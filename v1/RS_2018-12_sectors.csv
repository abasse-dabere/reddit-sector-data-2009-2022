personalfinance,Contribute to 401k or pay off student loans?,"Hey /r/personalfinance 

I’ve been researching this and have found conflicting answers, so I’m coming to you guys for advice.

I’m 32, but just recently started working in my career path the last couple of years, and finally am in a place where I can start saving meaningful amounts of money.

I owe ~$38k I’m student loan debt at varying interest rates (some subsidized loans, some unsubsidized) and just started contributing to my 401k the last few years (Its approximately at $33k right now)

I just got a new job, paid down my credit cards and have no other debts besides these student loans at this point, but my new employer doesn’t have any 401k match, so I’m wondering if it’s worth me not putting anything into my 401k for a few years to pay off my student loans in full. I can almost certainly have them completely paid off within 3 years if I put 10% of pre-tax income towards them each month.

I’m still trying to also put money aside to have ~3 months of living expenses in savings, but I’m not quite there yet.

personalfinance,Should I refinance my Student Loans?,"Hello, Reddit

I am 24 years old and I am working in the Public Service Sector. Therefore, I qualify for Student Loan forgiveness after 10 years of service. I love my job and don’t plan on changing my career. 

I am wondering if it would be a good/bad idea to refinance my student loans? I have $17,800 of Total Student Loans at a 4.01% interest rate. I am currently on an Income Based Repayment Plan and have no issues with the current monthly payments. 

However, since the current monthly payments are on the lower side, the $17,800 loan is set to be paid in a total of 20-25 years, but because of the Public Service Forgiveness, it will be forgiven in 10 years. 

I have heard horror stories of people not qualifying after the 10 years of public service and are stuck with a loan that is way higher than what was actually borrowed.

personalfinance,9 years of tax return mistakes - mortgage interest deduction,"a close relative got audited this year.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont know the exact details, but she made some kind of mistake on their mortgage interest deduction.

&amp;#x200B;

audit #1 happened earlier this year and they had to pay around $10k, including interest and penalties.  they didn't have an emergency fund, so the relative got a zero interest credit card and expects to be able to pay off the $10k before the zero interest period runs out.

&amp;#x200B;

audit letter #2 just arrived recently.  they're on the hook for the same mistake in a different year's tax return for $11k this time. it sounds like they won't have the cash or savings to pay for this one either.

&amp;#x200B;

she talked to a CPA acquaintance and was told that she basically f-ed up their tax returns for the past 9 years (that's when they bought the house).  the 2 audits were for recent year tax returns.  CPA advised her that she can file an amendment for the past 3 years and 2017 is the only year left for her to file an amendment.  basically, fix it before the IRS finds it and pray that they can get the penalties and/or interest waived for 2017.

&amp;#x200B;

she's scared out of her mind because she believes that they can be audited up to 10 years back and that leave 6 more years of bad returns that could come back to haunt them.

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize for the lack of details, but is there much hope of getting through this?  should be talking to a CPA?  an attorney?

&amp;#x200B;

A quick search on Zillow suggests that property values may have risen enough for them to sell the house, cover 9 years worth of penalties, and still walk away with a little bit of profit.  selling is an unpleasant option, but i think owing the IRS $90k+ is a worse option.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Have any legitimate projects actually discontinued development during this crash?,"Many project teams hold a stake in their own coin and sell it off as a means of paying their salaries. In these dramatic price drops, often over 95%, it seems more teams would throw up their arms and say their funds are dry and they need to go get real jobs. But I haven't heard of that happening to a single project.

I have seen coins plummet to prices so low that their market caps are now dwarfed by penny stocks, yet they all seem to be chugging along and making progress. So I guess that is encouraging in a way. Although it also seems clear that there is no real demand for most of these coins and utility tokens.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Important Notice From Navient,"&gt;Congratulations! You are one of the select few to receive an exclusive offer. Log in to your Navient inbox to see how you could save thousands on your student loans.

Anyone else getting repeated sketchy emails from Navient to refinance your student loans? Hint: the word refinance is never used.

Nevermind the fact they're amid several lawsuits for misleading borrowers about repayment plans, they've begun using scare tactics and appeal to exclusivity.

The last email made it sound like they had this super awesome offer to lower my loan. This email makes you login just to see the advert a la ""add to cart to see price.""

&gt;Now is when your hard work pays off
Introducing NaviRefi, a new student loan refinance solution that rewards you for your hard work. You’re one of the select few Navient customers to get this offer. Because of your good history, a NaviRefi loan could save you money each month.

&gt;^You ^may ^lose ^benefits ^associated ^with ^your ^underlying ^federal ^and/or ^private ^loans ^if ^you ^refinance, ^such ^as ^federal ^Income-Driven ^Repayment ^plans ^or ^deferment ^and ^forbearance ^options. ^If ^you ^file ^for ^bankruptcy, ^you ^may ^still ^be ^required ^to ^pay ^back ^this ^loan.

Navient is my federal loan servicer. I did not choose Navient, I signed an online form when I was 18 for the government to help fund my education. The government chose a company to facilitate my payments. I use said government's income based repayment plan to help pay off credit cards and get established in a career. Said company decides it's not making enough money off me and uses the email I'm required to use to service my federal loans to send unsolicited advertisements against said loans that Navient is privy to. I don't get to opt out of Navient, the only emails I should be getting from them is that they received my autopayment. Oddly enough the only way opt out is to... refinance.

But doing so is the worst personal finance decision I could make right now and Navient knows that. They know what my payments are and they know what they'll be without income based repayment. They also know how much more money they'll make off of me.

I bet Betsy would prefer all our debt is transferred to the private sector and out of the Treasury given she recently called student debt a crisis and is a opponent of the Navient lawsuits.

If I refinance to a private loan don't I give up any chance of student loan forgiveness? 

Is anyone else getting pestered by Navient or your loan servicer lately?",finance
personalfinance,Credit Card utilization,"Due to some unfortunate circumstances in the last few months I was forced to run the balance up on most of my cards. I’m paying them down now but I’ve already seen it effect my credit score. In paying them off, is it better to do it one at a time or lower them each by a smaller amount?

To get specific, I have 4 cards that are 70% utilization and above. I can either lower them each by 10% a month or more for the next few months, or pay one down by 30% this month and next month... then move to another and pay that down. The end goal is to get each down below 30% (and ultimately zero.) The interest rates are about the same.",finance
personalfinance,Budgeting and student loans. Young professional in my 20s that needs some advice,"I'm a college graduate with a engineering degree. I've been employed full time since February and am still building up my emergency fund. I wanted some opinions on how I am currently spending my money and how to best take care of my student loans. I'm a 23 male and still single. I currently live in a one room apartment. My parents own my car (paid off) and I just have to pay for routine maintenance/gas. I don't really have any plans to buy a house or a new car in the near future. I'm relatively satisfied with my current job at a manufacturing plant of a automotive supplier for all the big OEMs. As a supplier we can adapt a little easier to changing trends than the OEMs although GM closing some plants recently makes me nervous about the industry.

&amp;#x200B;

**Expenses**

My monthly income is $3012. This is my take home income after my health insurance and 401k are subtracted. I contribute 5% with company match of 4.5%. I started contributing to 401k in October. These are my estimated monthly expenses and probably a little bit overestimated. Expenses that are italics are solid and consistent month to month.

|*rent*|828|
|:-|:-|
|utilities|75|
|groceries|270|
|fast food|30|
|gas for car|90|
|*phone bill*|75|
|*loan*|1002|
|*car insurance*|100|
|*PC fund*|100|
|*savings*|100|
|other|100|
|Leftover|240|

Any left over money is dumped into my savings account or stays in my checking account. For the month of November I spent $274 on groceries, $38 on fast food and $72 on gas. I also did some maintenance on my car (filters, oil change) this month in addition to buying a $300 futon for my apartment. The futon is now my main piece of furniture and a major upgrade from the one beat up dorm chair I had from college. I try to always pack my lunch and not eat too much fast food. Phone bill is $75 because I recently upgraded my Iphone after having the same one since 2013. I plan on having this one for as long as I can until it starts freezing/battery issues. As a single male a portion of the other category is used on acne medicine, candles, cleaning supplies to keep myself and my apartment in shape in case a girl wants to come over / to make a effort to try to meet a girl.

I also have some irregular expenses for when my friends from college all get together and we do something fun (skiing, rock climbing, just hanging out). We only get together maybe every 4 months or so and my budget has been able to handle it so far. Maybe costs me $50 to $120 each time I see them depending on the activity. These get togethers are one of my favorite things and keep me sane.

**Student Loans**

I have  federal student loans and private student loans. My federal loans total $25,600 with a average interest rate of 4.14%. My current payment is $285/month in level repayment and projected payoff in 2027. I also have a private loan totaling $56,000 with a average interest rate of 7.09%. This is the loan that makes me nervous. I pay $717/month. This loan has a projected payoff of 2027. I have a detailed spreadsheet with all the interest rates, principals and have the forecasted monthly balance for each month until 2027.

&amp;#x200B;

**Accounts**

&amp;#x200B;

|Checking|4700|
|:-|:-|
|Savings|3300|
|Express|10|

&amp;#x200B;

I pay my bills (rent, loans, ext.) out of my checking account. Savings account is for emergency fund, insurance( paid every 6 months) and PC fund. I'm slowly saving up to build a PC. The express card is for business travel, I typically get a cash advance and then put that on this card. The card acts as a debit card but can't be overdrawn (mostly have it to shield checking account from fraud).

&amp;#x200B;

So I'd just like some opinions on if I'm spending my money in a smart way. I'm currently throwing money into my savings account (I transferred a extra $300 last month) but would like to start paying extra each month towards my student loans. I've gotten my checking account to the point that it bottoms out during the month at above $4000. This can act as a cushion while I put extra money each month towards my loans. I'm not sure how smart it is to build a PC for around $1700-$2000 in the near future (possibly February 2019). My laptop from college is getting older (2013 Mac) and I use it constantly when I'm home to watch movies, reddit, 3d printing, 3d modeling, computer programming and other hobbies.

Should I just keep this budget for now and try to stay the course for the next few years? The loans worry me the most but this is my only debt (no credit card bill).",finance

My husband has $150,000 in student loans from medical school with interest rates at 5-7%. We are doing income-based repayment and owe $150/month, but pay as much as we can ($500-$1000 per month). We have a mortgage ($100,000 at 4% interest) and no other debt. 

We have investments from before he went to medical school (they were set up by grandparents many years ago and  we are incredibly grateful, but we honestly don't know much about them) - $25,000 in stocks and $40,000 in mutual funds. I max out a Roth IRA every year but my husband doesn't have any retirement accounts yet (aside from his current job but we just found out his employer won't be matching his contributions due to the length of his residency). 

After residency his gross annual salary will be around $200-250K (according to our state's averages) and our plan is to maintain our current living expenses and pay back his loans ASAP.

1. Should we compare the personal rate of return on our investments to his interest rates to determine if we would be better off putting this money toward his student loans? If so, over what time period? For example, the mutual funds earned -2% in 2015, 9% in 2016, 10% in 2017, and 5% in 2018 to date. Or is this not a valid comparison?

2. Should we sell the stocks and/or mutual funds and put that money toward the student loans? Or do something else with it, like starting a Roth IRA for my husband? Or just let it be?",finance

# **Fed concerns aren't over for the market yet   - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/30/fed-concerns-arent-over-for-the-market-yet.html)**
*****
&gt; Trade relations between China and the U.S. overshadow most everything as stocks enter the month of December, but in the week ahead the Fed and U.S. economy come back into play with important Fed testimony and the November employment report.
*****
&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, whokicked off a powerful rally with his comments Wednesday, appears before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress this coming Wednesday to speak on the economy. Powell said the Fed was close to the neutral rate, the level on the benchmark fed funds rate that is neither stimulative nor slowing for the economy.
*****
&gt; That comment sparked a rally of more than 600 points in the Dow and, in the market's view, reversed a previous comment from Powell that neutral was far off, meaning the Fed would have to keep hiking interest rates aggressively. The market is now pricing in one hike for December and just one for all of 2019.
*****
&gt; ""I think the markets may have overemphasized the dovishness of what he's trying to say,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West. ""I think [the Fed] is trying to wean the markets off of forward guidance. …They want to give themselves a little flexibility."" Anderson said there's risk the first half of 2019 could be weaker, and he does expect the economy to slow just below 2 percent in the second half, in part due to trade wars.
*****
&gt; He said Powell's comment makes the Fed's interest rate forecast all the more important when it is released after the next meeting on Dec. 19. The Fed currently has forecast three interest rate hikes for next year, but the market is concerned the economy will not support that many. Powell's comments before Congress in the week ahead are also important, given the fact he was criticized by President Donald Trump for raising interest rates.
*****
&gt; ""It's kind of dicey politically, I think, and the fact his statement just a month ago was interpreted so hawkishly,"" said Anderson. Economists expect Powell to state that the Fed is independent and point to the fact that it is dependent on data for rate guidance.
*****
&gt; Although the stock market rallied on Powell's statement and bond yields fell, some economists believe the markets misinterpreted the Fed's message. Both J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs economistsexpect four rate hikes next year.
*****
&gt; The emphasis in the week ahead will also be on any U.S. data that can help steer the Fed. Most important is Friday's employment report, but there are also vehicle sales and ISM manufacturing data Monday.
*****
&gt; Economists expect 200,000 jobs were created in November, and wages grew at a pace of 3.1 percent year over year. Vehicle sales will also be important, especially after GM's announced layoffs, and economists are expecting to see sales on an annualized basis at 17.2 million, down from the 17.6 million reported in October.
*****
&gt; OPEC meets Thursday, and analysts expect Saudi Arabia and Russia to steer the group to a production cut, with Saudi Arabia bearing most of it. Oil prices fell more than 20 percent in November, their worst month since October 2008.
*****
&gt; ""Our base scenario is you might get some sort of actual but gradual and not really telegraphed 1 million barrels a day cut,"" said Citigroup energy analyst Eric Lee.
*****
&gt; West Texas Intermediate crude futures lost 22 percent in November and closed down 1 percent Friday at $50.93 per barrel.
*****
&gt; Stocks staged a stunning turnaround in the past week, erasing losses for an otherwise rough month of November. The S&amp;P 500 was up 4.8 percent to 2,760 for the week and is now just a point below the key 200-day moving average. The S&amp;P was up 1.8 percent for the month of November.
*****
&gt; Stocks rallied on Powell but also on optimism for a trade truce between the U.S. and China when Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were to meet Saturday.
*****
&gt; ""Is the market pricing in a cease-fire?"" asked Scott Redler, partner with T3Live.com. He said the market could have gotten ahead of itself, depending on the outcome of the trade meeting between Trump and Xi. ""We just had our biggest weekly move since 2011. Is that taking away from the actual event? I think the market has priced in about 75 percent of a cease-fire.""
*****
&gt; Redler said the next area of resistance is around 2,810, if stocks continue to gain after the weekend meeting.
*****
&gt; Stock traders may also be watching the bond market,after the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.99, just below the 3 percent level. The yield, which moves opposite price, moved closer to the yield of the 2-year, in a flattening move. With the 2-year at 2.78, the difference was just 21 basis points.
*****
&gt; Traders believe that occurs when the market is warning about the strength of the economy. If the yield inverts and the 10-year drops below the 2-year, it is a fairly reliable recession warning.

# December Almanac: Top Performing S&amp;P 500 Month

&gt; December is the number one S&amp;P 500 month and the second best month on the Dow Jones Industrials since 1950, averaging gains of 1.6% and 1.7% respectively. It’s also the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and second best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000. Rarely does the market fall precipitously in December. When it does it is usually a turning point in the market—near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback.

&gt; Trading in December is holiday inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins. Regardless, December is laden with market seasonality and important events.

&gt; Small caps tend to start to outperform larger caps near the middle of the month (early January Effect) and our “Free Lunch” strategy is served from the offerings of stocks making new 52-week lows on Triple-Witching Friday. An Almanac Investor Alert will be sent prior to the open on December 24 containing “Free Lunch” stock selections. The “Santa Claus Rally” begins on the open on Christmas Eve day and lasts until the second trading day of 2019. Average S&amp;P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%.

&gt; This is the first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down. The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch’s now famous line states, “If Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/82ecde69f447212f732a7528f7a0309c/tumblr_inline_pj125hmdWi1spdppr_400.jpg))**

&gt; In the last seventeen midterm years, December’s rankings slip modestly to #3 S&amp;P 500 (1.8%) and DJIA (1.5%) and #5 NASDAQ (0.6% since 1974). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, also perform well in midterm Decembers. Since 1982, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just twice in nine midterm years in December. The average small cap gain in all nine years is 0.7%. In 2010, Russell 2000 gained 7.8% in December.

# Time for Santa?

&gt; 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. “Although the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can’t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!

&gt; Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That’s right—since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.

# LEI-ding the Way to No Recession

&gt; The Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI) is one of our favorite economic indicators. It is designed to predict future movements in the economy based on a composite of 10 economic indicators (like manufacturers’ new orders, stock prices, and weekly unemployment claims) whose changes tend to precede shifts in the overall economy. Last week, the LEI painted a continued strong backdrop for future economic growth, as it rose slightly above the previous month and 5.9% year over year (YoY).

&gt; Looking under the hood, the LEI has risen or been flat for 29 consecutive months, the longest streak in more than 30 years. While the yield curve, peak earnings, Federal Reserve (Fed) worries, and trade issues with China have been getting all the attention recently, all recessions going back to the early 1970s first saw the LEI turn negative YoY; and because of its solid track record of predicting recessions, the LEI is a component of LPL Research’s Five Forecasters.

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the LEI is nowhere near turning negative.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/powerful-sign-the-economy-is-on-firm-footing.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “The fact that the LEI has been very successful at forecasting recessions, and is one of the few forward-looking economic indicators, make it one of our favorites. The continued strong data suggest a recession is nowhere in sight and signal solid underlying fundamentals in the U.S. economy,” said Ryan Detrick, LPL senior market strategist.

&gt; Last, examining all seven recessions going back to early 1970 shows some interesting developments. It turns out the LEI turned negative year over year on average eight months (with a median of six months) before a recession officially occurred. That is what we call a nice track record. Again, with the LEI up 5.8% year over year, we believe we are a long way from this economic indicator flashing any major recession warning.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week ahead? Have a great week to everyone in here on this new week ahead!

*****

Have a fantastic week ahead r/stocks!",finance
gaming,Lords of the Fallen is a great game,"Here's a mini semi-biased review of Lords of the Fallen, made by Deck13 who later went to make The Surge which is a superior game to LotF and has more expansions (LotF has 1).

First things first, the game is gorgeous. The attention to detail is astounding, the effects are awesome. It's what I would say is a more colourful Dark Souls but it nails the medieval-fantasy version of a Space Marine. 

The combat is slower than Dark Souls, unless you pick the light class (don't know why you would want to, the medium class has a giant hammer and the heavy is an immovable object). The game shines when you're swinging a giant hammer and it smashes full-force into the face of an enemy that I find endlessly frustrating. To summarise the combat, slow yet satisfying.

One criticism is that there's a distinct lack of classes and therefore playstyles. You can choose one of three at the start, light, medium or heavy. I chose the heavy because I enjoy wielding big weapons.

This game has a mechanic which isn't in Dark Souls and I think really makes every encounter that little bit more tense. Banking XP to level up. Now you might be thinking, ""but wait, you can do that in Dark Souls!"" let me explain. At the point I'm at in the game, I don't see shops so your only resource is XP. You can bank the XP to level up or you can hoard it. But why would you hoard the XP? Because the game gives rarer weapons and items the more XP you're holding on to. I liked this mechanic up until I died trying to get back to my corpse and now I have to get the XP back again.

This brings me to my next criticism, the number of items. Dark Souls drowns you in items, a lot of which you'll probably never use, it also uses the items for world building. More items means you learn more about the world. You do learn about the world in LotF but you're basically dripfed lore. For some people, this might make you curious and intrigued to discover this interesting world. I, on the other hand, just want to wield big weapons.

I'm on my second play through after having given up on my first one because I took a long break and no longer felt connected to the story. This time, I'm having a more interesting time exploring the labrythine map (an aspect which was brought into the Surge). Compared to the Surge, LotF has a smaller map, less areas to explore and not much variety on the enemies that I've fought. At one point, I was fighting a massive spider thing that did a ton of damage but aside from that, I was killing mainly Rhogar (imagine ""Darkspawn?"" from Dragon Age).

I haven't tried the expansion yet but I'm looking forward to it. 

I encourage you all to give Lords of the Fallen a shot. You can pick it up (plus the expansion) for peanuts on sale. I also hope you try out the Surge, it is superior in almost every way except aesthetically.

I know Deck13 are working on the Surge 2 at the moment, I hope they make Lords of the Fallen 2 after the lessons what they've learned from making the Surge games.

TL:DR iz gud.",technology
personalfinance,Keep or Surrender Whole Life Policy?,"I've had a whole life policy for over 30 years now. It was started by my parents when I was an infant, and I took over paying the premiums about 5 years ago.


The death benefit is $125k and current surrender is right at $4k. My premiums are $125/quarter. I think the guaranteed interest rate is 4.5%, but I honestly don't even really look at that since I don't really think about the money as any type of investment (Because it's not...).


I'm 35, married with 0 kids right now and do have a term policy for $1.5 million, and my wife has a term for $1 million.


My question is - should I just keep this thing at this point? Dump it and increase my term policy? I'm aware that whole life is pretty much a crap product, but just want to know my best options going forward.",finance
personalfinance,Please evaluate my long term credit card goals,"Hi everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, I would like to thank all redditors in this sub. I learned A LOT. However, wallets are very idiosyncratic.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like some opinions on my long term strategy for credit cards. Let me share some background info:

1) Income: around 45,000 annually; 

2) I'm a PhD student, first year. My income will stay like this for around 5 years. After 5 years, hopefully I will become an assistant professor. That means two things: First: around 5 to 7 travels per year (conferences + visit parents in my home country). Even as a PhD student I will be traveling to conferences and I can use my cards and get reimbursed. Second: after becoming a professor, my income will jump to mid 100k.

3) almost no credit history, no loan, etc. I'm not a US Citizen. However, I've been in the US before and I have a checking account with chase.

&amp;#x200B;

My goals are:

1) Chase trifecta (rewards are awesome when combined);

2) AMEX Platinum (status, centurion, delta lounge, gold status (hilton, marriott), etc.

3) 800+ FICO Score. If I ever become an assistant professor, I will be on a tenure-track, immigrate, etc. Thus, a very high score to get low interest rate on a mortgage is crucial!

4) Get store cards to be able to do 0% financing. e.g., Wayfair, BestBuy, etc. I know these cards suck if you don't pay in full (deferred interest), but that's not my intention. I want to be able to purchase lots of furniture and electronics and finance it not to hurt my pocket when I exit the PhD program and become an assistant professor. That is, I would like to be able to get my house ready with a huge TV, PS5, PSVR2, nintendo switch, etc. (yes, I'm materialist, but of course I will not be a dumbass and spend stuff I will not be able to afford)

&amp;#x200B;

My situation now:

I have a Chase Freedom Unlimited ($2000 limit), a Discover It Student ($500 limit), and a CapitalOne Secured ($200 limit). 

&amp;#x200B;

As soon as I got my SSN, I strategically applied to several cards. I did an application spree and got these three cards. Now, since I have on average 10 inquiries per credit bureau, I will wait 25 months until they disappear from my reports. During the next 25 months I will pay 100% on time and maintain my utilization low, asking for credit limits from 6 to 6 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Then, after my inquiries disappear, I intend to get the Chase Freedom card. That would make me able to build a stronger relationship with chase. After this, I intend to apply to a starter american express card (a no annual fee such as amex blue preferred). After this, what should I do, considering my goals? Get no annual fee cards to maximize rewards (e.g., uber visa, amazon rewards, etc.) and take advantage of sign up bonuses until I get enough history to get CSR and Amex Platinum?

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions?

As an aside, I have other non credit card goals too. Roth IRA and emergency savings (6 months+).

personalfinance,Make a budget (spend less) then optimize your spending (earn more),"Hey PF,

So I thought I would share some helpful ways to save money and ways to optimize your spending.

The first way (and the best way) to save money is by lowering your expenses by developing a budget.  You might be surprised to see how much you are paying for some expenses. Some popular websites include YNAB, Mint, and Personal Capital. I personally just use Mint, I just like the format and I find it easy to track my day to day expenses as well as any debt you have. As far as some advice if paid bi-weekly I would recommend budgeting based upon 2 pay periods per month rather than taking your bi-weekly paycheck \* 26 (pay periods per year) / 12 to come up with your monthly income. If you budget based upon 2 pay periods instead of your monthly income, you will be able to treat your 2 extra paydays a year as a ""bonus"" (when you have 3 pay periods in one month). Take a look to see what expenses seem higher than you thought, see if there are ways to reduce them.

Build an emergency fund, first aim for 1,000 initially and then after paying off the debt you can look to build up the EF up more (3-6 months expenses). This [flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png) does show you the steps to help you reach your goals.

With all the excess, unallocated money, you should start to pay down your non-mortgage debt. The ""best"" way to pay the least amount of debt is by paying off your debt with your highest interest rate and working your way down to the lowest.  If you are someone who needs to see the immediate improvement and see debts getting paid off, then paying the debts from the lowest balance to the highest might be the best route for you. This might not be the best way to save the most money, but you can more easily knock off lower debts and you can use that as motivation to continue paying off the debt.

&amp;#x200B;

Additional ways to earn more money (money in the bank or through spending)

&amp;#x200B;

Take a look at where you bank. Are you banking at a nationwide company or are you banking with a local bank/Credit union? Are you paying fees based upon your balance? Are you paying fees if you take your money out of an ATM that is not your bank?  You should look to see how much you are being charged to keep your money in the bank also you should look to how much interest you are earning on your money. There are a lot of banks and credit unions other there that don't charge fees or give you interest rates up to 3%+ (make sure to read the fine print). I open look over [Deposit Accounts](https://www.depositaccounts.com/checking/reward-checking-accounts.html) every once in a while to see if there are any changes or higher rates out there. I bank at Lake Michigan Credit Union and earn 3% on balances up to 15K, which comes out to $450 per year in interest. I also get $10 refunded for ATM fees (if I do not use the ATM at the bank). I house a good portion of my ""emergency fund"" within the checking account. Itself. You can also use the same website for the best rates for [Savings Accounts](https://www.depositaccounts.com/savings/) (make sure to review the terms of the savings account for limits for deposits and withdrawals) or even [CD Accounts](https://www.depositaccounts.com/cd/) (just set the term and possible penalties). Don't just ""settle"" for a big bank, explore your options.

Once you have stopped paying interest and started earning interest from your money in the bank, the next way you can earn money is through credit cards (Make sure to pay the debt off in full every month, the 2%-6% you might earn is not worth paying interest of 25%). You can either focus on Cash Back or Travel Points, personally, I just like to look at the cash back, as I like to just like to redeem my points for cash instead of travel. [This website](https://www.magnifymoney.com/blog/earning-cashback/best-cash-back-credit-cards-for-every-category222723218/) is a great resource that breaks down the best cards for each category. From your budget, you can see the areas where you spend the most money and work your way down the list to the smallest category. The Citi Double cash card is an easy way to get 2% cash back on everything, most cards get you 1% back, so it is the best ""everything"" card, but you can get cards for 6% on groceries, 5% on Gas, 5% on Amazon or Target, or 4% on eating out. You have to determine if it is ""worth"" you to get another credit card to pay for the specific category.

I have the American Express Blue Cash Prefered (6% groceries, 3% Department Stores, 3% Gas) Uber Credit Card (4% eating out, 3% on Airfare and Hotel, $50 Statement credit on streaming services if you spend enough, $600 cell phone coverage if you pay the phone bill through the credit card, Discover IT 5% revolving categories, Amazon Prime Credit Card 5% Amazon, Citi Double Cash 2% everything). I could continue to go deeper with the credit cards, but the additional gains were minimal.

These are the ways that you can have your money in your bank do work for you and how you can earn additional cash back on your day to day spending.

If you are trying to save money on a mortgage, make sure you shop around.  Don't just default to using your current bank that you have. I would suggest looking for a [local broker shop](https://findamortgagebroker.com/homeowner-homebuyer) to find the best rate and price, this also helps support local business. They have the ability to shop across multiple different lenders to find a solution to your current needs compared to being stuck with what the bank gives you. ALSO more times then not, you will get a better rate with your current bank IF you go through a broker shop (for example if you bank at Chase, you will get a better rate if the broker goes through Chase then going directly through chase). Now there are exceptions to the rule, especially if you are a private client, you very likely might get a better rate but you should still shop around. Also just as far as mortgage credit pulls within 14 days count as 1 inquiry.

Loyalty might help with mortgages (if you have a lot of assets with the institution), but the same does not apply to Insurance. Again you should look at your current coverage and shop around every 3-5 years. You might see the rates slowly creep up. Which is why it is important to shop around. I don't have a great source for Insurance, the only one I found is [this one](https://www.trustedchoice.com/about-us/carriers/), but it doesn't necessarily get everyone one in your area. I might rely on google maps to find a local one. Try to avoid going to insurance companies that do a bunch of commercials, as you are paying for their advertising

personalfinance,Got scammed and need advice if there's anything I can do. Help!,"I'm here with a friend of mine who just today got scammed. We aren't sure what, if anything, we can do. Any advice is appreciated. Sorry if this isn't the right place for this.

Here are the details:

I was wondering what this 800-772-1213 was that kept calling, so I Googled and saw that it was the Social Security Dept. ""This will take 2 minutes"" so I called and was greeted by Jake Tyler. Employee ID: 02840175. (He had an accent. I think Indian? I thought it weird that his name was Jake, but my Indian roommate Deepak tells people his name is Dave whenever he goes to a restaurant, so... somehow I kept going with it.)

He gave me a case number and a lot of other information. I was taking notes with a pen and paper. I was informed that my SSN was linked to money laundering and drug trafficking in El Paso, TX. (I’m from Las Vegas, NV. Never been to Texas.) I was given two addresses there and asked if I had any affiliation or knowledge of these places.

The call ended up going on for hours. They asked to verify the last four digits of my social and what different accounts I had open. I answered a bunch of questions and was asked if I was answering to the best of my knowledge. I was told the call was recorded. Different specific federal offices had access to it... they thought I was suspicious.

Essentially they were telling me I was trying to process an Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) rather than seeing a criminal lawyer and going to Texas to settle things in person. They said the ADR entailed moving money to a digital account so that everything associated with my social. I don't even know why... but I put money into a Bitcoin machine... basically all of my money, and now other people have it.

The one weird thing that I don’t understand is that I was asked for the make/model/license plate # for my car, as well as the class for my license (which I gave them). I don’t know what the end game was there … should I be worried that they have any of that info?

After the first half hour or so, I thought something was not making sense, but felt like if it was true, I didn’t have a choice.

I called 311 to try to get police help and to file a police report, but they told me they don’t handle this sort of thing, and I should call the FTC to file a complaint instead. Is that true? Should I really not file a police report? The FTC is closed on the weekends, so I can’t do anything with them right now. I feel like I should be doing something today, ASAP. What should I be doing? Is there anything I can do?",finance

personalfinance,Changing Banks as a 19 Y/O,"(FIRST WORLD PROBLEMS COMING IN) Hey Reddit! Excuse me if I seem ignorant to an extent but I am fed up with the bank I currently have. Basically I am a college student that lives at home and everyone inside of my home has Chase. Now Chase used to be perfect to me. Except for the past month. 

Backstory: I went to a concert a week ago and I lost my debit card while being there. No big deal I said, I'll just order a new one. Oh 1--3 days? Perfect! Gives me enough suffering to justify it. Right?

Hell no. It's been a week and I never received my card. It wouldn't be an issue if I didn't have things I needed to purchase. So while attempting to purchase things, I attempted to use Zelle with my friend so I didn't make him pay out of pocket for all of these things. Seems reasonable right? Nope. Basically needed further verification and I waited about an hour, nothing. Attempted to send my sister the money because we both have the same bank, but the things I needed to buy were ""In-Store Only"" so I got it back.

Finally, got the verification text from Chase. Mind you, I only asked for it once. Chase attempted to charge me three more times after I sent the money to my friend. Trying to figure out what I can do about it, suspended my entire account. Don't know if anything happened or not. Tried calling, gave all my information. not two, not three, but four types of I.D., and guess what happened. Nothing.

And over the past month besides this shit show over the past week, a lot of direct deposits went on hold. I just wanted to know how it'd be possible for me to change banks. I'm a relatively broke college student, and not knowing what's going on with my money isn't something I want to worry about especially during both final and holiday seasons",finance

(My first check is next week!) I was hoping you guys could give me some advice on how to wisely use my much larger income to help me tackle my student loan and credit card debt. My plan was to just throw as much money as possible at my credit cards right out of the gate. 

I’ve been banking with BoA since my dad helped me open the account when I was 16. I have a BankAmeriCard Visa Platinum Plus at %22.99 APR. The credit limit is $2500 and I currently have a balance of $1420. 

I also have a Discover Card at %19.99 APR with a $4300 limit. It has a balance of about $2500. (In between my last job and this new one, I had to pay for most of my expenses on this card. Most of this balance is from the last month. It was floating at under $1k before). 

I also have federal student loans.. I currently pay $112/month on. The current balance is $32,650.  The loans are split into groups that receive different interest rates. The largest group is $13.2k at 6.55%. It’s also the highest interest rate. I don’t know if I’m allowed to pay that specific loan first since I pay through Nelnet and it does it automatically spread between all of them. 

I don’t finance a car or have any other debt. I rent a 1/br apartment and my monthly costs including what I typically pay back to my debt is around $1000. 

Both of my parents know nothing about finances and so I’ve always sort of been winging it. I really hope you guys can help me figure out what steps I need to be taking. If there’s any additional information you need to help me I’m happy to provide it.

personalfinance,Credit union getting crappier each year- stay or go?,"So I've got two credit unions.  One of them I opened four years ago because I moved overseas for a job and I could access them very easily.  I still use this as my main place for banking.

My other credit union was my go-to until I went overseas.  Since coming back, they seem to get crappier each year.  I've been with them for about 10 years, they're closer to the house than the other credit union, and I feel the employees seem to actually care about the members.

Since coming back from overseas, I use this CU as my emergency fund.  I've got about 22k in it (checking/saving/moneymarket), and very little is ever deposited or withdrawn.  I kind of have it for when the house and car spontaneously vanish in a black hole and I need it.  Earlier this year (March/April) the interest rates on their savings products tanked.  Savings went from .25 to .05, money market from .4 to .15.  Now, I don't have the money there to make tons on interest (I know I should invest, and that's on my agenda over the next 3-4 months).  Meanwhile, interest rates on their loan products went up.  Now they're making more money, but I'm not seeing any of it (aside from the horrible renovation they did at my local branch which made the flow inside just a clusterfk).

My monthly payments are around $200 which are the minimum I can pay with my and my wife’s income. We don’t have the income to pay more than that monthly. Current loans are around $35k total. I haven’t made a dent in it paying the minimum since getting out of school in 2016.

A couple years ago, my mom passed away and left me a fairly sizable amount of money in stocks. After putting a decent down payment on our house and purchasing a new (needed) car, we still have enough to pay off my student loans in full and still have around $30k remaining. 

Do I pay off the student loan debt in full? The interest rates for all of the loans is around 7%. Granted, I’m probably making more than 7% with my current investments, but I can’t stand having this outstanding debt and we’re not really able to save much, if any, due to this being one of our larger monthly bills.

CryptoCurrency,Crypto Currency is not Winner-take-all,"I was just giving more thought to the debate on which crypto currency is going to be ""adopted"" the other day and the idea that we’ll have one dominant currency that will be used to transact.  Since I joined crypto, my thoughts on this, and the community as a whole, seemingly, have shifted and morphed multiple times.

My opinion, however, is that we’ll continue to have a number of mainstream cryptocurrencies that will remain popular and highly used.  I used to think otherwise, then before that I thought something similar around the time when Bitcoin was thought to be “digital gold”.

Now the reason for this line of thinking is actually simple.  I believe people will value the attributes of various currencies (like today, just continuing past widespread adoption).  And, it revolves around communities, school of thought, trust, and the decentralized design you believe in and thereby choose to hold your wealth.  I no longer see a winner take all scenario.  I don’t think this is necessary either (not to mention healthy for the ecosystem).  I believe we’ll have more wallets that support all the leading currencies, gateways and POS that do the same, with currency conversion offered on the fly if desired.

It’s like PayPal, you can send someone EUR but they can request to receive that as USD.  I see the same for personal crypto wallets, POS systems, etc.  The ecosystem isn’t quite there yet, but we'll get there.

People may choose to convert their payments, received in various currencies, to BTC because it’s the most well known, is the least volatile or because it’s their favorite and where they put their trust.  Or, maybe they choose Nano because they have more faith in DPoS as a long term viable alternative to POW and it's eco-friendly design, or Monero because they value the highest level of privacy.  Whichever coin is chosen, it's whatever you value and desire.

So, what I’m saying here is that I don’t see a winner-take-all scenario playing out at all.  It won’t be necessary or desired since people will have their currency of trust and choice.

Think about it this way.  Assume you could use any fiat in the world almost anywhere you go.  All the major country's fiat currencies are supported, you have a choice.  Now, which one will you keep your savings in?  Which one will you keep in your daily spend wallet?  How many currencies will you hold?  And why?  Is it because you trust that government more?  Or you like their monetary policy more?  Is it because their federal reserve doesn’t print as much money, or because you think the demand for their currency will increase more over time?

I see crypto currencies as being much more than a protocol and open sourced nodes/wallets that live on github for you to download.  These aren’t one and done projects or currencies where we’ll get one that’s perfect and stable and then it’s game over.  On the contrary, these are communities, each with their own school of thought, direction and opinions about what makes the most appealing, fair and distributed currency, not much different from a government and their federal reserve.

By holding a currency of choice, you’re choosing to do so because you like the direction of that coin/community for whatever reason.  I think this is great and healthy, it allows us to continue to learn and innovate, provides options and allows for us to hold a currency that’s the best vehicle for our needs.",cryptocurrency

investing,Strong US Dollar Reversal Investments,"At some point, just like everything else the strong US dollar will reverse trend so I wanted to start a discussion to see how that might happen, what kind of factors could trigger it and try to identify investments that have solid fundamentals but been beaten down by a strong dollar and would stand to gain if the dollar became more neutral. Let me preface this with, I'm not generally the kind to keep track of this sort of thing without reading a news article on it first but since the new CNBC app came out I did a little exploring and found a couple of things in the process that I wasn't expecting (also I have zero ties to CNBC). If you hit the market tab and then drop down to Currencies you'll see what I'm talking about where just about every currency ratio favors the US$ and it seems like the trend has been like that for a little while. I'm guessing a lot of that has to do with the other drop down that I started following, Bonds. I was mainly curious about kind of keeping tabs on the change in the amount of distance between the US 10yr &amp; 2yr to monitor if they became equal or inverted but I noticed that CNBC had a lot of other countries listed that I've never even tried to find data on. Most of the developed economies look like they are using very low or even negative interest rates in comparison to the US economy. Like I was saying before, I wanted to get the group's opinion on what kind of assets would have been suppressed by these two functions and might rebound nicely if the trend were to normalize. The first thing that came to mind was something like a Mexican Bank that has solid fundamentals, would not warrant a beat down and would rise if it's currency appreciated (Banco Santander, BSMX). I'm definitely sure there are better countries to target or maybe even better industries that might see greater appreciation from a currency shift so I thought I'd bring it up for discussion in here.

I know nothing about investing, life insurance, etc., and am having a hard time making financially sound decisions on how to curb/remove debt.

Literally this morning I met with a consultant who helped set up our life insurance/retirement fund a couple of years ago. She brought up a new program in the BOLI market that could potentially help us expedite the process of wiping out our debts. Essentially, we need to budget and put in $1k into the BOLI each month to stimulate the compounding interest rate growth (4% currently) to be able to fast track into financial freedom. 

With that being said, I know nothing about this program and need to figure out if this is the right fit for our family. We estimate that we would be able to pay off our home in about 10 to 15 years, as opposed to our 30 year fixed VA home loan, as well as wiping out all of the debts mentioned above prior to paying off the home. 

The program sounds too good to be true -- so what's the catch?? Any advice, or even a much more comprehensive (ELI5 format because I'm dumb) explanation of the program would be so greatly appreciated!! Thank you!",finance

I have a Fedex account and used that to get a pretty good deal. I remember the cashier saying what a good account I had at the time. Total bill with the box was like $40 or so. Receipt is long gone- the package arrived with no issues. I can't seem to find the charge on any of my credit cards (even the one the FedEx account is tied to) - I sort of recall they would not let me use my account to buy the box or something.

In October I get a bill for $144 for this shipment. There is no way I would have paid or agreed to that- this was not an emergency and I would have chosen ground shipping if that was the quoted overnight price and certainly did not sign off on that.  I am guessing it was a pricing error by the clerk but even that seems like a crazy price.

I noticed that on the new October invoice my name says ""SEATTLE"" and the account number is blank.  It was sent to my correct home address- my name does not appear anywhere on the bill, but my mother's info all does on the recipient side.

personalfinance,Compound interest help,"Hi! 
I want to start by saying I already googled and looked at videos about this but I am still confused. 

I have a Marcus savings account with 2% annual interest rate paid monthly. From my understanding if I have $100 in it, I should get $2 monthly. Yet I am only gaining about 13 cents per every 100 dollars I have. 

I do understand that the following month the interest would be calculated from the original $100 plus the interest of the previous month. It is not a linear equation but rather an exponential one.

Can someone explain me the math to understand how this works?
Also, if I want $100 a month? About how much do I need to deposit. 

Thank you for your help! I know I learned this at school but I’m just so confused, not sure where I’m wrong. 
BTW this numbers are not exact",finance
personalfinance,Recent grad loans are coming due: budget planning,"Hi r/Personalfinance!

I am a long-time lurker and first-time poster to this sub with an alt because you never can be too careful! Like the title says I just graduate from college this summer and my loan repayments are due this month (merry Christmas to me!) and I would love some help planning and budgeting and maybe a few tips that helped you get out of debt along the way.

The Facts: I went to a private school for college (I know a bit dumb) and decided to put myself 100k in debt for a 4-year degree. The good news is a picked a career that allowed me to have a job lined up right after college that has full benefits and I make decent money for a kid right out of college. As I enter loan repayment, I want to make sure I am not forgetting anything so I am asking all for you for help so I can pay off my loans as quick as possible. I am going to break this down in sections as I find this the easiest way for me to analyze the information.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Numbers**: I have multiple loans at different interest rates a few loans worth about 65% of my total debt with a 6.5% interest rate collectively. I have another loan with about 35% of my debt at a 3.7% interest rate.  I make about $4,200 dollars a month gross, and about $3,250 a month after taxes (damn taxes and I live in a state that wastes money like no other…anyway). I also have saved about $10,000 in savings as a rainy-day fund that I would like not to touch unless I absolutely need to as well as about 3500 in my checking account. I also have about $1,200 in a Schwab 401k plan that I need to rollover from a previous employer.

&amp;#x200B;

**The expenses**: I currently live in an apartment with my girlfriend and the rent is about 1400 a month this includes utilities and our car spot. We split this so I pay $700 a month. My loans together are about $1,050 a month. My dad has offered to pay half of it -120 as he still pays for my car insurance/ phone because of our family rate (I am extremely lucky with such helpful parents, I know). He has offered to help for as long as it is feasible for him as he is in sales and can be very dependent on cycles/the economic market. My food expenses are relatively low as we meal prep every week for lunches at work and rarely eat out at night or the weekends the only time we do are when we are traveling to her folks which is about a 4-hour drive or our date night which is about once every 2-3 weeks. We don’t have cable as we use Hulu/Netflix for a combined bill of 20 a month and my travel expenses for gas are about 175-220 a month.

&amp;#x200B;

**Foreseen future expenses**:  Big things do come up in life and planning for them will hopefully put you in a better place to handle them. I currently drive my first car from high school a 2000 ford with about 120k miles on it. I can probably safely assume that I will need to get a new car in the next 3-5 years just based on mileage and type of car. I also am getting a dog in the next 1-2 months as my girlfriend is dog crazy…  so, I will have to pay the upfront fees for the shots and spaying as well as the monthly costs of food and regular upkeep. I can’t really think of any other big expenses looming but there most certainly will be because life fucks everyone somehow.

&amp;#x200B;

**Current Focuses**: My current focuses are to get my CPA license as it dramatically increases my career trajectory in my field, I am also currently planning on paying the full loan amount + my dads help of 405 (1050/2= 525-120 = 405) a month for the time being so I can aggressively pay of my loans.  Plus, the usual looking for bonuses/ promotions at work because increasing my gross salary will obviously open up more opportunities to stretch my dollar even further.

&amp;#x200B;

For context, I live in a I live in a MCOL city in Canada, making roughly $60K/year from my job plus an additional $17K/year in rent (after expenses but before taxes) from a real estate property (which was an inheritance). My goal is to save an additional $500K, of which I have saved $67K so far, and pay off my mortgage which has $300K left to go. Then I can live off of the rent money and 4% withdrawals from the savings.

&amp;#x200B;

And some days, I feel like complaining. I work in a small city where there are relatively few opportunities for career growth in my industry. We love our city and plan on staying here (it's beautiful, close to family, and good for both my SO's job and my job), but some days, I just get so fed up. There's hardly ever any money in the budget for raises, and there's never going to be because head office knows we have very limited mobility in this city. My job always has more responsibilities and sometimes I end up working multiple weekends in a row during the busy season (I'm salaried, so there's never any money in it for me). And my salary just feels so incredibly small sometimes.

&amp;#x200B;

But whenever I get too stressed, I try to remember how much FIRE brings to my life. I'm so very grateful to have learned about FIRE, and to have a life so free from stress that the above is really all I could have to worry about.

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, some days my job sucks. But so what? If it was really that bad, I could easily figure out an alternative. I could easily afford to go back to school, if I wanted. I could easily afford to take on a lower-stress administrative job, where I didn't have any high-end responsibilities and didn't have to think about work once the day was done. I could just take a year off if I wanted. But at the end of the day, I don't bother because I don't think I actually want to. My coworkers are awesome people, I have a good rapport with my boss, and a lot of independence in my role. Sure, sometimes during the busy season, my life sucks. But there are also days where things are easy - where I get to just chat with awesome people, go for lunch with clients, and do work I feel good about. I actually do like my job, just the corporate BS makes me want to throw things at the wall sometimes. But so what? Is it really worth thinking about at the end of the day, when I've got so much going for me and could quit if things were actually bad?

&amp;#x200B;

I meet my goals, and we're saving more money than ever before. My SO has had some awesome chances to pursue opportunities in their field because my income is the more stable one, and it's helped both our income and our happiness level. Yeah, some days we get frustrated because we're always asking ourselves, ""should we be dining out this week or should we save more money? Should we do some work on the house this year or should we be focusing on our retirement savings?"" But at least we will never have to ask ourselves ""do we want to get that dental work that desperately needs to be done, or do we want to buy groceries this month?"" All of my problems are just first world problems in comparison.

&amp;#x200B;

If you really want to get down to it, I'm incredibly lucky to live where I do in the world. There are so many people who would gladly trade their problems for mine.

personalfinance,"Advice on Student loans.... S.O. is offering to help pay tuition so we can avoid student loans as much as possible, but I don't want to put her in a tough financial bind.","Throwaway account to keep this anonymous.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I'm in community college right now. I have next semester paid for by a scholarship and have enough saved up to pay in cash for next semester (although I'm still applying for scholarships, so hopefully that'll be covered as well). 

&amp;#x200B;

The plan was to keep applying for scholarships and cover the difference with student loans. I'll be traveling to the college campus and I live with my SO in an apartment, so the only thing I would be paying for would be tuition, books, and other fees (everything but room and board). 30 hours per semester, the school says tuition would cost about $8,000 per year.  I was fine with taking out loans (this would be about $30,000 in loans within the course of 3 courses for 6 semesters). 

&amp;#x200B;

My SO, who already has her degree, no debt, no car payment, and makes substantially more told me that she would rather help pay for my tuition. She can save up $900 per month towards tuition, which would be enough to cover every year if I attend school full time. Her end goal, by the time we get married, would be to have a down payment towards a home. Originally the plan was for me to take out loans, and she can contribute towards the down payment while I take out loans. I told her that school was my debt and that I would be uncomfortable with her paying it.

&amp;#x200B;

But, she spoke with her mom (financial advisor) and came up with an alternative plan:  

&gt; 1. Rather than me taking out loans, with an average of 6.50% interest rate, she would pay for tuition with minimal loans taken out/any scholarships gained to lessen that amount and/or pay her back.  With the $30,000 total cost at 6.50% \[these are all rough estimates\] we would save about $6000 from the principal and interest.

&gt; 2. Once I am out of school and debt free, my CS degree (granted I get a job in the field) should yield $55,000 minimal, an 80% increase of what I already make a year. I could easily match her contributions to a house down payment (if we were both contributing $1,000 per month, we could have a house payment within 2 years time).   

&gt; 3. If we were to take out student loans, I would not be able to contribute to the house (currently only working 30 hours a week to go to school full-time) until after the fact, and that's with the student loans I would need to pay off. So I would maybe contribute half that amount.  We'd still get to the house in time with her already established contribution (if she were to contribute $1000 per month), but the difference is that we'd be $6,000 less at the end with student loans. 

&gt; 4. Although my credit score is good (750), we would have a more difficult time getting a mortgage with student debt in my name. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'm not sure what to do. I told her that I would be uncomfortable with her paying my student loans, but in her mind, since we'll be married we'll share this debt together regardless. This would be a way for us to knock out one debt and apply towards a home together. I gave her the unfortunate scenario if something were to happen (such as us splitting) and she said that we'd work out a payment plan (which, I'm not too worried, we're both honest people and I'm 100% certain I pay back any money I would owe). 

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a solid plan, should I be worried? Is this feasible to do? We're pretty dead set in love and planning to get married in the future, I just don't want to put us in a financial bind. Her Mom seems to think this is a good idea and the payoff would be greater.",finance
MachineLearning,[D] tflearn error: Shape must be rank 1 but is rank 2 for 'strided_slice'. How should I change to correct rank?,"Hi there, new to reddit so if I'm doing something wrong please inform me :-)

I'm struggling to complete a project which needs to be finished fairly soon. I've put a lot of work into it but I've been struggling at this bit for quite a while.

I am attempting to make a CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network), using tflearn, which inputs 17 grayscale images of 28 by 28.

The network is as follows:

    def rnn_conv_lstm_model(width, height, sequence_length):
       network = tflearn.input_data(shape=[None, sequence_length, height, width, 1])
       network = tflearn.reshape(network, [-1, height, width, 1])
       network = tflearn.conv_2d(network, 32, 3, activation='relu')
       network = tflearn.max_pool_2d(network, 2)
       network = tflearn.conv_2d(network, 64, 3, activation='relu')
       network = tflearn.conv_2d(network, 64, 3, activation='relu')
       network = tflearn.max_pool_2d(network, 2)
       network = tflearn.reshape(network, [-1, sequence_length, int((height/2**2)*(width/2**2)*64)])
       network = tflearn.lstm(network, 256)
       network = tflearn.fully_connected(network, 2, activation='sigmoid')
       network = tflearn.regression(network, optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', learning_rate=0.001, name=""output1"")
       return network

This network is then fed into:

    get_input_data()
    # train the model
    model = tflearn.DNN(rnn_conv_lstm_model(28, 28, 17), tensorboard_verbose=0)
    model.fit(X_input_data, Y_labels, show_metric=True, batch_size=None, snapshot_step=None, n_epoch=1)

The 2 errors I get are ""Exception in thread Thread-8"" and are as follows:

    tensorflow.python.framework.errors_impl.InvalidArgumentError: Shape must be rank 1 but is rank 2 for 'strided_slice' (op: 'StridedSlice') with input shapes: [1,2], [1,17], [1,17], [1].
    During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:
    ValueError: Shape must be rank 1 but is rank 2 for 'strided_slice' (op: 'StridedSlice') with input shapes: [1,2], [1,17], [1,17], [1].

From looking around and researching, I'm fairly sure that rank means number of dimensions. As a result, as each input shape in the error above starts with a 1, I would assume that it should be possible to reshape these to a shape of rank 1 relatively easily. Having said this, I'm not sure how to, where to, and even not sure if this idea is correct at all.

I have looked at the shape of my X\_inputs and Y\_label before they are fed into the network, and they are as follows:

    X_inputs shape:

       global Y_labels
       Y_labels = y

I've been stuck on this for a while and now need to complete the CRNN quite soon. I would like it to run on more epochs than 1 of course, but I am just trying to get it to run at all at the moment.

If someone could help me with resolving this, that would be very much appreciated. If you would like some more information/code then I'm sure I could provide it.

2.	Is there an advantage to wait until after Jan 1st to request the payout?
3.	I think my best option is to pay off most of my existing debt except for my mortgage. This will clear up about $1,500 a month that was going to debt service. What option would make the best sense?
a.	Making additionally payments to my mortgage with the goal of drastically paying it down or off (I have a veteran’s loan with no penalty for making additional payments or early pay off)
b.	Maxing out my 401K

It's valued now at over $400k as tons of old houses in the neighborhood are being knocked down and rebuilt into McMansions plus lots of sales in general.

When we bought, it was a bit more in size and $ than we wanted plus it needed some updating- but we couldn't resist the bargain and have a baby due in May, so we are growing into it. We've handled some smaller things but some major areas need updating (2 bathrooms, partial kitchen, and roof). I'd say about $35-40k is needed.

- Original Mortgage: $225k
- Amount Owed: $205k
- Interest Rate: 4.25%
- Monthly Payment w/ Tax/Ins/Etc: $1732 ($145 of that is PMI, $1026 is principle/int)
- Zestimate: $426k
- Credit Score: 815
- Savings Cash: $35k

I feel like I'd have to refi into a conv 15 or 20 year at current rates for it to be worth it, even with the $145/mo wasted on PMI. I ran some numbers a few months ago and a 15 year 4.25 $30k cash out put me at $2283/mo (and only $20k came back to me in actual cash).

Is it more wise for my situation to just get a HELOC and refinance into conventional once rates drop or level off again (even though I can't predict that)?

I work from home, managing the author's website, answering emails, and shooting/editing videos for his YouTube channel.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked my boss if he could put me on payroll in the New Year. After talking with his accountant, my boss proposed a plan where he'd pay me an extra **$600/month** to go towards health-care, in exchange for me classifying myself as an Independent Contractor and foregoing payroll. He's told me it'll cost him more or less the same amount of money, but that he'd save the trouble of setting up payroll, and I'd be able to write off things as business expenses, because I'd be my own business **(?)**. He's a nice guy, but I'm fresh out of university and don't know too much about taxes or health-care, so I'm concerned I might be taken advantage of.

&amp;#x200B;

After doing my own research, I've learned that Indie Contractors pay double the FICA taxes on their income (what I've heard called the ""Self-Employed"" tax), so I'd pay 7.65% extra tax on my annual income. Adding my Federal, State, and Local income taxes, I've calculated my post-tax income as an Independent Contractor would be: **$35,000/year**

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, as a W2 employee, though I'd get a lower salary, my boss would pay more of my taxes, so I calculated I'd take home $**34,000/year,** post tax.

&amp;#x200B;

While on paper, it does seem I'd make **$1000 more** this upcoming year by choosing to be an Independent Contractor, I'm wondering if there are other factors I'm not considering that make being a W2 employee more appealing.

Pay lot of money into loan then refinance after)?

But now my dad really thinks that my job offer is his chance to move out of the state. He's showed my mom some houses on Zillow and she seems to be pretty stoked on it herself. So here's where things get sticky. I love my parents, they've sacrificed their youth (kinda their fault for having kids at 18 but hey different times) working physically demanding jobs their entire lives to provide my siblings and I all the opportunities they never had. I could not have graduated in this field, debt free, without their support.... BUT,  I've posted before about their relationship and damn near inability to leave me out of it, but things have improved substantially since the ambulance, distance helped. So anyway, my dad brought up what I think might be a good plan: sell our home here and pay for one cash in SLC, freeing up what I otherwise would be spending on rent and tucking it away along with a large portion of my check and saving up money for my own home in a fraction of the time. My dad and I have a vision of buying a large plot of land and building an off-grid completely self sustainable home and I truly think that his plan might expedite that vision of ours. But I am torn between starting my own life completely, and being in a toxic environment again but with the chance of expediting homeownership and fulfilling this vision. 

I guess my question is, would it be worth it to move in with my parents again in SLC in this this economic environment with interest rates and whatever (I know nothing of economics)? Will home prices continue escalating at a rate I'll never be able to save enough for a decent down payment if I am paying rent for an apartment (assuming $1200/mo)?

Help. Please. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

Finally graduating and moving to Utah for a career. old man wants to come with but I want to start my own life. But old man makes a good suggestion to expedite my homeownership, the catch is moving backing in with the 'rents into a toxic environment.",finance
personalfinance,Disadvantage to leaving Income-Driven Repayment Plans (IDR) on student loans?,"Hello Pfers,

The interest rates on my student loans are very low so I am looking to keep my payment as low as possible to use my money for other personal financial goals. All Income driven repayment options for the coming year are higher than the graduated payment offered directly from the student loan servicer.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a notable disadvantage to leaving IDR? I am not PSLF eligible. Will I be able to switch back to IDR in a year if that provides the lowest payment? Thanks for any help!",finance

personalfinance,Using a HELOC as a Down Payment - Does the a New Mortgage Cover This?,"I am a homeowner looking to upsize. I run an online business from the current residence and there can be no interruption for the move. As such, the plan is to pull a HELOC to get as much equity out of the existing house as I can, and use this in combination with savings for a down payment on the next house. This allows me to have both mortgages in my possession at once, allowing the transfer of the business materials when time allows, and also allowing the first property to be prepared as an eventual rental. (I can cover both mortgages pretty comfortably, and I am already prequalified by the bank)

Unfortunately, HELOCs today are of unacceptable interest rates. I'm getting quoted for something like 7% to pull a $35k HELOC, which is $255 a month in interest alone. Not wanting this HELOC to be long-term, I've been told that the new mortgage covers the HELOC immediately. Is this true? Other people are telling me I'll be saddled with the new mortgage AND the HELOC if the new house appraises for less than the value of the new mortgage. Can anyone shed some light on this?

I know immediate payoff has fees associated with it because it is the bank's responsibility to appraise the current property, and I am willing to pay these. I just do not want to have two mortgages AND a HELOC racking up my monthly expenditures. Thanks in advance.",finance

Edit: it's only on the 3-5 year. Clarification to reduce click baitiness.

&gt;Some analysts attributed the short-end underperformance to demand for riskier assets as global trade tensions eased following this weekend’s tariff truce between U.S. President Donald Trump and China’s Xi Jinping. Others pinned it to modestly higher expectations for Fed hikes next year after the summit between the two leaders. Either way, the five-year is faring better because investors anticipate the end of the central bank’s hiking path beyond next year.

&gt;Curve flattening over the past two years has signaled investors’ concern that rising interest rates against a backdrop of slowing global growth could harm the U.S. economy. **Inversion -- where yields at the short end of the curve rise above those at the long end -- has been a reliable indicator of recessions.**

Emphasis mine.

Edit. Personally I'm not selling my LT holdings, so I'm not saying we are doomed or any such alarmism. I'm long term after all. But I am going to DCA any new cash, not lump sum drop it in. ""Time in the market"" over all :)

personalfinance,How best to manage an inheritance,"Hello, 

Recently I received an inheritance of approx €10k. It was given to me under the stipulation that 1k of it would go towards savings and then the other would be used to purchase a good car. However, given my current situation, I don't wish to purchase a car until two or three years pass, when I return home from a working abroad etc, as there would be little point having a car sit at home depreciating in value and not being used. 

&amp;#x200B;

So we'll get into the bones of it. What is the best way to manage this inheritance? I'm reluctant to put it into bonds/savings accounts due to inflation vs interest rate issues etc. One possible scenario I had discussed with people was putting it into a credit union, little by little over the next few years (say 50 euro a week) and building up a reliable reputation for saving in their eyes and then when the time comes, finance a loan for the car off the initial sum and use the inheritance as collateral. That way, I don't actually touch the 10k and it can be used as a base later on for larger loans such as a mortgage.

personalfinance,How can an interest rate reduction program make a loan cost more money without changing the term of the loan?,"Navient offers an interest reduction program that caps monthly interest payments on my private student loans at 3%, and I have been enrolled in this program for about a year.  The idea is that not everyone can afford the full payment, but you might be able to afford a partial and you want to make good faith payments without going into forbearance which capitalizes any accrued interest.  As I was applying to extend this program enrollment, I was informed during my phone call with a rep that this program may ultimately cost more money than a level repayment, and that just doesn't click in my head for some reason.  Here's the text from their website:

&gt;RATE REDUCTION PROGRAM

&gt;&gt;The Rate Reduction Program is an alternative payment program for private student loan borrowers experiencing difficulty but who can afford to pay a reduced amount. The program provides a reduced interest rate for a 6-month period. As a result, the Monthly Payment Amount is also temporarily reduced.

&gt;&gt;**By making reduced payments for a period of time, your total loan cost** ***may*** **be higher compared to a level repayment schedule. That's because during the program, your principal balance** ***may*** **be paid down at a slower rate compared to a level repayment schedule.**

&gt;&gt;Eligibility for the program is dependent upon your and your cosigner's financial information. Proof of income may be required. Three (3) qualifying payments may be required prior to enrollment in the program.

There is not more detail or fine print listed anywhere on the website that I can find, so I asked them to mail me a copy of the terms and conditions, which annoyingly can not be emailed (so now I have a great X-Mas card from Navient to look forward to). Under my particular circumstances, it's definitely much more manageable for me to have a lower payment, so I'm pretty sure I'm going to stay in this program, but it doesn't make sense that a reduced interest rate would pay out more money to the lender.  Seems like it's more of a 'Principle Payment Reduction' program, which is neither how it is advertised nor how it is explained when you enter into it.

Does anyone have experience with this program, and can anyone tell me how bad I'm screwing myself?",finance

I've just recently turned 20. I've been working in the small town that I live in as the fiscal officer for some time, but when I started my mother helped me a lot to learn how to do the job. It's been a year now, and despite me trying to take over the job so I can start saving the money for myself to move out, she continues to take most if not all the money. Saying that if I want more that I need to start doing the work. I've tried, and there have been months where I do all the work, and she will still take all my money. I have no income due to this. My parents won't teach me how to drive, and I have no car. I have no savings, emergency fund, or any money at all because the few times I do save up money my parents will come to me and ask for it to pay the bills. Or take it out of my account (it's a joint account despite me not wanting that). My mother is usually very confrontational with me, yelling about how I never do anything. And how I need to learn to ""grow up"". At this point, my mother is wanting to kick me out because I ""never do anything"", despite me working around the house and doing most of what she asks. So I would like to move out, and get started on my life.   
The problem is, I have no money, no car, no savings, no degrees, no certifications, or anything. My dad said I could keep the 40ft pull behind trailer so I guess I could have that. But I have no way to move something that large. I planned to move out to DC, since the cost of living was good, and there is public transportation there. I also have my partner that is going there for college. I would like to avoid relying on them money wise in any way I can, but if I have no options I would be able to for a short time before getting a job. I would also like to live with them after their first year of college. 

I am going to need some sort of money to live off of while I am down there looking for a job. I have no/bad credit due to my family signing my name up for bills they never paid so I have pretty horrible credit. So a credit card is not really viable. I can't guess that I would qualify for a loan since I have nothing that could be used as a collateral.   
I'm not sure what to do. I need to be out before May. Is there some sort of loan I can take out to live on until I get a job? Or a credit card that wouldn't have ridiculous interest rates? Should I try taking the 40 ft camper with me? It's large for 2 people, but I don't think there would be many places in DC it could be parked, also the challenge of getting it there. Any advice or options would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!

personalfinance,My Tax Situation Look Like for 2019 - ACA Tax Credits: Do I pay it back in 2019 or Not?,"Hello Redditers:

I am trying to prepare for the upcoming 2019 tax season and I have a question regarding ACA. In 2017, I signed for a qualifed healthcare plan under the Silver plan with financial assistance meaning an individual would receive tax subidies/tax credits. Then, March 2018, I was let go from my temp agency job. I did not file for unemployment as I cannot claim those. I also did not inform my US state's healthcare marketplace within 30 days about a change in my income. However, I had money in my savings to pay for the ACA health insurance bills for April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, and December as I did not and still currently at this time not working. I have paid all of the bills on time and there has been no lapse gaps in coverage. When it came time to sign up for 2019 ACA health insurance through my US state' marketplace in November 2018, I updated my information and was qualified and enrolled in Medicaid. The state's health insurance marketplace notified the ACA health insurance provider that my qualifed health insurance plan was terminated by November 30, 2018 as I have switched and enrolled in Medicaid.

On December 3, 2018, the ACA health insurance provided returned/refunded the amount I paid for the upcoming December bill. My medicaid coverage will start in Mid-December. I am based in the State of **Maryland.**

My question is as follows:

1. Do I have to pay back the tax credit/tax subidies for the year 2018 when filing my taxes in 2019 even though my income was 0 in March 2018 and is currently at zero?

datascience,Quality inspection in manufacturing using deep learning based computer vision,"**Author: Partha Deka** and **Rohit Mittal**

&amp;#x200B;

**Automation in Industrial manufacturing:**

Today’s increased level of automation in manufacturing also demands automation of material quality inspection with little human intervention. The trend is to reach human level accuracy or more in quality inspection with automation. To stay competitive, modern Industrial firms strive to achieve both quantity and quality with automation without compromising one over the other. 

**Deep Learning for Quality inspection:**

To meet industry standards quality inspectors in manufacturing firms inspect product quality usually after the product is manufactured, it’s a time consuming manual effort and a rejected product results in wasted upstream factory capacity, consumables, labor and cost. With the modern trend of Artificial Intelligence, industrial firms are looking to use deep learning based computer vision technology during the production cycle itself to automate material quality inspection. The goal is to minimize human intervention at the same time reach human level accuracy or more as well as optimize factory capacity, labor cost etc. The usage of deep learning is varied, from object detection in self-driving cars to disease detection with medical imaging deep learning has proved to achieve human level accuracy &amp; better. 

**What is deep learning?**

Deep learning is the field of learning deep structured and unstructured representation of data. Deep learning is the growing trend in AI to abstract better results when data is large and complex. Deep learning architecture consists of deep layers of neural networks such as input layer, hidden layers, and output layer. Hidden layers are used to understand the complex structures of data. A neural network doesn’t need to be programmed to perform a complex task. Gigabytes to terabytes of data are fed to the neural network architecture to learn on its own. Sample deep neural networks below:



https://i.redd.it/dum6mzj8l5221.png

**Convolution neural Network**:

Convolution neural network is a class of deep neural network commonly applied in image analysis. Convolution layers apply a convolution operation to the input passing the result to the next layer. For example an image of 1000 by 1000 pixels has 1 million features. If the first hidden layer has 1000 neurons, it ends up having 1 billion features after the first hidden layer. With that many features, its difficult to prevent a neural network from overfitting with less data. The computational and memory requirements to train a neural network with a billion features is prohibitive. The convolution operation brings a solution to this problem as it reduces the number of free features, allowing the network to be deeper with fewer features. There are two main advantages of using convolution layers over fully connected layers – parameter sharing and sparsity of connections. 

Convolution neural network look for patterns in an image. The image is convolved with a smaller matrix and and this convolution look for patterns in the image. The first few layers can identify lines / corners / edges etc, and these patterns are passed down into the deeper neural network layers to recognize more complex features. This property of CNNs is really good at identifying objects in images. 

Convolution neural network (aka ConvNet) is nothing but a sequence of layers. Three main types of layers are used to build ConvNet architectures: **Convolutional Layer**, **Pooling Layer**, and **Fully-Connected Layer**. These layers are stacked layers to form a full ConvNet **architecture:**

**Case Study:**

**To maintain confidentiality of our work we are presenting an abstract use case below:**

**Problem Statement:**

Detecting bad quality material in hardware manufacturing is an error prone &amp; time consuming manual process and results in false positives (detecting a bad one as good one). If a faulty component/part is detected at the end of the production line there is loss in upstream labor, consumables, factory capacity as well as revenue. On the other hand, if an undetected bad part gets into the final product there will be customer impact as well as market reaction. This could potentially lead to irreparable damage to the reputation of the organization.

**Summary**:

We automated defect detection on hardware products using deep learning. During our hardware manufacturing processes there could be damages such scratches / cracks which make our products unusable for the next processes in the production line. Our deep learning application detected defect such as a crack / scratch in milliseconds with human level accuracy and better as well as interpreted the defect area in the image with heat maps.

**Details of our Deep Learning Architecture**:

To describe things better, we are using an example image of a circuit board with an integrated chip on it below:

**Our first approach**: 

We adopted a combination of pure computer vision approach (non-machine learning methods) to extract the region of interest (ROI) from the original image and a pure deep learning approach to detect defects in the ROI. 

**Why ROI extraction before DL**? 

While capturing the images, the camera assembly, lighting etc. was focusing on the whole area of the circuit (example images below). We are only inspecting the chip area for defects and no other areas in the circuit. We found with a few experiments that DL accuracy increased substantially when neural networks focus only on the area of interest rather than the whole area.

Ø First Extract “Region of Interest (ROI)” with Computer Vision (Non-Machine Learning Methods). Here, we go through multiple processes on the image such as gray scaling, transformations such as eroding, dilating, closing the image etc. and eventually curve out the ROI from image based on use case type / product type etc. The basic idea of erosion is just like soil erosion - it erodes away the boundaries of foreground object. Dilating is just opposite of erosion - it increases the size of foreground object. Normally, in cases like noise removal, erosion is followed by dilation. Opening is just another name of erosion followed by dilation. It is useful in removing noise. Closing is reverse of opening, dilation followed by erosion. It is useful in closing small holes inside the foreground objects, or small black points on the object. Gradient transformation is the difference between dilation and erosion of an image. Overall, these steps help in opening up barely visible cracks / scratches in the original image. Refer the figure below :

Ø Secondly, detect defects using deep neural networks(deep neural network (CNN)-Based Models) using proven CNN topologies such as Inception Net(aka Google Net), Res Net, Dense Net :



https://i.redd.it/ozahu8sll5221.png

Some other areas where experimentation was necessary to find the optimal architecture

Ø **Data Augmentation**: We have few thousand unique images labelled as defects and few thousand labelled as good ones. Augmentation is critical to avoid over-fitting the training set. We did X random crops and Y rotations (1 original image results in X\*Y augmented images). After augmentation we have X\*Y thousand defective images and X\*Y thousand good images. Referring one of original CNN papers in this context [https://](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf)[papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf)

Ø **Initialization strategy** for **CNN** topologies: 

We replaced the final connected layer with our own FC layer and sigmoid layer (binary classification) as shown in the figure below: 

 

https://i.redd.it/zr1sgo7nl5221.png

Rather than random initialization of weights in each layer we considered ImageNet initialization for each CNN topology, our DL accuracy have increased substantially when we used ImageNet initialization than random.

Ø **Loss Function** and **Optimizer**: 

· **Cross Entropy loss**: Cross-entropy loss, or log loss, measures the performance of a classification model whose output is a probability value between 0 and 1. Cross-entropy loss increases as the predicted probability diverges from the actual label. So predicting a probability of .01 when the actual observation label is 1 would be bad and result in a high loss value. A perfect model would have a log loss of 0

· **SGD** and **Nesterov momentum: SGD** or stochastic gradient descent is an iterative method for optimizing a differentiable objective function (loss function), it’s stochastic because it takes random samples from the data to do the gradient descent update. Momentum is a moving average of the gradients, it is used to update the weight of the network and it helps accelerate gradients in the right direction. **Nesterov** is a version of the momentum that is getting popular recently. 

   

https://i.redd.it/rm4s0imol5221.png

**Our Second approach**: 

**Critique to first approach**: While extracting regions of interest, it requires rewriting code whenever there are changes in product types, circuit board type/chip type (in case of our abstract example), camera setups / directions etc. This is not scalable.

**Solution:** We built an end-end two step DL architecture. In the first step, instead of a CV approach we used a DL approach to predict the ROI itself. We manually created a labelled dataset with a bounding box tool &amp; we let train a DL architecture to predict the ROI. One downside of this technique is that the labelled dataset has to be explicit and extensive enough to include all product types etc. (circuit board type/chip type in case of our abstract example) for the deep neural network to generalize well on unseen images. Refer the figures below: 

  

https://i.redd.it/kmvyolmpl5221.png

Ø **CNN ROI generator Loss function:**  

· We initially used a squared distance based loss function as below :

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/cl28vnmql5221.png

After training a Resnet50 model for 20 epochs we achieved the following validation metric (average missed area and IOU) on the validation set :

**Ave. missed area = 8.52 \* 10-3**

**Ave. IOU (intersection over union) = 0.7817**

At least, we want to improve the **IOU**

· We came up with an **Area based loss,** please refer the figure below to get an idea of how we use basic math to calculate the area of intersection between the ground truth and the predicted label. In the loss function, we want to penalize both the missed and the excess area. Ideally, we would want to penalize the missed area more than the excess area:

 

https://i.redd.it/b73qb64wl5221.png

   

 The Loss function above is differentiable so we can do gradient descent optimization on the loss function

Ø **CNN ROI generator Augmentation**: we simply added margins 5% (both left and right) margins during training time and test time on our predicted ROIs:

 

https://i.redd.it/btl8iniyl5221.png

Ø **CNN ROI generator results:**  We used Resnet50 (ImageNet initilization) toplogy and SGD + Nesterov momentum optimizer with penalty term ""lamda missed"" =2  &amp; penalty term ""lamda excess"" =1 in the **area based loss** as described above. After training the Resnet50 model for multiple epochs we want to minimize the avg. missed area and maximize the avg. IOU (Best IOU is ‘1’). After training for 20 epochs we achieved the following on the validation set: 

**Ave. missed area = 3.65 \* 10-3** 

**Ave. IOU (intersection over union) = 0.8577** 

With area based loss and augmentation(described above) we improved  our validation metric on missed area and IOU

**Experiments &amp; Benchmarks**: 

Ø **Experiment**:

Total # of images: Few thousand images

Data split: 80-to-10-to-10 split, using unique images only

Framework used: PyTorch &amp; Tensorflow / Keras

Weights Initialization: Pre-trained on ImageNet 

Optimizer: SGD with learning rate = 0.001, using Nesterov with momentum = 0.9

Loss: Cross entropy

Batch size: 12

Total # of epochs: 24

Image shape: 224x224x3 (except for Inception V3, which requires 299x299x3)

Criterion: Lowest validation loss

&amp;#x200B;

**Benchmarks**:

Our benchmarks with both the approaches are pretty comparable, the results with CV+DL (first) approach are little better off than the DL+DL (second) approach. We believe, our DL+DL could be better if we can create an extensive and explicit labelled bounding box dataset.

&amp;#x200B;

Following a successful completion of training, an inference solution has to be found to complete the whole end to end solution. We used Intel OpenVino software to optimize inference in different types of hardware besides CPU such as FPGA, Intel Movidius etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Inference**: 

**Intel Open Vino**: Based on convolution neural networks (CNN), the Intel Open Vino toolkit extends workloads across Intel hardware and maximizes performance:

\- Enables CNN-based deep learning inference on the edge

\- Supports heterogeneous execution across computer vision accelerators—CPU, GPU, Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute Stick, and FPGA—using a common API

\- Speeds time to market via a library of functions and pre-optimized kernels

\- Includes optimized calls for OpenCV and OpenVX\*

Refer the following figures on Open Vino architecture:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/yqofs0lfm5221.png

Two Step Deployment:

\- Step one is to convert the pre-trained model into intermediate representations (IRs) using **Model Optimizer**: 

§ **Produce a valid intermediate representation**: If this main conversion artifact is not valid, the Inference Engine cannot run. The primary responsibility of the Model optimizer is to produce the two files to form the Intermediate Representation.

§ **Produce an optimized intermediate representation:** Pre-trained models contain layers that are important for training, such as the dropout layer. These layers are useless during inference and might increase the inference time. In many cases, these layers can be automatically removed from the resulting Intermediate Representation. However, if a group of layers can be represented as one mathematical operation, and thus as a single layer, the Model Optimizer recognizes such patterns and replaces these layers with one. The result is an Intermediate Representation that has fewer layers than the original model. This decreases the inference time.

The IR is a pair of files that describe the whole model:

.**xml**: Describes the network topology

.**bin**: Contains the weights and biases binary data

\- Step two is to use the **Inference Engine** to read, load, and infer the IR files, using a common API across the CPU, GPU, or VPU hardware

Open Vino documentation: [https://software.intel.com/en-us/inference-trained-models-with-intel-dl-deployment-toolkit-beta-2017r3](https://software.intel.com/en-us/inference-trained-models-with-intel-dl-deployment-toolkit-beta-2017r3)

**Inference Benchmarks on sample Image:**



https://i.redd.it/75dhbp9im5221.png

It is clear that optimizing with software stack is critical to reduce the inference time. We saw 30X to 100X improvement in latency time using OpenVino software optimization. In addition, besides Intel CPU we also experimented with other Intel hardware accelerators such as Intel Movidius and FPGA. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Visualizing CNN with Heat Maps**:

Often deep neural networks are criticized for low interpretability and most deep learning solutions stop at the point when the classification of the labels are done. We wanted to interpret our results, why the CNN architecture labelled an image as good or bad (binary classification for our case study), which area in the image the CNN is focusing most.

Based on this research in MIT [https://](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04150.pdf)[arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04150.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.04150.pdf) , a class activation map in combination with the global max pooling layer has been proposed to localize class specific image regions.

Global average pooling usually acts as a regularizer, preventing overfitting during training. It is established in this research that the advantages of global average pooling layer extend beyond simply acting as a regularizer - little tweaking, the network can retain its remarkable localization ability until the final layer. This tweaking allows identifying easily the discriminative image regions in a single forward pass for a wide variety of tasks, even those that the network was not originally trained for. 

Following is a heat map interpretation using this technique on the “crack on a plain surface” image using Resnet-50 architecture trained on ImageNet.  As we can see, the heat map focusses on the crack area below although the architecture is not trained on such images –

 

https://i.redd.it/624ov14sm5221.png

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary &amp; Conclusion:**

With deep learning based computer vision we achieved human level accuracy and better with both of our approaches – CV+DL and DL+DL (discussed earlier in this blog). Our solution is unique - we not only used deep learning for classification but for interpreting the defect area with heat maps on the image itself.

Human factor cannot be completely dissociated but we can substantial reduce human intervention. An optimal model is always a fine tune between FPR (false positive rate) &amp; FNR (false negative rate) or Precision vs Recall. For our use case, we successfully automated defect detection with a model optimized for low FNR (High Recall). We substantially reduced the human review rate. With our case study we proved that we can automate material inspection with deep learning &amp; reduce human review rate.

personalfinance,"Should we make an offer? 3% down on $365,000 house, but sooner than we expected","Hey all!

I'm trying to figure out whether or not my wife and I should make an offer on a house. We've got about $15,000 saved for a down payment/closing costs right now, and the house we are considering is $365,000 (though we are going to offer $360,000). We got preapproved through quicken and they say that the down payment will be \~$10,500 and the closing costs will be \~$4,500, with an interest rate of 5.25%.

This is all happening a bit faster than we expected. We were planning on saving up a few thousand more dollars in the next couple of months, so we could have a DP of \~$25,000, but we like this house a lot. Once we found it, we started thinking that it'd be nice to move out of our 1-bed apartment before our baby is born in January.

I'm worried that we're shooting ourselves in the feet by moving too fast. 5.25% seems a bit higher than what I've seen, and with other fees/costs of home buying, we'd have less cash than I'd like after the purchase (we'd still have an emergency fund, and a bit left over, plus retirement accounts, but not much else). On the other hand, we can probably shop around and find a better rate. And we could always back out of the offer if we realize we're doing something stupid.

I'd like some advice from people who aren't trying to sell me something. Are we making a mistake, or being too risky? Is it worth it to wait until we're a bit more comfortable? We're expecting the house to go fast and would like to make an offer soon.

Thanks in advance for your help!

personalfinance,"Need advice on loans, debt and working two jobs.","I really had no clever way of make the title sound appealing so I apologize for that. In the past I have posted about credit card debt and other things but I have a more personal issue and honestly I can use advice of people who are not emotional involved in this.

There are three things I really need to ask, they may be easy so please bear with me.  

So first thing, I have a rounded total of $6,100 debt, it was $7600 3 months ago but I am really trying to get rid of it before interest kills me slowly.  Even to the point where my monthly diet is basically Pb&amp;J every night.  I even locked my credit card and have not used it since 3 months ago  Now these are two different cards 1 is capital one for $3000 and another is an engagement ring.  Now the capital one has interest on it, I want  to say its like 20% or something.  The engagement ring has no interest until March.  When interest does hit it will the be the same as the credit card.

My bank, since moving to TN needs to see at least 6 to 8 months of income coming in before they can even offer me a loan.  They offer loans at 8 to 10% interest.  I am really...really tempted to get a loan from them at a lower interest rate, but also instead of paying two different companies, I only pay one.  It simplifies things also.  My credit card would still be locked.  

What do you think about that?

The second thing, I got the engagement ring alright, its been over 60 days since I have had it, and well lets just say things did not go as planned after I proposed.  Luckily I found out about the infidelity before we spend thousands on a wedding so some good luck on that end.  No longer really have a need for the ring but still paying it off and its a horrible reminder of what was.  Can I sell it or do I have to wait until I pay it off to sell it or pawn it or whatever?  If I am able to sell it the money would go straight into the ring anyway to pay off the balance.  I did get the ring appraised for around $4500 (rounded down a little) so I know what its worth and probably asking for 40% of it or close to it when I sell it.

Third question...I am working two jobs  currently.  One is where I want to go in life, IT, and love it to death and thankful for one good thing that has happened in recent months of my life.  The other is a crappy night shift I only work on weekends.  I get an extra $800-ish a month from it.  I have been putting it towards my debt.  Should I continue working there until I pay off the debt?  I will be honest only doing it for the money but 65 hours a week is not enjoyable and I can easily live off the other job alone.  Just would take long to pay off I guess like a year or so.  Plus I will be starting school in spring semester, to get my life on track and move on.

&amp;#x200B;

I work for a start-up company that I joined pretty early on, about 3 years ago fresh out of college. Over that time we've been massively successful and grown from fewer than 15 employees when I joined to around 200 employees, including c-level execs from massive companies you no doubt would have heard of, if not own goods from. I've grown by leaps and bounds in my career, wearing many hats as start-up employees are wont to do but coming into a focus on data and analytics over the past 2 years. A few months ago, I was named 'lead business intelligence analyst' (I'm the only BI analyst and the only analyst period). Because of my institutional knowledge, I've become a crutch for just about every employee for every type of question. I have extremely high throughput, am involved in strategic decision making, interviewing, and have extremely high c-level visibility. It's been the best start to my career I could have asked for, I've had the best manager I could have asked for. But our team is also crazy understaffed, overworked, disorganized, and generally a bottleneck in our company's operations. Managers from other departments complain to me about my team. I don't find myself having fun at work anymore and I'm constantly stressed.

&amp;#x200B;

About a week ago, I was approached with a job offer (circumventing HR rules. Still a start-up at our roots I guess) leading the marketing analytics department with a 'senior' title and the opportunity to begin my management career, all with a handsome pay raise (a little over 30%). All of these perks are things I've communicated to wanting from my current department leader and have been promised are coming, but take it from me that they are not materializing. The marketing department has more nonsense to deal with, more big personalities, and more general insanity. There's also a huge unknown in changing teams, management, and the whole thing just keeps me thinking in circles what I actually want to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Just about everyone I've confided in said to take the leap, be selfish and go get what I've earned. Everyone except my current manager and mentor, whom I trust completely and truly, truly does want the best thing for me in my career. He recognizes one way or another he is done managing me before too long, so there is really nothing for him to be selfish about, anyways. He thinks I'm set up perfectly to go learn data warehousing (I'm currently leading our implementation with the help of a consultant) and be part of big data in the future and become a data scientist or something like that, while at the same time being a huge impact on our analytics organization wide. But the thing is, I didn't study computer science, and I don't want to be a computer scientist, and I think my skills play better in the new role. But I'd have to give a lot of autonomy up if I switch teams, and there is always the unknown of making a switch. I've been told by the president of the company that I can't make a wrong choice but I am feeling like I can't make a right choice.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's a bit of a unique situation, but I'm wondering if anyone has been through something similar and can offer some sage advice, or if anyone has any experience that they may find useful for me as I toss and turn over what I should do.

To preface this, almost no legwork has been done for this project. I am not a dev and I have a career and a family, however, I've been in crypto for awhile and I am in the information security industry. Right now, I'm just a guy with an idea. TL;DR at the bottom

A global database of interconnected argument maps ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument\_map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_map)) written to a highly available, publicly readable and writable data-structure can allow for a minimally redundant public discussion forum and act as a best-effort unified field of logic and reason, a sort of “best-effort truth database.” A condensed summary of how this is achieved follows. The key to advancing discussion is the reduction of redundant arguments. Much time is wasted repeatedly explaining the same arguments and counter-arguments both in person and in online discussion forums every time a particular issue arises in a conversation or online thread. This is an extremely inefficient way of propagating information, and it is vulnerable to a variety of attacks. This propagation can be improved by treating each specific “thought” as a node, and rather than repeating that thought in each case where it must be used to argue for or against a cause, simply link to that node, increasing the complexity of the best-effort truth database. Imagine harnessing the collective decision making capacity of all other users of the system in an efficient way, that's what this attempts to achieve.

There is already some open-source work done on argument mapping - but it serves a different use case. Maybe some code can be reused - I don't know. [http://www.argunet.org/](http://www.argunet.org/)

Here is an example relevant to the BCH community. We will call this system ""[argumap.it](https://argumap.it)"" for now (I bought the domain but there is nothing there yet):  


Someone makes the claim ""Big blocks can't scale."" If that node does not yet exist in the system, create a node declaring that statement. Then, create ""refutation"" links from nodes that show the statement to be false to the node claiming ""big blocks can't scale"". The opposition can create nodes that attempt to refute your negations or to support their statement, and the process continues. This ""map"" grows and becomes tangles with every other debatable topic. The original node ""big blocks can't scale"" could be used by the opposition to support or refute another node, and all the logical leg work about the statement can be viewed branching off that node.

  
I've thought about spam protection already. Essentially, users select trusted (don't crucify me yet) moderators who take [argumap.it](https://argumap.it) posts, quality control them (remove spam, fix grammar, prevent ""text walls"" from showing up as each statement should be separated out into a node, etc) and sign the QA'ed posts with their digital signature. Users then ""filter"" the map by posts with a digital signature from their selected moderators. Anyone can become a moderator, anyone can filter by any moderator's digital signatures, or they can filter by no signatures at all but that is vulnerable to spam attacks. I would call this a ""federated trust model"".  


There's more to this for sure, and it's success is going to be based on how well we can create a front-end that shows users as much information as possible in an easy to understand way. There are other challenges too. There may be attack vectors not yet discovered. People might not even use the system. I imagine this could end up being a sort of social media for debating, if it is successful. I met a dev at defcon who was interested and we've been in light communication since then and he is still interested in working on the project (yeah, we move slow, very slow, but I really think this can help the community, and the world).

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Use argument maps written to a blockchain or other public data structure to create a web of debates, spam protection via user selected moderator cryptographic signatures.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Savings Account,"I am a military member that currently does most of my banking throughNavy Federal Credit Union. 

My saving account (7k and trying to build my emergency fund) currently earns .4% interest. 

I was on Mint.vom today and looked at the recommended savings accounts and they are at 2.25%. 

How can some banks have interest rates so much higher and is there a downside to transferring my savings to CIT Bank to get the better rate? There are no fees and just a requirement to bank a minimum of 100/month (currently depositing 700/month).",finance
personalfinance,What should I do with my bonus?,"Tl;dr: I am about to get a $7,000 bonus (after taxes). Should I put it in my emergency fund (currently balance $3500, transfer $500/month), pay off my car loan (\~$7000 payoff, $399/month payment, 4.75% interest rate), or pay off one of my student loans (\~$7000 payoff, $140/month payment, 4.624% interest rate)? 

I expect I already know the answer to this question, but I'm just wondering if others have different perspectives. I am a 24 year old with a stable job working for a technology company in North Carolina. My base pay is $115k per year, and the only debt I have is an auto loan and student loans. I previously went through a divorce which ate up a lot of my money for a while, but I'm slowly starting to build up an emergency fund (current balance $3,500, contributing $500/month) and am continuing to improve my financial stability. I contribute 12% of my gross income to my 401(k), before my employer match (3% total match). I am about to receive my quarterly bonus which will end up coming to about $7,000 (after taxes).  I have two debts remaining: an auto loan (\~$7,000 payoff, $399/month payment, 4.75% interest rate) and student loans (mix of public and private with \~$35,000 remaining total balance; graduated repayment plan, $404/month total payment, 4.1% weighted interest rate). I would specifically look to tackle the remaining private loan since it has the highest interest rate of all my student loans (\~$7,000 payoff, $139/month payment, 4.624% interest rate). I am trying to decide what do with the bonus. Should I contribute it to my emergency fund, or should I pay off my private student loan or auto loan? My current lean is to payoff the auto loan and contribute that newly-freed $399/month to my student loans (interest rate weighted). My only hesitation is if my car is totalled, but after reviewing NADA values, I think that even with a poor payout on a total accident I would come out ahead. I do currently have GAP insurance on the vehicle, but I don't believe that I'm underwater based off the NADA values.

personalfinance,My finances are becoming a MESS. I'm redirecting &amp; splitting money and it's becoming confusing.,"Hello!

My current banking set up is

Direct deposit -&gt; 30% A Savings Account &amp; 70% B Checking Account

B Checking -&gt; C Savings &amp; D Savings &amp; E Savings &amp; F Savings &amp; G Savings

G Savings -&gt; H Checking

At the end of the month, I transfer extra from:

A Savings -&gt; B Checking

Any extra that I didn't use at the end of the month goes from

B Checking-&gt; F Savings.

A MESS.

The reasoning is: My savings &amp; checking require a direct deposit or charge me a fee per month. This is a bank that I can withdraw money from quickly. The savings has an interest rate of 0.01%, so I would rather anything ""extra"" to be transferred to Ally bank. Since my checking is basically only used to collect my paycheck, I disperse it among my Ally accounts (Emergency Fund, Insurance, Gift, Liquid Savings, Spending). The spending (savings) is then transferred to the Ally Interest Checking, which handles my gym draft &amp; other ""fun"" money, which will get put back if I do not spend it all. There has got to be a better way. I want the high interest rate, but I hate this.


How should I set this up better? I like splitting my money into different accounts, but I do not like this. I'm thinking that I could close my Savings with my ""local?"" bank, and have 100% of my check go to my checking. From there, I can use this account for ONLY dispersal, meaning my ALLY 5 savings and 1 checking. Anything Extra can simply go back into my Ally Liquid Savings account (which may get used to reduce my loans).

CryptoCurrency,Why instant ramen in a prison economy is likely a more successful currency than the average altcoin.,"Does prison ramen have a better economic model, userbase, &amp; utility than most altcoins?🍜 

A casual mental exercise for token creators.

""Ramen is the best &amp; easiest currency because everybody uses it.. it's durable, portable, divisible,&amp; highly valued""

https://youtu.be/PLt9fRYT92M



**Ramen within a prison economy has many traits of an attractive sound currency:**

✅ **Predictable monetary policy** - a stable, scheduled, and quotaed monthly delivery of ramen supplies into a prison means no unpredictable inflation.



✅ **Scarce**- a constant demand &amp; consumption of ramen as food reduces the available supply after every meal, &amp; overconsumption raises the value of the little remaining ramen supplies. Expiry dates force timely consumption and ""token burns"" inedible expired supplies.


✅ **Standardized units &amp; divisible:**  Packs of ramen have factory standardized sizes and weight for each pack. One pack can also be broken down into smaller bits. 

✅ **Durable:** Plastic packaging and long expiry times = holds value longer than most prison foods.


✅ **Fungible:** One strand of noodle always has a fixed caloric value, multiple packs of ramen can be crushed &amp; intermixed, the total caloric value will stay the same, one strand of noodle from one pack can be interchanged with one from another pack with no loss of caloric value.


✅ **Adoption:** ""People bet with them in games, trade them for favors, write their families to get access to more.. What will (ramen) buy? Anything it seems — other food items, razors, shampoo, “services” or as a way to pay off debts."" https://www.pymnts.com/news/payment-methods/2016/ramen-noodle-payments-history/


✅ **Large userbase:** The average prison population in the US is 134000, which is likely much larger than most altcoins and dapps.  

✅ **Innate value:** Backed by life sustaining calories, ramen has survival demand and can be eaten unlike paper money or cryptocurrencies.


If you're the creator of an altcoin or utility token seeking to become ""the next bitcoin"" or ""the future of money"", compare your project with prison ramen, and see how your token fares in comparison. Given the fact that most tokens have lost 99% of their value compared to the stable ramen price this year, with low adoption, and low userbases compared to the average prison ramen economy- altcoin and utility token projects have their work cut out for them! 🍜",cryptocurrency

I just got a new job where I received an extremely large increase in pay, from $38k to $72k. After creating a new budget, with a good amount of saving and money towards retirement, I have $150 to spare I'd like to put towards our debt.

Our total college loan debt between my wife and myself is over $110k. Our total payments into this debt are currently $940/month. Interest rates range from 2.5 - 4.8 %. 

I also have a car payment that is around 3 years from completion with $11k left approximately. I pay $334/month currently. Interest rate is 3%.

I know it initially seems like paying the higher interest school loans off first would be best. However, my wife's car (which is paid off) is old and jankety and constantly in need of repair. I'm afraid it may not last another 3 years when my car is paid off, so my thought was to put that additional $150/month towards my car payment to get it paid off faster, in case we need another car.

On the flip side, that 150/month towards loans won't put a huge dent in our total school debt.

XRP,XRP: The Way Ahead,"Exactly three months ago, on September 4th, I made the following EOY prediction for XRP:

“2017 was an amazing rally, and no cryptocurrency rallied harder than XRP. There's a saying in investing that ‘The hangover lasts as long as the party,’ so I suspect that 2018 will be a bummer of a year. I'm looking for XRP to remain weak into December and close out the year at or below .25. I'm looking for a small rally in early 2019 and firming prices throughout the year. May not see serious bull action until 2020.”

I’m not here to say “I told you so.” And I couldn’t care less if you buy, sell or hodl XRP. I’m here to explain WHY XRP remains weak, and explain what you can expect for XRP price action in the next few weeks. 

XRP price is weak and will remain weak through December 31st. The primary reason for this weakness is the powerful incentive for investors to sell their XRP now and claim the loss on their 2018 federal income taxes against any capital gains they may have earned on other investments. After December 31st, this window of opportunity is CLOSED, and this type of selling will cease.

A secondary reason for XRP price weakness is “window dressing”. This is the common practice among hedge fund managers (and mutual fund managers) of selling losers to avoid SEC annual reporting requirements. You see, if XRP remains on their books on January 1st, then they must include the loss in their annual report to investors. These managers do not want to shake investor confidence by revealing that they lost 50%, 70% or even 90% on XRP in 2018, so they will clear XRP off the books now, avoid the reporting requirement, and (perhaps) buy it back on (or after) January 1st.

As a result, I’m looking for the entire cryptosphere to experience more price bleeding and one final, bone-jarring plunge toward the end of this month. This is the final stage of the bear; it is called “capitulation”. It will shake out many “weak hands”.

Some don’t understand technical analysis (studying past price movement to anticipate future movement); others don’t trust it. All the same, let me explain what the long-term charts show. BTC is breaking down to new lows for 2018. It has strong support at the point where the 2017 rally began, which is about $1250. This means that BTC could drop another 70% (from $4000 to $1250) before it encounters bedrock support. If it were to plunge this low, this movement would be called a “full retracement”. I personally do NOT think it will fall to $1250, but it very well COULD.

So what does this mean for XRP? Well, BTC leads the entire cryptosphere, so if (when) BTC plunges lower, all other cryptos are likely to follow it lower. That includes XRP. I am NOT saying that XRP will fall at the same rate as BTC (I believe it will fall slower), but I am saying that I fully expect XRP to continue to fall in price against the U.S. dollar (and its proxies, USDT and USDC).

Now, let’s look at technical analysis for XRP. Although BTC price keeps falling to new lows for 2018, XRP price remains above its 2018 low of 27 cents. This is very, very GOOD—and it will remain very, very good as long as XRP does not break below 25 cents and stay below 25 cents for more than two or three days.

My expectation is that XRP will fall back to the 25-27 cent range in the next few weeks. On some exchanges, it may momentarily plunge even lower. View these as BUYING opportunities. The next 27 days is NOT your last chance to buy cheap XRP, but it is your very BEST chance to buy cheap XRP. I believe that XRP will find support in this 25-27 cent range, and that it will rally early in 2019, perhaps even as early as January 1st or 2nd as tax-deduction-incentived sellers become bottom-fishing buyers. I do not expect much from the January rally, but I believe it will mark the bottom of the Great Crypto Bear Market of 2018. 2019 will probably be a boring year for crypto, with months of sideways action punctuated by occasional seesaw movements. I’m looking for our next crypto bull market to begin no sooner than January 2020.

Merry Christmas to all!

CryptoCurrency,Crypto: Focus on what you can control and be rich,"I'm seeing lots of very young investors or BEAR TARDS posting rear view mirror charts, non stop negative news, if you only sold posts, this mining op went out of biz, etc

&amp;#x200B;

Listen up, Crypto Winter is WHEN you invest. All industries like all of LIFE goes thru cycles. The Fall and Winter cycle has been here for a while with crypto. You see this stuff in capitulation like mining drying up, etc. However it is very unique to see real world investment and our sector gaining traction as ""retail"" gives up and sells at the worst time of course.

&amp;#x200B;

All the johnny come lately rear view posts are not just LAME, finger pointing, shaming, smearing, etc. They do Nothing today to change YOU or your wealth/health. You cannot control the past. You all can control your future with a reasonable bounds. YOU CAN CHOOSE To SEE OPPORTUNITY TO DO the following depending on the awesome crypto of :

&amp;#x200B;

Mine

open a validation node

Educate yourself like reading a basic BOOK about crypto

Educate others, go to MEET UP to learn

Build yourself up with coding classes or brainstorming

Being an entreprenuer in this space

Talking to other people HERE on reddit/youtube to build a network of strong hands, or a venture, etc

Consider valuing your holdings NOT IN FIAT, but in total tokens/stake held \*\*\* this is a big one guys!

Participate in the new Apps out there like maker/DAI, Compound, etc out there. HODLERS are being PAID interest to hold assets in the crypto space. Too many people have forgotten these are new digital assets, in inning 1-2, and you can be PAID to hold now! My god, people are using their ETH as collateral debt obligation at sub 3% interest rates! How many people will build biz's on this or pay back credit card debt!

&amp;#x200B;

What not to do:

Sit here bitching and moaning, not realizing half or more of the negative posts are wall st troll accounts, shorter accounts, etc

Attacking other developers or hodlers. BTW, most people are attacking HODLING now at the very moment TO HODL and accumulate

Attacking other non scam Cryptos! Big one. Stop attacking ltc, bch, etc. Wake up fool they are on most top exchanges for a reason

As you age you realize wasting your time on being negative is a waste of a life and your productive power. The ELITE want you to do this to retain control of the existing power structure. I'm in this for the freedom and property rights. I'm in this like forever. I will use my stake as an asset and participate in using crypto in many ways to benefit us all. I hope you all will join me!

&amp;#x200B;

PS, Life has no guarantees but I know this. Crypto helps bring freedom and liberty to people let alone more transparency, including, and democratization of money. That is something never going out of style. Some of the next gen millionaires are probably reading this now. I know most people here don't get it but 80% of the stock market is literally controlled by the top 1/2 of 1%. You cannot win that chess game anymore guys.

personalfinance,401k Question,"I recently put in my two weeks for my current job, which I was at a year as of today. I am going to work for state government and my retirement account will be contributed to a 403b as opposed to a 401k. I have a very small Roth 401k with the employer I am about to be leaving, around $1,500. The employer is giving me the option of opening an IRA and rolling the funds into it tax free or having the funds cashed out and paying a 20% federal income tax and POSSIBLY have to pay a 10% early withdrawal penalty. I know it is generally not advised to cash out retirement accounts, but with a dollar amount this small,  I’ve been advised by my FA that cashing out will likely be the best option. Should I cash out or rollover into an IRA?",finance
personalfinance,"I was paid $4,933.07 in earned income this year. But made about $60,000 through non-earned income. How much am I allowed to contribute to a Roth IRA for 2018? [New York State]","Hi, I'm in college and had a windfall and as a result, generate a sizable amount of passive income each year through interest, dividends, and short-term gains. (I'm not referring to long term gains and unrealized gains). This year, I'm on track to generate anywhere between $45,000-60,000 in passive income. (I make estimated tax payments for this).

&amp;#x200B;

This past summer, I landed my first paid internship that was located in New York City. (I'm not a resident of New York City - I live upstate. I sublet an apartment for the 2 months I was there. Mentioning this since New York City has an additional local tax whereas my county does not).

&amp;#x200B;

I allocated 0 allowances for both state and federal on my W-4. According to my compensation summary from my employer, my total compensation and benefits was exactly $4,933.07. I added up my paychecks and they summed up to $3,557.84. So that leaves about 30% withheld?

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first time contributing to Roth. Since I have other monies, I'd like to contribute as much as allowed.  I've heard that you contribute after-tax dollars. But since my total compensation was less than the federal maximum, how much am I allowed to contribute?",finance
personalfinance,Should I temporarily pause retirement savings to rapidly pay off debt?,"I am a 29 F working in medicine and make a decent salary. It varies due to bonuses and hours of numbers worked, but I make about $140k a year. I graduated in 2014 and I have paid down my student loan debt from $170k to about $95k at this point. 

My boyfriend and I are getting engaged and I will be moving into his place soon. He owns his house and doesn’t have a mortgage. His monthly cost to live there is about $500 in association dues and utilities. This will be a huge reduction in housing costs for me, as I am spending about $1600 currently. 

I have been contributing steadily to retirement since graduating, but started maxing out my 401k two years ago, and maxed out a backdoor Roth for the last three years. I also have about 20k in a taxable investment account. I have about 100k total in those three accounts, plus a 20k emergency fund. 

My employer contributes 3% to my 401k regardless of whether or not I contribute, along with a profit sharing contribution that’s usually an additional 2%. 

My student loan is at $95k with a 3.9% fixed rate. 

Once we move in together, I was thinking about pausing all retirement contributions so I can max out student loan payments. Depending on how many hours I work, I think I can pay about $5k-6k a month and pay them off in 1.5-2 years. We would really like to be debt free ASAP.  The only other debt I have is about $5k in a car loan but the interest rate is negligible. 

I know that 3.9% isn’t a staggeringly high interest rate, but with the way the stock market has been this seems particularly appealing. It’s been so depressing contributing to my 401k and watching it plateau. Yes, I know that staying the course is the best option, but this is a guaranteed 3.9% return and once my loans are paid off, it will be a huge burden off my back. I will also resume retirement savings as soon as the loans are paid off. At the same time, I don’t want my money to lose time in the market. 

Any thoughts?",finance
dogecoin,"Dogecoin's History, according to me","`L`ong ago, gentle and kind fairy woodland elves picked flowers and multiplied throughout the woodland realm.

      Then, about 5 years ago, Dogecoin was created.

After that, a magical unicorn came down and poofed rainbow clouds, which were dreams, and created the **Dogecoin Foundation**. The Dogecoin Foundation has wow and clap your shoes and they will come, on their magical unicorn. To this day the Dogecoin Foundation still poofs rainbow clouds from its dreamland haven, poofing on bad people and also approving all meme content from its supreme hindquarters on an iceberg by the north pole, manned by penguins and polar bears that take penguins occasionally in exchange for work.

The method by which all meme content is approved is simple: first the memes go to the approval committee, if nothing happens, then a bie is presented and if it is not a leap year the meme is approved on the condition that day or night is achieved within 48 hours, that there are enough penguins on the iceberg, that the rainbow unicorn has the proper dietary supplement, that the fairy woodland elves are picking flowers, that the Dogecoin Foundation remains centered yet has wow, on its rainbow unicorn. if it is a leap year then the same rules apply, except the fairy elves are picking flowers and multiplying. Pending any further dispute, of which there is none, all meme content is thusly approved. If the meme content approving generation method were to cease to exist, there would most likely be non-existent or non-perceivable effects,  which nonetheless affect effections of the meme and its subsequent effects.

Volgons seldom wont for the kind of flowers that gentle and kind fairy woodland elves multiply for,  but as long as there are rainbow unicorns the Dogecoin Foundation will thrive and poof dreams on  kind and friendly woodland elves, and others.",cryptocurrency

worldpolitics,Modern weapons for the Arctic,"Due to the fact that currently NATO countries led by the United States are strengthening their positions in the Arctic, Russia has taken a number of measures to ensure the protection of its own interests in the region. In particular, the military presence is increasing, military exercises are being held, the serious development of the Northern Sea Route as the most important logistic artery in the region begins, and, of course, the naval component is being strengthened. The domestic military-industrial complex has innovative solutions that allow military equipment and infrastructure to function smoothly in the harsh conditions of the north. And prospective military equipment and weapons are constantly being tested in the extreme conditions of the Arctic.

In 2014, the Defense Ministry of the Russian Federation formed the joint strategic command ""North"" with headquarters in Severomorsk. As part of the joint strategic command of the Northern Fleet, an army of air force and air defense was formed, as well as an army corps and an arctic motorized rifle brigade prepared to perform combat missions in harsh climatic conditions.

The Northern Fleet includes: 41 submarines and 38 ships, including the heavy aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov, as well as 8 submarines with ballistic missiles. In 2018, the icebreaker Ilya Muromets, the logistics support vessel Elbrus, and the large landing ship Ivan Gren were added to the Arctic forces.

The structure of the Northern Fleet in 2018 included the frigate Admiral Gorshkov, which was the first ship with cruise missiles Caliber. This frigate is designed to conduct combat operations in the near and far sea and ocean zones. The basis of its striking power is a universal ship shooting complex, which allows strikes against ground targets with long-range cruise missiles.

In the coming years, the Northern Fleet will be replenished with three nuclear missile carriers, Prince Vladimir, Prince Oleg and Prince Pozharsky, and three nuclear-powered project 885 Yasen, Kazan, Arkhangelsk and Ulyanovsk, as well as two frigates of Project 22350 - ""Admiral Kasatonov"" and ""Admiral Golovko"".

In 2018, 15 aircrafts and helicopters, 62 radar and anti-aircraft missile systems arrived in the Arctic.

The coastal missile systems ""Ball"" and ""Bastion"" appeared in service - to control territorial waters and torrential zones, protect naval bases, coastal facilities and infrastructure of the coast.

The air defense of the Russian Federation in the region is getting stronger. In 2018, a new air defense division was formed, units of which were deployed on the Novaya Zemlya archipelago, in the villages of Dikson and Tiksi. Here deployed radar, providing control of the air situation. Arctic air defense units receive the S-400 Triumph air defense missile system and the upgraded Pantsir-S1.

The complete rearmament of the coastal troops of the Russian Navy is planned to be completed by 2021. Today the share of modern weapons in military units of the Arctic region is about 60%.

Thus, Russia seeks to implement all the planned measures for the return of the army to the Arctic region, since this will allow it to provide its northern frontiers with reliable protection from land, air and water.",energy
personalfinance,Buying a laptop to learn about web development—but low on cash. Invest now or save for later?,"Hey guys long time lurker and this is my first post! I am 6 months post-graduate and have thus far deferred repayment. My federal loans are in IBR and are $0. My private loans are due soon however I have been able to defer paying them for a few months.

I will be in a situation where I won’t need to pay for housing in less than two months. 

I am working towards teaching myself the skills for web development. However my MacBook that’s almost 9 years old has died, and I need a new laptop. I’m fairly short on cash despite trying to bring in as much income as possible. I was wondering if anyone has insight on if I should buy a cheap laptop to learn on or save up and dish out the money now.

However now it's broaching 4% and I'm beginning to wonder if this makes sense.  Or at least it is 4% among the credit cards I currently have and I'd rather not open another one.

To clarify, I have more than enough funds to pay this off but I liked idea that if I invest this money I'd come out ahead.  I mostly thought this because long term return of S&amp;P500 I believe is between 7 to 10 percent.  Is my thinking on this flawed?

Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 23, a debt-free, college graduate and looking to attend flight school. I'm trying to determine which loan (type &amp; distributor) would be best for me. I currently have $5,500 in savings. I'm also looking for input regarding whether this is a sound financial decision.

The flight school I'm considering attending is [Blue-Line Aviation](https://www.bluelineaviationllc.com/), in Raleigh North Carolina. For $57,500 they offer 4 month flight training that would qualify me to be a flight instructor and eventually an airline pilot. 

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These some expected expenses for moving and supporting myself in Raleigh North Carolina. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Housing can be had for $[800 a month](https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_rent/Raleigh-NC/54047_rid/1-_beds/1-_baths/196278-245347_price/800-1000_mp/1_parking/1_laundry/36.007173,-78.403587,35.660365,-78.994102_rect/10_zm/) or maybe less if I sublease.
* Food is projected to be $[236 a month](https://smartasset.com/mortgage/the-cost-of-living-in-north-carolina). That's a 2014 number lets round up to $300 a month.
* Gas per gallon is [$2.27](https://www.gasbuddy.com/home?search=raleigh&amp;fuel=1) x 13.2 gallons.

Mazda 3 gets 27 miles to the gallon.

Thus 27 x 13.2 = 356.4 miles before refuel (11.8 days if I drive 30 miles a day) 

13.2 gallons x $ 2.27 cost per gallon = $29.964 to fill up.

* Theoretically my commute would be less than [30 miles per day](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Raleigh,+NC/Unnamed+Road,+Morrisville,+NC+27560/@35.8441291,-78.802918,16144m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m15!4m14!1m5!1m1!1s0x89ac5a2f9f51e0f7:0x6790b6528a11f0ad!2m2!1d-78.6381787!2d35.7795897!1m5!1m1!1s0x89acf0f9b3f21be7:0xaa6107803c25aa54!2m2!1d-78.7898343!2d35.8765644!3e0!5i2) 
* 30.932 fill-ups per year x $29.964 the cost of a fill-up = $926.85 per year

According to [Payscale](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Flight_Instructor/Salary) flight instructors make between 40,000 and 80,000. I've heard figures from [36,000](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Certified_Flight_Instructor/Hourly_Rate) to 50,000 for training in small aircraft. The reason the disparity is so large is because training pilots to fly large or specialized aircraft pays significantly more. It'll take me 4 months or more to start earning.  


* Lets assume a pay rate of $38,500 annually.
* [NC Flat tax](https://smartasset.com/taxes/north-carolina-tax-calculator) of 4.32% leaving me $30,911 gross after federal taxes.

  
First 8 months of 2019. (after graduation)  

I could earn $30,911(Gross)  x .6667 = $20,401.26 (first year)  

|***Expenses:*** ||***Annual Cost:*** |
|:-|:-|:-|
|Housing |800 x 12=|$9,600 |
|Food |236 x 12 = |$2,832|
|Car Fuel|30.932 fill-ups per year x $29.964 the cost of a fill-up =|$926.85 (per year)|
|Utilities|???|???|
|Health insurance|???|???|
|Clothing|???|???|
|Cost of car registration|???|???|
|**Total Costs**|13,358 - $30,911=|$17,553 (after taxes &amp; above costs)|

$13,358 - $30,911 = $17,553 Annually, after expenses+taxes. 

$1,400 x 12 months =  $16,800

$60,000 / $16,800 = 3.57 years to pay off loan (assuming 0% APR)

Assuming APR of 4% it'll take 4-5 years to pay off at 1,400 a month.

oil,Oil Continues its Rally,"#### Oil Continues its Rally

Oil prices extended their rally on Tuesday after a day of big gains on Monday as traders remained optimistic that OPEC will announce fresh production cuts after its meeting in Vienna later this week. On Monday both U.S WTI future and crude oil futures gained around 4 percent, with the rally prompted largely by the trade war ceasefire between the United States and China over the weekend, as well as expectations of a production cut. Prices for both benchmarks were both over 1 percent higher in the late afternoon in Hong Kong, with U.S. WTI futures up 1.02 percent as of 3:01 HK/SIN to trade at $52.46 per barrel. Brent was up 1.01 percent to trade at $62.31 per barrel.

In an effort to help OPEC keep prices from falling further the Canadian province of Alberta called for producers to cut output by 325,000 barrels per day until crude stockpiles are reduced. OPEC and Russia, its oil-producing ally, will need to further reduce production by 1.3 million barrels per day in order to balance out the current high inventories.

#### Dollar in Trouble

The dollar was lower on Tuesday after U.S. Treasury yields fell to three-month lows, a sign that the Federal Reserve might not raise interest rates as quickly as expected. The dollar index dropped 0.37 percent to 96.86 .DXY. Following the trade truce investors regained their interest in riskier currencies, a sentiment that did little to help the greenback. The dollar fell 0.52 percent against the yen to 113.06 and 0.14 percent against the Canadian dollar to $1.3176. It was also lower against the British pound and the euro.

btc,"An interesting question on AskHistorians(a great subreddit), illustrating the play between globalism, markets, and money","This thread got me thinking about ""banking technology"".

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7p61s8/how\_did\_the\_money\_transfer\_for\_the\_louisiana/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7p61s8/how_did_the_money_transfer_for_the_louisiana/)

I know a lot of bitcoin supports are also gold supporters.

Would a world-class gold trading platform create a better market for global transactions? Perhaps. But that was tried, and it didn't work. If  you've been following the anti-fed counter-cultural for a while you probably already have some idea why.

Consider for a moment that fiat going over the ""wire""(or telegram, or western union, or pony express, or letter, or whatever) between trusted parties of banks, can create a larger, more liquid market, than from, for example, shipping gold around the world.

Let's also note another positive aspects of ""fiat"". In addition to the ease of transferability of bank-notes, Fractional Reserve banking also lends more power to the issuer.

Perhaps you find that morally objectionable, but please don't forget that ""defense"" is a legitimate act, and remember that I am not making a moralistic argument. A gun can be used to kill Hitler or rob an old lady. What about banking as a technology? The ability to shift capital to fight wars or to save bankrupt super-banks is a benefit, if viewed from a different perspective. Whether that power is used for good or evil, is another issue.

So what is the dollar? The old issuers, regional city-banks, simply combined their power to form a Megazord of Banks, The ""Federal"" Reserve.

Does all that mean fiat is ""better"" than gold?

No. It's not so simple. The goldbugs have legitimate gripes with the current system. It sacrifices some financial sovereignty. And also, the fairness of the current system has always been questionable, even more-so in the post-2008 era.

Can we build a global economy on gold? on digital gold?

Can we build a global economy on blockchain?

personalfinance,How to help my father retire?,"Just as a forewarning this will probably be lengthy/rant-ish as I am very concerned and not all sure what factors matter myself so i'm trying to lay it out the best I can. Thanks for all the help and i'm sorry for any fluff that appears in the comment below.

My father and I have a volatile relationship and we fight very often but that doesn't change the fact that I want to help him as much as i can. He has done a lot for me growing up and despite his toxic attitude a lot of the time I can't stomach not helping him. 

To put some of his finances in perspective, he is sixty four years old and has somewhere near 55,000 saved up. Some of this is in a 401k and some in a savings account, I'm unsure of the specifics of wheres what but he will tell me upon asking. He is very open about his finances with me as I think he understands I intend to help him and i'm not stressing about inheritance or anything. He and his wife bring in about 40,000 after taxes give or take and have about 30,000 in expenses a year roughly. After going over his budget I have identified some places that severely need to be cut. He spends nearly 200 dollars on food a week, he almost never eats out and when he does he basically gets it free due to his line of work. My dad has always been known to cook very exquisite meals and doesn't like cheaping out on food but he has admitted and agreed that he needs to cut spending back considering he only cooks for him and his wife now that i've moved out. Occasionally i'll come and eat and he'll have guests over but nothing to justify the number he is spending currently. 

Apart from cutting costs i've also stressed the fact that his wife needs to start working. She has a degree in English, however it is from (And they both are) from Syria. My father has lived here for nearly 40 years at this point and his wife has lived here for closer to fifteen. Not sure if that's relevant but it is. He sends a minimal amount of money back to his family in Syria as the civil war has been hard on them and anything helps, but that maxes out around 500 a year as that is all he can really provide. His wife has about fifteen to twenty years she could work and wants to be a teacher, however she has had trouble passing the Praxis. She does fine on the English part, however curriculums in Syria are different apparently and she never focused on math so she continues to fail it. She has some anxiety about the test but is willing to try again and while I am not the best at math, I was a Civil Engineering major(I switched to History) I should be able to tutor her at least to the point of competency to pass the Praxis. With that she should be able to teach here in Louisiana for at least fifteen to twenty years, if nothing happens. She is about fifteen years younger than my father, but honestly I forgot her exact age. 

If she can get a job starting next year at the latest I think she could definitely start providing some much needed income for the family. My dad also provides me and my sister(Both college age) with money from time to time, but under the guise of trying to be financially independent I have denied a lot of his gifts as I want to help him out of this financial rut.

My dad isn't terrible with finances, outside of the food he is very very frugal (And I honestly think he doesn't spend that much on food, so i'll definitely try and get a hold of his statements to see where his spending is going more realistically.) I believe he could definitely start working to improve his situation going into retirement even if its grim at this point. 

I am almost completely financially independent from him myself, the only thing he provides for me is health insurance, he also claims me on his taxes. I have no idea if he comes out in the green from the tax refund for me v. the cost of health insurance but that just how it works right now and I don't know how to change that. 

The most glaring issue that I see is that he does not own a house. After my parents divorce he sold his home in New Orleans and moved to Baton Rouge to get closer to us, he has rented the same apartment the whole time he has been in New Orleans(Roughly 17 years or so). The apartment is bigger than he needs and he himself has admitted to possibly moving to a one room apartment now that he doesn't have to provide a living space for my sister or I but I know this would hurt him mentally as he would like to be able to provide a place for us if need be. But I digress I think he would be willing to downsize to an apartment if need be, but I was wondering if there was any options or benefits to trying to purchase a house instead. 

Just for a quick update on my napkin math as i'll be sure to get more specific numbers as i'm recalling this all from a conversation we had the other day:

40,000 after taxes
30,000 expenses a year(Good margin to cut, could potentially get this down to 23,000-25,000). 

Ideally that would leave him saving 15,000 a year and if his wife started working she would probably bring in another 35,000 a year. If they were to be very frugal with their living situation and such they could save in the ballpark of 50,000 a year. Though I do have a few questions, as to what is the best way to use this money considering he is already so old. Would it be best to max out his 401k every year and try to sit on that? He understands he cannot retire at 65 even though he wishes to do so.  

Another thing about him earning more money is I think he could definitely up his salary however I think there's some taboo surrounding that situation as he's definitely brought an insane amount of sales to his company. Due to my dads connection with a lot of people he has managed to bring in a whole new market to the company he works for, though he has seen little in terms of raises and the sense. According to him he was the only salesmen this year to not only keep his figures from last year but to raise them, he also says he has brought in nearly a million a year to the company however he could definitely be hyping up that number but considering how hard he works and the connections he has I wouldn't be surprised. He told me they told him to sign a Non Compete document or whatever, but he said no and one of the secretaries just did something with it, but never really bothered him with it again so I don't know if he's able to try and go to another company. I believe the biggest reason he doesn't negotiate too hard for a raise or anything is because he doesn't want to disrupt his customers as many of them are close friends to him who own businesses that he doesn't want to hurt but i've stressed the fact to him that he needs to focus on himself for a bit and try and negotiate a higher salary. Hopefully I can get him to do this soon. 

So to just put the numbers out one more time he is a 64 year old with 55k in savings, he and his wife currently bring in an income of 40,000 or so after taxes but by passing the Praxis she could get a teaching job which would nearly double their income. Ideally they could potentially save 50k a year or so. 

With that 50k what would be the best thing to do, try and purchase a small home? We live in Baton Rouge so there are some houses here to purchase in the 100k range that he could move to however I don't know how mortgages and all that work. Or should he just downsize to a smaller apartment and max out his 401k every year for as long as he can work or until I can provide more financial help.

Now a little about myself(Sorry again for this being so long). I am a studying History and plan to graduate in May of 2020. I intend to go to Law School, my goal school is Georgetown in Washington DC, but I may settle for a local law school depending on scholarships, etc etc. I would likely be done with law school by the time i'm 25ish if everything goes well. I hope to get a decent law job as even my secondary choice has excellent prospects when it comes to post-law school employment though I do understand that the market for lawyers is not great. I am not going into law for money, but I do think it would provide me enough to help myself and my parents when need be. I would be willing to give quite a bit to help my father retire, especially if he makes a lot of good decisions now to try and set himself up for retirement. I personally only have 2k student debt from undergraduate, through federal subsidized loans and only intend to have 8k by the time I graduate, give or take a thousand or so. Law school will obviously cost more but I am doing my best to try and qualify for as many scholarships as possible to help with that. But if I go to Law school in state i'd be looking at another 90k in debt for 3 years. 

I'm not sure how much longer he's going to be willing to work after 70 as he's already getting tired but he's a tough man so I doubt he'll buckle under the pressure but I don't really want my father working himself into a grave no matter how stubborn he is. 

Thanks again if you read all this and any and all tips I can get at this point I appreciate!

I have 8 groups of students loans totaling $21K remaining. The avalanche method says to pay the minimums on all 8 loans, with whatever extra I'm paying going to the one with the highest interest rate. That said, what should I do in the case below?

Loan Group 2 has about $1,800 remaining at about a 6% interest rate while Loan Group 6 has about $4,400 remaining at about a 4% interest rate. Avalanche says to pay off Loan Group 2 due to the higher interest rate, but isn't Loan Group 6 accruing more interest? My mind is saying I should pay off Loan Group 6 first, until it reaches an equilibrium point where the accrued interest is the same as Loan Group 2's. Am I overthinking it?",finance

personalfinance,Feel like I'm underpaid and not sure which route to go.,"I work contracted security in Chicago and feel that I'm underpaid and don't foresee being able to negotiate a raise due to the fact that I'm a low level manager.  The company I work for does not have very good benefits; I'm ""salary"" but it is prorated, so I only make what I work, salary comes out to $15 an hour.  Any hours I put in over 40 I only receive $14 an hour for and due to shortages I'm stuck into working at least 48 hours a week.  No 401k benefits and HR has not been getting back to me about Health Insurance Benefits.  I've been applying for jobs with the Federal Government, State, and other private and public entities; have probably applied for roughly 10 jobs within the past few weeks and besides going through a slow process with two Federal positions haven't heard anything from any of the other applications I sent out.  

I recently got moved to a different location for my job to help out with staff shortages and now am stuck working the overnight shift and I seriously hate it due to there being nothing to do, I actually enjoy working and staying busy and having nothing going on makes it so difficult to want to come into work each day.  I do have a part time job that I work on weekends but unfortunately cannot work during the week to make extra money since all the shifts are at night. 

I'm starting to feel unmotivated and stressed out and not sure where to go from here.  Each day that passes that I don't hear back from a job offer chips away a little more at my enthusiasm to work and the only reason I honestly haven't gone through  with my consideration of just leaving my job is due to wanting to save up money to move out of my parents house but my limited income makes me feel like I'm barely making progress at my goal.

Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 23, a debt-free, college graduate and looking to attend flight school. I'm trying to determine which loan (type &amp; distributor) would be best for me. I currently have $5,500 in savings. I'm also looking for input regarding whether this is a sound financial decision.

The flight school I'm considering attending is [Blue-Line Aviation](https://www.bluelineaviationllc.com/), in Raleigh North Carolina. For $57,500 they offer 4 month flight training that would qualify me to be a flight instructor and eventually an airline pilot. 

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These some expected expenses for moving and supporting myself in Raleigh North Carolina. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Housing can be had for $[800 a month](https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_rent/Raleigh-NC/54047_rid/1-_beds/1-_baths/196278-245347_price/800-1000_mp/1_parking/1_laundry/36.007173,-78.403587,35.660365,-78.994102_rect/10_zm/) or maybe less if I sublease.
* Food is projected to be $[236 a month](https://smartasset.com/mortgage/the-cost-of-living-in-north-carolina). That's a 2014 number lets round up to $300 a month.
* Gas per gallon is [$2.27](https://www.gasbuddy.com/home?search=raleigh&amp;fuel=1) x 13.2 gallons.

Mazda 3 gets 27 miles to the gallon.

Thus 27 x 13.2 = 356.4 miles before refuel (11.8 days if I drive 30 miles a day) 

13.2 gallons x $ 2.27 cost per gallon = $29.964 to fill up.

* Theoretically my commute would be less than [30 miles per day](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Raleigh,+NC/Unnamed+Road,+Morrisville,+NC+27560/@35.8441291,-78.802918,16144m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m15!4m14!1m5!1m1!1s0x89ac5a2f9f51e0f7:0x6790b6528a11f0ad!2m2!1d-78.6381787!2d35.7795897!1m5!1m1!1s0x89acf0f9b3f21be7:0xaa6107803c25aa54!2m2!1d-78.7898343!2d35.8765644!3e0!5i2) 
* 30.932 fill-ups per year x $29.964 the cost of a fill-up = $926.85 per year

According to [Payscale](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Flight_Instructor/Salary) flight instructors make between 40,000 and 80,000. I've heard figures from [36,000](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Certified_Flight_Instructor/Hourly_Rate) to 50,000 for training in small aircraft. The reason the disparity is so large is because training pilots to fly large or specialized aircraft pays significantly more. It'll take me 4 months or more to start earning.  


* Lets assume a pay rate of $38,500 annually.
* [NC Flat tax](https://smartasset.com/taxes/north-carolina-tax-calculator) of 4.32% leaving me $30,911 gross after federal taxes.

  
First 8 months of 2019. (after graduation)  

I could earn $30,911(Gross)  x .6667 = $20,401.26 (first year)  

|***Expenses:*** ||***Annual Cost:*** |
|:-|:-|:-|
|Housing |800 x 12=|$9,600 |
|Food |236 x 12 = |$2,832|
|Car Fuel|30.932 fill-ups per year x $29.964 the cost of a fill-up =|$926.85 (per year)|
|Utilities|???|???|
|Health insurance|???|???|
|Clothing|???|???|
|Cost of car registration|???|???|
|**Total Costs**|13,358 - $30,911=|$17,553 (after taxes &amp; above costs)|

$13,358 - $30,911 = $17,553 Annually, after expenses+taxes. 

$1,400 x 12 months =  $16,800

$60,000 / $16,800 = 3.57 years to pay off loan (assuming 0% APR)

Assuming APR of 4% it'll take 4-5 years to pay off at 1,400 a month.

gaming,"The current state of games, and game development","Most of us can attest that certain games that have been released the last year or two have been underwhelming at best. Everywhere we look almost every other AAA game that gets released has a major PR plunder or is released in an unfinished state. I will attempt to discuss why I think this is below.


First, we will start off with a few definitions:

Minimum Viable Product - A minimum viable product (MVP) is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers, and to provide feedback for future product development.


Time Value of Money - The time value of money or TVM, assumes a dollar in the present is worth more than a dollar in the future because of variables such as inflation and interest rates. The later money is received, the less value it holds, and $1 today is worth more than $1 received at a date in the future.


Now that we have defined two concepts critical to both investment and development, let us look at an example and discuss how these concepts affected their development. I will then go into why companies love pre-ordering, and why you should never do it.


[Ubisoft] Rainbow 6 Siege (2015): Rainbow 6 Siege is a Tom Clancy game released by Ubisoft Montreal in December of 2015. Since then it has grown into one of the most popular shooters that hundreds of thousands of gamers play monthly. Rainbow 6 is in a good state now, however, it was not all rainbows and roses. When the game released in December of 2015 it was objectively unplayable due to game breaking hit registration issues, unbalanced game play mechanics, server degradation and support, and worst of all, cheaters. Ubisoft Montreal released Rainbow 6 Siege knowing that all of these had the potential to exist in the form they released it in, this game was tested throughout an Alpha and Beta in which many of these issues were brought up and were never remedied. As per usual, the alpha and beta were used as a play test and marketing scheme to get people to pre-order or buy the game when it comes out. So, let’s talk about how the concepts I brought up relate to this game.


I’ll start off with MVP. Ubisoft Montreal knowingly failed to complete their game and released it in an unfinished and untested state, so they could begin profiting off their work that they had already done. 2 months after the game was released, their first season started. In this season they fixed some issues such has hit registration, but others persisted such as widespread cheating and server degradation. Since Season 1, Ubisoft Montreal has deployed 11 seasons all with new bug fixes and updates. One of these seasons, Operation Health, specifically focused on the games unfinished state and attempted a crack at fixing most of the underlying backend issues with this game. The issue with this, is that Operation Health came out as the 6th season, a full year and a half after the game was initially released. Ubisoft Montreal released this game, in a hope that they could profit enough to fix it with long term updates. This is the very definition of MVP. It worked for them, but it doesn't work for most games, see Fallout 76.


Why is this bad you may ask? This is bad because game companies are consistently releasing games in unfinished states, and in some cases, never get fixed because of how unfinished they are.

Now we will discuss TVM. TVM is essential to both MVP and pre-ordering. First ill discuss why TVM is a key factor in MVP. Let’s go back to our Rainbow 6 example. When the game released, it released as a full 60-dollar game in a very broken state. Let’s say that you bought this game in December of 2015. The game was then at a 'playable' state a full year and a half later after Operation health was deployed. However, TVM is not just visible and factors in time investment. Had Rainbow 6 not released when it did, Ubisoft would have lost 1 and a half years’ worth of profits on the game which they could have invested in other projects or re-invested in the game for updates. What we see with a lot of games that use this MVP strategy, is that they do not re-invest in their game, but instead, scrap the project, and invest in other projects. This also factors into pre-orders. The reason companies want you to pre-order their games, and the reason they use digital incentives to do so, is because while their digital incentive may have cost them 48 man hours, your 60 dollars (times the amount of people that pre-order) is worth a lot more in investment potential now, than 6 months when the game comes out. 

How does this effect you? This affects you because your 60 dollars has that same investment potential. You could hold off on pre-ordering, forego the digital incentive, and invest that money in other things that have potential to have gains (house, stocks, etc.). You could then buy that game as a discretionary purchase (no potential for gain) when it comes out and keep your TVM gains.


TLDR; MVP can work, but it leads to a unfinished and buggy product when initially released which then has the potential to be worked on and improved once the funding is secured through re-investment. However, many times funding is not secured through re-investment, and the projects are scrapped. MVP is not good for the games industry, and not good for gamers. 


Also, do not pre-order, you are effectively losing money every time you pre-order a game.",technology

[I'm a 20 year old sophomore in college studying computer science and am about to receive an offer from a Connecticut tech company I've been working at](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/a3255y/advice_on_my_current_situation/). My company is preparing an offer for me that I expect to be around $70,000 before taxes and additionally supplement the costs to finish my degree.

&amp;#x200B;

I mentioned in my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/a3255y/advice_on_my_current_situation/) on /r/cscareerquestions that I plan to finish school part time and have my schooling payed for as part of my offer. I then want to apply to grad school to get an MBA and open up the opportunity to be a tech company exec given my strong soft skills and experience in the field. By 25 I will have 5 years of competitive startup experience, a Computer Science BS, and an MBA from hopefully a top school.

&amp;#x200B;

Given I expect the offer to be around $70,000, before taxes, what is my best approach to saving?

* I have $30,000 in federal and private student loan debt.
* I don't have a car (I also intend to pay for my own car insurance).
* I can live at home with my parents rent free.
* I have very few expenses in general.

&amp;#x200B;

I obviously want to minimise taxes, aggressively pay off student loans, and max out any saving options while also factoring in the cost of grad school in approximately 3-4 years.

&amp;#x200B;

I will post an update when I formally receive the offer because that is a significant factor.

personalfinance,Extra Mortgage Payments Worth It?,"There's an AskReddit post about how $10,000 would affect your life right now, and one of the commenters noted it's not usually financially beneficial to pay down your house early when you could be investing that money instead. That's actually exactly what I've been doing and now I'm wondering if it's all been a big blunder. Using online calculators he seems to be wrong, but I'm not sure if I'm thinking about this correctly.


**Here are the details of my mortgage:**

Mortgage:$260,000 (30 year)

Interest rate: 3.5%

Payments started: 11/01/12

Additional payments: $4712 per year (started 12/01/2015)



**Calculators say:**

Total paid by end: $420,304

Total paid by end w/ additional payments: $367,733

Savings:$52,570 (and loan paid 9 years, 9 months early)



**If instead I put those payments into an S&amp;P 500 Index fund:**

$4712 per year over 17 year period (remaining loan life w/ additional payments)

Estimating ~7%ROI = $119,260 (Taxable)



**To calculate my earnings I minus my investment:**

$119,260-(4712*17)=$39,156



So from these calculations it looks like either I save $52,570 on the loan, or earn $39,156 on investing it. Isn't it better to put this toward the loan then as that's the higher amount?


**Edit:**
Appreciate all the suggestions, calculations, and perspectives here. 


I realize risks are inherent to uncertain investments like stocks and funds, but just because there are risks doesn't mean you shouldn't consider them. To cover the bases, I have enough liquid funds to cover living expenses ICE for more than a year. 401k is close to maxed out and I just recently started contributing toward a roth IRA. No outstanding debt other than the mortgage loan.

That said I did some recalculating based on contributions starting now:
Remaining Mortgage Balance: $201,348
Estimated Payoff:August 2038
Monthly Payments: $1178

2 Different Scenarios:

A) Extra principal payments($4712 per year starting 12/01/19), after loan paid invest mortgage payments + extra principal until 2038 when loan would have originally ended 

B) Minimum payments, invest $4712 per year from now until 2038

A1) $18848 per year, 6 years, 7%ROI = $134,825

B1) $4712 per year, 20 years, 7%ROI = $178331 (15% gains tax already deducted)

A2) $18848 per year, 6 years, 3%ROI = $126,613

B2) $4712 per year, 20 years, 3%ROI = $117765 (15% gains tax already deducted)

If the market performs below it's past 30 year average (11.8%ROI), at 7% investing in the market looks to be better. If it performs horribly low ~3%ROI then putting the money towards the loan would be better. Just based on these numbers and my safety nets it feels like investing the funds in an index fund rather than the loan seems to be better.",finance
personalfinance,Question about buying a house and the current state of the economy,"Hello guys.  I have a couple questions regarding buying a house in today's current economy.  Here are a couple things before we get started.  

\-  I read a lot of market forecasts, but I don't invest.  I have an ""Acorns"" account and that is the extent of my investing.  

\-  I have a decent income and just got approved for an $804k home loan (20% down; \~168k required).  

\-  I live in the Bay Area (hence why the home loan approval is so high) 

Anyway, I have been looking at the housing market for about 7 months now.  I haven't found a place that is relatively affordable.  Just a couple days ago, I read that the U.S. Yield curve just inverted, meaning we could be going into recession and the interest rates may sky rocket. 

My questions are...

\-  Is it ""smart"" to buy a house soon?  

\-  Is it better to buy a house before the forecasted recession, during, or after?  

\-  If I proceeded to buy a house, would it be better to lock into a fixed rate or going with the variable, all factors of the economy considered?  

Currently, I'm renting an apartment ($1800 a month; market 'standard' for the area I live) but if I just shell out another \~2-3 thousand, I could be living in my own house.   I have put aside enough in my savings to offset any future emergency costs.  My job stability is excellent.  Unless I mess up royally, I will not lose my job.  

I've never bought a house before but any other tips and tricks to buying would be greatly appreciated.  As stated before, I have been gearing up to buy a house for quite some time, but the market volatility kind of has me worried.  I don't mind staying in the apartment I am currently at, but again, I would rather have a house.

personalfinance,"Should I consider a weighted interest rate when repaying debt, or should I just prioritize accounts with the highest APR?","I'm trying my best to tackle a huge amount of debt and I want to make the best decisions possible. I know that accounts with the highest APR are charged the highest interest rates per year but I also have some accounts with very high principals (student loans) that I end up paying more interest on each year despite having lower APRs. Can someone please help me understand why I should or shouldn't pay the highest APRs first?

My account balances are below:

&amp;#x200B;

|Account|Balance|APR|Weight of Total Debt|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Credit Card 1|$0|25.74%|0.00%|

|Totals|$215,698.02||100%|

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming a simple interest rate and no payments made per year (I know that's bad math, just trying to simplify things for the explanation of why I started questioning repayment strategies):

|Account|Interest Accrued Annually|
|:-|:-|
|Credit Card 1|$0|

|Student Loan 2|$3,739.36|
|Student Loan 3|$1,027.23|
|Student Loan 4|$857.61|
|Totals|$17,019.36|

Based upon the above, again I know the math isn't correct based on what's really happening with the accounts but I hope it explains my thought process, I'm paying the most interest annually to my Student Loan 1, despite Credit Card 4 having the highest interest rate.

&amp;#x200B;

Does it make any sense to pay towards the accounts that accrue the highest annual interest charges first due to their high principals or should I just stick to prioritizing the highest APRs?

&amp;#x200B;

I hope that makes some sense and I'm sorry if it's a silly question. I'm calculating to be debt free within 3.5 years based on current income but I really would like to minimize how much interest I have to pay during that period.

financialindependence,Taking out a HELOC during recession to invest a good or bad decision?,"I value the opinions of those in this community as it relates to investing in an intelligent manor so I thought this would be an interesting topic/question to bring to the group. Most posts I've seen about mortgages relate to paying off early so this essentially doing the opposite. I think this does relate to FI because if it works you could FIRE earlier than if you didn't take this approach.

With all the talk about a potential/likely recession in the next few years, I've been thinking about drawing on a HELOC (home equity line of credit) to invest the proceeds when the market is at somewhat of a low point. My thinking is that if I can take a HELOC loan of say $100K at an interest rate of say 3-4%, the market is likely to perform far better than that AFTER a recession. I'm basing this opinion on market returns after the tech bubble in the early 2000s and the mortgage crisis around 2008. After those recessions, the market performed very well. I haven't considered all details but here is my thinking at a very basic level:

$100k HELOC
Interest at 4%/year= $4K interest expense
Invest $100K in some Vanguard ETFs/Mutual Funds
Investment returns are likely to be over 5% and possibly well over. So say a minimum annual return of $5K with a max of maybe 15%=$15K.

As you can see, you would come out ahead with even modest returns of 5%. Obviously, this is dependent on when you actually invest in the market and whether it's at a truly low point or somewhere between the low and high point. And of course, there's risk involved too in case you time the market wrong and actually lose money you invest AND have to pay the interest on the loan.

I'm wondering the following from members of this community
a) Have you actually done this in the past and what were the results (gain/loss, how much?)?
b) Do you plan to do this after/during the next recession
c)  Any other general thoughts or critique of my logic. Is it a good idea or foolish/too risky?",finance

personalfinance,How to shop for private health insurance,"I've had private insurance since before the passage of the ACA due to being self-employed. When I first enrolled nine years ago, my monthly premium was around $180 and my deductible was $2500. In order to keep my plan I've had to endure increases which have resulted in a monthly premium of almost $270 and a deductible which has risen to $7500. 

I've tried the government healthcare exchange, however the cheapest plans are more expensive, have a higher deductible, and are EPO plans. I currently have a PPO plan with UHC, which no longer sells individual plans in my state (only short-term plans). I also do not qualify for any federal help with premiums.  

Now that it is only possible to shop for health insurance during the enrollment period, I am worried I will get another letter at the beginning of next year notifying me of further premium increases and being forced to accept an even higher deductible since I will be out of the enrollment period and thus unable to shop for new insurance. 

I looked around a bit last year but it seems that since the ACA was implemented insurers have fled the market in my state and it is very difficult to shop for private insurance on my own. It looks like I may have to find an insurance agent to go through now but I am highly suspicious of them and don't even know where to start to find a decent one. I tried using an internet search to help point me in the right direction and maybe find some reddit topics, messageboard posts or blogposts with info but the results were all just websites that ask for your information, which I'm guessing is forwarded to agents who will then start bombarding you with calls and emails. 

Could anyone with recent experience shopping for private insurance provide me with some advice or tips? I feel completely overwhelmed and am just trying to find a decent plan. I'm under 40, non-smoker, have had no serious illnesses or accidents, visit a physician maybe 2-3 times a year including yearly physicals, and am not on any sort of medication or treatments for any medical issues. I don't plan on getting seriously ill, but would like to have the peace of mind of having decent healthcare coverage in case something were to happen.",finance

Credit went down to 628. Started trying to fix it on top of paying off my car(500/mo) which I bought as part of the company deal when they hired me, paying medical bills (250/mo) which were high during that time because relationship had physical abuse and I had broken bones, other credit cards (200/mo), various insurance fees (450/mo), phone (150/mo), and of course rent(900/mo). I was doing okay until the middle of this year when the company I was working for stopped operating. Since then my source of income has been fluctuating (due to visa issues that restricted me from obtaining a new job without sponsorship, and in the small town I was in there were no other facilities that did sponsorship anymore). 

Fast forward to November. Got my green card, moved to Chicago. I have managed to keep paying for all my bills from savings (minus rent), and had also used money for the move. If I hadn’t lost my job, my car will have been paid off by March but I had missed 2 months of payments now. I got a job and will start in the middle of December.

personalfinance,Refinancing my home,"My husband and I purchased a home in rural Kentucky in 2009. At the time of purchase, we bought the home for $68,500. It was a good price for a 3 bedroom, 1.5 bath brick ranch-style home in rural Kentucky.

personalfinance,House paid off at 34 now what?,"Hello all,

My first time to posting here. I have always been a believer in paying off current debt due to most debt that we currently have will hit us at a higher interest rate than most investments we are investing in for the future.

When I turned 29 I fell into debt as I bought a townhouse and I moved it for the first time. I also started my Master's degree as well. My house was only 91k at the time. An opportunity jumped out at me to do overseas military contracting. I was offered a position to make over 100k+ tax free with my housing paid for, car paid, and food as we are allowed to eat in the dining facility for free as well. Fast forward several years later and I paid off all my debt and am a mere few month from paying my entire balance of my house off.

I never dreamed I would have this paid off as quickly as I have and all the articles I've read about what to do post-mortgage all center around individuals in their 50s. While I am old at 34 I still feel I have alot of working years left in me. And I also plan to stay working overseas making tax free money for quite some time at least until I'm about 40. 

I tried the Airbnb for a few years but now I'm going to go an actual regular rental since my house rents for around $1350/month. With all that being said and the final boss of the mortgage is defeated I'm trying to find ideas of what to do next. I don't want to just have money stacking up doing nothing. I don't really know much about investing other than my 401k which I've maxed out.

So I was coming here to gain some insights on what other things I can do now that I have paid off all my debt and mortgage will be fully paid off soon. Also I will continue to work abroad so my situation will remain the same in which I have no federal tax liability and my accommodation is going to be taken care of as well.

personalfinance,Does buying a car make sense?,"This is more out of curiosity and wanting your opinion. 

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory: In 2013 I got in trouble financially because of underemployment and debt. I had a foreclosure and some other issues too. But I was able to find a good job with decent pay soon after the bad year and a half. Right after I got my new job my car died and I had to buy another one. I bought used, but the interest rate that I got financed for was/is outrageous (22% if you must know). But I needed a car and the payment was do-able. The fact that I had reliable transportation was the most important thing for me and one less worry on my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

That brings me to today. I am re-building credit at a pretty good clip and we are saving; possibly looking at buying a house if it makes sense in the next year. 

&amp;#x200B;

that brings me to now. I got pre-approved through Capital One for a car loan. I didn't request the pre-approval they just sent it to me. It is for a rate of 5% interest. I didn't think anything of it, just a thought; oh that's nice. Good to know if I needed to buy a car I could get a much better rate. Of course, I owe more than my car is worth. But it is reliable and has pretty low miles. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I was just bored and started playing with car payment calculators. I could get a much newer/nicer car plus adding what I owe on my current car and the payment would still be about 40 bucks less a month that I am currently paying. That is just based on the pre-approval loan. I could possibly get a better rate than that.

&amp;#x200B;

So from a monthly cost perspective, it makes sense. but will it kill my credit? Basically closing a 5-year old loan that is 2/3 paid off versus a new loan. I also looked at re-financing my current car loan, but there are only 2 years left on the loan. The banks I looked at won't refinance for that little time.

financialindependence,"My co-worker posted a retirement/FI email today. Whether or not he knows he is FIRE-ING is unknown, but his email is interesting. Nothing you probably don't already know, but nice to see it happen.","After 13+ years at Company\_X, 36 years in the industry, my wife and I plan to retire early. This will be my last week at Company\_X. Thanks for all the advice and thought-provoking discussions from the investing community.

Some folks have asked how we are able to retire early. Here is a brief summary of the steps we took to retire early, in no particular order:

1. We lived below our means. Stayed cognizant of lifestyle creep and kept our expenses well below our income.
2. We paid off debt early. All loans and mortgages were paid off before they were due.
3. We saved diligently. Maxed out 401Ks, Roth IRAs, HSA, catch-up contributions and ESPP.
4. We invested wisely. Bought and held low-cost passive index funds with no active trading. We don't follow or invest in \[individual stocks/Bitcoin/gold/options/whatever\] at all.

The plan going forward is to use some low income years to take advantage of low tax rates i.e. a marginal tax rate of 12% and a long-term capital gains tax rate of 0%.

One final thought: Some investors use an active investment strategy and need to continuously analyze balance sheets, business cycles, interest rates, weekly economic numbers, quarterly earnings report, year-end mutual fund summaries, market trends, global economies, standard deviations, ten-day moving average trend lines, sector fund rotations and then track emerging markets growth, small-cap micro tech, large-cap blue chip, mid-cap health care, etc. You get the point.

Instead of an active investment strategy, we found that a passive investment strategy worked for us. I wished an old geezer had given us this advice many years ago:

Finishing up residency soon with $50k in the bank and $320k (6% interest rate) in med school loans. I'll make ~$196k post-tax next year. I spend $3k/month now and live comfortably as it is so I do not plan on dramatically increasing lifestyle until after another 2-3 years or so. Age 29, no wife, no kids. 

I was thinking of putting $100k/yr towards loans and using $50k for savings/stocks/lifestyle creep. Does this sound reasonable or should I be even more aggressive with paying things back? 

EDIT: Thank you all for the replies, sincerely. I will refinance my loans ASAP and pick up the white coat investor.",finance
personalfinance,Created myself a financial mess over the past year. What should I do next?,"Over the past year, I've had ongoing health issues that led me to take a few months off which turned into many more than anticipated. It has taken some time to pick up new projects. During that time, I racked up quite a bit of debt in bad forms – credit card and tax debt. Here is what I have going on.

**Debts**

* \~$10k credit cards
* $28k Tax Debt :(
* $9k car loan $528/month @ \~2.2% APR
* $7k motorcycle loan $220/month @ 4.5% APR
* $12k student loans @ various interest rates

**Monthly expenses**

* Rent: $1575 (includes gas, electric, internet, etc.)
   * The only way I will find something significantly cheaper is if I move in with roommates or outside of the city.
* Health Insurance: $225
* Auto/motorcycle insurance: $200
* Food: too much but started eating at home nearly all meals.

Prior to this, I never had any credit card or tax debt and it is ruining all of my focus. In this situation, what would you do? My first thought is to sell my car and take the \~$20k in equity and buy a cheaper car. Getting rid of the motorcycle would be tough since it is one of the few hobbies I do have. I just started bringing in about $2,000 a week and that could increase between $3-4k shortly. My typical income was around $120k the past two years. This past year it has been about 50% of that. Do I start selling things or just ride this out?",finance

personalfinance,Is it smart to pay off a credit card with another credit card?,I have a chase card that’s had a 0% APR rate but it goes up to 20% in March and I have enough space available on my Bank of America card to transfer the balance with a lower interest rate on my other card. But I’m not sure if that’s a smart move or not. I don’t know too much about the ins and outs of credit cards. I don’t want it to affect my credit score but I also don’t want to pay a stupid amount in interest.,finance
personalfinance,Where do I start with my student loans?,"I recently started my first real job and I’m starting to get a handle on the world of budgeting and personal finance. However, I have around $28,000 in student loan debt that will soon all begin accruing interest, and I am looking for the best place to start on managing this debt with a few things in mind. 

First of all, I will soon receive an inheritance from a deceased family member of around $18,000.

The debt amount is made up of several small loans (around 6 or 7) with interest rates ranging from 3.6 to 5%. $18k of the debt is already accruing interest, while $10k of is still in the grace period until February.

1) should I pay off as much of the debt as possible with the inherited amount?
2) should I pay a portion and save/invest the rest? If so, how do I figure out how much?
3) is there value to paying off specific loans? As in, would it be of benefit my credit to pay off individual ones or is only paying off the entire debt of benefit? 

Thanks for any advice you can offer! If there’s anything I should consider that your average new graduate may not be aware of here, please let me know!",finance

personalfinance,Should I sell my house in SoCal?,"Ok, so my house I currently live in, I paid $260,000 for. Zillow now has its zestimate at around $500,000. With the rising interest rates, I’m getting worried about another home loan bursting bubble, only because I got burned back in 2008 on a new home that I also bought cheap and saw it almost double in value before i had to quickly short sale. 

Now I’m not too savvy on the real estate market, but I was wondering if I should sell now, rent for a while, and buy again later if the market does drop. 

Do any of the experts here think that another 2008 is in the near future?

Thanks in advance

Edit: Thank you all for your input. I guess I just needed to hear it from others. I do love my house. It’s in a great neighborhood, and about 1.5 miles from work. I do not think it will ever go below what I bought it at but a few of you pointed something out to me...don’t gamble with my only home. This opened my eyes. Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,Any advice for 401K investing?,"I'm 36. Not planning to officially retire until 67. I haven't saved a dime for retirement, however.

I get paid bi-weekly. A ""regular"" work schedule for me is flip-flop weeks with 12-hour shifts. 4 days (48 hours) one week and 3 days (36 hours) the next. They pay for the 8 hours of overtime every other week as part of the schedule. On that schedule, I make about $1,254 bi-weekly before taxes. Not a ""lot"" of money, but I'm really frugal. I'm in a unique position in that I'm taking care of a family member and live in a house, but my ""rent"" is more so helping pay the bills, buy gas, buy groceries, etc. I'm not a mooch by any means.

If I worked 4 days on both weeks, that's $1,480 bi-weekly.

If I worked 5 days for both weeks, that is 40 hours combined of overtime for both weeks. That's just under $2,000 before taxes. I'm single, file 1 federal allowance and one state allowance as recommended on the forms, so I never owe at tax time and always get a little back.

The company has 401K. No match, however. It says in the employee handbook that the board of directors can decide to give a match or not. HR told me that in 18 months, they have never seen the company match contributions. So anyway, we're assuming no match. I like the company and plan to stay with them for a long time. Decent pay and I'm gaining valuable experience for any future jobs should I decide to leave years down the road.

The company handbook says you can contribute from 0% - 80% of your pay. Most companies limit at like 10%. I ""think"" the limit is like $5,500 a year for 401K contributions tax-wise. So it looks like $211 contribution per bi-weekly pay period would be my max before they would start penalizing me. I'm not sure I want to save that much just yet. If I did 10% for an average pay rate, it would be about $3,550 a year. Estimates using 7% returns put that at $520,000 at age 67. That's about $150 every two weeks. Even more if I had it set for 10% and worked a lot of overtime to meet the max contribution each year. Sometimes overtime is actually mandatory and assigned whether you want it or not.

How ""much"" should I begin with?",finance
investing,Transfer IRA from TD Ameritrade,"I have a Traditional IRA with TD with only a nominal amount of money.  I dislike the UI and don't plan on adding anything further.  However I just got a job with the federal government and believe I can transfer a Traditional IRA into my new TSP which would be great.

The TDA full transfer fee is $75, which is actually a pretty large percentage of what I have in there.  This doesn't seem worth it.  However you can apparently do PARTIAL transfers for free.  AND I see nothing about minimum balances listed (you can probably see where I'm going with this).

Am I reading this right? This seems to me a GAPING loophole to avoid such a fee.",finance

personalfinance,Can I pay off a consolidated loan early?,"First off I am from the US and these are federal student loans so the consolidation is free. 

All of the fine print on the consolidation application (studentloans.gov) has me a little nervous. If I owe just over 20k, and I make over 3x the estimated monthly payments am I going to be on the hook the the additional interest if I consolidate? Thus far, when I have paid off one of the loan accounts it closes and I don't have to worry about it any further. 


E.g. loan servicer estimates I'll pay not quite twice the amount I owe if it takes me 20-30 years to pay it off. Are they somehow entitled to that interest if I pay early?


Consolidation appeals to me because of the fixed rate, but even then it says ""in some cases, you *may* switch from a variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate"" (emphasis mine). Is there not a guarantee for a fixed rate then? Has anyone here been stuck on a variable rate after consolidation?",finance

personalfinance,"I’m paying down my student loans aggressively while I live at home. I’m at the point where I have enough in personal savings to pay them off. Should I do it, or is there a benefit to continuing my payments?","If I continue making my payments the way I’m making them, I anticipate having them paid off 100% in the next six months anyway. My average interest rate is 3.86%. Is there any benefit to me continuing the payments, or would paying them off in one fell swoop be better (with the obvious avoiding interest benefit)?

I’d also like to buy a house in the next year and a half. So my goal is to pay them off and then save as aggressively as I’ve been paying off my debt for a down payment. I have little to no consumer debt, so that isn’t a concerning factor.

If I use my savings, I have nothing. My car is 18 years old, and in need of repairs more frequently. So my savings has been my “emergency car/life fund.” I’m afraid to lose that. That would be the major downside to me.

I feel like the answer is obvious, but I just want to hear others’ opinions.",finance

I make $55,000 a year before taxes. I have 2 credit cards, 1 car loan through my local bank, and a student loan through the government. I have $28,000 of student loan debt, with approximately 4.4% interest rate (multiple loan types through the same servicer, with different rates averaging out to 4.4% for the total balance) and a minimum payment of $256. My Car loan has  $29,500 remaining with an interest rate of 4.25% and a minimum payment of $510. My credit cards are a bit of a mess due to a dire situation towards the end of my last semester and are at $1047 (Discover card, Minimum payment usually around $50) and $1398 (Chase, still in intro 0% APR for another 7 months, Similar minimum to Discover) This is a combined utilization rate of 40% (It's going down every month!)

It should be noted that I have NO housing costs as I live with my family, as they told me to worry about paying off my debts before I consider incurring housing expenses.

Costs I do have: 

Gas - $140/month estimate (I drive a good distance to work)

Food - I chip in around $140 to family food budget each month

Insurance - My father chose to take care of my care insurance for at least a few more months

Other - My father and I are purchasing a home from a good friend to renovate it and I pay about $300/month towards it.

I have never been particularly great when it comes to financial literacy but have been managing my debt fairly well thus far (no missed payments, always at least double paying but often more).

My question is this: what would be the best course of action financially in my situation? I am wondering how much I should pay towards each debt per month vs saving, etc. If you need any more details feel free to ask as I'm not really sure what information would be most helpful.

Here's my situation:

I'm currently a sophomore receiving a state scholarship and ROTC  scholarship. This in total pays for my tuition and fees and room and  board. I currently receive an ROTC stipend of $350 a month, but I plan  to use this to pay for the car, gas, and car insurance.

I don't know  if this matters/ helps my chances but for the past three semesters, I've  taken out federal loans to pay for my room and board money until my  scholarship reimbursed me and I have payed all of those loans back in  full. I checked Credit Karma and it says my credit score is 698. I'm  also guaranteed a good paying job after graduation through ROTC.

personalfinance,"Have a large amount of savings and in a good spot financially, and want to position myself and my wife to be in the best spot possible in about a year to start a family - best plan to tackle student loan debt?","Straight to the basics - the rough numbers look like the following:  
  

 - $51k in liquid savings. 
  
 - About $45k in investment accounts. 
  
 - $90k salary across two jobs, no student loans (me)/$50k salary, $60k student loans (wife) (undergraduate and masters).  
  
 - Own our home (total monthly expenses roughly $3k).  
  
 - No car payments, own both of our daily drivers outright.  
  
%nbsp;  
  
I recently got back from an overseas deployment which allowed us to pay off the remaining balance on both our vehicles and any other smaller debt that we had, leaving us with a good amount of cash in savings and pretty much just our mortgage, monthly living expenses, and my wife's student loans as debt.   
  
We want to start a family in a little over a year, during which time I would like to pay off her student loans completely/as much as possible.   
  
Right now I'm contemplating keeping half of our savings account as our emergency fund ($25k, approximately 6 months of expenses for us) and throw the other half at her student loans now - And then pay off the remaining $35k over the course of the year using her salary.   
  
The interest rates on her loans is between 6.8-8%.  
  
We both work in steady fields with solid job security, although she will switch to only working limited part time once we have a kid.   
  
Am I missing something here? Would it be smarter to invest the savings and take more time to pay off the student loans? Look at re-financing? I'm torn between having more of a buffer in cash savings and knocking a solid chunk off the loan debt right now. I think my emergency fund at this point might be overkill, but I've been conditioned over time to always be stressed about not having enough saved and it makes making large purchases difficult for me, or even just being able to enjoy spending the money we do have on home improvement projects or vacations, etc.

personalfinance,Does it make sense to take out new federal loans (US) to pay off my higher interest private loans?,"I have ~48K in student loan debt from undergrad. One of my federal loans is for ~2.8K and is at 6.8% APR (not sure why it’s so high) and I have a $10K private loan with variable interest rate, currently about 8%. 

I’m now enrolled in a PhD program and my understanding is that I’m eligible to take out new federal loans at a lower interest rate than the two aforementioned loans. I don’t want to refinance with a private institution right now because I want to hold on to my deferment options, which I’m currently taking advantage of because I would struggle to make minimum payments with my stipend (I’m currently focusing on building my emergency fund). 

So is my thinking correct here? Can I lower my interest rates by taking out new federal loans to pay off my other loans (and gain better repayment options by replacing my private loan with federal loans)? Thanks in advance for your help.",finance

personalfinance,Screwed myself buying a car,"I bought a used car recently. The dealership showed me a car for $12,000 and then after tax fees and dealership fees, it was $14,000 for a car worth $11,500. I negotiated down to $12,800 OTD. I was happy with paying the premium because this was the only car within 250 miles that had the color scheme that I wanted. I agreed to the $12,800 OTD with a $5,000 down payment and told them I need to finance the rest. They said ""ok np, the best we can do is 54 months at 205/Month at 10.51% and we can call you in a couple of days to refinance and see if we can lower your interest rate. I agreed thinking I was going into this loan owing $5,000 less but we actually negotiated a price to get me financed. They changed the price of the car to $16,800 and financed me $11,300 and I signed on it without reading like an absolute fucking idiot.

I went into the office thinking I was getting a 54\*205+10.51% Interest=$13,941 loan with $5,000 already paid towards it.

A couple of days later, I get a call from the dealership saying they can lower my interest if I refinance to 60 months at $215 a month at 3.50% interest if I pick up a warranty. I said thats great, I thought that was only a $1,800 difference and I get a warranty. I never asked for the price of the warranty. It was $3,000. I again signed like a fucking moron without reading. I dont even need a warranty.

personalfinance,Seeking opinions on classic debt vs investing,"I know this is a topic beaten to death, and I've read this sub for a really long time, so I know the interest rate vs. returns method but my debt still bothers me mentally. So I'm more or less seeking perspective on what others would do.

My only non-mortgage debt is a student loan that's been whittled down from $60k+ (at the time of MBA) to $21,372. The payment on it is $270 or something but for the last 18 months or so I have been paying $1k a month on it.

Income: $95k

Two Roth IRAs maxed out each year, putting us about ~20% of gross for retirement.

Two kids daycare expenses ~$700/mo total

Both kids have 529s contributing $350/mo total.

Retirement accounts sitting ~$110k, we are both 31.

At current payoff I will probably pay off the student loan in full around the summer or spring of 2020, the calculator is November of 2020 but I tend to throw extra cash into it at tax and bonus time so it's likely earlier than that. Thing is, I'm so sick of paying it, part of me wants to do it even sooner. If I trimmed back retirement to 10% or something at the expense of a Roth, I could very possibly knock this thing out in 2019. But I simultaneously hate the thought of not maxing my Roth. It's like a constant battle in my head between giving up the Roth vs. the amazingness of freeing up $1k+ a month of cash flow. I only have like $8-900 of interest left on this thing, but getting that cash flow back sounds like a dream to me.

investing,"Bloomberg: ""Titans of Junk: Behind the Debt Binge That Now Threatens Markets""","https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-corporate-debt/?srnd=premium

&gt; Masayoshi Son and Elon Musk leveraged their dreams to the hilt. Patrick Drahi stockpiled debt to build a global cable empire. Michael Dell loaded his computer company with risky loans to buy out activists threatening his control. And a group of Chinese developers borrowed big to expand in the nation’s booming property market.

&gt; Call them the titans of junk.

&gt; But chances are that anyone who socked away cash into a retirement account during the past five years has lent them money. Investors have parked trillions of dollars in mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that buy junk bonds. Pension funds in Canada have started leveraged-finance lending operations. Insurance companies have helped bankroll leveraged buyouts. And, in an echo of the subprime mortgage bubble a decade ago, investors from Sydney to Seattle snapped up hundreds of billions of dollars in AAA rated securities known as collateralized loan obligations that are actually backed by the debt of junk-rated companies.

The article covers SoftBank, Netflix, Tesla, Altice, the factors that lead to the current debt binge and when those loans are set to mature.

&gt; It’s not as if regulators didn’t attempt to keep the borrowing in check. The three primary entities that oversee the U.S. banking system—the Fed, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.—began cracking the whip in 2013 on banks that underwrote debt that they considered too risky. One no-no: any loan deal that loaded a company with debt more than six times its Ebitda would get extra scrutiny, and barring any offsetting factors, those banks often were slapped with warnings.

&gt; But that barely made a dent. Even as the big banks turned away the riskiest borrowers, a host of firms that fell outside the purview of banking regulators—securities brokers, boutique investment banks and even pension funds—swooped in to underwrite those loans. Instead of capping leverage in the market, it continued to grow

personalfinance,"Update: Won $120k scratcher, re-enrolled at University, need advice on financing","Title seems ironic, but it's slightly more complicated. So quick summary, back in May I won a scratcher that gives me ""$1k/month for the next 10 years"" (1 paycheck every May for $12k, ~$8500 after taxes). Since then I've re-enrolled in college and plan on finishing my degree within the next 3-4 years. 

But now I'm concerned about financing, I'd like to work a maximum of 25 hours per week to give me the best chances of succeeding. I signed up for the student loans giving me $9500 this semester but am only expecting $2100 refund.

With working and dividing the refund I estimate that I'll have a max of $1200/mo. for all of my expenses. $700 goes to my basic living expenses giving me ~500 for groceries/transportation/etc. Which is fine, I've lived with a much tighter budget before. But now there's a twist, I've recently blown out my knee with a pre-existing injury (torn ACL/MCL), and after my inevitable surgery the expected recovery time is 2 weeks guaranteed in bed with about 2 months of very limited mobility. With that and my $1,500 deductible, I'm scared that this will affect my job/income.

My original plan was to just hustle as much as I could until May, then use my $8500 lotto check to help subsidize my income for the upcoming school year (2019-2020) and then repeat every year until graduation. Then use those checks to pay off whatever student loans I have afterwards. But with this injury I'm nervous that I might not make it until then, so I'm considering private student loans.

I know private student loans are a terrible option, I have terrible credit as well as my family so I'm guaranteed a bad interest rate, but I feel that a few thousand would really help keep me afloat during school/recovery. Does anybody have any experience or advice?

TL:DR - Won $8500 paycheck every May for the next 9 years. Injured myself recently and am considering a private student loan. Need advice/reassurance.

I know Zillow and online platforms like that can be a bit off when it comes to giving you an idea of what your home is worth, but I am in a growing market right now (outside of Nashville) so I know it's improved. It's located close to the downtown area of my small town (in short, it's a desirable location) but a large portion of my town commute to and from Nashville and also this area has been getting a lot of new manufacturing jobs.

I'm currently renting this property out. The mortgage is $540 per month (it still has PMI on it, I got it with an FHA loan) and I rent it for $1000 per month. I could probably increase the rent by $100 but I have a good renter and would rather not push him to look elsewhere. I'll probably raise rent by $50 though.

Zestimate is $122,850. I've given Zillow all my home's information too (type of flooring, heating, windows, etc.) to try and increase its accuracy. My loan balance right now is around $77k.

I'm just trying to decide whether or not it would be a good idea to refinance. I would use the money to improve the home and also probably use it to help me with a down payment on my next home which would be a primary residence. That said, I know my interest rate would be worse - but my main concern is cashflow on the rental, not how long it'll take me to pay it off 100%.

Not sure it it matters but I also co-own another rental that has about $25k equity in it but that'd split because I co-own it with my business partner.

I'd love to know what those of you with more financial literacy think I should do.

Here's the other thing- his company offers loans for the stock which they take out of his paycheck.  We paid for part of the stock and then did a 10 year low interest loan so they only take about $120 out of each paycheck and we still reap the rewards of the year-end stock bonus.  (I don't remember the interest rate but could look it up if necessary)

What do you guys think, should we buy more stock?  I'm currently not working because we have two very small children.  We live in a moderately high cost of living area, have no consumer debt, own both of our cars and have about $12k outstanding in student loans.  We also own a rental property across the country that we can't sell because it's in an area that seriously hasn't appreciated in 10 years (bought at a bad time at the beginning of the housing crash), so we want to make sure we have enough savings to pay for repairs and cover a few months rent for when we have turnover.  We just had to cover 5 months rent because we got scammed by some renters (long story) and we had to repaint and replace all the carpet so that's kind of a fresh wound right now haha.  We have new renters in there and break even every month.

personalfinance,Student loan to improve credit?,"I have a decent credit score but it seems to not go above 750 because I don’t have enough length of history and enough previous accounts. 

I’ve only ever had five loans. Should I take out a federal student loan and pay it off after a month to make my history show 6 previous accounts?

I don’t believe this will affect my credit length because once it’s paid off that doesn’t apply. Also no ding for checking credit since it’s a federal loan.

personalfinance,Can/Should I use the forbearance I've been granted to target my high-interest loans first?,"I went through the ambiguous ""Trouble Paying?"" application after accidentally putting a full monthly payment toward one specific student loan instead of spacing it out across all of them. I'm still not working in my field after graduation (yay health issues) so I couldn't afford to both correct the error and make another full payment at the same time. I thought they might reduce my payments a bit so I could catch up with the past due balance, but the servicing firm responded by postponing all payments and canceling the past due balance, which really wasn't necessary. I still intend to pay what I was before, or close to it anyway.

But then I wondered, could I use this opportunity to target the loans with the highest interest rates first? One has less than 300 bucks left and I really just want to squash that and get it out of the way.  One less account on my credit report and all that. The monthly disbursement wasn't even going toward that one anymore, like they want to keep it kicking around as long as possible. Would it make the most financial sense to do this, or keep paying across all loans like I was before? OR will they cancel the forbearance if I continue to make payments anyway?",finance

I’m lucky enough that I haven’t had to work, partly with some money my parents gave me and my significant other (who is not American) pays for our life together now.

When I was younger I just assumed I didn’t need to file taxes since I lived outside the country and I didn’t have any job or income. Now I’m planning on getting married soon and want to make sure the American side of my life is in order. I don’t have any plans to move back to the states or anything, but I read that you can get your passport renewal denied if you haven’t filed taxes? It’s started to become a lingering anxiety more and more recently, and I don’t want to get into any kind of trouble because I’ve never filed taxes (especially since I don’t even make any money!)

The only time I've made any money in all these years is when I helped a local friend design some posters and a website a couple years back and they paid me a couple hundred US dollars (converted from local currency)

I guess I don’t even really know where to start right now.

Can I just start filing a tax return starting next year (for 2018)? Would I just fill out “0” for income? I do have a bank account in the states and I make like a couple cents in interest each month, do I have to report that? (I haven’t even looked at a tax form before, I’m sorry for my ignorance) Would the IRS find it odd that I just started randomly filing taxes at age 33 and don't even have any income to report?

Do I have to file for previous years? and if so how far back am I supposed to go?

Do I have to file both federal and state tax returns? I used to live in California, but my driver’s license is long expired and I don’t know if I belong to any state now since I haven’t lived in the country for so many years.

Also a somewhat unrelated question, but maybe someone can help me with this too:
My driver’s license (which has been expired for many years now) has an old address on it. My parents moved a couple years ago after my license was already expired. I’m worried that jury duty summons or something might still get sent to that old address since it would be the only address the dmv/government has on file for me?
I’m almost a little scared that if I go back to the states there could be a chance I could be arrested for avoiding jury duty or something. Hopefully someone can tell me I’m just being paranoid.

CryptoCurrency,Nuclear Bloodbath Bear Market: Bitcoin Cash SV Has Surpassed The Value Of Bitcoin Cash ABC,"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/36niorl2cr221.png

[http://genesisblocknews.com/nuclear-bloodbath-bear-market-bitcoin-cash-sv-has-surpassed-the-value-of-bitcoin-cash-abc/](http://genesisblocknews.com/nuclear-bloodbath-bear-market-bitcoin-cash-sv-has-surpassed-the-value-of-bitcoin-cash-abc/)

The Bitcoin Cash fork on 14 November 2018 [initiated the nuclear bear market](http://genesisblocknews.com/nuclear-bear-market-decimating-the-crypto-market-cap/),  which saw Bitcoin crash below its USD 5,800 support level. It appears  the Bitcoin Cash fork is continuing to have negative impacts on the  entire crypto market. [A lawsuit was launched in Federal Court today](https://cryptoiq.co/unitedcorp-suing-bitmain-kraken-bitcoin-com-and-roger-ver-for-colluding-to-take-over-bitcoin-cash-network-for-personal-gain/)  against Bitmain, Bitcoin.com and Roger Ver, and Kraken, for colluding  to make Bitcoin Cash ABC the dominant fork with a burst of hash power  right after the fork. Once Bitcoin Cash ABC was declared to be the true  Bitcoin Cash by the majority of exchanges, the Bitcoin Cash ABC  development team dropped a poison pill into the blockchain, and  centralized Bitcoin Cash ABC, so that they had the sole right to change  the code in the future and no one else. The lawsuit is saying it should  be illegal for a small group of companies and individuals to coordinate  on centralizing a decentralized cryptocurrency. On this news, Bitcoin  Cash ABC, which is labeled as Bitcoin Cash, has dropped 21%, while  Bitcoin Cash SV, which is now called Bitcoin SV, has rallied 29%. [Now Bitcoin SV has a market cap that is USD 200 million higher than Bitcoin Cash ABC](https://coinmarketcap.com/).

Everyone who thought Bitcoin Cash ABC was the dominant form of  Bitcoin Cash must be face palming or throwing their computer out the  window. They were tricked. Bitcoin Cash ABC only won because of a  massive coordinated effort, and once they got the title of Bitcoin Cash  the hash power dropped off. Further, Bitcoin Cash ABC abused their  position to centralize Bitcoin Cash, which is an extremely dangerous and  irresponsible thing to do. Who would want to own a cryptocurrency run  by greedy developers like that? Like it or not, Bitcoin SV is better  because they are decentralized. GenesisBlockNews believes that any  centralized crypto is worthless, and now the market is pricing that in,  since this lawsuit made everything so clear.

The sudden mainstream revelation that Bitcoin Cash has been  commandeered by a small group of companies and individuals and was  converted into a centralized cryptocurrency is probably the reason for  today’s overall market bloodbath. Bitcoin is down below USD 3,400,  Ethereum has dropped lower than USD 90 ([The CEO of BitMEX, Arthur Hayes must be cracking open a bottle of 300 year old wine while jumping into a pool filled with jello](http://genesisblocknews.com/bitmex-ceo-arthur-hayes-gets-high-off-ethereum-barely-dropping-below-usd-100-for-a-minute/)),  EOS is totally imploding and is down to a USD 1.5 billion market cap  (it deserves that for being centralized), and everything else is down  10-20% or more, besides Dogecoin which is only down 7%.

[GenesisBlockNews](http://genesisblocknews.com) calls this the Nuclear Bloodbath Bear Market. Crypto  traders should seal their doors, and hide in their bathtub under a  mattress, since bears enriched by radioactive nuclear fallout are  roaming the streets and looking to take a bite out of your  cryptocurrency wallets.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"4 months free of my addiction, but now I'm restarting my life at 30. Homeless, no car, 440 credit score with 90K in private student loans, broke and very little support. What do I do?","I've made some really poor choices in my life, but it really spiraled out of control this year. I am still employed, and have a 36K salary. However, there is a very likely possibility I will lose my job within the next couple weeks. I returned from leave a few weeks ago. I'm already applying to other jobs to hopefully have a backup plan because I can't afford to lose my income or benefits. 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I owe 29K in federal student loans, and 90K in private loans through Navient. I also have several defaulted cards in collections at 15K. Three other loans at 21K. I was able to get my federal loans enrolled into special program, but Navient has only offered me a rate reduction plan. However, even with that my monthly payment is $502. I've looked into credit counseling, as well as bankruptcy. However, I know that getting student loans dismissed in bankruptcy is extremely difficult. I just know I need to increase my credit score somehow if I want to make it long term. 

&amp;#x200B;

My car was repossessed in July, and I was evicted shortly after. Luckily, I had one good friend who was able to convince me to get help. I went to rehab, and got out after 90 days. My entire family, and most of my friends no longer want anything to do with me. I don't blame them at all, and I just hope to reconnect with them in the future. Not having much support is hard though. The other issue is I have no couches to crash on. Homeless shelters are literally on the opposite side of the city. I've been sleeping in my office at night, when possible, and that might not be an option if I lose my job. I tried to get any kind of assistance from the programs available in my city, county, state, as well as federal ones. However, I make too much money to qualify for anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I need to increase my income, deal with my debt/credit, and start saving something. I just don't know where to start. I'm trying to stay positive, and I'm still going to counseling/meetings 3 days a week. It just all feels so impossible and sometimes it's hard to stay motivated. Where do I start? How do I build a foundation to survive and succeed again? Any and all advice is greatly appreciated!

personalfinance,$100k Wire Transfer Lost!? Please HELP,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

Long time reddit user, but thought I should use a through away as I'm talking about financial information.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in Australia, however have had a large amount of funds in a Schwab trading account for a few years.

I just bought a house a required the funds to settle, so I cashed out my positions and made a 5k then a 10k 'test' wire transfer to my Australian bank account to make sure details were correct.

Both of these came through fine, so I then made a transfer request for 100k with the exact same details, it never showed up.

&amp;#x200B;

The details:

&gt;Requested transfer date: 26/11  
&gt;  
&gt;Aus Bank received a MT103 notice of incoming funds from Wells Fargo (intermediary bank) on 29/11, however funds never arrived.  
&gt;  
&gt;I can't talk to Wells Fargo directly as I don't have an account with them.  
&gt;  
&gt;Schwab received a Fed number for the transfer, and Wells Fargo provided a Reference number of transfer to Aus bank but the ref number means nothing to the Aus bank.  
&gt;  
&gt;I ordered a Trace and it seems to mean nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

Initially Aus bank said they got a MT103 but required a MT202Cov which they didn't receive. Aus bank has tried to contact Wells Fargo 5 times now without a response.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically Schwab and Aus bank are pointing fingers at each other, what makes things more difficult is that the two companies don't have a single overlapping business hour for me to loop both into a call, in addition both don't let you talk to the International Money Transfer team directly, further confusing the matter.

&amp;#x200B;

The request was submitted on the 26/11, it's now been 2 weeks and no one seems to know where it is, I need these funds for settlement and I'm really starting to fall apart, if anyone has any ideas or insights of what I should do next please let me know, I would truly appreciate it.",finance

business,Thinking of buying a business. What are my financing options?,"I recently came upon an interesting opportunity to buy a local company.  The company has a 66% net profit percentage and the asking price is 2 years of revenue.   Based on this if i feel I should be able to pay this off in 5 years while also taking enough home to live.

Sellers are retiring.  For many reasons, I think I could grow this and increase revenue and profit. 

The seller isn’t interested in seller financing.  What are my options? I have great credit, but not sure if where to look to first (I.e. a bank?).

Any help would be appreciated 

Update:  wanted to pass along a status update for anyone who may one day be in a similar position.

1.  SBA loans - after inquiry I was told that currently sba loans are reserved for new businesses rather than purchasing of existing businesses

2.  Bank loans - went to a bank and met with their business loan representative.  They do often provide loans for the situation described.  As you can imagine it is a many-month process and requires significant documentation.   For anyone who’s a homeowner, that is a piece of cake compared to this.  Some examples of documentation are:
  -  income statements from seller
  -  tax returns from seller
  -  financial documents from all accounts from a buyer (like buying a house)
  -  business plan from buyer
  -  resume from buyer

Also you will still require a signifcant down payment (i.e 20%)

I was told the terms of the loan are negotiable which is good to know.  For instance first payment due, interest rate, down payment , length of loan, are all negotiable with the bank.

One of the plus’s of the meeting with the bank is hey provided a industry report.  This is packed with super useful information anyone looking at entering a market I highly recommend getting your hands on one.

3.  Seller financed - many people recommend this option as it’s the easiest transition of ownership.    Knowing several people who sell businesses, this can be daunting as you put your business in someone else’s hands before you receive your full payment.  Many sellers aren’t interested in this for that reason (or take hard convincing)

In short we didn’t find many great for financing the purchase of an existing business.

For now we have a new business strategy which doesn’t include the purchase of their business which we believe to be the best route for us.",finance

Bitcoin,Ima Bitcoin permabear transforming into a REAL Bull! Please don’t rip my horns off...,"Bitcoin blurb that turned into an essay: 

I’ve been following Bitcoin since 2014 when I first observed it spike to a $1000 that then crash to $200. Since then, I’ve been very anti-Bitcoin, specifically when looking at it as a form of currency, which needs to be (1) a store of value, (2) a unit of account, and (3) a medium of exchange. Bitcoin’s price will never be stable enough to actually be a currency, IMO. HOWEVER, I have started to turn more bullish on Bitcoin, especially over the long term because investors the world over are hungry for asset diversity. 

However, since it’s an asset, it is ultimately tied to the global financial system, which is dominated by the US, which is in turn dominated by the Fed. I’d say there are many things causing Bitcoin to fall, but I think the Fed raising rates along with shrinking their balance sheet is a big factor. Effectively, the Fed is making the value of money go up by reducing supply and increasing rates, which means you can easily get ~2% yield in a money-market fund. Also, their actions combined with Trump’s antics have helped induce or at least intensify a global bear market. Most Americans don’t realize that assets have been getting walloped this year outside the US.  

Anywho, on to the positive. I see Bitcoin as much more analogous to gold then a currency. You don’t use gold to buy stuff because there are so many more efficient means to do so. Yet it still has value because so many see it as such. The key for Bitcoin is the relatively limited supply that cannot be produced arbitrarily. You cannot counterfeit Bitcoin (to the best of my knowledge). There is no way to hack into the Bitcoin “system,” at least now although there might be future risks that arise from quantum computing, although I read that the Bitcoin system could adapt to such a threat (if you see a future, systemic threat to Bitcoin, then please tell!). There will not be a sudden spike in aggregate supply, although supply at a given time in the marketplace will vary greatly. This means that it actually is a viable asset. 

When I turned my back on Bitcoin in 2014, I did so because I just didn’t like its risk/reward. One of the big reasons for me was that it could easily just slowly sputter out and die. I saw it as a niche computer experiment. However, critically, it has become a household name. The boom last year was an extremely effective advertisement in this regard. Bitcoin is known by everyone who is in finance. Many see it as too volatile, which is a fair reason to not buy in. Many also see it as rigged, which it is. Even so, the idea of Bitcoin and other cryptos continue to seep into the human psyche. With Bitcoin, crucially, being the first mover as a durable crypto asset that has achieved global awareness, it will likely continue to be the leader in the space. From my perspective, this bear market has been good for Bitcoin long-term since the other secondary players are getting washed out.

The BIG POSITIVE in my book, though, which is leading me to soon buy my first Bitcoin, is the fact that as the price and market cap goes down, the easier it is to support. The lower it goes, the more powerful this idea becomes. That is to say it is becoming increasingly easy for demand to match the supply on the market in terms of fiat currency. I don’t know when it will bottom, but it will be way higher than $0. In that case, literally no one would buy a Bitcoin for any price. That is clearly absurd. I don’t know when the bottom will occur, but it will occur one day. When that day comes, it will be a stronger, more mature asset in a pruned crypto space. I don’t like to pretend I am a market caller, although I was warning people about Bitcoin when it jumped up to $2,000 and just kept rising last year. Still, I feel that the bottom is going to occur relatively soon. There is just too much fucking fiat sloshing through the world economy looking for a good place to settle. I, with a good bit of confidence, say that Bitcoin will continue to be one of those places well into the future. 

Now that I’ve taken an hour to write this essay at 1am when I was planning on just typing a little blurb, I can confidently say, what the fuck am I doing with my life? Also, what is the best cold storage crypto-wallet right now, because I’m about to jump into the frenzy and HODL. 😅 

P.S. someone please respond to this so I don’t think I completely wasted my time.  

Yea, I’m that needy.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Student Loans 2: Attack of the Loans,"Hello again r/personalfinance. Following up on a post from [three years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4oq10e/max_ira_contribution_vs_student_loans/) that was very helpful. The consensus then was to pay down student loans aggressively and wait on retirement. So now, I am 30, I have $25,000 remaining in fixed loans (all federal at 5.6%), and $0 in retirement (job still offers 401k with NO match). I also have a small emergency fund of 5 months income, but something like a down payment on property in the future would take a lot of saving.

My private loan is finally paid off, so now I have $1000 a month to play with to either attack the federal loan or do something about that $0 in retirement. Something about being 33 and having nothing saved is making me uneasy, and family members are suggesting I split between retirement and loan payment. I am big on the avalanche method though. I have read that one of the reasons long term investment in stocks often balances out is because money is deposited gradually over time, minimizing the effects of short term crashes and recessions. I am wondering if delaying rush mode a few more years will make me more vulnerable to volatility, since I will be investing more over a shorter duration.

Seems like I should stick with aggressive loan payments a few more years with that $1000 a month guaranteed at 5.6%, but is there any merit to my concerns about being 33 with no retirement and no assets?",finance

I live in a low cost city. I am actually hourly and can bump the 40k figure with some OT a bit. My bill is 109k private and 25k federal. I have a decent car that is paid for.

1. How should I go about the federal loans? I'm fuzzy on the details on these.

2. Private loans? I.e. aggressively pay these down? Any technicalities on paying down properly on a monthly basis? The private loans are a smorgasbord of horrible interest rates of being in school for 7 f-ing years. I need to consolidate as well and need some tips on getting a good interest rate ASAP.

3. You can get cheap houses and condos where I live. My GF makes ~35k a year. The mortgage on something like this appears to be cheaper than our apartment at ~800 a month. Is this something feasible to do anytime soon as a way to save money or am I just missing something? I.e. plenty of tiny little 80-120k houses in town, 30y mortgage at 360-600 a month 10% down with a minuscule 1% property tax rate.

4. I have no savings. I'm not sure how to approach this at the moment since I have no emergency cash for anything like a car repair.

5. Is it worth it to calculate my taxes to maximally reduce withholding such that get a perfect 0$ tax return to maximally reduce interest paid?

I am stationed overseas, and am renting out our house in the states.   We do not plan to move back into the house, as our family has grown.   The rental and property managemeng is going well. 

I just recieved my annual bonus, and am looking for some hive-mind thoughts on my next step.  Here's the situation: 

\- Bonus (after tax)                    58K

\- Mortgage 1 (remaining)       96K         5%

\- Heloc (remaining )                 23 K        5.25%

&amp;#x200B;

My options:    

1: Invest all 58K either all at once or over the next year, (knowing we are most likely heading for a downturn).  I have an about 20yr window until I plan to retire 

2: Pay off my Heloc and invest the rest

3: Pay off Heloc and part of mortgage 

with addendum question:  should I try to refinance the two mortgages into one with a (slightly) lower rate?

&amp;#x200B;

Other data:   401K is maxed for both me and my spouse.  Together we have approx 1M in retirement savings and 70K in emergency fund.

I typically lean towards keeping the mortgages for tax implications and for the fact that typically the market will beat the mortgage interest, but with both the coming (I think) downturn and the relatively high interest rates I'm torn.   Any additional thoughts or advice would be appreciated!

personalfinance,"Low Income (atm), Lots of debt, Relocating, and Need Finance Help - What are my options?","Hello all,

This is only my 2nd or so post ever so bear with me, please. So this may be a long-winded question. Here is my story. I need some serious help with my finances. Please refrain from judging and throwing the fact that my finances suck in my face haha.

I currently have around 25k in student debt, that I have not started paying yet (it is all on one single interest rate). I have 4 open credit cards that are all pretty full, around 80% being used. (this is from plane tickets and lawyer fees, which I will explain) My credit score is low 600's. I am currently working solely online, using PayPal as my payment collector, so I have no way to prove my income. I am only making around 1k a month. However, I am currently living in Brazil where the cost of living is MUCH lower than the US. So it has not been an issue until now. I really make 4,000 reais (Brazilian dollar) a month after the conversion rate, so it has been more than okay.

I followed the love of my love to Brazil almost 2 years ago at this point. We have since gotten married. To help with her visa process (green card) we hired a lawyer (where most of my CC debt went). We are preparing to return to the US soon ( in 2 months) and I need additional funds to help get settled. With rent and deposits, additional housing stuff, food etc. We do have a car and some housing stuff waiting for us back the US. We will be cutting it extremely close as we first arrive.

Thankfully I have an extremely supportive and helpful family that is going to help us out as much as possible. But there is still a HUGE need for funds right now. As far as my work goes, I will continue to do my online business as sort of a side thing, but I have some offers for different jobs when we return. Those jobs vary from 32-40k a year. None of which are guarantees at this point, seeing as I won't be there until Feb. My wife will not be working quite yet, she has an internship that could lead to a job, but at the moment I will be the only source of income. \*side note: Brazilian families are much closer than most US families, so until this point my wife's dad has supported her fully while she has finished her schooling. However, while we are in the US he will be very limited on the amount of money he can give.

What are my options? Thank you in advance for any and all suggestions!

Edit: I have no savings.

Edit2: I should have stressed the fact that my wife has an amazing internship opportunity as a foreigner for her field of work. That is why we are moving. We planned all along to move back to the US, this just has sped the process along.",finance

personalfinance,My financial situation has changed for the better... What now?,"At my previous job I was living hand to mouth with no extra income. That's changed for the better now, and I have the resources to start tackling my debt, but I'm looking for opinions on what to do next. I make about $500 more than my bills not including groceries. I won't get much done this month due to Christmas presents, but I'm January I'm getting a windfall of an extra $800 (so I'll have $1,300), in February I'm expecting a windfall of around $3,700. I owe about 5k on my car at around 9% interest. I owe $3,300 on my credit card at ~%14, but I'm in the process of moving that debt to another card for ~%9. I owe ~$550 on cell phone with no interest rate. I owe $2,800 on an engagement ring at %10. I'm putting $180 into savings each month, and the amounts I've said that I have left over are calculated after that money goes into savings. Currently I have nothing in savings.

My biggest focus right now is freeing up monthly income. For that reason I'm considering tackling the smaller stuff first rather than going in order of interest rates. So the monthly debt repayment bills are $40 for the phone, $80 for the CC, $147 for the car, and $130 for the ring. I intended on going after the phone first with my extra funds in January, and the ring with my extra funds in February, and my CC with a $700 windfall I'll get every July and February starting after this coming February.",finance
personalfinance,SEP vs Roth IRA when planning 2018 taxes,"I am self employed and planning my taxes with the draft tax spreadsheet (https://sites.google.com/site/excel1040/home/2018-tax-planner-new-tax-law) to see how I should contribute to my retirement accounts before the end of the year.

I am just barely in the 22% tax bracket with my business income, and from reading this sub it seems like most people would recommend contributing to my SEP IRA rather than my Roth because of 22% marginal is likely greater than my average tax bracket in retirement.

HOWEVER, I have kids and now with the larger child tax credit, that lowers my federal income tax significantly (but not the self employment tax). In fact that credit takes away 80%+ of my federal income tax.

So, playing with the calculator, if I contribute to my SEP IRA it ends up reducing the Qualified business income deduction, and that coupled with the child tax credit means that if I contribute more than a certain amount the my income tax goes to $0.

Putting in some numbers makes it so effectively for every $ I contribute to my SEP it would only allow me to deduct about 10%, even though I am in the 22% tax bracket.

This leads me to think that a Roth makes more sense in my situation, as it seems likely that the average tax rate in retirement would be &gt; 10%.

Does this approach make sense? Thanks.",finance

I’m a bit confused about some other things I’ve read about being self employed.

- Do I have to make an LLC for myself?  Do I have to have the employee ID number first?  I know it’s also a form of business protection but the details are confusing.  Is it expensive to do so, and would I have to have an accountant who does LLC work instead of just individual returns?

- I’d like to roll over my old 401k into an account not held by my old company, what are my options as self employed?  Does it change depending on if I get an LLC and employee ID number?

- A few of my credit card savvy friends say I should open a business credit card.  Would I have to have an LLC or employee ID number first before being able to apply for one?  Also, primarily my work would consist of being a temp contractor working in-house for clients, so I’m not sure that my strictly business expenses would line up with a business credit card.

investing,Morning Technical Newsletter - Dollar Crawls Higher in Asian Trade,"#### Dollar Crawls Higher in Asian Trade

The US Dollar was finally seeing some recovery after struggling for traction earlier in the Asian trading session. That comes on the back of growing speculation that the Federal Reserve Bank is not likely to continue to project a hawkish outlook into 2019. Analysts and market players both believe that the Fed will pause its tightening cycle not long after they give the green light on the expected December rate hike at their next policy meeting. What is worrying markets is the steep declines in yields for US Treasury instruments, suggesting the strong likelihood that the US economy could soon be heading for a significant downturn.

As reported at 10:30 am (JST) in Tokyo, the USD/JPY was trading flat at 112.7170 Japanese Yen. Remaining in Asia, the AUD/USD was trading lower at $0.722, down 0.16% while the NZD/USD was trading at $0.6878, down 0.03%.

#### Markets to Focus on NFP Data

In the hours ahead, markets will focus on the release of the November Non-Farms Labor Report from the United States Labor Department. The latest poll shows that analysts believe new private sector jobs will have fallen to 200,000, down from 250,000 in October. The unemployment rate is predicted to remain unchanged at 3.7%; analysts also have predicted that the average hourly earnings will be flat at 3.1%. The Federal Reserve has a mandate to ensure full employment while maintaining price stability, so any data which impacts one or the other of their criteria is deemed a market moving event.

I’ll keep this post as short as possible, so bear with me.  
  
I’ve recently been gifted a brokerage account with an account value almost equal to my student loan debt.  
  
Financially, I’m just making ends meet and making minimum payments on my student loans, but am starting a FT job in April and therefore going to be bringing home more money annually. Significantly more.   
  
My average brokerage account return is about 8%. My average student loan interest rate is 4.12% across multiple $3-$4k loans ranging from 3% to 4.8%. 
 
Simple finance would tell me it makes more sense to let my brokerage account grow over time and continue making student loan payments.  

I’ve been thinking that I could sell my stocks to be free of my student debt and the ever dreaded interest payment associated with my student loans, but I’m not sure what to do.  
  
I’ve also thought about selling off a portion of my stocks to pay off some of the higher interest rate student loans which pull my average interest rate up, but then again I’d still be paying mostly interest and not much principal.

Any help would be appreciated. 

Thank you",finance
personalfinance,Best Friend Looking to Consolidate Debt,"My best friend is looking to consolidate her credit card and small loan debt. It's about $4M in total. Current interest on the CC is 24.99% APR.

She applied for a personal loan to try and get a lower interest rate and combine her debts but all the places offered her rates of over 30%.

I'm looking to see if I can't become a co-signer with her in order to help her with lower interest rates.

Does anyone here know of Credit Unions, Financial Institutions, Etc. that would give more favorable rates if there is a strong guarantor/co-signer on about a $5M loan for debt consolidation.

*For folks trying to talk me out of becoming a guarantor/co-signer, it's alright. I've known her for a long time and we've been through a lot together. If she ends up kicking the can (debt wise), I make more than enough to cover her ass and I'm more than willing to do it if it comes down to it. However, obviously it'll be better if she pays it down on her own without having to rely on me so I'm trying to give her an ""out"" so to speak, while saving her dignitiy.

Any advice related specifically to the obtaining of a personal loan for debt consolidation with me being a co-signer is greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,Question About Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) G Fund for School Project,"Hi,

Thank you very much for checking my thinking on this. I am new to learning about fixed-income investments. 

I have a question regarding the US Government Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) G Fund (Government Securities Investment Fund). I'm trying to better understand how it acts in times of changing interest rates for a high school project.

https://www.tsp.gov/InvestmentFunds/FundOptions/fundPerformance_G.html

From reading the information at the above link, it states that inflation risk is the only risk to the G Fund.

I know that with a regular bond fund, rises in interest rates will decrease the value of the bond fund, and vice versa. 

However, when it comes to the G Fund - if I am understanding and reading the way it works correctly, a rise in interest rates will *only* cause a rise in the interest the fund pays, with no corresponding decline in the value of the fund. 

So, in effect, the G Fund will never ever lose nominal value, even if interest rates shot to 10% from here. At the same time, the interest paid on the G Fund is now higher given the rate increase. 

If so, doesn't that make this fund essentially a complete win-win? It may not pay much in interest or be good for long-term growth, but in terms of protecting your money it is bar none the best option because even rising interest rates will not cause it to lose principal. 

To demonstrate this with a hypothetical, I could put $100K in the G Fund with rates currently at 2%. Over the next few years, interest rates rise to 5%. I am now being paid ~5% interest payments on my G Fund, but the initial $100K I placed into the fund has not in any way fallen. Additionally, it has grown a little from the accumulated interest over the last few years. 

With a typical US Bond Fund, a rise like this in rates from 2% to 5% would cause the shares in the funds to fall and you had $100K in shares, now they are worth less than this amount, for example $95K.

Do I have this right that the G Fund can never have negative nominal performance?",finance

CryptoCurrency,CME Bitcoin Futures Are Poisoning Crypto,"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/09pk2d9tlx221.png

[https://cryptoiq.co/cme-bitcoin-futures-are-poisoning-crypto/](https://cryptoiq.co/cme-bitcoin-futures-are-poisoning-crypto/)

The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) [launched Bitcoin futures on 17 December 2017](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/17/worlds-largest-futures-exchange-set-to-launch-bitcoin-futures-sunday-night.html), the same day the price of Bitcoin peaked near $20,000 and then began to crash, a crash that has lasted a year. Today, [the price of Bitcoin is $3,200 and falling](https://bitcoinwisdom.com/markets/bitstamp/btcusd).  The launch of the Bitcoin futures on CME and the drastic decline in  Bitcoin’s price is not a coincidence. The paper Bitcoins being printed  on CME and simultaneous short selling are poisoning the entire crypto  space. That’s especially true since the CME Bitcoin futures are playing  an increasing role in setting Bitcoin’s global price as will be  explained below. 

Bitcoin is supposed to have a maximum supply of 21  million Bitcoins, and this is true for actual Bitcoins, but the printing  of paper Bitcoins on CME is inflating the supply of tradeable Bitcoins  beyond what is actually in circulation. CME, via COMEX, is doing the  same thing to the gold market. Tremendous amounts of paper gold are  being printed on COMEX, as well as London OTC, leaving gold prices  hopelessly supressed even though they should be rising as fiat inflation  increases worldwide. 

In order to understand how poisonous CME Bitcoin  futures are for the crypto space, it is best to understand how COMEX has  ruined the gold markets. Gold is something that is physical and must be  mined from the Earth, which requires great expense and effort. However,  COMEX and London OTC issues paper gold with a click of a button. [An article in 2017 by Bullion Star](https://www.bullionstar.com/blogs/bullionstar/what-sets-the-gold-price-is-it-the-paper-market-or-physical-market/)  gives great insight into this situation. London OTC has the greatest  ‘gold’ volume in the world, but there is 15,000X more paper gold traded  than actual gold. [Worldwide in 2016](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-05-17/paper-vs-physical-amazing-amount-leverage-silver-market), including all spot and futures exchanges, the paper to physical ratio for gold was 233:1. 

The real danger comes from the fact that paper gold  markets are setting the global price of physical gold. Obviously the  price of paper gold is far lower than what gold should be since there is  so much more paper gold than actual gold. Further, even though COMEX is  by far not the biggest paper gold exchange by volume, it is the  dominating force in setting global gold price since COMEX is more  accessible and has extended trading hours via GLOBEX. 

The Bitcoin Futures on CME are also on GLOBEX, so in  effect, the same people, who have ruined the gold market’s profitability  and are stealing from everyone who owns actual gold, have copied and  pasted this strategy into the Bitcoin market. There is one slight  adjustment that makes the Bitcoin futures even more vicious than gold  futures. Holders of gold futures can receive physical delivery, but no  such option exists for Bitcoin, removing any possibility that the CME  Bitcoin futures can help Bitcoin’s spot demand.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/z59fx7culx221.png

Thus, Globex and CME are experts at setting global  spot prices for assets, even for huge markets like gold. Bitcoiners are  largely unaware of this and need to realize that a paper Bitcoin market  on CME, which can print as many Bitcoins as it wants, is beginning to  set the global Bitcoin price. People are looking for all sorts of  reasons why Bitcoin is going down, but many fail to see the obvious  influence of the CME Bitcoin futures markets. 

CME Bitcoin futures have been increasing in volume in lockstep  with Bitcoin’s price decline. In the below, chart each contract is  equivalent to 5 Bitcoins. In Q3 2018 the trading volume of CME Bitcoin  futures was 757,950 paper Bitcoins per month on average. 

https://i.redd.it/3r9u55xvlx221.png

The  Federal Reserve, the biggest bank in the world, concurs with the notion  that CME Bitcoin futures have caused Bitcoin’s price decline. 

“The peak price coincided with the introduction of bitcoin futures trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,” [The Federal Reserve said in a May 2018 letter](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2018/may/how-futures-trading-changed-bitcoin-prices/).  “The rapid run-up and subsequent fall in the price after the  introduction of futures does not appear to be a coincidence. Rather, it  is consistent with trading behavior that typically accompanies the  introduction of futures markets for an asset.”

The Federal Reserve also attributes the year-long  Bitcoin price decline to short selling on the Bitcoin futures market.  Basically, people pessimistic about Bitcoin bet on Bitcoin going down  when the futures launched. Those sentiments become reality on the spot  markets because Globex sets the global Bitcoin price. This is especially  true since institutional investors have practically no other options  besides these paper Bitcoin futures on CME as well as similar Bitcoin  futures on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBoE). 

So how can Bitcoin and the crypto space escape the  stranglehold of the CME Bitcoin futures? The Bitcoin futures and gold  futures are backed by the dollar, and it will take a total collapse of  the dollar to free gold and Bitcoin from this highly coordinated,  top-level, worldwide market manipulation. 

Essentially, it has become a war between  cryptocurrency and fiat, whether Bitcoiners like it or not. The launch  of CME Bitcoin futures is equivalent to a nuclear attack on the Bitcoin  market, but there are other forces in play. [The United States debt is approaching $22 trillion](https://treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/current),  and the government cannot afford to cut the deficit, so this debt will  continue to spiral out of control, and that will cause the dollar to  inevitably fail. 

Bitcoin is positioned perfectly to be the primary  global currency when the total collapse of fiat inevitably happens. The  next major Bitcoin rally may have to wait until the dollar enters  hyperinflation and collapse mode, and there will be a simultaneous major  gold rally. No other Bitcoin rally in history will compare to the one  that is coming when the house of paper Bitcoins, paper gold, and fiat  burns down.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Desparation for loan options,"I posted this as well on r/StudentLoans , but I figured id also try on here to increase my chance of getting responses. 

 

So, a little preface to me begging for assistance.

I am a Sophomore in college, with divorced parents (both lower middle class) who live seven states away from one another. My first years tuition was taken care of by Parent PLUS loans ran through my mother, whom i live with.

At the beginning of the year when my mother went to apply for the PLUS loans for me this year, she got rejected. For the fall semester, balance due was a tad over eight thousand. I turned to my father to see if he could do the loans in order to help. He also got rejected. Both of them have pretty bad credit, and are unfortunately unable to cosign for me currently.

My dad is a contractor, and recently had a pretty big job, which was gonna get him a hefty commission check, that was projected to be around ten grand, but turned out to be roughly seven grand. He was going to pay this semesters tuition in cash with the commission money when he got issued the check (which was this month, next Tuesday to be exact), so we let the late charges stack up. But it turned out to not be enough, since we were banking on 10k and only got 7k. So, 4 months into the semester, I still have the unpaid dues, now up to \~$9,250 (from monthly increases) since i was relying on the cash. The school I attend requires me to have paid the bill before i schedule classes, and scheduling classes is what keeps the housing contract. This happens to be due a week from today at 4:00 pm. If the balance is not paid and classes are not scheduled, my housing contract is terminated and im basically asked to leave just like that (which is understandable- no freeloaders obviously).

I have never owned a credit card. I dont think i even have credit. To be completely honest, loans are completely foreign to me as well. I am the first child to have used loans. My parents didn't attend school, so they didn't know too much about them either. So, here I am, a week away from the payment deadline, on the border of staying on campus next semester or getting booted back home. Paired along with the stress and anxiety of five finals, it is not going to well.

So my question is- is it possible to get loans, without a cosigner, as a 19 y/o, who has only ever worked part time jobs? And if it was possible, what are the options? While I understand interest rates are a large factor, I am for now just worried about getting the loans to pay it off. And would a loan be able to process that fast to be done by next friday? Once again, i am clueless on this so bare with me as much as possible.

IF im able to return next semester through some miraculous loan service, i have a decent paying research position lined up, starting at the very beginning of the term, and i would be more than willing to start making smaller payments right away.

Bitcoin,Is it really good that local governments and some state governments accept Bitcoin for taxes?,"I totally get the idea where people claim it’s a win for adoption, but is it a win for sound money?

Most of us here expect the value of BTC to increase over time. I think that to an extent governments do too. 

So if we pay taxes (read: If we allow governments to steal from us) in BTC, are we not essentially slowly giving them control over our money again.

If we pay tax with BTC, we’re handing over good money to government. These governments are not paying or even talking about paying their contractors and service providers in bitcoin, they’re still paying them in the fiat money that they literally  print out of thin air (sure states and municipalities don’t print money, but they get federal/national budget grants) so we’re giving them good money and they’re giving bad money back.

I pay a government $100 in BTC today, and they don’t spend it, in 5 years time it could be worth considerably more, while the money they spent over the last 5 years will have been fiat, and will be worth less than it is today due to government induced inflation, fractional reserve banking and all the other silly things we let them get away with.

Anyway, what are your thoughts on this? 

My opinion: pay your government in the magical papers they created and keep your money to yourself.",cryptocurrency

worldpolitics,Iran: Angry unpaid steelworkers in Ahvaz protest,"By: Hassan. Mahmoudi

The Angry unpaid workers of Iran National Steel Industrial Group in Ahvaz, Khuzestan province, took to the streets of Ahvaz on Saturday, Dec 8, 2018, for the 29th executive day to protest for their rights. The workers were chanting ""The voice of every worker, Death to the oppressor"".

[ Angry unpaid steelworkers in Ahvaz protest  Dec,08, 2018](https://i.redd.it/akqstfwil1321.jpg)

The workers were marching toward the Naderi street condemning the condition of workers in Iran while also targeting the whole regime with their political chants such as :

“Inflation, high prices, answer to us Rouhani”

“Victory is near. Down with this deceptive government.”

""Threats, and prison, Have no more effect""

"" Our country is the thieve house and is one of a kind in the world"" 

“Workers, students, unite, unite” 

They were holding banners that read, “Workers are awake and fed up with being exploited.”

The workers of the Ahvaz steel factory have been demanding the payment of their overdue salaries for months. The lives of thousands of workers and their families have been negatively impacted by the by the deteriorating working conditions at the factory and the corrupt practices of its administrators. Having received no concrete response from the government, the workers began a new round of strikes and protests four weeks ago.

The Iranian regime has tried to dissuade the workers from continuing their protests by different means. The regime’s authorities have also issued threats against the protesters and tried to associate them with foreign meddling.

But for the workers of Ahvaz, who have been deprived of their most basic rights, the threats of the regime are sounding increasingly hollow. The workers continue to take to the streets day after day, and they are earning a growing support among different classes and communities in the Iranian society and across the world.",finance

personalfinance,"Been slowly changing habits, being better with, and more aware of my finances. Time for the final push, for my delayed entry into adulthood (Im 34). Have a couple credit/debt related questions.","Hey everyone!

**If you want to skip the back story, feel free to go down to the **

I tried to keep it short, but that kinda turned into now apologizing for being a little long winded.
I have been lurking and using the community info as reference for some time. 
In my early 20's I was happy to wreck my life, as an addict. Now, since that time is long past (about 8 years strait now) I am finally nearing a postition where I may be able to buy property.

I have a 4 year job, last year made about $50k, and this year I'm breaking $60k, with a likely pay increase coming soon. Between debit/savings/cash/precious metals/other sellable assets, I'm ""worth"" about 20 to 22 grand, with about 15 of that liquid.

I have a few unpaid debts on my credit reports, around $4k (that's down from $20k or so, after years of paying things off, disputing items, and others simply dropping off based on time.). Im taking care of the remaining issues in the near future after the validation and/or dispute process. 
I have a paid in full auto loan on there with good payments, and a current auto loan (about a year old, and nice, low interest) with 3 or 4 years left, 7 grand remaining balance. No other credit cards or line of credit yet.

I can never seem to get all three free credit reports when I go to pull them each year, theres always one or two that want me to do more legwork, and until now I was too busy or lazy to call or mail the bureau's and get them.
My bank does a ""soft pull"" and gives a FICO. Last week I'm at 570 with trans-union (has always historically been the low one for me, and hasnt changed much in the last year). When I got the auto loan last year I was at 630 and 600 with the two E's, both rejected my yearly request last week.

Im a full-time single father and since the begining of the year my daughter and I have been staying with my folks, but as most can imagine, tensions build up, and its getting about that time for us to get our own place (my goal is by the end of the school year).

**
I cant seem to find exact answers on the comm. info page, so hopefully you guys can help me out...

1. An option Ive been considering and will likely move forward with is getting my own work vehicle.
So... would it be better, in terms of improving credit, to purchase it with a typical auto loan, or to instead open a line of credit with availble credit 3 times the price of vehicle Im looking at, and make the purchase through the LOC? That's assuming there isnt a large variation in interest rates. I should have a co-signer if needed also.

2. Seems everyone prefers the free credit report route, and calculating your own score, but is there any paid service you reccomend that can reliably get me all 3 reports on an as-needed basis (bonus if they do scores too, but not required of course) without affecting my credit rating? I realize that type of service may be looked down upon, but its worth it for me to save my limited time/energy by having that info at my fingertips, for essentially the same cost as a netflix subscription. Any site that you all support or reccomend?

Any positive suggestions, or advice on my situation (why I included the backstory and such) or routes to proceed would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!

personalfinance,Question regarding the emergency fund savings account I am about to start.,"Hello. I am about to start an emergency fund that covers 11 months of expenses (have 1 month of expenses in my current checking account to make it a year total). I have an Etrade account with both a brokerage and a checking account (the checking account is used for direct deposit for quicker transfers to brokerage vs using ACH from my external bank). 

After much Q&amp;A with their reps on the subject I have opted for their ""Premium Savings Account"" which yields 1.90% interest annually. I can access it up to six times within a calendar month if needed, as per federal regulations, and can instantly transfer/ access it from my current Etrade checking account. They are going to send me both an ATM/ checks for my checking account. 

This will give me immediate access to my emergency funds. Though inflation rises at 2% annually on average, this 1.90% was the best I could find. My current external bank was far lower and required much higher minimum balance.

I know the people here have done their homework and know their shit. Since the emergency fund is considered one of the most important aspects of personal finance I just wanted to ask if you think this setup is the best I can do? The 1.90% yield is .10% below inflation, but I think it is a pretty solid return for a savings account. The accessibility to it makes up for it don't you think. Don't want to sound nitpicky, as I've been with Etrade for many years and love their service, I just want to make sure I'm making the most of my personal finance situation.

Thank you in advance for any feedback!",finance
stocks,"Get ready for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018!","Hey what's up r/stocks! Happy Saturday to all of you. I hope everyone on this sub had a pretty good trading week this past week admit all of the market volatility, and are ready for the new trading week ahead! :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 10th, 2018.

# **Stocks could be set up for another violent week of selling  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/07/stocks-could-be-set-up-for-another-violent-week-of-selling-.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks could continue to take a beating and aim for a retest of lows, after one of the most brutal weeks for the market this year.
*****
&gt; The past week was one of the worst of 2018, with the Dow down 4.5 percent at 24,388, and the Nasdaq down nearly 5 percent, at 6,969. The S&amp;P 500 was down 4.6 percent at 2,633, just 2 points above its November low. The S&amp;P suffered its worst week since March and the third worst of the year.
*****
&gt; As stocks melted down, bonds rallied, sending their own spooky message as the yield curve flattened and even inverted at some points — a sign of potential economic trouble ahead. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgages and other loans, started the week at 3.02 percent and was at 2.85 percent Friday, its biggest one-week move since October 2015.
*****
&gt; There is some important data in the week ahead that the bond market will be focused on, including CPI inflation data Wednesday and November retail sales on Friday.
*****
&gt; “I think we’re in a holding pattern, waiting to see if we get oversold on the S&amp;P and look for some sort of oversold bounce, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see a lot of selling into that bounce until we get some substantive news, making investors feel confident. I think the market feels vulnerable,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.
*****
&gt; Investors have been fretting about uncertainty over U.S. trade relations with China, as well as the fact the economy looks to be growing more slowly. What appeared to be a promising meeting last weekend between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping sparked a one-day rally but gave way to skepticism and doubts especially after the arrest of a prominent Chinese telecom executive.
*****
&gt; The Fed has been a big concern, but central bank officials seem to have been making a concerted effort to assure markets they will move cautiously, even if they raise interest rates this month, as expected. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the Fed is close to neutral, the point where it can stop raising rates, and Fed Governor Lael Brainard was the latest Friday to emphasize that the central bank will be data dependent and make its decisions on how the economy evolves.
*****
&gt; Stovall said the market often touches a low point in mid-December, before taking off into year-end, but it’s not clear this year whether the market will right itself for much a year-end rally.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P is sending some negative technical signals, and its chart formed a “death cross,” a technical pattern that suggests a bearish change in trend.
*****
&gt; “The real question is are we headed for a global recession. That’s what I think the problem is, and I think that because the trade issue is so uncertain. That could end up being a pretty influential catalyst,” said Stovall. “Everyone keeps saying they’re worried about a recession in 2020. What if it ends up being 2019? On average, the S&amp;P 500 tops out seven months before a recession. I don’t think we’re heading for a recession. I’m thinking this is a correction that will right itself, but until we get to breakeven the jury is still out.”
*****
&gt; The stock market sell-off fits into a pattern the S&amp;P 500 has experience In 26 of the years since World War II. In those years, it dipped more than 5 percent and then fell again later in the year.
*****
&gt; “In 70 percent of those observations, the second decline was deeper than the first,” Stovall said. The S&amp;P fell 12.8 percent from late January to Feb. 9, and in October, it hit an intraday low of 2,603 that was 11.8 percent below its all-time high from September. It’s that low strategists say the market could retest in the near future. So if it is like the majority of years, there could be a deeper move.
*****
&gt; “It does that because we need to reset the dial. We just didn’t reset the dial enough the first time around so we had to do it again. I was thinking a decline down to a pretty important support level like 2,550 on the S&amp;P would be a decline threshold that would then be deeper than the first one,” he said. “It references the low, where we bounced in February of this year. It just gives me reason to think that that’s the kind of decline we could get.”
*****
&gt; Scott Redler, partner at T3Live.com, said Apple helped add to the negative sentiment, losing its gains for the year in Friday’s trading, and the rest of tech was also a negative.
*****
&gt; “There’s not much to stay positive about but there was really no reason to sell off. There was no shock move, there was just a weak tape,” said Redler. He said even with some positive comments from the White House on trade and a decent employment report, the market still could not rally.
*****
&gt; Redler said he expects the S&amp;P 500 to break the November low and test the October intraday low of 2,603 in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Ari Wald, technical analyst at Oppenheimer, said he also sees a retest of lows coming but the market is getting oversold. “We’re due for a bounce,” he said. “Risk assets face formidable resistance on the way back up. I think it’s going to face significant problems in 2019. I think there’s a ceiling out there.”
*****
&gt; In the bond market, strategists expect buying to continue, especially with the sell off in stocks. Bond yields move opposite price.
*****
&gt; “I think (the 10-year) could dip below 2.80 percent,” said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rate strategy at BMO. Lyngen said the market is watching inflation to see if it shows signs of weakening as some expect. Core CPI is expected to rise 2.2 percent year over year.
*****
&gt; Retail sales are expected to rise by 0.2 percent.
*****
&gt; “I think the combination of those two all-important headline data points are going to further confirm a soft patch in the real economic data or we’re going to see a challenge to the notion that the Fed has gone too far too fast,” he said.
*****
&gt; If the data misses the mark, it could continue to pressure the long end of the curve — or the 10-year note and 30-year bond. The 2-year to 10-year spread is the most widely watched, and the two yields edged closer together in the past week, reaching just 9 basis points Thursday. If they invert, with the 2-year yield moving above the 10-year, that would be taken as a recession warning.

# Yield Curves Near Inversion

&gt; On Tuesday, the front end of the yield curve inverted as 3-year yields rose above 5-year yields. Other front end curves, by that measure, while not there yet, have also begun to dip to cycle lows. The 10-year minus 3-month spread is at its lowest level since 2007. Despite being at a low for the current cycle, the curve remains around 40 bps from inversion.

&gt; In the charts below we look at various yield curves over the past 15 years; this time frame allows us to see the curve’s movement leading up to the last recession.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-3Ms10s.png))**

&gt; Perhaps the most widely followed curve, the 10 year versus the 2-year spread, is also at levels it has not seen since 2007. Although it is picking up slightly today as yields across the board fall, 2s10s is looking much more ominous at only 13 bps away from becoming inverted. This will be the main curve that investors will keep their eyes on; expect to see it ad nauseam in headlines if it moves those 13 bps lower.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-2s10s.png))**

&gt; Shifting our focus to the longer end of the curve, spreads are off of lows from earlier in the year, but may not have quite bottomed just yet. The 10-year versus the 5-year spread has recently fallen back down towards these lows.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/120618-5s10s.png))**

&gt; Even longer maturities like the 30-year versus the 10-year have a higher spread still and has much more clearly made a bottom. It is important to note, leading up to the previous recession this curve was not inverted for long. Most of the bottoming occurred with a normal—albeit very flat—curve.

# Time for Santa?

&gt; 2018 has been a rocky year with a big dose of volatility, but could a late-year rally be in store for investors? History says it is quite possible. “Although the well-known Santa Claus rally is technically the last five days of the year and the first two of the new year, you can’t deny the fact that December tends to bring with it good vibes and stocks gains,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, no month has a higher average return or has been higher more often than the month of December.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/santa-comes-in-december.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; With Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opening the door to potentially fewer interest rate hikes in 2019, the last component likely needed for a rally is some type of agreement between the United States and China regarding the ongoing trade issues. Given the G20 summit is this weekend, many are expecting some type of potential resolution to be announced. Stay tuned!

&gt; Last, an interesting stat: December has never been the worst month of the year for stocks. That’s right—since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 Index has never had its largest monthly drop in December. Given that the worst month this year was October with its 6.9% drop, history would say to not expect a similar big drop to end 2018.

# Typical December Trading: Strength Early and Late, Choppy Between

&gt; Historically, the second trading day of December, today, has been a modestly bullish day with S&amp;P 500 advancing 36 times over the last 68 years (since 1950) with an average gain of 0.13%. To find a worse second trading day of December, you would have to go all the way back to 1932 when S&amp;P 500 dropped 3.86%. Trade remains a concern, but today’s sell off appears to have been triggered by economic growth fears caused by a flattening Treasury yield curve and 5-year yields dipping below 2-year yields. As we have repeatedly noted, the Fed is the biggest risk to the market and the economy.

&gt; These fears could lead to a larger than usual amount of choppy trading during the first half of December. Historically December has opened with strength and gains over its first five trading days before beginning to drift. By mid-month all five indices have surrendered any early-month gains, but shortly thereafter Santa usually visits sending the market higher until the last day of the month and the year.

personalfinance,Do I have to pay taxes for self employment income under the standard deduction?,"I have been working as a W2 last year until December 31. On January 1, I started being self employed. I made $72k this year in gross income but I deducted expenses aggressively and the net income is around $19k. My wife just started a W2 job 2 weeks ago, will get two paychecks by the end of the year, thus eliminating her tax liability. She filled out the W-4 with 2 exemptions, so her employer will take out federal taxes that will probably be refunded in 2019. We will be filing married jointly. No kids or dependents. 

My question is, will I have any federal tax liability from self employment? Correct me if I’m wrong, but I know that income under the standard deduction does not have federal taxes to pay. I also live in WA state, so no income tax either. What taxes will I have to pay? I did not make estimated payments.",finance

I'm currently $7.2k in credit card debt, with interest rate at 9.5%APR. I also have a used car loan with roughly $8k remaining(59 monthly payments- no early payment fees either) and 5.03%APR. I have $27k in student loans, my first payment due the 17th of December, 2018. 

For savings, I have roughly $9k in ESOP that I should receive once I officially leave my current company. I also have a 401k and Roth 401k.

I'M 26 and have been winging this whole adult thing by myself since I was 18. I feel like I'm in an ok situation, but I feel like this debt is a huge burden on my shoulders. My gf has one year left of school so her student loans, though only about $20k, are pending too. Please send help!",finance

personalfinance,Mother and Adjustable Rate Mortage,"My mother (mid 50's) moved and bought a house about 6 years ago for about $135k. She was able to make a fairly large down payment, probably about $70k from selling her old house in another state. She is disabled and has a social security income as well as state health insurance, but it's simply not enough to live on. My sister and I give her some money every   
 month, and she has a boyfriend who pays her some rent (about half the mortgage and utilities). She's on food stamps. With the extra income, she's able to live ok, and most of the time is budget conscious, e.g. she cut the cable cord last year, but sometimes she makes stupid financial decisions. I just found out her mortgage is adjustable rate and the payment is now $560/month, up about $200/month from 1-2 years ago. She also took out a home equity loan about 6 months ago for $20k for some unnecessary home improvements (one of the ""stupid financial decisions"", I didn't know about this until recently...I think she's an easy target, so gets taken advantage of), and she doesn't remember what the interest rate on that is. She tries to pay about $100/month on that, but she doesn't have any more than that left over per month, and 0 savings. She just can't afford for the mortgage payment to go up much more. 

Any advice on what to do about the adjustable rate mortgage or the home equity loan?

Other possibly relevant info:

She can't hold a steady job due to the disability.

She tried to sell her house and buy a smaller one about two years ago, but couldn't find a buyer who was willing to pay more than the cost of buying the small house. I think she overpaid for her current house by quite a lot.

personalfinance,"Thoughts on ""Revolving Debt Avalanche"" Payment Plan?","Hi Everyone,

I have three credit cards with approximately the same balance but different interest rates.  From what I understand about the Debt Avalanche method, I would pay off whichever account has the most interest before moving on to the next.  That mathematically makes sense to me.

Here's what I'm stuck on... do you revolve your avalanche or stick to the account with highest interest, regardless of balance?

Example:
If I pay $1000 every month on the account with highest interest, eventually the other accounts with lower interest rates will have a higher balance and therefore charge more interest. So, when that happens it makes sense to switch the account that I'm focusing payments on, right?

I put together a tentative spreadsheet, and it looks like I would be switching the ""avalanche"" account every two months or so.

Has anyone had this strategy before? Or, do you focus on one account at a time regardless of the balance?  If you've done a debt avalanche, whether ""revolving"" or regular, I'd love to hear any advice you have on managing/tracking that.

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Does it matter which spouse we get health insurance from?,"I got married this year and my wife and I are trying to figure out open season for next year.  We are both federal employees so our health plans cost the same and are the same options regardless of which of us signs up for insurance.  My salary is over the social security cap so that social security taxes are not deducted from my paycheck at the end of the year.  My wife is under that cap and pays social security taxes all year.

&amp;#x200B;

If we get insurance through my wife rather than me, does that effectively save us 6.2% of the premium?  My thinking is that since the money comes out pre-tax, reducing my salary exposes more of our income to FICA taxes whereas reducing hers should have no effect.  It should come out in a wash income tax wise since we file jointly.

&amp;#x200B;

If that's true, does the same apply to FSA deductions and the like?  Is it better to put $1,000 in her FSA instead of $500 for both.

personalfinance,Best approach to obtain a (used) car with no credit history?,"I moved to the US on an L-1B visa a little over a month ago and obviously that's not enough time to build up a good credit score.

Currently, I have a temporary car, but this is a benefit that will end in a few weeks and thus I started to look into the different options that I have.

My initial idea was to lease a car for $250 p/m or less, but it seems to be very hard to find anything at all that meets my requirements (no down payment, 2 year contract, 15000+ miles per year), so I pretty much scratched that idea. I'm also unsure if my lack of credit history would even make this possible.

I'm now looking into purchasing a used car. Coming from a country where the majority of the payments are usually made through debit card, I have the habit to only spend what I have readily available. For a car that would enable me to spend ~8-10k out of pocket - enough for a not-too-old compact car. However, I got the advice from someone to actually get part of the car payment financed, as that would be good for my credit score. Without any credit history this financing would be tied to &gt;20% interest rates and that feels, with my current mindset, like throwing away money.

I'm still trying to somewhat adjust my mindset to one more geared towards establishing credit score, so I could use some advice regarding the above dilemma: what would be the best move to make for me that will get me the best of both worlds (no excessive amounts lost in paying off a loan vs an opportunity to increase my credit score)?",finance
personalfinance,401k Rollover Mistake Advice,"I have monitored this group for some time and have gotten a ton of good information from it.

She cashed out a \~55k 401k and immediately deposited the resulting \~44k in a Roth IRA in 2016.  The IRS now says that we owe \~17.6k and a 1.4k penalty on this.  Is there any way to make this right?  If we do have to pay the penalty, can we withdraw money from the Roth IRA without incurring penalty on that withdrawal?

&amp;#x200B;

Update:  I have the original 1099-R and some more exact information.

Filled in 1099-R fields :

1) Gross Distribution: 53,152.74

2a) Taxable Amount: 53,152.74

2b) Total Distribution X

4) Federal income tax withheld: 10,630.55

7) Distribution code(s): 1

14) State distribution: 53,152.74

&amp;#x200B;

The Notice of Deficiency form the IRS states:

Increase in tax (deficiency): 17,630

Substantial tax understatement penalty: 1,400

The deficiency is stated as an increase in tax and is not the amount they are stating that is owed.  That amount is $10,630 which is the amount withheld on the 1099-R.

It looks like they are correcting taxable income (line 43) from 26,189 to 80,032

and thus increasing tax liability to 16,232 from 5,602 which is a difference of 10,630.55

&amp;#x200B;

So, I think she just filed her taxes incorrectly and didn't include the 1099-R like she should have.  Is that something that can be fixed with an amendment at this point?

personalfinance,"Reflection on opportunity costs of graduate school, from a physician.","Hey PF, have lurked on this sub for a while.  I'm a practicing physician.  When I went to medical school, I spent a lot of time thinking about the opportunity cost of medical school.  Maybe ruminated on it too much, possibly.  Recently, I have returned to this as I start thinking about saving for retirement.  I figured I would share some of my thoughts, for anyone that is thinking about possibly going to graduate school.  At the time, thinking about this stuff made me incredibly pessimistic about going to medical school, but fortunately, I now love what I do, and there are more important things that money at the end of the day.

To start, I decided to model retirement savings as a continuous function.  This would be ignoring the volatility of investing, but greatly simplifies the model, and I wanted to keep it simple.

If you assume that the rate of savings over time is equal to income plus savings * interest, then ...

dS/dt = income + savings x interest x t

Solving this differential equation gives the following.

S[t] = (Exp[interest*t]-1)*(income/interest)

Now that we have an expression for compounded savings, we can solve for savings as a function of time, for a given interest rate, with a given rate of contributions.

For example, at the prevailing rate of return of the S&amp;P 500 over the past 30 years has been approximately 8.5% annually.  For example, investing 10000 USD / year over 15 years should yield approximately 300000 USD at the end of that period.

So with this we can calculate the opportunity cost of attending graduate school, by considering two scenarios. In one, the ORIGINAL scenario, you start working out of college (we'll assume debt free) and start saving at some rate.  Because you are not going into debt, you immediately start accruing savings.

The ALTERNATIVE scenario, you decide to go to medical school (or some other expensive graduate school), requiring you to not just forgo income, but also possibly to incur debt for tuition.  In this scenario, your net worth becomes initially negative, and you only achieve zero net some time after graduating from school.

To keep the model simple, I didn't bother to take into account the specifics of debt accrual or repayment.  Again, too complicated.  Rather, I decided to use the delay between starting saving between the two scenarios as an input to the model.  For the ORIGINAL scenario, you would start saving right after college.  For the ALTERNATIVE scenario, you would start effectively saving for retirement when the last of your loans were paid off.  So a reasonable assumption would be a delay of 10 years - 4 years for medical school, 4 years of residency (presumably just paying small amounts on the loans), and then 2 years of being an attending, when the bulk of the loans would be paid.

Since we have a function that approximates savings as a function of time, we can solve for WHEN the savings of the alternative scenario, catches up with the ORIGINAL scenario.

So if we express the above function as Savings[time,interest,income] ...
Then we can consider an example scenario.

Savings[10+t,0.085,10000]==Savings[t,0.085,30000]

Solving for t numerically yields approximately 13 years.

To summarize, this considers how long after reaching zero net worth, it would take for a medical school graduate to catch up to someone saving right out of college, assuming the physician started saving 3x as much after paying off the last of your loans.  The term 10, is the delay between starting medical school (when the original scenario would start saving), and completing paying off loans (when the alternative scenario would start saving).  As you can see, even by saving at a rate three times faster, it still takes almost 13 years to catch up.  To contextualize this, assuming you start medical school at 21 (right after college), you wouldn't break even until age 44 years, 23 years later!

The above specific scenario involves several fairly aggressive assumptions.  First of all, this assumes that after 4 years of medical school, and 4 years of residency, you are managing to pay off all of your loans (however large) in only a further 2 years of being an attending physician.  Not necessarily impossible, but possibly difficult depending on how much debt is incurred.
Intuitively, the longer that the higher income of the alternative scenario is differed, the larger the opportunity cost.  Plugging in another set of values confirms this.

For example, if it took you 4 years of being an attending to fully pay off your loans (i.e. achieve zero net worth), then, assuming you're still saving 3x as much.

Savings[12+t,0.085,10000]==Savings[t,0.085,30000]

Where 12 represents 12 years consisting of 8 years of medical school and residency, and 4 years of being an attending.

Solving for t gives 25.6 years, which again assuming you go to medical school right out of college, would mean that you would catch up with the ORIGINAL scenario at age 58 years, approximately 37 years after starting medical school!

And again, this is assuming that you go immediately to medical school without any delays, and it's still assuming a somewhat aggressive strategy for paying off loans.

Alternatively, we can assume that we want to catch up after a certain delay, and solve for the multiple of income required to break even.

For example, let's say we plan on paying off loans 3 years after finishing residency, so a lag time of 11 years (4+4+3 years).  If we were going to save 10k per year in the original scenario, and we want to catch up 20 years after achieving net worth, how much would we need to save in the ALTERNATIVE scenario, to catch up at age 52 (assuming we started medical school at age 21).

Savings[20+11,0.085,10000]=Savings[20,0.085,x]

Numerically solving for x gives us a value 28.9 k USD / year.

So, in other words, to break even by age 52, you would need to save almost three times as much as the original scenario.

Rather than numerically solving, it's also possible to solve for a symbolic expression that describes the multiple savings rate required, as a function of the delay to reaching zero net worth (the lag), prevailing interest rate, and the time from reaching zero net worth to catching up to the ORIGINAL scenario (the term).

I called the multiple required to catch up, alpha.

alpha =  (Exp((Lag + Term) x interest)-1)/(Exp(Interest x term)-1)

Solving for the same values as the previous example shows consistent a consistent result.

alpha = 2.89

Notice that alpha grows exponentially the longer one takes to fully pay off loans.

It's worth considering the numbers if there is a large lag time until loans are paid off.  For example, I heard of an attending where I did my residency who didn't pay off his loans until his 40s.  Assuming he went to medical school in his mid 20s, and paid off his loans in his early 40s.  Lets assume he wants to be done working by age 70.

Lag time = 42-25 = 17 years
Term = 70-42 = 28 years
Interest = 0.085

With these values, alpha is 4.6.  Thus, he would need to save this multiple to catch up by age 70!  Realistically, he may end up just saving at a lower multiple, and therefore never catching up with what he would have made if he had just started working out of college.

There are obviously several drawbacks to this model.  The greatest of these is that it assumes continuous uninterrupted gains from investing.  Obviously not true, especially recently.  However, over the long run the stock market is a biased random process, so on average, this should be reasonably OK approximation for this model.

I guess the reason I felt like sharing this, was that I had only considered this after enrolling in medical school.  It felt like that was too late to have considered this stuff.  I was already committed at that point, mentally and financially.  Honestly, when I finally considered this, it scared me.  I felt like I was drowning in six-figure debt for over a decade.  Even if you think about it, and you have a plan, it's scary to be that far in debt.  And one of the things my model didn't cover was the fact that you might not like what do do as a physician when your done.  Fortunately, I love what I do, but several of my classmates either dropped out, or switched into different fields after finishing medical school.   They'll probably never recover from such a huge loss.  I'm sure they'll make ends meet, but they'll most likely never catch up to where they would have been if they had just gotten a job out of college.

Anyways, if any of you are considering going to graduate school, I'd just suggest being extremely dispassionate about the costs, particularly the opportunity costs, both in time and money.  The cost of tuition is only part of the picture.  The other thing is, people everywhere assume that doctors make tons of money.  While in general we're well paid, remember that that lag between making that salary can be significant.  A physician making 200k per year, with an alpha of 3, is almost like someone making 66k per year, after considering the opportunity cost.  

Just my two cents.",finance

personalfinance,"Great job offer, good financial decision?","Kind of a weird situation, looking for some feedback here...

**Background**

I work in engineering, and have been with the same company for over 10 years, started at the bottom, and am now one of the sole design engineers. I'm in my late 20's, graduated three years ago after working my way through school (took me a while). I got an average pay bump to ""entry level"" when I officially moved into the engineering department after graduation, but it's a small company so I had been working in the department ""unofficially"" prior to this. 

I'd say that I've done pretty damn well in my position. My supervisor has consistently told me that I'm a stand out engineer. I've been put in charge of all recent major mechanical product releases, and just about all of the current product improvements have been because of my ideas or come from me pushing these changes through. Not only that but I get sent out to work on our equipment/manage installations at an international scale. I even increased and sales/service in the local region by building up relationships with all the equipment owners and doing the service myself. I consistently work over 55 hours a week, and try to show up early every day.

I asked for a raise about a year ago and was told ""no, no money for raises."" I'm still paid entry level, which is **65k**, I've never received a bonus, not once entire 10+ yr. career. My attitude definitely changed after they shot me down, and I did tell my manager that I was disappointed in their decision. 

**Today**

The company was acquired by a huge international corporation, and of course they are telling everyone that they've got secure jobs. When I first found out I started hoarding money and putting my feelers out there with my resume.

They flew me out to the HQ and spent weeks going through training and meetings, telling me I'd become a ""product manager"", but nothing official yet. I DO hold some of the most critical knowledge about the product and process.  I think I'll have a job for at least 1 to 1.5 years until everything is stripped. After that, there may be opportunities in this company elsewhere, but I'd have to move, possibly cross-country.

During this trip, I actually got a great job offer from one of my ""feelers"".

**Pros**

\- 30% salary increase

\- up to 15% annual bonus

\- similar benefits

\- flex schedule (I can work 5x8 or 4x10, and leave early as long as I get my work done and make it to the morning meetings)

\- Small lean company operation, with big company support. 

**Cons**

\- my commute doubles for now: 35 minutes increased to 70 minutes, all country roads w/ no traffic. 25 miles each way to 50

(I can eventually move closer and rent out my current place)

\- ??? that commute.

**Current** **Finances**

$1830 take home pay every 2 weeks (after 401k, and medical, etc)

$850 per month in property tax/insurance for my current house, no mortgage. I ""rent"" from my parents, but they left me the house.

$40k in federal student loans, which I pay 3X the minimum on.

1 year E-Fund, (about 25k)

About 35K cash in other accounts.

Cost to commute is $579 per month (gas, wear and tear)

Right now I am able to save around $1000  per month after all expenses. I have really gotten tight on my budget this year all thanks to PF.

**New Finances**

$2316 take home pay every 2 weeks (after 401k, etc.)

My gas and vehicle operating costs double from the commute, (I may need a different car too, I am still driving my shitbox from university.)

Cost to commute is $1450 per month? Yikes. (gas, wear and tear) $1100 if I can actually do 4X10 schedule, even less if I can get a more efficient vehicle.

Everything else remains the same.

With this new job roughly I may be able to stash about 2k a month after expenses?

**Thoughts**

My current company does not deserve me at my entry level salary.

I feel like I could grind this out, knock out my student loans even faster, and actually be able to afford to move closer to the new job to kill that 1 hour commute. Hell, I could landlord my current place if I move. There aren't many engineering job opportunities in my area, so I'd have to move anyways if I were to get a different job. 

I could pass on this opportunity and see what happens with the acquisition. The new company is interesting, and has some cool perks, but my gut is telling me not to listen to all the sunshine and rainbow promises coming from the new overlords.

What am I missing? I have tried to factor increased transportation costs here, I know the commute is going to wear on me eventually, and damn its costly, it almost seems like it could totally cancel out the increase in take home unless I move. Housing is not cheap here, it's 200k for a shack, and 300k+ for a ""livable home"". Rent is worse, but either way I'd be looking at increasing my housing cost significantly if I move closer to a new job. I do want to eventually move, I am sick of living so far from town.",finance
personalfinance,How much of a hit would our credit scores take if we closed longstanding credit cards (one since 2012 and one since 2017). Both husband and I have good credit scores (670-739 FICO),"Does anyone know how much of a hit my husband’s and my credit scores would take if we closed our current credit cards and got a new one?

I have two credit cards (one rewards and one cash back) from my credit union that I share with my husband. These are the only two credit cards we have. I am the primary account holder on both. He is joint on one of the cards (cash back) and an authorized user on the other (rewards). Both of us have good FICO credit scores (670 - 739) and have zero debt of any kind (credit card, mortgage, student loans etc.). We have had the rewards card since 2012 and the cash back card since 2017. The credit limit on the rewards card is $1500 and on the cash back is $5000. We always pay off our credit card balances in full at the end of the month. We charge about $1000- $2000 total (both cards) per month. 

I am trying to close these cards because my credit union has effed up transactions with these cards so many times that we are fed up.
I am trying to decide between two options :
1.	Close both cards if the hit to the credit score is minimal or can be recovered easily.
2.	Keep both cards open by having a small recurring charge on each card every month (phone bill and streaming service) for a few years until we have built up enough history with the new card and then closing the older ones.

We are probably going to get a Chase cash back card and be joint card holders. Still trying to figure out if this is the best card for us.

personalfinance,"How can i tackle 19,000 in credit card debt and remain sane?","i thought i had a good ballpark idea of my credit card debt status, when i clearly did not. i recently added the numbers and it comes up to $19,000. I wanted to sink into myself until i was nothing.  now im trying to figure out what to do. honestly i feel so overwhelmed that it's hard to stay focused and clearly think so i'm hoping some of you might have better ideas. let's go over the facts:

- income : ~$43k a year

four credit cards:

- citi (26 apr/$800 balance)
- discover (24 apr/$11,400 balance)
- chase (19 apr/ $3,300 balance)
- visa (18 apr/ $3,800 balance)

credit: 638-689 (these come from the credit checks my credit card companies provide monthly) 

ive been averaging how much money ive put into my credit card payments the last 6 months, and it's come out to 500 a month (however its been an upward trend lately which is why it has me worried). 


i first considered a balance transfer to another credit card, but ive been reading more about personal loans for debt consolidation. it seems online companies offer better rates and plans than banks, so i tried some out. so far ive tried sofi - (rejected;didnt meet credit score min.) and marcus as they have 0 origination fee, history of good service, and no early payoff fees. i had considered lightstream but it seems they do a hard pull so i'm gonna hold off on trying them for now. 

marcus provided plans that all would have me paying way more than what i already pay, and for some at a high apr rate (23%). 

my next thought was instead of asking for $19,000, i instead ask for smaller amounts to cover one or two credit cards.  Yet the payments required by marcus would still put me over my $500 a month limit 

[$500 is my limit on what i can pay monthly based on what i worked out from my budget. i will go back and see what else i can cut out, and i'll be selling things i have, and work more when possible, but i didn't want to count on these things as i can't for sure reliably count on having those extra dollars above $500 to pay each month]

it seems my credit score is why i'm getting rejected, or high apr offers.  

so going forward here are things i'm considering:

- check other online companies for personal loans- even ones with origination fees.
- check with banks- such as usaa, and take up the opportunity to make an account with navy federal credit union and try with them
- if no offers come back that can accept the whole amount, then do a smaller loan for an apr that still is less, and can fit in my payment limit
- consider a balance transfer with a new credit card. see how much i could guarantee to pay off within their 0 apr intro period. this would 
 only help chew down a small piece of the debt, but nonetheless a piece with 0 apr + balance transfer fee.  
- buy a bag of rice, hunker down, and just start living every second by saving or making a dollar (which regardless, im still going to do, but this would be to the most extreme effort i could muster), try to improve my credit score, and try to get a loan further down the line. 


right now i guess im looking for what actions do i need to do to get ready to go in and start fighting. i know as more gets paid off, i can start adding on to my payments, and start snowballing, but for the moment, i just want to start the ball rolling and make sure into the right direction. if anyone has any ideas, recommendations or, well, anything that you think could help, i would greatly appreciate it.",finance

personalfinance,Should I refinance considering my future plans with medical school?,"Hello all, I've been reading up throughout the subreddit with regards to the pros/cons of refinancing a combination of student loans. I'm trying to make the best decision for my future and well being so I'm hoping to get some advice here that is tailored to my personal situation:

Yesterday I entered my first bout of loan repayments. Deferment season has officially ended.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently owe $72,500 to the banks for educational loans, no other debts outstanding

$44,600 of that is private loans through citizen bank-- this is the culmination of borrowing roughly $14,000 dollars a year for three years for school. My parents paid for the first year so I didn't have to worry about that

$27,000 of the money I owe represents the federal student loans I have.

&amp;#x200B;

The private student loans from CitizenBank have a 6.05%, 5.04% and 7.74% interest rate for each year, (sophomore through senior) respectively. I believe they are all variable, and are all cosigned under my mom which I would like to free her from.

&amp;#x200B;

My current monthly payment for the Federal loans is $286/month

My current monthly payment for the CitizenBank private loans (cumulatively) is $405/month

My total monthly payment minimum therefore is roughly $700/month

&amp;#x200B;

At the moment I'm employed with potential to go full time at $15/hour, so I can make $2400 a month pre tax--

What I need help with is making a smart decision due to my **plans**. At the moment I'm working part-time due to my commitment to studying for the MCAT-- **my long term life plan (next 10 years)** is essentially to matriculate into medical school in August of 2020, at that point taking out more loans to cover the cost of medical school. At this point, all my existing loans will re-enter into a deferment period if I understand this correctly. After my exam in January, I'll enter full time work and begin working on applications/living life like a normal, generationally relevant 23 year old dude who's also writing a novel on the side and lives with his parents (&gt;!I own a subaru!&lt;). With this in mind, I'm not sure if I should refinance or not... I'm not sure which path would allow me the best outcome as well as most flexibility.

My plan at the moment is to refinance all of the private loans at a lower interest rate so that I have as low of a monthly repayment minimum as possible that I can get at a fixed rate. This will allow me to not stress about life events (random job loss, illness, etc) as well as live a better standard of living (vacations, gifts, food). During the good times I wouldn't hesitate to commit larger payments so that I can get this beast down. During the bad times I wouldn't be too strapped for cash. Philosophical arguments aside, are there any financial detriments to this plan that I'm not seeing?

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn't refinance the federal loans because that would kill off some of those federal benefits... however, the financial planner I met with (family friend, classic Italian) recommended throwing all $77,000 of the loan into a refinance program and leave the fed. What do you all think? Advice?

&amp;#x200B;

**Essentially, I plan on shouldering $200,000 more debt in 2 years from medical school, should I refinance so that I can live a more free life now without immense detriment later?

personalfinance,Why You Shouldn't Buy A Car,"Cars need so much responsibility. There's car insurance, maintenance, and gas. That all racks up, just for one asset.

There's also a thing called depreciation. Like if you get the car, and it's younger than 5 years old, then you'll have to pay the same interest rate for every year you own that car, no matter how old it is.

Alternative methods? For short-distance places, you can just use a bike. If it's medium-distance or long-distance, then there's tons of options to have you covered if you live in a city, from the train to the water taxi. But most of us don't live in major cities, so for that, you can just Uber. Yes, over time, researchers say, you'll still spend less with Uber or another similar service, as opposed to just owning a car.

One more thing to consider: Commuting. It's a process that can be really painful - and can really be a long time. In some instances, just simply taking a bike calls for smaller commuting times.

A car is usually your second biggest asset, and the simplicity of saving on this is mind-blowing. So, if you really want to drive a car, then I'd just go for one that's affordable, and older than 5 years. If you want a car that's younger than 5 years old, then I'd make sure I'm doing well financially.",finance

personalfinance,Low Credit. Any tips?,"Ok - so, with the new year coming up and some major changes coming mid January, it's time I sit down and start to re-evaluate my spending habits and try to recover from the debt hole I put myself in. 

My current credit score is sitting around 543, and have three credit cards with fairly low balances - but, because of my current pay rate ($13.50/Hr), it makes it quite difficult for me to pay things off in large chunks. I'm 26 and reality just hit that I need to start changing some habits now and save money if I want to have some cushion cash in case something major were to happen. 

I'm currently in a position where I may get a promotion and my pay rate will be increasing, not much, but with the pay rate possibly increasing to $15-$16 an hour - this will slightly give me that extra push to pay off a bit more to the current debt. I'll know more next week, as I've already had my interview with my employer for the position. 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently living with my folks, but will be moving into my own apartment come January 17, 2018.

Rent will be $705.

Spending habits... I eat out a LOT. I'm terrible at cooking, and with me working overnights - it's quite difficult for me to muster up the energy to head out to the grocery store during rush hour traffic (aka lazy). Not to mention our stove is not functioning, and our fridge just broke down. (New stove and fridge arriving end of December) So currently, cooking isn't really an option until we get a replacement)

Looking at my current statement, I spend at least $100-$150 on take out food every two weeks.... 

I'm also incredibly bad when it comes to impulse buys. big gamer here so... when it comes to steam and PSN sales..... I end up spending around $100 a month on games. 

Fully aware of all my bad spending habits, doing my best to tackle these things one by one, since I'm not going anywhere with my current habits. Nothing I can do about the past, only fix it and move on. 

There are some medical debts sitting in collections - I don't have the paper work in front of me, as I am at working as of writing this post, but I believe my medical debt has piled up to around $12,XXX. 

&amp;#x200B;

one thing to note, starting january, I'll be having to pay $302 for insurance through my employer. I had to get the highest plan available, as I do have pre existing conditions, and medication that wont be covered in the lower plans.

I have a few questions that I'm hoping I can get some info/guidance on. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. I don't have a 401k. I've never been explained as to what exactly a 401k does, but I have also not made much of an effort to seek out information. This changes now. What are the benefits to having a 401K? And how does it work? 
2. As I have three credit cards, I'm trying my best to pay the lower ones first, one at a time, paying minimum on two cards, and then paying about $150 - $200 on one card. Once I get these cards paid off - I'm thinking of cancelling one, as their Interest rates are pretty high, and I get almost no benefits from these cards. I know cancelling a CC will hurt my credit, but - what do I do in an instance like this? I wan't to have a CC that'll accrue points for travelling - but, I don't want to open up a new line of credit. What will be the best route to go from here? 
3. As the title says, I do have low credit. What will be the best ways to raise my credit score? I know bringing down my CCs and usage down will help. But - is there anything I can do to help speed up the process? 
4. Would a small personal loan help in getting my CC's paid off? And is it worth it? (Since my CC debt is pretty small) 
5. Does Medical debt in collections affect your credit score? I have been told mixed things, and I kind of want to have a little clarity on this.

personalfinance,Am I missing something here with mortgage payment amounts?,"Hi, i was just checking around houses on zillow just to see what I'd be paying if I bought. I found a nice 225k house.

Why is my payment more then double? Taxes/fees and interest can't raise my rent by more then 100% can it?

personalfinance,What is the big deal about bad credit?,"Ok, up front, I'm really not trying to be an asshole. I know it comes across that way, but it's not the intention. I've just asked many people in my family, and nobody can adequatley explain this to me. So, in the least douchey way possible, can you guys explain to me what is so terrible about bad credit?

The story: I am 24 years old, and in April I quit my job to fulfill my dream of traveling the world. And no, I'm not a trust fund kid, I got working holiday visas and I work to fund my travel. It's been going great, EXCEPT I have a car that I leased in 2017 when I had a stable job. I've been making the payments, but it is frustrating because I do not plan to ever drive the car again. I asked my mother if she could sell it for me. She took it to the dealership, and the gist of it is it will cost 3500 to get out of my lease. That's money I really dont have.

Now, I'm of the mind to just not pay. What are they gonna do? I'm thousands of miles away. And more to the point, I just dont have the money. My mom says my credit card interest rates will go up, but what if I dont pay that either? Like, they can charge me as much as they want but if I dont have anything to give what can these companies do? You cant get blood from a stone, as they say. I understand doing this will result in the dreaded ""bad credit,"" but so what? I've googled it, and so far the biggest penalties I can find are ""interest rates on loans are higher,"" and ""it will be harder to get a mortgage."" But here's the thing. I dont want a mortgage, or loans, or another new car, or kids, or any of the trappings of the good 21st century american life. And no, it's not because im a stupid 24 year old. I decided a long time ago that being weighed down by all those bills wasnt for me. I saw it shave years off my parent's life and I dont want or need that kind of thing. Im not looking for a lecture of how I'm being irresponsible by not getting a house - I get that from my parents all the time and frankly I think they're full of it. I'd like to know the real, tangible concequences of bad credit, and if any of it can actually harm me in the long run if i do not plan on purchasing big ticket items that require credit. Because it seems like this credit business is a way to trap people in a cycle of debt, but if I dont wanna buy stuff, then what does it matter what my credit is?

Thanks guys. Have a great day

EDIT: I was gonna respond to each of you, but its basically the same message so I'm gonna say it here, to everyone who commented. Thanks guys! This was exactly what i was looking for. You really roasted the shit out of me, but you answered my question, and sometimes the truth is a little roasty. I feel like I have a bunch of disapointed dads right now. I'm sorry, internet dads!

- Effect a down payment may have on interest rate?

- Inflation
- Other factors I may be missing that one should take into consideration

personalfinance,"In the near future I want to refinance my auto loan, change financial institutions, get (hopefully) a credit card, shop around for new auto insurance and get a health insurance plan. I'm rather lost on how best to proceed.","I guess the best place to start is in August of 2016. The car that I'd had for nearly 10 years finally died and I had to get a new (to me) one. Walked to a dealership by work on lunch and two days later I drove home in a 2012 Nissan. I got a pretty terrible interest rate through a shady company because at the time I effectively had no credit. My report had one hard inquiry on it, that's it. I should have shopped around more but I was just happy to be able to get something.

I can afford the payment - I've actually paid ~$25 more than the minimum every month - but between that, rent and auto insurance I'm not left with much to live on so I want to refinance. My intention would be to continue making my current payment and just get this debt gone ASAP.

Related to the car, I need to shop around for new auto insurance. Not happy with my current insurer and at least want to see if I could do better somewhere else.

Then I figure as long as am doing this financial stuff, I might as well change financial institutions as well because I've long been miffed with Bank of America over various things but have always been too lazy to actually go about doing anything about it. My plan would be to just open new accounts with whoever I refinance with but I'm open to other options. Don't need much as I'm cash and debit card only, no paper checks and no investments.

I would also like to find a credit card. I had one in my early 20s for a while and was irresponsible with it but I've become much more disciplined in the 20-some years since. Outside of necessities I agonize over most purchases and go into shutdown mode when needed. I'd just like a card for a little breathing room in case of emergency. My idea would be to use the card like I use my debit card now but pay everything off immediately. So the card would be used regularly - hopefully earning some rewards for groceries or something - but I'd never actually be in debt.

On top of all this my health insurance coverage from my employer is ending. To somewhat offset losing my health insurance my employer has said they will give me a $2/hour raise. They are being fairly flexible but as of now we've agreed to end it at the end of the year. So I need to get a new plan. I was looking at healthcare.gov last night and it was making my head swim a bit. I'd kind of like a plan of attack for the rest of it before I dive back in.

Equifax has me at 679, TransUnion via NerdWallet has me at 663 while Discover Scorecard has a FICO of 725. (As an aside I understand some of why those #s are different but 663 to 725 seems like a huge difference.) Outside of my auto loan the only other thing currently on my credit report is a hard inquiry from November of 2017, when I didn't get approved for an Amazon card through Chase.

To finally get to some questions:

 - What do I do first? I've done the little simulations with NerdWallet and CreditKarma that show how my credit might change if I get a new card or something, but they only have options for getting a new auto loan, not refinancing an existing one. They say a new loan would put my credit score in the 500s, what does a refinance do? On the other hand they say getting a card with even a $300 limit would jump me into the 700s. Shoud I start there?

 - Should I shop for auto insurance now or wait until I potentially raise my score a good bit?

 - Should I hold off entirely until I have a few pay stubs showing what I'm making at my increased hourly rate? That could be a few months due to the raise not being in effect yet - and maybe not until after the new year - combined with bi-weekly pay. I would really like to get some of this taken care of as soon as I can but am willing to wait if it could be beneficial.

 - For the health insurance, should I use all of the premium tax credit to lower my monthly payment? That seems the best option financially but I'm not sure what it will do to my year end taxes.

Thank you for reading at least some of my disjointed novella. I'm sure I've missed out on a lot important information; I'll do my best to answer any questions.

personalfinance,Should I pay off my student loan?,"Hello r/personalfinance!

In short I have just over £14,000 left on my student loan at 1.5% APR. I currently pay back just over £400 a month which comes out of my income before tax (this is how it works in the U.K).

I am in a position where I could settle the entire loan right now, but I'm not sure it's the best choice to make for the following:

1. The interest rate is fixed and is below inflation
2. I would not take home an extra £400 a month once paid off because once I pay it off that £400 would now become income and therefore taxable at 40%, which means I would take home an extra £240 each month
3. I could put the money into a Vanguard ISA account and earn a return &gt; 1.5%

However, this is my only other outstanding debt and by paying this off I would technically be debt free.

2.lower tax liability with mortgage payments or just use standard deduction?
3.lower tax liability due to $2k in stock losses

Hello everyone I've got a couple questions I'm having trouble finding answers too I was hoping someone here would know or could point me in the right direction. I understand you're not all CPA's but you may know more than me.

My fiance and I got engaged earlier in the year and were originally planning on getting married around the end of 2019 but an opportunity came that let us by a house earlier than planned so we just closed on our property in the middle of October and now we're not focused on the wedding exactly what date it'll be because this was a big step and we want to get settled in to our new house.

We've talked about the idea of just getting married in the courthouse and then depending on how much extra savings we have next year to just have a reception but we've both heard that if we get married this year before January 1st the IRS sees us as married the entire year and we can get the benefits so I'm wondering if that's true and what benefits would we get tax wise if we were married this year. I made about $36k this year and my fiance made about $42k but we both started new job late in the year so next year we're expecting to make $51k and $46k respectively if income level changes anything.

2nd question in regards to our home purchase we made our first mortgage payment December 1st so only 1 payment this year I'm guessing it's not worth it to deduct such a small amount and instead opt for the standard deduction which I heard is practically doubling so for future filings would using the interest we paid towards the home beneficial or would we be better off with just the standard? 
Since it's a brand new mortgage most of the payments going towards interest and I'm expecting we'll pay just a little above $12k in interest next year

I've also lost about $2000 in stock this year and I've never traded before so can anyone ELI5 how I report that to the IRS and how I can save money on taxes since I had that loss.

Also how can I better fill out my fed and state tax forms? I've always had at least $500+ from federal returned and usually over $1000 in state taxes because I elect to overpay because I'm so scared of ending up owing but I'd rather have that money in hand through the year than stuck with the IRS",finance
personalfinance,Need help deciding ratios of debt paydown vs. retirement,"Hello all, 

Long-time follower on my main account, this is a throw-away due to the personal nature of this post.

I'm a 31 yo married male with one, 11 month old child. By the end of the year, I will have cleared \~$91,000, and my wife will have cleared \~$21,450.

This past year (2018), I have been paying 3% into a 401k w/ matching 3% from my employer, 1% into my company's stock (sold to us for 10% off), and I maxed out my Roth IRA for the first time this year. My wife also contributes 7% with 7% match into a Roth 403-b. Our total retirement accounts are currently sitting at $70,000 (little bit of a late start to investing, unfortunately).

Our student loans total \~$250,000, mostly at around 6.5% interest rates. The minimum payment is currently \~$2500 per month, with a current ETA to payoff of 12/2030 (\~11 years), assuming we would continue paying the same rate (it is a graduated repayment plan, so this would not be accurate but can suffice for argument's sake). We have paid \~$50,000 toward loans in 2018.

Other considerations are that I 

From crunching the numbers using the Vertex 42 spreadsheet, I have arrived at the following payoff time-frames:

* $3000 per month/extra $500 monthly--03/2028 (\~9.25 years)
   * $36,000 annually total ($6000 extra)
* $4000 per month/extra $1500 monthly--04/2023 (\~6.33 years) 
   * $48,000 annually total ($18,000 extra)
* $5000 per month/extra $2500 monthly--10/2023 (\~4.83 years)
   * $60,000 annually total ($30,000 extra)

My primary questions are: 

**1) should I stop contributing to my 401k, Roth, and company stock in order to maximize my debt payments?** 

**2) are there any calculators out there that can run simulations on the different scenarios of if I increase paying off debt but stop paying into retirement vs. the market losses from not contributing?**

I think we can easily pay the $48,000 a year toward debt, so our current plan is to stop the IRA and the company stock but keep my 401k and her 403b payments going because I don't know that I can bear to miss out on that long without paying into retirement.

I have been working in the nonprofit sector in the northeast since college. For the first four years after college, I was making between 35k and 39k. As of last July, I make 48k. I have a paid-off 2011 Prius with 100k miles on it for which I get all recommended maintenance. Current debt: 0.

Grad school is nonnegotiable - I am nearing my salary / position ceiling without a master's degree. In August, pending a job for my partner, I will be moving to California to get my Master's of Public Policy (MPP) at U.C. Berkeley. Berkeley has the top program in the country for my degree. For some reason, they admitted me, so that's all handled.

I was offered a $20,000 stipend for each year, which brings the total two-year cost for tuition and fees to about $50,000. Factoring in about $25,000 in living expenses for each year (living with partner) brings the total cost to about $100,000. Obviously daunting. I should have about $24,000 saved by then for school. I plan to work through school and (very) conservatively estimate that I’ll bring home $1,000 per month. Otherwise, I’ll be seeking federal loans. My goal is to take out no more than $50,000 in loans - ideally under $40,000.

**Income** 

*Gross Income:* $4,000 (+ $350 side hustle) 

*Pre-Tax Savings:* 

$600 – 403(b) (no employer match in first year) 

$60 – HSA 

*Net Income:* $2,800 

*Post-Tax Savings:* 

$300 – Grad school 

$175 – Saving for move 

Total Monthly Savings = $1,235



**Savings Accounts:** 

Graduate School: $22,000				Goal by July: $24,000 

Emergency Fund: $5,400 (3 months) 

Retirement: $8,300					Goal by July: $12,500 

*Sinking Funds* 

Car Maintenance: $7,000 (Paid for through mileage reimbursements from past jobs) 

Visiting long-distance partner (FY 19): $600 

Move to grad school: $2,000				Goal by July: $5,000 

Future vacations (FY 20 and 21): $2,700 

HSA: $700 



**Current Allocations of Savings:** 

$25,000 in 12-month Ally CD at 1.7% (Matures January 2019) 

$12,000 in Ally Savings Account at 2.0% (APY increased since I started CD) 

$6,300 in Vanguard and Fidelity 403(b) accounts 

$2,000 in IRA (2017 contribution) 

$2,700 in local bank savings account (negligible APY) 




**My questions:** 

1.	Am I allocating my savings correctly?

2.	Should I be doing something more creative with where I put my savings?

3.	Are there any changes I should make before filling out the FAFSA for 2019? I saw someone else advised to max out a Roth IRA for 2018 – why? Should I do this?

personalfinance,Laptop Replacement Denied,"Hello, sorry if this is the wrong sub for this, but I couldn't really think of anywhere else to put it off the top of my head.

So back in August I bought a new laptop at Walmart, along with the 3 year accidental damage plan. When purchasing the laptop, I specifically made sure to ask for the ""ACCIDENTAL DAMAGE plan"" because the laptop I was replacing in the first place broke due to an accident (I live in a house with a lot of kids). I went through today to try and file a claim for some damage (device still works, thankfully) and the insurance company told me that I am not covered for accidental damage.

I bought the plan specifically for this and verbally confirmed with the associate that it was covered with what he was selling me. Now I'm stuck. I need it fixed before it becomes a bigger issue, but there is no way I'm going to pay retail for a brand new one.

Who do I need to speak with the get this sorted out? Am I honestly just S.O.L.? I don't know if I need to go into the store I purchased it at and speak to a manager there or if I need to call the insurance company. Maybe both? I really don't want to get stiffed on this because I paid extra with a clear, (I thought) confirmed understanding that it was accident protected. As much as I hate saying it, it's not fair to be lied to and jerked around like this, and I plan on doing everything in my power to get it done right. I just need some advice on the proper way to do this

financialindependence,Traditional 401k VS. Roth VS. Taxable Account for FI's,"[https://imgur.com/a/XfLHtg9](https://imgur.com/a/XfLHtg9)

Summary:

The Traditional/Roth question is very common, usually without direct answers because it really does depend on the individual.  However for someone pursuing FI there really is a better choice.  I thought people might be interested in seeing the results from one particular case which is attached.

&amp;#x200B;

Results:

For someone that is planning on living off of a good portion less than they make, a traditional IRA/401k is definitely the way to go.  It would be recommended to put the bulk of savings into traditional accounts, with enough put into a Roth so that one can live off of the contributions penalty free until standard retirement age.  If one cannot get enough put into a Roth to accomplish this, you would generally want to use backdoor rollovers to move this money into a Roth before using a taxable account, but you'll need to be mindful of your tax bracket otherwise this can become worse than a taxable account as shown in the full withdrawal option of the plot.   For the lucky few that can max out everything and still have plenty left over for taxable brokerage account savings, then it's simplified even further, you'll want to max out your Traditional 401k rather than a Roth 401k given the choice.

&amp;#x200B;

Methods:

This simulation compares traditional IRA/401k savings with Roth IRA/401k and a standard taxable brokerage account.  For the traditional accounts, different withdrawal methods are used.  Withdrawing a specific dollar value each year (corrected for inflation), withdrawing a specific percentage of your last paycheck (corrected for inflation), and withdrawing a specific percentage of your total savings.  At the end of the day though, these withdrawal methods only differ depending on the dollar amount you're pulling out and what marginal tax bracket that falls into.  For all the cases, contributions are exactly the same and the only thing that is making any difference is taxes.

Each data point corresponds to the effective value of any of the accounts at that exact period of time, assuming the account holder plans on using the corresponding withdrawal method.  Early withdrawal penalties are not considered.

&amp;#x200B;

Parameters:

The parameters for this simulation are included below, if anyone wants the scripts for this to compute their own case let me know.

Starting Income: $100k

Savings Rate of 30% pre-tax

Income growth is linear at about 2.4% above inflation

Rate of return is 6% nominal

Inflation is a constant 3%

Current federal marginal tax rates and brackets are used and corrected for inflation

Current social security tax rates are used

State income tax is ignored (go Washington!)

A capital gains tax of 15% is used

Withdrawal Option Parameters, as follows:

Traditional Full Draw: screw it, pull it all out at once (obviously don't do this, its laughably worse than a taxable account)

Traditional Fixed Draw Value: $70,000 constant withdrawal (inflation adjusted)

Traditional Last Income % Draw: withdraw 75% of your last paycheck value (inflation adjusted and pre-tax)

Traditional % Savings Draw:  withdraw 4% of your total savings each year

Roth: withdraw method doesn't matter since there's no tax!

Standard Taxable: withdraw method doesn't matter, it's all capital gains!

I'm not arguing that all these withdrawal methods make sense to compare back to back, it really is about comparing Traditional accounts to Roth accounts at different savings withdrawal rates.",finance
personalfinance,Questions about paying off parents' Parent PLUS loan,"I went to a private university for 1 year and my parents signed a Parent PLUS loan to help pay for the tuition. At the time, I didn't care about finances and didn't even think about how expensive it was, and how I was going to pay it off. A year later, I realized how much it was going to cost me in the future, and I transferred to my state's flagship university. From that point forward, I managed to land a bunch of internships, and eventually land a job that paid 75K out of university.

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated a little under 2 years ago, and this is my financial situation:

&amp;#x200B;

\- 90K salary + solid benefits / insurance. At risk of losing job (company going through messy merger), but I could easily get another similar job

\- 10K Emergency savings

\- 20K Roth IRA

\-35K Vanguard portfolio

\- Around 20K in student loans (ranging from 4% to 6% interest)

\- No other loans, don't own a car, monthly expenditure totals to around $1600

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think my parents are doing well financially, and I just learned that this Parent PLUS loan they took out has an interest rate of 7.5%! I think they still have between 10K and 12K to pay off on this loan, but I'd like to pay it off (or at least help.) My parents never made me agree to paying them back. At the time their financial health was very strong, but there were a series of events that really messed that up. I don't know how to go about this, because I'm not sure that my dad will accept the money. He is quite stubborn, and I think he looks at this as a case where he agreed to pay for it, as an investment in me, and therefore he will pay it off. Still, I'd like to do it, and I think if I did it the right way he'd at least let me help them. I am looking for advice on how to do this. Also, how does this work tax wise? Is there a way to do this that would be tax beneficial for either myself or my parents? Is it possible to pay the loan company directly even if I am not legally responsible for the loan? Is my best option for paying them back to sell off some of my Vanguard funds and write my parents a check?",finance
personalfinance,Claiming Exempt on W4,"First time Poster excuse me if This is in the wrong place. TLDR at bottom

My friend and I both work for the post office it’s Christmas time so we are earning a lot of overtime.

As far as I know the more overtime you make the more Uncle Sam takes out on federal taxes for the pay period. He is married (2) and I am single (0). 

He told me that during the month of December he changed his W4 form so he is exempt which to my knowledge means they don’t take out any federal taxes. So he gain more net income.

We compared our paystubs this morning and he showed me he made $582 more because they took out zero Federal taxes.

I was reading online and it says that you pay a penalty of $500 dollars and other things for basically lying, in my case they took out $480 in federal taxes that I could have possible earned like my friend,


My question is if I do this JUST for the month of December is it worth it,  like this paycheck they took out $480 which wouldn’t cover the penalty fee but if I did it the whole month it would . Any advice help for?

TLDR: is it worth claiming non exempt for ONE MONTH to buy Christmas presents and paying the penalty later and fees later",finance
personalfinance,Paying off US student loans with a UK loan to save on interest,"Hi - to give the background my wife is American &amp; living in the UK with me. Currently we pay $1200 a month on her US student loans. We make a combined income of £66,000 but live in London where rents are high. We're able to make these payments &amp; have money to live on but are getting reamed by the interest. Over the last 2 years we've paid over $24,000 onto these loans but only seen the principle balance reduce from just over $90,000 to $80,000. The loans are spread across several providers with the interest rate being between 8-13%. Currently we cannot refinance in the States - payments are being made on time but attempts to consolidate have been rejected. We're not able to move back to the States in the next year or so.

&amp;#x200B;

There are two loans equaling $26,700 of that $80,000 that if we were to carry on paying as normal we'd pay over at least $15,000 in interest plus that balance of $26,700.

&amp;#x200B;

I can qualify for a loan in the UK of  £20,000 at an interest rate of 3% meaning we would pay back £1,791 total in interest over six years. A total amount of £21,791. The monthly amount would be less than what we're paying monthly on the US loans too. There'd be a cost to transferring it to $ but that's only a few hundred. This would save us at least $11,000 over six years (the US loans are variable).

&amp;#x200B;

This seems like a no brainer. Is there anything obvious I'm missing? Apart from the fact I'd be taking on the wife's debt and all the risks that entails! It would not be a co-signed loan. Or any other advice that people have on consolidating loans while living abroad. If the £ tanks post-Brexit we would need to look at where we were living.

personalfinance,The Math of Paying Loans Early,"I have a rather lot of student loan debt.  I'm currently on a ten year repayment plan with VERY high interest rates, and I'm looking to consolidate/refinance to a lower rate.  This also, however, gives me the chance to re-evaluate my timetable.

Basically, I'm worried that a ten year plan could go south if for some reason I become unemployed in the next decade.  It'd be a real drain on an emergency fund, to say the least.

So I'm also humoring the idea of a longer schedule, say twenty years.  I'm 28 now and have no ambition to pay these loans until I'm 48.  But the advantage here is that it's more flexible in the event life happens.

Which brings me to the idea that I could sign up for a 20 year repayment schedule, and simply use bills those as minimum payments, instead pretty drastically overpaying.  But I haven't yet found a way to describe this mathematically.  I don't even know if doing this would result in fewer payments of the same minimum amount, or lower required payments for the remainder of the repayment schedule.

I'm pretty comfortable with math, and I'd like to be able to sim out a few possibilities here. I just need some help with setting up the formulas here.

While I'm not explicitly asking for help on selecting a loan term, or deciding on a lender for consolidation, I'm open to thoughts if you have them.",finance
Bitcoin,Bitcoin has never existed during the beginning of a major recession,"Before I begin, I just want to preface by saying that I love Bitcoin. I have been around
since the $266 bubble in 2013 and like most people here, have an unhealthy obsession with crypto.
I believe in Bitcoin's long term potential, but I have a seriously growing concern about the next few weeks/months/years or so in regards to the price of Bitcoin.

""OH MY, NOT ANOTHER FUDSTER ASSHOLE HERE TO TELL US WHY BITCOIN IS GONNA CRASH"" you say.

Before you jump to that conclusion, which is the conclusion I would make at first glance of this post, hear me out.

So what's bothering me? It's really quite simple: **We've never had a Bitcoin market during the beginning of an economic recession.**

I think everyone here is on the same page in one regard: There is a bubble in most asset classes at present. The stock markets, bond markets, real estate markets, amongst others are in massive bubble territory. This is the result of 0% real interest rates, quantitative easing programs and other ""genius"" bandaid remedies that our shitshow central banks have bestowed upon us.

Like many here, I once suffered from the *doomsday porn* fetish. ""I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THE STOCK MARKETS CRASH SO THAT BITCOIN CAN MOON!""

**...but I now realize that this is a severely flawed theory.**

Why is it flawed? Because whether we like it or not, Bitcoin is still a highly speculative asset in the minds of most people. In additon, like other asset classes **Bitcoin has also been the beneficiary of these 0% interest rates and financial stimulus programs.** 

More money in the economy = more money that can flow into a high-risk asset class like crypto. When recession hits and the money supply contracts, there will be a lot less money floating around that can flow into any asset class, including Bitcoin.

Ask yourself this, when stock markets crash...what happens first? Corporations lay off their employees (of course) because employees don't matter to these corporations, profits do. So as people are losing their jobs, and eventually their houses....are they going to be rushing out to buy crypto, a highly speculative asset class in their minds....or are they going to worry about keeping food on their families table? 

In fact, I would suspect that many would **SELL** some crypto, in addition to not buying any, in order to pay their living expenses. A net negative for the Bitcoin price.

Sure, we are what, 5-6 bubbles into Bitcoin at this point? **But this is the first time we have been in a Bitcoin bear market at the same time as the global economy is entering a recession.**

This seriously worries me.

Geopolitical concerns are just compounding everything in my mind. The arrest of this Huawei CFO is a big, big deal. It is a major escalation of an ever-concerning trade dispute between the US and China. As the global economy slows down and trade wars escalate, things are going to get very, very ugly. **All the signs are here for a major global recession...and I fear it will bring down Bitcoin with it.**

John Q No-Coiner is not going to be interested in learning about or buying crypto when the eviction notice shows up...he's going to be looking for a new job and driving Uber to keep his family afloat.

The next few weeks really worry me. I really don't want to believe it, but I am really starting to think we see sub $1,500 levels. 

Why sub $1,500 levels?

After the $1,163 bubble in late 2013, EVERYONE said we'd never go below the previous $266 high...**BUT BITCOIN DOESN'T CARE WHAT WE WANT** and it dropped to a low of around $160.

Not looking to FUD, just looking to voice a serious concern. Any **constructive** replies are appreciated.

Have a good night everyone. (It's late where I am now...fuck I need to sleep. GODDAMN YOU BITCOIN, lol)",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Advice for a Canadian university student,"I started a new job in October and I'm looking to reorganize the way my money is being held to maximize my returns. This is my first regular part-time job and I've never been in the position of making big decisions about my money because whatever freelancing I did before didn't make me that much steady income, and the rest of my spending money came from my parents. I make Ontario's minimum wage of $14.00 and work around 12-20 hours per week (when I'm not in the middle of exam season). My parents are going to continue to pay my cell phone bill and car insurance, but I won't be taking any more free cash from them for spending.

Right now I have around $1500 in a TD TFSA Direct Investing account, with only about $300 of that actually tied up in securities. I'm in the process of switching to a Questrade TFSA account for those holdings and then begin loading most of my savings into a High Interest Savings Account I'm looking to open. I also have a student checking account with TD with no E-Transfer fee and 25 free withdrawals per month.

The highest interest rate for a HISA that i've found through research has been EQ Bank's 2.30% which offers 5 free Interac E-Transfers out each month, and free linking between existing accounts at other banks. I've never heard of this institution before and am kinda skeptical about the difference in their rates compared to the Big 6. This account would be used as a sort of emergency fund in case I need some money unexpectedly at some point in the future, as well as a place to hold my tuition money for school.

For a daily-use checking account I'm looking at Tangerine. They offer 0.15% interest on the money, which isn't a lot, but compared to TD's 0% it's something. E-Transfer fees with Tangerine are $1.00 per, which is only a factor because I pay for parking at school monthly using E-Transfer (friend's driveway). I'm not set on switching my checking account away from TD, but I think it might be beneficial.

personalfinance,Best option for paying back $5000 in a week,"I owe my parents $5000 and they want it back in the next week. I have $1500 in cash which I can use towards this. Unfortunately I am currently in the process of re-funding my emergency fund, so that's all I have in cash at the moment.

For the remaining $3500, I have come up with the following options (from most to least feasible):

1) withdraw contributions from my Roth IRA. I have about $9k in there at the moment. However, I really don't want to do this with stock prices where they currently are. 

2) get a personal loan. I'm 24, my credit score is ~760, income is $60k, HCOL area. It looks like the interest rate would be somewhere between 6-8% for a 36-month loan. I could pay this off in ~8 months (faster if I were to lower my 401k contributions). Are there penalties to paying off a personal loan early?

3) credit cards somehow??? I have about $40k in total credit limit. I pay all my cards off in full every month. I'm not sure how I would convert this to cash so I have't really thought this option out fully.

4) sell something. I have a pair of diamond earrings from my parents purchased in 2015 with an estimated value of $7850. I realize I would get much less than the estimated value. I also don't really want to sell them, but it's an option.

No other debt, had a lot of unexpected expenses in the year (but especially the past few months). I already lowered my 401k contributions from 12% to 4% (for maximum employer match) to restock my e-fund.

Anyways which option is best for minimizing fees/losses associated with paying back this debt? I am open to other ideas as well. 

**edit:** i have decided to use a balance transfer from discover. total fees are 3%. i can pay it back in 12 months with no penalties or interest. for $105, i'd gladly forgo a payment plan with my parents and/or selling my earrings.",finance

personalfinance,I want to get out of an Annuity my grandparents set up for me when I was born,"Background: I am 23 years old, just graduated college, no student debt, making around 70k a year in the state of California. My grandparents placed 15k in an annuity when I was born, which has now grown to around 40k(doesn't pay out cash, it compounds within the annuity). Due to the restrictions/fees ect, I want to take the money out of the annuity by the end of this year. The rush is due to starting fulltime work over the summer and making half a years salary, which would keep the withdrawal under the next marginal tax bracket. My goal is to not pay so much in fees (the annuity has a high load) and to have more flexibility in what I invest in (either real estate or equities).  I am wondering what options I have and after doing some research, it seems I have these three. 

1) Keep the money in the annuity

2) Withdrawl the money in cash, pay 10% federal penalty, 2.5% state penalty, and income tax on the cash. Which would total to around 30% of the withdrawal. 

3) Move the money to a roth IRA, in which I would pay income tax, but not the 12.5% penalty with pulling it out in cash.

I am wondering if my penalty assumptions are correct and if my income tax assumptions are correct (making around 35k this year and living in California). I am trying to weigh out the possibilities and having a difficult time due to a potential 30% loss with withdrawal in cash. If there are also any other avenues, would love to hear!",finance

CryptoCurrency,Bear market is blessing in disguise. All lessons learned in it.,"No doubt this bear market has taught me those lessons which I couldn't have learned anywhere else.

Here are few lessons which I learned.

1. There are only two categories of coins that are Bitcoin and non-Bitcoins.

2. Crypto social media is full of candy sellers and their content is only to help themselves.

You will find these candy sellers everywhere from YouTube to Facebook. They produce content only to sell you ads, affiliates or other stuff.

For them you are just a commodity.

3. Crypto market moves in cycles.

4. Shill and FUDders come in waves with market cycles.

5. Cold storage is only way to protect your assets.

6. Finding a gem is just a gamble there is no such thing as gem because low market cap coin can easily go offline.

7. All market cap websites give you wrong sense of market cap without keeping in account of total supply and volume on all exchanges.

8. All exchanges are not transparent right from the start but they behave like a transparent exchange.

9. Too many coins are just money grab.

10. This bear market is a blessing in disguise because all weak projects and all weak hands will get out.

11. HODL is only true for BTC.

12. FOMO is your worst enemy.

13. Technical Analysis are not all that wrong which you are usually told.

14. Various exchanges are under staffed or don't have capability to run exchange but they are in this business like COSS, bitgrail etc.

15. Patience is key to success don't chase price just relax and let the price chase your target.

Disclaimer: These are the lessons I learned based on my experience and it's quite possible that in future I find myself wrong.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,[US] I am in a position to pay off my mortgage across the next 5 years. I am wondering if investing the money is the better choice.,"I am in a position to where I could pay off my house across the next 5 years if I put all my spare money toward it. I have been doing a little research on the topic and the one piece of information I have found that makes a lot of sense is to invest the money into something that will have a higher return rate than our mortgage interest rate (4.125%) instead of powering through the loan. The one counter I can make to that strategy is to simply acknowledge that paying off a mortgage is not contingent on the market doing well over the next 5 years.

personalfinance,Considering first credit card?,"First off: sorry if this is the kind of post that you folks see a lot and get tired of. If you would rather just direct me to a general guide even that would be helpful. I just have anxiety and am looking for some more personalized advice from outside sources so I don't somehow manage to fuck myself over completely. Anyways, onto the reason for posting.   

I'm considering getting my first credit card in order to build credit (and also make online purchases easier).  
I'm a 21 year old student who is currently living at home. I'm very lucky in that I don't have a lot of regular expenses right now, as my parents are willing and able to cover most of them, and in general I don't like spending for myself (rarely go out to eat/drink, rarely buy games or clothes, don't drive, etc). I have a fair amount of money in my saving and checking accounts, but don't currently have a regular income (some irregular income from odd jobs).   

Does getting a credit card at this stage make sense? Should I wait until I'm living alone again and spending more regularly? Are there other things I should be doing to make future finances easier?  
If I do get a card:   
What kind of things should I look for (limit, interest rate, whatever APR is, rewards, etc)?   
What kinds of things should I use my credit card for? Should I find a way to use my card on a regular basis (buying groceries and being paid back, etc)?   
What do I need to be careful about (paying bills on time, spending a certain amount monthly, etc)? What are the biggest risks and worst mistakes?

Edit:  I ended up pulling the trigger and going with Earnest.  We got a rate right around the same as our average monthly interest rate but it reduced our payment by about $150 a month.

personalfinance,"Going back to school full time, will be running at deficit for 2019, any tips?","**Background**: 27 M laid off from sales job mid May, was planning on going back to school for second B.S. in accounting in August 2018 anyways. Just completed first semester as full time student - secured part time internships for spring/fall in 2019 paying $20-22/ hour. 

Will be netting roughly $1600 per month from internship - 24 hours/week  at $20/hour.

Before my monthly expenses - wanted to post some personal debt/equity info:

* Checking account: $21,000
* 401k - $21,500 
* Student Loans: $13,000
   * Deferred payments of 200/month because I'm in school - average 3.4% interest rate. 
* Owed on car: $5,500
   * 2015 BMW 328i - very small dent in bumper. bought for $21,500 last year with 34,000 miles. Prob worth $18k now.

Right now living at home, my parents are moving out of state, but are allowing me to take over their rental property 2 bed/1bath house for $800/month starting April 1st, 2019. So I should be able to save ($1600\*3) - (800\*3) = $2,400 before moving out.

Now for Monthly Expenses - starting April 1st, 2019. 

* Rent (starting April 1st) - $800
* Car Payment - $300
* Car Insurance - $175
* Internet - $100 - est
* Electric/water - $100 - est
* Health Insurance - $60
* Food/Entertainment - $400 - est
* Gas - $60 

Total - $1,995 

My take home from work will be $1600, so I will be running a deficit of (395) for roughly 9 months. (3,995) for year. I will also have to pay tuition for Spring, Summer, and Fall of 19. Roughly (5,750 total)

This is barring any emergency expenses, car repair, furnishing apartment, etc. So my checking which I consider my emergency fund will be depleted as follows. 

21,000 + 2,400 - 3,995 - 5,750 = $13,655. 

This was a huge decision to not find another sales job and go back to school, I know it will pay in long run, but just feeling the stress of depleting my savings I worked so hard for the last 3 years, and also not contributing to 401k at all. Will graduate December 2019 hopefully with full time employment as staff accountant (50-60k) and pursue my CPA. Is there anything I can do to lessen the blow to my savings? I realize it might look more like 10k because of unexpected expenses through the year.

personalfinance,Which to pay off first,"So I have (2) ~$1000 repayments that need to be made. One this month and one next month. I've planned it out where I am doubling the money I put aside for rent each week to equal out the extra $1000 end of month. 

Now, assuming I can do this successfully for December and January and pay off those respective debts it puts me in a position where I know I can successfully save an additional $1000 per month.

I have 3 items that I owe around $1000 on and trying to figure out which I should pay off in February assuming I can once again be successful with this strategy. 

One is my car that I owe about $950 on at a 12% interest rate.
Then I have two credit cards with about $1000 balance (give or take) at 20.5% and 10% respectively. The one at 10% I am on a wellness plan that gives me the lowered 10% rate until July of next year.

I am inclined to pay off my car first just to have the title and own it but I do think it is smarter to pay off the high interest credit card as the interest is higher than the auto loan and it would, in theory, provide me with an emergency fund as I would now have a $0 balance on that card.

for example, if you look at the overnight swaps for major currency pairs on the dukascopy website (below) you see that holding one standard lot (100,000USD) yields 7.7$/night (if you are short EURUSD), due to the higher interest rate on USD.

personalfinance,Real estate/ inheritance taxable Income in NY?,"This is a complicated story to get to my question but I will try my best to quickly give the facts.

I have inherited/probated an estate to acquire a Cooperative apartment unit located in Suffolk county NY which was originally owned by my deceased grandfather who passed in 2003.

My father who was the executive of my grandfather's estate and dispersed of and distributed everything between his siblings and himself right after the death excluding the co-op  which he, myself and grandfather lived in.

We continued to live in said Co-op for years.

Upon my father's death in 2011 I discovered he never transferred ownership of the co-op to himself. (Both of them had the same name, different middle initial) I discovered the process was quite complicated and documents were missing. Most likely why he never did it.

 I probated my father's estate (he had no will) expecting to take ownership/administrative duties over the coop only to discover I had to retroactivity probate my grandfather's estate and jump through tons of hurdles and locate many documents to submit.... 

Fast forward to today. 

I have been appointed administrator of both my father's and grandfather's estate.

I had any legal parties of interest based off the will(aunt and brother) sign off okaying my my rights to the co-op and remaining estate. ( Only the co-op is left) 

Super long frustrating process. NY courts suck.

I am in contract to sell and am approaching closing.

 It has been empty for 8 months as I moved out into a house my boyfriend bought for us.  I was not authorized to rent/sell it until my probate/legal paperwork and the board of directors signed off. A fair amount of money down the drain.

The co-op was originally bought for $40,000 by my grandfather in 1997 (51 shares)

I am in contract to sell for $85,000 cash offer.  That's before my lawyer and real estate agent fees are taken.

There is no lean. Only the co-op maintenance which is $756 a month.

I'm am clueless as to NY tax law and although my lawyer tells me I can do whatever I want with the money, I do not trust him. ( I have gone through 2 lawyers trying to get this far and 7 years of effort)

 I want to make sure I move/disperse/invest the money in the most efficient least taxable way. 

I would like to give some to family, invest in my portfolio and go on vacation.

What can I expect King Cuomo and the federal government to take from me once I get this check. Because this is a shitty layered cake.... what kind of Capital gains tax, estate tax, inheritance tax can I be hit with?

personalfinance,Pension Plan or 403b?,"My husband and I are in a bit of a bind.  We are trying to plan for retirement and he was offered the option of buying into a pension plan. Prior to this he has been putting the maximum in a 403b.  He's 41 and has about 500k put away at this point. I'm 34 and I have about 100k put away in my own 401K (I started later because of grad school).  Our only debts are our house (130K left on the mortgage, 220K value, interest rate \~4%) and 16K in my loans (scheduled to be paid in full in 2020, interest rate is 3%).  No kids yet, but we're going to be trying for 1 in the upcoming year.  We currently live on about 1/3 of our combined salaries, but do splurge on occasion for nice vacations/gifts. 

Our concern relates to some of the pension plans penalties.  He's got some serious medical problems and in all likelihood, unless he gets really lucky, he'll likely have to take a medical retirement before he's of retirement age.  (We have everything set up so that we can survive on about 1/2 of my salary.)  The pension sounds great IF he's able to work until he's 63.  We would get over 100K each year which would easily allow us to continue our lifestyle. But, if he can't work that long, there's a 6% penalty each year.  So at 55, he'd lose about 1/2 that. If everything goes to shit medically before then, we would get his contribution back with 4% interest for each year he's been in the plan. 

Because we're in the USA, health insurance is super important. His meds alone cost about 10K per month.  I'm sure the cost will only go up with time. The pension plan, if he is employed til 63, promises health insurance for life.  I currently get health insurance through my job, though I'm on his plan for now ($5 meds! Yes please!), but I have the option of insuring him if he lost his job or got sick.  He would also immediately qualify for medicare due to the nature of his illness, so he would be able to continue getting medical care if that was the case.

I get that no one here has a crystal ball, but with all the penalties, we are thinking the pension plan doesn't make sense.  But it's a pension plan - which no one offers any more - so we are reluctant to say ""No"" to it.  If he was healthy, it would be a no brainer - we would opt for the plan, but with him having several medical issues, turning it down seems to make more sense, I think.   What do you all think?

As a federal employee, I have many health insurance options, and I think I have settled on GEHA HDHP. After the $3k family deductible, all maternity costs are covered and all other costs are covered at 95%. The lower premiums and tax savings of using an HSA save me more than going with a low deductible plan.

My one concern is whether my $3k family deductible is going to reset when we switch from GEHA HDHP self plus one to GEHA HDHP self plus family when the baby arrives (both have a $3k family deductible). The plans seem to be identical, but self plus one is about $40/month cheaper in premiums. I'm thinking of signing up for self plus family today during open enrollment to avoid the risk of having the deductible reset. It will be about $250-300 more in premiums.

Update: I was able to talk to my insurance after the deadline, and they were able to confirm that the family deductible will not reset when we go from self+one to self+family. I was able to cancel my transaction to switch to self+family, which keeps me on the self+one for now.

Brief background, my wife gave birth to my son 5 months ago so there were a lot of bills that the various billing departments were, on average, grossly incompetent. This all took place in Illinois but we have since moved to Colorado.

Fast forward to last week and my wife started getting calls for different unknown numbers all from the same Illinois area code. We looked all of them up and one of them came up as a collection agency. The others didn't have results (spoofed or something else). So she checked her credit and there are no delinquent accounts or anything like that on any of her reports but there is a credit inquiry by the same collection agency that had previously called.

She called the place with our only outstanding bill from the birth (they hadn't submitted it through insurance and said they would do so and send us a new bill which, as of right now they have not done) and they told her that her account doesn't have a balance.

My question is could there be a bill that we don't know about that hasn't been reported but is in collections? How should we handle the collections agency? I read the collection advice wiki and tells my wife to only give her name, no other information (like address or any other identifying information), to ask who is calling and to stop contacting us by phone and only communicate by mail.

US Bank has one that I had been eyeing for a balance transfer for her, but it is well suited to this as well. Additional questions:

1. She has already been approved for this loan, we just have to sign the paperwork. This means a hard credit check has already occurred. If we apply for the US Bank card, that's another hard credit check. Is there any expected negative effect on her credit score for two hard credit pulls in quick succession like this?
2. She currently has two credit cards, one with no balance and one with around $7000 with a 15 or 25 limit. If we open a third for this, and then eventually open a fourth to balance transfer her $7000 over for a 0% rate, will four cards dock her credit score?

I'm kind of leaning towards the card, partly because of the heavy charge if for some reason we don't pay this off in 18 months. I also can't find anything in the loan contract about whether we can pay off the remaining balance with a credit card which, if that's the case, we could just open a card at the end to take advantage of an even longer 0% interest rate.",finance
personalfinance,Considering bankruptcy. Can anyone tell me your experience of renting after bankruptcy?,"I have been considering bankruptcy after a bad relationship and some health concerns left me with $40k in credit card and medical debt on  a $40k salary. All I can afford is minimum payments and I can't afford to pay more than the minimum or to save. All of the loans I have found to consolidate will have monthly payments above what I can afford to pay and have interest rates as high as my current credit cards. I am not seeing many other options. (I am open to suggestions though)

My biggest concern is being able to find a place to rent after bankruptcy? I don't like where I am currently living and plan to move to Chicago or Kansas City as soon as I can. This would mean moving relatively soon after the bankruptcy was finalized. Can anyone tell me what their experience was?",finance

Forex,carry trade with hedge?,"hey, just wondering if anyone has any experience using carry trades with interest rate difference (for example, being short 1lot on EURUSD pays approximately 8$/night with dukascopy, see link below)

[https://www.dukascopy.com/swiss/english/cfd/cfd-overnight-policy/](https://www.dukascopy.com/swiss/english/cfd/cfd-overnight-policy/)

&amp;#x200B;

i was thinking due to the ability to leverage, it might be interesting to try a strategy where you make money from carrying a short on EURUSD across multiple nights, while simultaneously hedging on some anti-correlated instrument with less of an interest rate difference (such as  NZDUSD). 

i'm a bit confused as to whether or not this would actually work in practice...do you have to pay the spread every night to open/close the trade? that would pretty much wipe out any gain due to interest rate difference.

investing,Man vs Machine,"There are two new factors in the market that we've never seen before and nobody is really talking about how it will impact future trends. What do you guys think will be the result? Could this be the perfect storm or is it an antidote to prior market trends?

\*Algorithms - The machines and black boxes. Sky scrapers of servers near the internet origins making micro transactions based on statistics alone faster then a human could act. I know this had an impact in some prior crashes and they closed the markets after these robo traders triggered stop loss auto trades in brokerage and their own accounts.

\*Man - Lowest barrier to entry into the marketplaces there has ever been. When I started trading at 13 I had to physically go to a broker. Pay the funds have him make the purchase for a fee. Same slow process to sell and commissions high on every transaction. This encouraged slow meticulous thought and delay in action. Now anyone can be on Robinhood in minutes once funds are loaded they are off and without commissions there is no barrier to making fast or rash decisions aside from strong discipline.  Doesn't cost a dime to buy or sell a share. We also have information overload and access to more details, tools, and screeners then ever. Used to have to check the paper or have at least a few thousand to start up with Etrade. We can see how the cheap paper, government bailouts, low interest rates, and a non resource backed currency has destabilized the economy.

personalfinance,Save in MMA or High Yield Savings instead of federal withholding?,"Probably a stupid idea, but is it advisable to skip federal withholding (by putting a crazy high number on my W4) and instead put the money in a high yield account and just pay taxes with that money? 

&amp;#x200B;

I am fresh out of professional school and only worked part time for most of this year, so 2019 is the first year that I will actually have a tax bill. I expect my tax liability to be around 15K for 2019. The idea is just putting the money that would normally be withheld from my paycheck into a money market account I have that yields 2.2%.  Then just pay the tax bill the following year after that money has collected some interest. I know I would have to pay taxes on the interest earned and at that interest rate I'll only come out a couple hundred dollars ahead.

personalfinance,Looking for a little bit of direction,"I have been a lurker here for about 4 years now. With help of this community, I have gone completely debt free, raised my credit score from 560 to 757, and with the help of r/frugal, redefined how I purchase.
I am currently about to buy a used car from my uncle (who buys cars in accidents and refurbishes for a profit). I am looking to buy a Volvo xc70 with 96k miles for $5500 (it is a clean title) . I am cash flush enough to buy outright but I am hesitant to do so due to both of my children having potentially fairly expensive special needs. 
It is my understanding that banks don't generally like to loan in such small amounts for auto(I'm looking to do a 2 year to minimize my interest paid).
A year ago, I was making 52k gross. Now because of a separation &amp; my desire to be with my children more, I will likely pull in about 22k net.

personalfinance,Improving credit without credit cards/revolving credit,"Going into the Great Recession (2009?) I had $10K credit card debt. Then I got laid off. I had $3500 in cash, but ran through that in a couple of months. By the time I got a job 7 months later I had run up another $10K in credit card debt, for a total of $20K of debt. Even with the new job, I couldn't pay it off and had to declare bankruptcy. I swore off credit cards and haven't had one since.

But I got a car financed last month and had a hard time of it. I got a loan, but at a very high interest rate. From the creditors that rejected me I saw lots of reasons like 'lack of credit experience' and 'lack of revolving accounts'. My credit record only has my previous car loan on it, nothing else except the 8 year old bankruptcy and there no other collections/bad marks. The FICO score is so-so, but not horrible. What can I do to improve my credit without getting a stinking credit card?

EDIT: OK, I guess some further explanation is in order. I have schizophrenia. Medication makes it better, but I have still issues with willpower, focus and attention to detail. Credit card payments are a particular challenge. While I can put certain consistent bills on autopay, credit cards fluctuate from month to month and it can be tough to remember to pay them. And then there's the issue with judgement. Sometimes its OK, sometimes not so much. So it's better to avoid the temptation entirely. Still, I'd like to avoid having to pay a ridiculous interest on a car.",finance

personalfinance,How hard is it to get a loan for land,My mom told me it's harder to get a loan for land. Is that true? I have a really good credit score. I live in Washington too if that helps. Would I be able to get terms like 5% down and a low interest rate?,finance
personalfinance,Car leasing and buying issue,"Hey everyone, hoping you guys and gals can give me some advice on a current situation with a car lease I currently have.

I currently lease a 2017 honda accord sport at 313 a month (a couple months from my last lease were rolled into this one, hence the higher than normal payment). It's a 3 year 36,000 mile lease, with 15 cents per mile over.

However, I've recently started a new job that requires me to drive about 100 miles a day total for my commute. I already have 20,000 miles on the car and still have 21 months to go (15 months in). Based on rough estimates, I'll end my lease period at about 70,000 miles, which will having me owe over $5,000.

My car dealer has offered to get me into a new car (2018 honda accord sport) for 0 down and $499 a month. I can't afford to put down a downpayment at this moment as I just started the new job. The new job is doubling my income though. So I know I can afford it. My question is, what do you guys recommend and why?

Should I just take the lease to say, 35,000 miles and then try to have them roll my remainder into the new car payment? Or is the fact that they're willing to cut my remaining owed in half and get me into a new car for less than $500 a month a good deal?

I did the math, with an average interest rate the car would cost me around $440 a month without adding any of the lease stuff into the equation. Really racking my brain over this, I'm interested in what you guys have to say.

Edit: the buyout price for the lease is $13,620 and the MSRP of the new car is $26,670. Tax tags DMV will bring it to about 28,000.",finance

personalfinance,Advice On What To Do With Bonus,"Hey everyone! Long time viewer but one of my first times posting. I was just reaching out to see if anyone here has been in a similar situation or has advice/experience on what to do with a bonus I will likely be receiving. I will be meeting with a local FA a coworker suggested but I know their endgame is to just get my business so I'll take everything from that meeting with a grain of salt. Thought I'd ask reddit before heading into that meeting! So I will very likely be receiving a bonus here in the coming weeks and I'm struggling deciding what to do with it. I currently owe about $31,000 on my truck with a 5.64% interest rate so it comes out to around $560 a month. I also just purchased my first home in October and am paying around 5% interest/5.6% APR (I don't have the exact percentage in front of me). I put 5% down on this home so I am on the hook for PMI every month and my mortgage comes out to around $2900 a month. I was thinking of doing one of the 2 - either putting that bonus away completely into savings and to keep saving until I can refinance OUT of PMI on my mortgage or putting that bonus towards my truck and paying it way down then looking into refinancing that. My gut is telling me to put it towards the truck because that $560 a month is quite ridiculous for a vehicle while the PMI is around $250 a month. Those are my two main sources of debt; thankfully I have paid all my credit cards down or else I would be putting it towards those. Not sure if anyone here has been in a similar situation but I'm just looking for some direction before I meet with the FA this week so I don't go in completely blind. Thanks everyone!",finance
personalfinance,"College loans in repayment, but in my fathers name?","I am a physician still in residency.  I have approximately $200k of loans for medical school in my name (mostly federal) which have been consolidated and are currently under forbearance.  I am entitled to mandatory forbearance as long as I am still in medical training, so for a few more years. These are also eligible for income based repayment plans, so relatively manageable.

My issue is my loans from college.  My father took out parent plus loans in his name to cover part of my college education. The initial arrangement was for him to pay these loans on schedule and then I was going to pay him back directly.  However, I have recently learned that he has kept these in forbearance over the last 10 years without me realizing it, and $75k is now more than $150k.  These are housed by Nelnet and AES, which I believe are private lenders? These loans are NOT entitled to mandatory forbearance, nor can they be consolidated into an income based repayment plan because they are not in my name.  These loans are now being forced into repayment, which would be far more than I can afford per month. 

What do I do? Are there reputable third party lenders that would buy these out? Do I have any options?  I have no idea how to manage this.

Obviously, I am in the US.",finance
personalfinance,How can I pay off my Mom's Parent Plus Loan while she has her own loans,"So yeah kinda confusing but here's the gist. 

My mom took out a Parent Plus Loan (balance is around 7.5k) to help me pay for school 7 years ago. I agreed to pay it back. I have been making payments on it by sending checks to the account number for my mom's loans through [Fedloan.com](https://Fedloan.com) (or whatever it is)

I recently realized that my mom ALSO has her own student loans that are managed through that website. My payments have been getting spread across her other loans. Sometimes some of it goes to the Parent Plus. I need to get this out of her name but I can't find how.

I currently have a VA mortgage loan with a balance of $137k and a interest rate of 3.75%. The current market value of my home is $152k. The VA loan allows for a refinance up to 100% of the value of the home. The main issue I am seeing is that my interest rate will likely increase from 3.75 to 4.5 if I do a refinance.

Mentioned in money stuff: https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-12-11/a-happy-anniversary-for-madoff-s-scam  

The paper discusses four ways of improving liquidity of canadian government bonds which should lower the cost of their debt. The last of these is pretty interesting, proposing that they would buy back the currently outstanding bonds which have many different maturities and rates and aren't easily interchangeable and issue three types of perpetual bonds in their place. One has a single fixed rate, one has a floating rate, and the third is inflation-linked.  

The government could expand and contract their debt, or change up its rate structure, by issuing and buying these bonds at any time rather than at intermittent auctions. They would be fungible within each class - a perpetual fixed rate bond issued in 2018 is identical to one issued in 2019 - so the market will be more liquid, lowering the yield.  

It has a few other implications: For one, the government and investors can construct any fixed maturity or duration they want from these basic bond types. However it might be inconvenient for retail investors to do this. A new market of intermediaries would pop up to construct them for clients.  

For another, it dispenses with the illusion that government debt is something that is meant to be payed off. Governments like to use debt and investors like to own it.",finance

stocks,10 Reasons Why GE is a BAD investment,"30 rock made GE look like such a great company, here are 10 reasons it's gone downhill

&amp;#x200B;

1 – Management turnover

Jeff Immelt was CEO from 2001 to 2017, and GE had succession plan where John Flannery took over in August 2017. Flannery was fired in October 2018 and replaced with the former CEO of Danaher Larry Culp. Larry Culp is the first outside executive to run GE in history.

2 – Credit rating 

GE credit rating was downgraded in October 2018 after John Flannery was fired. GE’s credit rating was cut was from A to BBB+ and is only three notches about speculative, or “junk” status. Credit derivatives such as credit default spreads (CDS) are widening in bond markets.

3 – Dividend cut

New CEO Larry Culp immediately cut dividend to $0.01 per share, reducing GE’s dividend yield from over 5% to nearly zero. This is the only the third GE dividend cut since the Great Depression, once seen as a symbol of its stability. There are over 400,000 GE retirees that were negatively impacted as they relied on dividend income from GE.

4 – Capital allocation

GE has a terrible track record of capital allocation in recent years. Aside from poor acquisitions, the company spent nearly $24 billion on stock repurchases in 2016 &amp; 2017 at nearly $29 per share, or at a price that that is NEARLY FOUR TIMES the current stock price.

5 – Financial performance

2018 will be the fourth consecutive year that GE EBITDA (Earnings Before Taxes, Interest, Depreciation &amp; Amortization) will decline. Estimated to decline by 12% this year led by GE’s Power business, which accounts for about 25% of 2018 revenues.

6 – Bad acquisitions

GE’s poor capital allocation extends to its acquisition track record. In fact, under former CEO Jeff Immelt from 2001 to 2017, GE made 380 acquisitions at a cost of over $175 billion, with many ill-timed energy acquisitions such as Alstom in 2015.

7 – Federal investigations

The SEC and Justice Department are investigating GE’s power business for its $22 billion accounting write-down in October 2018. This follows a January 2018 announcement by the SEC that it was investigating GE’s accounting tactics and a $6.2 billion insurance loss that caught investors off guard.

8 – Wall Street bears piling on

Sales sold short, betting against GE’s stock price, has risen nearly 30% over the past 2 months despite a 40%+ decline in the share price.

9 – GE Capital

GE Capital disclosed a surprise $15 billion reserve shortfall related to a legacy long-term-care insurance business, and concerns about additional funding shortages are growing.

10 – Liquidity is not concern

GE has access to liquidity with cash on its balance sheet and nearly $40 billion in credit lines while it deleverages its balance sheet through asset sales.",finance

personalfinance,"Just got my first job, where should my savings go?","I just recently graduated from school, and was fortunate to have parents who paid for me to attend college, so I'm currently completely debt free, single, and pretty frugal.

I just got my first job in a city that has a pretty standard cost of living, with housing being the most expensive part. I'll be making around $50k/year plus per diem for the traveling that I have to do with my job, which I am guessing will add around another $10k/year.

I wanted to try to ballpark how much I would have to budget for my monthly expenses after taxes and savings, as well as where would be the best place for my money to go. I currently have a healthy emergency fund of around $20k from summer internships and work, so I don't really feel like I need to add to that immediately.

A little more info to know is that my job has a health insurance policy that is great, I have a fully paid-off car, and I have to ability to live somewhere near work.

**Here is where I need help:**

I was under the impression that per diem does NOT get included as income and is therefore not taxed, but after a little more research it seems that if your per diem is higher than the federal limit (I don't really understand what the limit is) than it is taxed as income?

I don't currently know how much my company contributes to my 401k, but I do know that they have a plan, so I'll find out more about that soon. That being said, I know I can, but should I fully max out my 401k first? Also I learned today that there are two types of 401k's (Roth and Traditional), so would it make sense to put it all into a Roth 401k for now since I'm not making much?

I understand that the max contributions to both Roth and Traditional IRAs is $5500, but as a young person with a pretty low income currently, should I put all of it into a Roth?

Lastly, am I even approaching this correctly? I wanted to try to max out both my 401k and an IRA, determine a ball-park estimate of the taxes I would be paying, and then figure out how much money I would have left over to budget for my living expenses (mainly being able to determine how much I would have to spend on an apartment).

stocks,Archetypes &amp; Financial Bubbles: psychological guide on how to navigate the stock market,"## We Think In Archetypes

The interesting aspect of humankind is that we act in accordance with both our conscious mind and our unconscious. We try to [find our life purpose](https://www.worldpowerdesigns.com/blogs/focus-reasoning-discipline-heart/how-to-find-your-life-purpose) but instead we can be lead off course at times. The scientific evidence does find that we are unknowingly affected by our unconscious, even though it does affect our behaviors and decisions we make (Dijksterhus et. Al. (2005), Augsto (2010), Bargh, et. Al. (2008)). However, the tricky part is that the unconscious mind is much harder to track as we live our lives and it typically can only be observed in hindsight. If we are to attempt to track our unconscious mind, we must identify patterns and behaviors that the conscious mind displays. Famous psychologist Carl Jung invented the idea of archetypes to describe our repeated use of symbols and motifs in literature, art, or mythology to display our unconscious thoughts.

[Archetypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype): The concept of an archetype appears in areas relating to behavior, modern psychological theory, and literary analysis. An archetype can be a statement, a pattern of behavior, or prototype which other statements, patterns of behavior, and objects copy or emulate.

We can use these archetypes to predict all kinds of behavior, even the financial market, as this is largely emotion based and can be affected by societal norms and trends.

## Breaking Down Archetypes

Jung argues that archetypes are the basis of our cultural shifts and societal trends. Science has backed his claims with surprisingly high amounts of congruity to his theories. Archetypes can be categorized as certain philosophies or personality traits that we stereotypically follow as general guides in our lives. These personalities can be assigned to most anything human-made, for example here are the archetypes and their relating company archetypal assignments:

## Here are the definitions of each archetype:

* **The Innocent**: “wants to be happy” An innocent brand will never try to aggressively sell you on anything. Instead, it will try to reel you in on the idea of nostalgia.
* **The Hero**: “wants to prove himself” The hero will attempt to make the world better by simply being the best. They don’t resemble mother like characteristics of nurture, instead, it presents a more masculine trait of challenging you and giving you help when you need it most.
* **The Regular Guy**: “wants to belong” The regular guy attempts to appeal to everyone and refuses to be pretentious or unique. It is the most difficult archetype to pull off because, in order for a company to present the regular guy archetype, they must appeal across demographics.
* **The Caregiver**: “wants to nurture” Benevolent and simply wants to be there for you. They won’t run advertisements that take shots at competitors, and these brands build trust. Tend to be companies that state they are ‘a family company’.
* **The Creator**: “wants to be perfect” A creator makes things at scale and doesn’t worry about the cost of things. Creators strive to make products you feel you can’t live without and tend to have cult followings.
* **The Explorer**: “wants to be free” Explorer brands want you to break free of what we might consider home and go everywhere. Subaru is an example of the explorer archetype as they focus on the freedom to go anywhere no matter the weather conditions.
* **The Rebel**: “wants a revolution” The rebels aren’t afraid to go where no brand has gone before. In fact, they want to go where no one dares go, and they desire a cult following similar to Apple.
* **The Lover**: “wants you to be theirs” Pleasure, passion, and sensuality are the main characteristics to the lover’s heart. These brands like to be associated with the intimate moments in life and indulging on your significant other.
* **The Ruler**: “wants absolute power” These brands represent luxury and exclusivity. Their perception is vital to their success and they demand to be seen as high-quality. Jewelry and high-end vehicles fall under this category.
* **The Jester**: “wants to live in the moment” Characteristics of the jester involve humor, silliness, and nonsense. They want to make you smile and laugh. Other examples besides Skittles is the Old Spice Man ad campaign. By joking about masculinity, they appeal to both consumers whether or not they appeal to masculine or non-masculine products.
* **The Magician**: “wants dreams to come true” Magician brands help make your wildest dreams come true. They don’t attempt to make life’s dullness easier, they instead go around this and jump to giving you the impossible.

Capitalism and politics are major intrinsic parts of this nation. America has played into the non-rational impulses of the stock market and economy at large. These financial bubbles that spur mania at their heights and subsequent panics after the popping of the bubble “play a major part in collective human investment behavior” (Hageback). It is important to attempt to forecast the growth of bubbles as they produce great social and political unrest. Ben Graham, father of fundamental analysis, and investor Warren Buffet coined the name “manic-depressive Mr. Market” to describe market bubbles. John Maynard Keynes referred to them as animal spirits, and US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan mentions them as “irrational exuberance”. Scholarly journal author Niklas Hageback writes his article with the context of Carl Jung’s work stating: “if these theories could be adapted into arithmetic expressions it would allow for statistical testing against the unfolding price patterns of financial bubbles”.

## The Collective Human Investment Behavior

Jung’s research pointed him to additional dimensions of the mind. These additional dimensions are:

**The Personal**: unique to each individual.

* The personal unconscious is defined by Jung as “lost memories, painful ideas that are repressed (i.e. forgotten on purpose), subliminal perceptions, by which are meant sense-perceptions that were not strong enough to reach consciousness, and finally, contents that are not yet ripe for consciousness” (Jung \[1981a\], vol 9, para. 103).

**The Collective**: a form of public opinion.

* The collective is a combination of the “average person’s cultural and moral values into a set of societal beliefs, norms, attitudes, and mainstream politicalisms” (Hageback).

Jung argues that we are not born as a blank slate, and instead there are innate universal patterns that reside in our unconscious and that these patterns influence our thoughts and behaviors. This can have a biological base as genetic memories which have been coded into our DNA to survive over the millennia’s humans have existed.

## These Patterns are Archetypes.

* These archetypes stem from *dreams, fantasies, hallucinations, visions, folklore, sagas, myths, and legends.*

**The Three Categories of Archetypes: as stated by Hageback &amp; Stevens**

1. **Events**: Typical situations in life such as birth, death, rites of initiation, or marriage.
2. **Characters**: Some of these include the mother, the father, the child, god, the wise man, and the hero.
3. **Objects**: Including elements such as water, the moon, the sun, fire; animals such as the snake and the fish; and also, numerals and man-made objects such as the plow or the sword (Stevens, 2006).

This all stems from the idea that our minds are constantly trying to find equilibrium. The argument by Jung lays out that our minds will attempt to use archetypes to replace old conscious perceptions of reality with new ones, and the archetypes will then disappear after the unconscious finds equilibrium. The problem America seems to have is that our society keeps running itself into psychological imbalance through extrapolating momentum. This can be seen in the stock market whose collective behavior exhausts itself and pushes itself into the extremes. New norms are formed through this imbalance, and some of our desires become unacceptable by dominant conventions and norms.

## What Activates these Mysterious Archetypes?

New innovations like A.I. or internet companies during the dot.com bubble “in some way drastically changes the way reality needs to be perceived, rendering existing psychical notions less suitable, and thus to be able to cope with reality, activations of archetypes deemed more suitable are initiated” (Hageback).

So, therefore, we can start to see archetypes as humanity’s way of psychologically handling a civilization of millions. Humans were initially tribal and had small groups of people that they would see for their entire lives. In today’s world, the things that connect us and maintain equilibrium around the world are common myths that rise into godlike territory that humans have deemed they cannot cross.

* **Example**: the U.S. Constitution. The U.S. is an interesting experiment and idea of which we are one country united by 50 statehoods that all collectively abide by this constitution that we have deemed no one, not even the president of the United States, can rise above. This is similar to God in that we have determined that these things are above us and we can never attain power like the constitution or God. Continuing, these 50 states all are independent and thus, we have 50 simultaneous experiments running under the same myth so that even if 5 states are corrupted, the system can live on with some semblance of equilibrium and eventually bring those corrupted states back into the union (see The American Civil War).

## The Consequences

Flare-ups of societal unrest can turn into demonstrations which turn into riots which turns into revolutions which turns into war if left unchecked by our collective energy and archetypes. We can forecast this behavior because these patterns exist from within us as a country. We simply must follow the cultural trends, and the financial market is the fastest way to determine trends in America. We can watch it in real time on the stock market exchange. We have even developed systems to monitor this change, and we call those indexes; collective repositories of the health of many companies that are considered leaders and can indicate a change in trends.

“**Projections, obsessions with certain themes, hysteria, and panics, are easily recognizable features in financial markets” (Hageback)**

Projections are an interesting development of archetypes that are characterized by the need to reduce anxiety and create a scapegoat by pinning the consequences of any such negative action on to any person, group, object, theme, or situation that is the subject of the projection.

**Zeitgeists**: the general societal mood, the collective conscious in Jungian parlance.

## The Financial Markets

Bubbles form when Keynes’s “animal spirits” are high. We see that naïve optimism followed by rejection of naivety are the cornerstones of a bubble at its riskier phase. [There are four phases of a bubble](https://transportgeography.org/?page_id=9035):

## The Four Phases of a Bubble:

1. **Stealth Phase**: The investors that tend to have access to information and understand markets better than most see the merging opportunity and invest their assets into this rising trend market.
2. **Awareness Phase**: When other investors start to take notice of the momentum and push prices higher. The stealth phase investors take this opportunity to reinforce its investment.
3. **Mania Phase**: When the public takes notice of what is happening, and they all jump onto the trend hoping to make a large sum of money. This is where a frenzy starts, and investors’ greed can start to quietly pull out and retain their assets.
4. **Blow-Off Phase**: This is when everyone collectively realizes the situation they’re in. The paradigm shifts and many try to sell or unload their assets, however by now, there are few buyers. This is when the bubble pops and the market crashes.

Afterward, there are investigations into what went wrong, but the damage is there, and the market is hurt.

## Why This Happens

A common mistake that occurs is during the mania phase the valuation of the asset is exaggerated. This is where any news whether it’s good or bad, is interpreted by investors as validation of the price level they are buying it at. This where investors desperately attempt to rationalize the exaggerated valuation. Hageback states “the most ardent proponents of the rationalism of this new paradigm that underpins the financial bubble are generally people most easily susceptible to hysteria or other neurotic conditions”. These fluctuations in the market resemble a noise signal which is explained in [signal theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_(economics)). The market is binary in nature like that of archetypes where it is either dormant or active ([Bear market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearmarket.asp) versus [bull market](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullmarket.asp)). During the dot-com bubble, the thought process behind the poor investment strategy is as follows:

                Internet companies were seen as gambles that if one gambled enough, invested into enough companies, they would get lucky and make up for the losses.

## How To Determine Symbols In Order To Identify Archetypes and Trends

1. Focus on English speaking media.
2. Include national, regional and global coverage.
3. Note that political directions and affiliations are not dictated by the archetypes.
4. Symbolic language is symbolic language. It does not matter whether or not it is in support or against a certain topic.
5. Do not limit your search to just financial and political news.
6. It does not matter what tense (past, present, future) the language is being used in.
7. It does not matter if the symbolic word is used in an ironic manner. The unconscious does not consider negations.
8. Make sure to count the repetitions of symbols that reside in the same body of text.
9. It does not matter whether or not the symbol words is used in a singular or plural form.

**Conclusion**:

This abstract idea of archetypes is initially difficult to understand as it requires us to delve deep into the unconscious. The unconscious is inherently abnormal to think about as we perceive reality in the conscious mind. However, by studying how we behave and especially how we collectively behave, we can forecast where humanity will turn to next. These cultural shifts can predict not only the personal unconscious decision we make but the collective unconscious decisions we make even to the point of predicting the inflation and deflation of bubbles in the financial market. I encourage you to read more about Carl Jung’s work and continue to think differently.

personalfinance,Employer is giving us the option to cap or not cap our bonus checks?,"Hi all,

Our employer is giving us the option to cap or uncap our bonuses. If we chose to cap the federal taxes, it will be 25% and if we choose to not cap them, it will be 0% but we may owe at tax time. 

they wrote, ""If you cap your Federal Income Tax at 25% for the bonus check you may or may not still end up paying it at tax time depending on your individual situation."" which doesn't make sense? 

does this mean that if i chose to cap it, i might have to also pay again at tax time? in which case, is the safest option to not cap it?

But, as I tried to shop around, the next firm I contacted stated that this mortgage would be treated as an investment property and would thus receive a much higher interest rate.

personalfinance,Does this refi of 30 yr FHA to 20 yr Conv with cash out make sense?,"I can't find an online calculator to help me make sense of this scenario, although I know one portion (the cash out) is more of a personal choice.

I owe $205k ($218k starting) with 26.5 years left on my FHA 4.25% loan:

- Current payment: $1732 payment ($348 principal, $727 interest, $145 MIP, $500 ins/tax)

We'd like $40k for home renovations but rather not touch savings/stocks. House will easily appraise for $350k and more in our area, no worries on that.

Proposed 20 year Conv loan with $40k cash out at 4.375%:

New loan amount: $252,500 (inc 4k closing costs)

- New payment: $2080 ($1580 princ/int, $500 tax/ins)

We currently have $1800/mo after all bills/debts paid, but this new payment would eat $350 of that in the new increase. However, we'd pay this off 7 years earlier and get $40k for improvements.

My only concern is if paying $350 more on my current FHA mortgage (even with $145 going to MIP) would negate the time savings and instead pay for the projects by emptying our savings? I also see it as I'm getting $40k for a low fixed interest rate to put right back into the value of my home, which will still be appraised at more than my new amount.

personalfinance,Baby Planning Feedback,"Hi personalfinance,

&amp;#x200B;

My wife (27f) and I (26m) are expecting our first child who will arrive in August of 2019.

I would like to get our finances and medical situation as ready as possible before this and was hoping for some feedback and advice. What I am hoping for with this very long, rambling post is for feedback and advice on the medical plans, anecdotes on people who have recently gone through a pregnancy, and then just general advice and tips on things to do or not do financially during pregnancy/early life (somebody just tell me everything is going to be OK!...haha). I know r/personalfinance is very conservative and the general consensus is probably to have kids later in life when you are more financially stable but we discussed it and there were a number of reasons that I won't get into why we felt now is a good time to start trying (just to avoid too many ""but why now??"" responses).

&amp;#x200B;

Financial snapshot

Income

Me: 72k

Wife Job 1: 30k (remote)

Wife Job 2: 20k (my wife would no longer do this job post-July)

Wife Job 3: 4k (my wife would no longer do this job post-July)

Combined: 126k (102k post-July)

&amp;#x200B;

\*There are a few main reasons for my wife planning to stop two of her jobs. I think in most cases it doesn't make sense financially but for us it might.

1. We want her home with our child as much as possible
2. The cost of day-care even 3 or 4 days a week (if we can find that as an option) offsets about 1/2 her earnings from those jobs.
3. They are both part time w/o benefits and while she likes them, they aren't necessarily a career path with room for growth (financial or otherwise) without her furthering her education.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Liquid

Savings (High-Yield SA, \~2.1%): 53k -- we are saving for a downpayment. By August conservatively I'd estimate we have \~70k+.

Checking: 8k

&amp;#x200B;

Retirement

Traditional 401k: 19k

Roth 401k: 29k

Traditional IRA: 6k

Roth IRA: 13k

HSA: &lt; 1k

Pension: Vests at my company after 3 additional years of employment. Honestly I need to learn more about this, if I leave after 10 years I

don't understand if I get anything or not.

\*I think we have a good start for our age but are currently saving for retirement at a lower rate so we can bolster our downpayment savings.

My wife is unlikely to have a 401k/company match available so I know we will need to max our IRAs as often as possible going forward

&amp;#x200B;

Debt

Student Loan: 6k (@3.6% Interest)

\*I don't think this is worth paying off all at once although technically the interest rate is higher than our savings account so maybe I am wrong since we aren't putting the 6k ""to work for us"".

&amp;#x200B;

Expenses

\-We net \~7.5k / month after retirement (5% of our income in 401k, 125/mo HSA, then we put my bonus in our IRAs to bring us to \~7.5 - 10% for the year)

\-Rent: 1550 (1br apartment)

\-Utilities: \~300

\-Groceries: \~1000 (we have allergies that necessitate some higher priced items + we live in a HCOL area + my wife's third job is cooking for a family of three a few times a week)

\-General shopping: \~300 (includes gifts, clothes, household, etc.)

\-Medical: \~250 (mainly some prescriptions + blood work a couple times a year, I'm guessing this will go up) 125 is paid with HSA so I won't count it

\-Student Loan: 200

\-Restaurants/drinks: \~200

\-Transportation/car maintenance: \~150 (we live close to work)

\-Pet (dog): \~100

\-Hygiene: \~60

\-Entertainment \~50 (we hike/walk a lot + spotify/netflix)

Total: \~$4035/mo

&amp;#x200B;

So, we save \~3-3.5k / mo currently. With my wife stopping 2 of her part-time jobs it will drop our income to \~6k (groceries will come down a bit too but probably offset by medical increases, although perhaps these could be tax-advantaged with HSA + FSA). I think we should still be able to save \~1/mo conservatively unless I am missing something (this should account for my HSA increase). I think our tax rate should come down a bit too once we have a child.

&amp;#x200B;

Some obvious things we could work on are the groceries, restaurants, and shopping. We cook nearly every meal already and have the philosophy that buying healthy, higher quality foods will save on medical expenses in the long run. That said, I'm sure there are some meal prep things we could do to buy in bulk, be less wasteful with our leftovers, and eat more beans/eggs instead of meat. We also have friends over 2 or three times a month and tend to provide snacks/dessert so we could probably switch to a BYOB/F system + I doubt we will be hosting/attending as many get-togethers shortly after the baby comes. Obviously baby food will eventually add to this but we are hopeful that in infancy my wife can breastfeed to keep this to a minimum for a while. What I think I should do in the near-term is start tracking our receipts to see which items we need to cut back on/substitute and analyze which ones may be cheaper made from scratch. Restaurants are mostly from going out with friends a few times a month but I know this will not be as frequent with a very young child. And finally, I am doubtful our shopping will go down as you add diapers, baby clothes, etc. although I am going to need to actively keep my wife from going after every new outfit/equipment she sees on Instagram -- we have a lot of relatives who are generous and enthusiastic so, selfishly, I am hoping we get most of the necessities from them as hand-me-downs or baby shower purchases. I'm sure we could get cheaper phone plans as well so we may need to look into that.

Through work (California) I have BCBS PPO and we pay $0/yr for a family plan (shouldn't go up with a child) that has an in-network deductible of $3300/yr (OON = $6600), an in-network coinsurance of 20% (40% OON), and an in-network out-of-pocket max of $9600/yr ($19200/yr OON). If I am honest, the whole PPO thing is confusing to me as I grew up with an employee Kaiser plan --I've gone to information sessions but still it is not the clearest to me. I think this is a pretty poor plan in terms of the

medical costs themselves but ends up being pretty good when you factor in that $0 comes out of my paycheck. The other option I have at my work is a plan with an in-network deductible of $100 ($500 OON), an in-network co-insurance of 20% (40% OON), and an in-network out-of-pocket max of $8000/yr ($16000/yr OON) but the plan costs a guaranteed 4k for the year -- so long as we are healthy, stay in-network, and don't have major expenses, as far as I can tell I think the first option is better. Whether or not the same is true throughout pregnancy and once we have the baby, we will see. I can switch to the second option once the baby is born since it is a qualifying event, not sure if that would be beneficial financially.

&amp;#x200B;

For 2019, I plan to max out my HSA at $6.5k (looking at our expenses I probably should have been doing &gt; 250/month right now...). I believe this will be put in over the course of the year in each paycheck but as far as I understand it I can just pay in cash and then use receipts to get reimbursed so even if my expenses are in August, I can still pay for them with the HSA in December 2019 if I want. At the time I needed to pick medical plans we were not yet certain we would have the due date in 2019 (thought it may take 8-12mo) so I did not sign up for the FSA. I can however set one up after the baby is born due to a ""Change of Life"" event, so that could be an option come next August to get more tax-advantages for the next (likely expensive) medical year.

&amp;#x200B;

We are choosing to go with a midwife which will cost a minimum of $5500. I need to ask some more questions but I believe that this includes a standard amount of ultrasounds, bloodwork, etc. but could definitely get more expensive

if there are birth complications. She accepts our HSA but I am certain she is considered Out-of-Network -- I'm sure there is a better option financially than this but my wife is certain that she does not want a hospital birth if we can avoid it.

Through work she has seen a lot of different births and birthing locations and this is what she thinks will be best for us. I am interested in hearing from people who have birthed with a midwife about the financials.

&amp;#x200B;

Some other relevant info is that her family lives \~1.5 hours away and her mom works mostly remotely so she will likely be coming into town often to see the baby. In dire straights we could probably move in with them, pretty terrible commute for me but we could do it

if things get too tight or there are major medical complications. It could be an option for my wife to keep her second job (with reduced hours) if we ask her mom to watch the baby 2-3 times per week but that is probably asking too much.

&amp;#x200B;

One major thing is that we will be continuing to rent an apartment but may end up switching to a 2br ($1550 -&gt; \~$1850/mo) if we feel we need the space. It would have been a lot more practical financially for us to wait a year or two more until we had a house but we talked it through and current prices in our area (\~350-400k) combined with relatively few employment opportunities in our area aside from my current job make us wary of buying a house in our current situation (not that having a child will help this...). Our plan is to save to 90-100k before we would buy -- if prices come down to the low 300's that may move up our timeline.

&amp;#x200B;

It may be painful for a while from a space-standpoint with a baby and an energetic dog in our apartment but we have a variety of parks/trails near us and I will need to exercise our dog as much as possible before and after work. I think this system is worth it to avoid us over-extending ourselves with a house purchase that leaves us with little savings and a large mortgage, particularly with how things seem to be turning economically. There are some houses for rent for \~2k which may be a better option than renting a 1br apartment for \~1.5k or 2br for 1.8k -- it would of course lower our savings rate to \~500 but it would give us a yard for the dog, more space for family, etc. while still having minimum maintenance and upkeep costs/time while we are new parents. I work in a field with $$ available, and while my employer isn't known for huge raises I do think I have good earning potential over the next 5-10 years to allow my wife to work part-time or be a stay-at-home-mom.

&amp;#x200B;

So please, let me know what you think and if you have any experiences you think may be helpful. Are there options I should be considering in terms of medical plans, HSAs, etc? Things to watch out for in terms of pregnancy and newborn expenses? Things we should be doing differently in terms of our savings/housing strategy?

personalfinance,Considering buying a home. Too much of a stretch?,"Hi PF peeps,


My wife and I are considering buying a home and want some advice that is not from a realtor or a mortgage broker.


Here are some quick stats on us:
* We live in the DFW (Texas) area where we currently rent a 1b/1b apartment for $1200/month
* Our gross income combined is ~$130k. I'm early in my sales career so my pay fluctuates a bit, and my wife makes $50k salary. I'm expecting to make more next year, but don't want to bank on it.
* Average take home pay is $6900/month (averaged with my commissions, so some months are more than others)
* Both in late 20s
* No kids yet - planning on having kids in a couple years which is a big factor for this post
* No debt (car payments, student loans, credit cards, nothing). My car is a 2001 4Runner which is going like a champ and my wife's is a 2010 Corolla, but it's only a matter of time before we need a new one.
*780+ credit scores
*Contributing 15% + employer match to our 401ks
* $34k in cash
* Maxing out both of our HSAs


We are considering purchasing a home for $376k. It's a 4b/3b in a very nice area. We plan on putting our future kids in public school and this area has one of the best public school systems around, although there are other comparable ISDs. We plan on having kids in a couple years. The seller really wants to sell and the home is worth around $390k, so they are selling it at a discount. It is also a very well kept home with a new roof, hvac, water heater, kitchen appliances, and gutters in the last year. Most houses in the area and surrounding areas are at least $325k+, but anything under $360k would require some more significant work up front.


We talked to a mortgage broker and got quoted at around $2700/month for a 30 year mortgage/taxes/insurance with 5% down payment on the house. We know the prevailing wisdom in this sub is never buy without a 20% down payment, but our reasoning is that this would be a home we would live in for the the foreseeable future, it's in the great school district and it's a good commute to both of our jobs. We also view this house as a good deal as a lot of comps in the area are over $400k and we are worried that if we wait to buy a home then house prices and interest rates will continue to increase and we won't even be able to afford it in a year or two when we decide to buy again.


Now for our concerns.


With the 5% down payment, we would only have about $15k cash on hand when all is said and done. Our fear is that we would be stretching ourselves too thin since the mortgage would be 38% of our average take home pay (it's average because my commissions vary, which is another scary uncertainty). We also are scared of having so little cash on hand since that would amount to probably 3 or 4 months of an emergency fund. Plus when we have kids in the next couple years that's just going to be more expenses on top. Add on a car payment and our future looks bleaker.


Are we crazy to buy this house? I tried to put all the relevant info into this post but let me know if I missed anything and I can add it in.

personalfinance,Paying off my 58k in debt,"I currently have around 8.8K in credit card debt across two cards. I have about $500 in savings, and I take home around 2.2k per month. I spend about $800 a month on student loan debt and a car payment. I am currently putting 5% of my pay into my 401k and my employer matches 5% and puts in 5% (I'm very lucky).  I have 29k in student debt and another 11k on a car loan. My credit card has an exorbitant interest rate at 22% but my credit score is 734. I need to pay down the credit card debt as soon as possible so I can start saving. (thanks to a previous post for formatting)

personalfinance,Taxes due next year because of new policy?,"My accountant recently asked for a recent paystub so he can do year-end tax planning. He said that after entering the numbers into the system, I'll likely get a state refund of around ~2k but *owe* federal taxes of around ~6k because of new tax law that restricts the state tax deduction to 10k.

Can someone explain this? Maybe I'm not understanding the new law, but even if the state tax deduction is lower why would I *owe* taxes instead of just receiving a smaller refund?

I thought I would only owe taxes if I claimed too many allowances (ie dependents) but later had to reconcile that.",finance

personalfinance,"Taking a bigger mortgage than is necessary, and using the extra cash for ultra-safe investments?","What is this sub's opinion on this?

Lets say I can pay up \~70% of the house (it's for my own stay). Is it a good idea to take a bigger mortgage and use the left over cash for some ultra safe investments, like AAA bonds?

I'm not in US, so current mortgage rate is \~2%, though I suppose that is set to rise, depending on Feds. AAA bank bonds is giving a return of something like 2.8-3.2%. So about a \~1% spread.

So do you think if it's worth the risk? I've asked those around me, and they're pretty much split down the middle.

Former Federal Reserve Chair [Janet Yellen](https://www.cnbc.com/janet-yellen/) told a New York audience she fears there could be another financial crisis because banking regulators have seen reductions in their authority to address panics and because of the current push to deregulate.

“I think things have improved, but then I think there are gigantic holes in the system,” Yellen said Monday night in a discussion moderated by New York Times columnist Paul Krugman at CUNY. “The tools that are available to deal with emerging problems are not great in the United States.”

Yellen cited leverage loans as an area of concern, something also mentioned by the current Fed leadership. She said regulators can only address such problems at individual banks not throughout the financial system. The former fed chair, now a scholar at the Brookings Institution, said there remains an agenda of unfinished regulation. “I’m not sure we’re working on those things in the way we should, and then there remain holes, and then there’s regulatory pushback. So I do worry that we could have another financial crisis.″

In the wake of the financial crisis, some agency regulatory powers were vastly expanded, but others, for example, the ability of the Fed to lend to an individual company in a crisis, were curtailed. Current Fed officials have pushed back against criticism that their reforms are making the system riskier, saying they are making the system more efficient.

Speaking in London in June 2017, shortly after leaving office, Yellen had said she did not believe there would be another financial crisis in our lifetimes because of financial reforms. However, she did warn at the time about the deregulatory efforts just then underway.",finance

personalfinance,How can I pay off my debt the best/fastest way possible?,"I have racked up some serious debt over the past few years, from school, some medical bills and helping my parents pay house bills. I have recently moved out into my boyfriends and he said I dont have to pay rent until all my debts are paid off so I really need to get my shit as soon as possible. I’m not in school anymore, I plan to work full time starting in january. Here is what I owe:

Credit card 1: $3337 - min payment $10

Credit card 2: $3099 - min payment $10

Credit card 3: $5100 - min payment $10

Credit card 4: $1600 - min payment $10

All cards are at 19.09% interest rate

fairstone loan: $2500(i know this one is really dumb) - 37% interest rate

My utilities: 

Cell phone: $85 - I pay for my mom and I’s phones

Car payment: $300 monthly

Insurance: $160 monthly

Food: ~$100

With my current job I only bring home about $1200 a month, I am looking for another full time job for the new year, hoping that I can land one in my current field I can bring home about $2300 (thats my lowest expectation)

I currently have $5100 in my bank, i know i should pay off that fairstone loan off right away right? since it is the highest interest rate? And then should I tackle the smallest loan to the biggest? 

Thank you in advanced",finance

personalfinance,What is the catch with Ally's 2% APY savings account?,"I am currently getting 0.30% APY on my savings account. Looking at CDs, I also see the option to lock away some of my cash for interest rates between 1 and 3% for one or more years. But I recently heard about Ally bank offering 2% APY on their savings accounts and instantly thought it was too good to be true. Is anyone familiar with this? Is there some kind of catch involved? Otherwise should I consider opening an additional account and putting some money into that account and treating it like a CD (albeit one I could potentially access when I want to).",finance
personalfinance,Going back to school for online MBA. Should I take a federal student loan or a regular loan?,I’m going back to school to get an online MBA from my undergraduate school. Total cost is approximately $12k. Is it better to just take out a regular loan from a bank or similar financial institution or should I just use the federal student loan program. What are the benefits? I hear a lot of bad stuff about student loans but only borrowed about 3k for my undergrad.,finance
personalfinance,Transfer HELOC debt to no interest credit card?,"I have about $7000 on a home equity loan with Citi and the interest rate is variable. It keeps going up and now it's at 7.5%. Citi also charged me a $50 annual ""membership"" fee for the loan recently. I hate paying the interest and am wondering if I should sign up for a credit card with a 0% interest introductory period and pay the HELOC off. I have plenty of equity and can pay about $500 a month toward the loan. I don't have any other credit card debt. I understand there may be a transfer fee or some other mindless credit card charge. Thanks for your input.",finance
Bitcoin,"The USD Will Inevitably Collapse, And Bitcoin Will Take The Throne","&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/y6nzalfe3v321.png

[http://genesisblocknews.com/the-usd-will-inevitably-collapse-and-bitcoin-will-take-the-throne/](http://genesisblocknews.com/the-usd-will-inevitably-collapse-and-bitcoin-will-take-the-throne/)

The United States Dollar (USD), which is the underpinning of the  global financial system, is entering the final phase before total  collapse. There is no limit to the USD supply, and it is printed at will  all the time to balance the bloated United States budget. Every time a  dollar is printed, every other dollar in the world loses value. This  means that everyone in the world is being robbed by the United States  government. The same people who are doing this lock people up in prison  for stealing bread to eat, but the highly coordinated theft of billions  or trillions of USD from everyone in the world is apparently kosher.  Fortunately, this flawed monetary system is nearing collapse. This is a  fact the mainstream media refuses to report, choosing instead to blast  political propaganda about nebulous issues 24/7 to incite and distract  everyone. The truth is the USD will cease to exist, and Bitcoin will  become the only working currency.

The United States government is doing everything they can to make the  collapse of the USD as catastrophic as possible. Bitcoin would be a  fine successor to the USD, and the transition could be smooth, but  instead the United States is attacking Bitcoin with non-stop propaganda,  severe market manipulation, and regulations. The worst thing that has  been done against Bitcoin i[s the launch of Bitcoin Futures on CME](https://cryptoiq.co/cme-bitcoin-futures-are-poisoning-crypto/).  This Bitcoin Futures market is single handedly crashing the entire  Bitcoin market, from USD 20,000 in December 2017 to nearly USD 3,000  today. This is causing an exodus of people from Bitcoin, and has  reversed Bitcoin adoption trends. The end result is many people will not  be using Bitcoin when the USD finally collapses, and they will lose all  of their life savings, instead of having some Bitcoin and surviving  comfortably.

Why is the United States trying to destroy Bitcoin and prevent  adoption, when the collapse of the USD is obviously inevitable, and  Bitcoin is the only good replacement? It is all about power. The United  States depends on printing the USD to maintain their power, especially  when it comes to funding the ridiculously oversized military. When the  USD implodes, along with all the other fiat currencies, and Bitcoin  becomes the only global currency, the United States and every other  country will lose most of their power. The truth will be revealed: the  governments of the world have been getting their power by stealing from  all their citizens via money printing. Bitcoin cannot be manipulated to  balance a budget, so Bitcoin becoming the primary global currency is the  government’s worst fear.

The reason the collapse of the USD is inevitable is because [the United States government debt is approaching USD 22 trillion](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/current). The government is taking loans non-stop from its citizens and other countries, [and the yearly budget deficit has finally reached USD 1 trillion](https://www.thebalance.com/current-u-s-federal-budget-deficit-3305783)  and is rapidly rising year over year. That is just the projected budget  deficit, any sort of economic disaster or war will cause the deficit to  be much higher in 2019. USD 364 billion of the budget deficit is simply  interest payments on the debt.

Decreasing the budget deficit is not an option, because that would  cause the economy to crash leading to unrest and a potential overthrow  of the government. This guarantees that the budget deficit will increase  year over year, and the debt will balloon. As the debt reaches critical  levels, basically when demand for buying United States debt dries up  because there’s no more money to left in the world to invest into it,  the interest rates for new debt will rapidly rise. Ultimately, the  United States will be forced to print tremendous amounts of cash to keep  up with interest payments, and eventually will just print cash straight  up and give up on issuing more debt. This will be the point at which  the USD enters hyperinflation. The world is literally one economic  crisis away from this becoming a reality.

Bitcoin is so cryptographically secure and decentralized that the  United States government cannot get rid of it, no matter how much they  want to. They can ruin the price with market manipulation and arrest as  many people as they can, but Bitcoin will exist and be ready for global  adoption when all the fiat currencies simultaneously collapse in the not  so distant future. At that point Bitcoin will rise to million,  billions, and trillions of dollars, since the value of the USD will  approach zero.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Immense Student Debt Help,"Hi Reddit,

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I are feeling desperate and need some help. Admittedly, we've made some mistakes along the way, but are looking for a way out. Some background:

&amp;#x200B;

My wife has over 300k in student debt. 200k is in private loans. Some of the interest rates on the loans are high, around 11%. The loans were in deferment a while, but they are soon to go back into repayment.

&amp;#x200B;

I make 92,000 and she makes 105,000. Our mortgage is around $1800/month. We have some minimal credit card debt, but most of that is on interest free cards that we will pay off before the interest kicks in.

&amp;#x200B;

We've applied at Sofi and Commonbond, both with and without me as a cosigner, and were expectedly denied. I'm feeling completely hopeless after the rejections and am afraid we won't be able to survive with these rates. My credit score is around 745 and her's 650. Any advice?",finance

personalfinance,How to Reduce Debt - $20k in two credit cards,"Hello! I'm wondering if anyone can provide some guidance on how to reduce expenses while still paying off debt.

I have two credit cards both at 19.99% interest rate, totally $20k. One credit card is $15k and the second is $5k. 

**My Monthly Expenses:**

Mortgage + Maintenance fees = $860

Cell Phone = $70

Gym = $45

Groceries = $150

Pet Insurance = $33 (on credit card)

Pension Contribution to match my company's contribution = $100

Transit = $140 (live far from work, have to commute)

Spending money = $100 (varies slightly to $150)

Cloud Backup: $15

***Total: $1498***

&amp;#x200B;

**Take Home:**

Every two weeks I take home ***$1372.*** **Monthly take-home paycheck: $2744.** There's an extra pay check in March and August every year.

&amp;#x200B;

**Difference between expenses and monthly take home paycheck:** ***$1246.***

&amp;#x200B;

I'm overwhelmed by the debt and every month I pay off anywhere from $500-1000 but it doesn't seem to reduce significantly. I'd like to get a plan of attack to make sure I don't end up here again.

Thank  you!

personalfinance,Standard 401k + Individual 401k (contractor): did I mess this up?,"I'm located in the US. I have a full-time position and also work part-time as a contractor (1099) for a number of different clients. I am in the software development industry.

I make about $120,000 at my full-time position and I max out the offered 401(k) plan. I am married and my wife makes $70,000 as a federal employee; she maxes out her TSP.

I've also established an i401k to try to limit my tax liability for my side work. This year, I expect to close out the year at approximately $26,000 in side income. My largest individual client accounts for about $14,000 of that income. I have currently made no retirement contributions for that income.

I thought that the 401k and i401k limits were additive and that I could sequester the first ~$18k of 1099 earnings in my i401k, but I'm concerned upon re-reading the [IRS publications](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-401k-and-profit-sharing-plan-contribution-limits) that I may have been wrong and I've screwed myself up on my 2018 taxes.

I think I'm example 1 (""Greg"") on that page, except I'm not sure how Greg gets to contribute a total of $55k. Is that a situation where Greg is contributing 25% of his total business income as an employer contribution? Is that my only option - contributing 25% of ~$26k? Or am I reading this all wrong?

Can y'all help me figure out how to best manage this situation? I have read the 401k FAQs and consider myself overall finance-savvy, but my wife and I have climbed several income brackets recently and I'm out of my depth.",finance

She went to school to be a social worker, she got her masters and some of her masters interest rates at 7.5% a year. She has 92,000$ in loans and 440/535$ is going towards interest. This is insane. In interest alone she is paying almost 5,000$ a year.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been told this will re-balance overtime and make it so more is applied to principal than interest. However, in the short term is there a way for her to transfer the loan to a lower interest loan or something? My student loans range from 2.5%-5.5% and average 3.9%

personalfinance,Can I afford this house?,"About me:

Location: PA

32M, working in the tech field, making $67k per year.  My take home pay after taxes, benefits, and a 16% 401k contribution (7% by me, 9% by employer) is $3600.  Raises in my field are relatively low, I can expect between a 1.5%-2.5% increase annually.  There is opportunity to move up into higher paying positions here with more education and experiences, but we are considered public sector, so I'll always be on the lower end of the pay scale for my field, but the job security is good and I plan to be here for at least another 5 years.

The prospective home I'm looking at has a cost of $227k.  It is move in ready, and there is nothing I would want to change to the home for the foreseeable future.  It comes with a 14 month home warranty.  The monthly mortgage cost is $1336 on a 30 year mortgage, which includes taxes, home owners insurance, and a monthly PMI charge of $19 (I would be putting %15 down to purchase the home, I'm not quite saved up enough yet to do 20%).  I do plan to pay an additional $100 month towards the mortgage, raising my mortgage payment to $1436 a month.

My expenses:

The realtor provided me with a lot of documentation regarding the home, including estimated utilities for the past year.  Using that information, and my current budget information, I came up with an estimate that my total monthly expenses would be about $1259 per month.  That number includes $100 for Misc home repairs or home related purchases.

Note: My car is a 2015 and is low miles and paid off.  My student loans have been paid off for a while.  The $1259 includes all my monthly expenses (food, gas, groceries, estimated utilities, going out, every dollar I spend is accounted for in that number)

After my mortgage and expenses are paid, that leaves me with a surplus of $900 a month.  If I were to purchase the house, I would have exactly $12000 in my emergency fund at the time of closing (after the down payment and closing costs)

I guess my question is, can I afford this house?  Would you be comfortable making this purchase with similar finances?  I know expenses can be unpredictable at times when owning a home....is $900 net a month a good safety cushion, or would you be hesitant to go forward with my finances?

Edit\*\*The interest rate on the mortgage would be 4.75%.  That is included in the $1336 mortgage payment.

personalfinance,Should I focus more on paying off my last credit card debt or start throwing some in savings?,"Long story short, I built up a bunch of credit card debts thru multiple lenders and did the snow ball approach.  I’m at my last credit card which is I believe at a 13%-16% interest rate.  I am kind of worried because my lease ends in July and I was planning on moving out of state afterwards.  I will start job hunting in April, but having a few thousand bucks will make the transition way more easier.  If I aggressively paid off the the last CC it will take like 3-4 months at $2400-2600 out of my projected savings.  Should I just bite the bullet and tackle the card or try to pay off the card in 7 months instead of 3-4 to give me more room in savings?  Also, I would love to hear any financial tips on the out of state move.  Thanks",finance

personalfinance,Sell my stock and pay off student loans in anticipation of downturn? Someone tell me I am dumb,"I'm going a little crazy with student loans over my head. I have $47,000 left in student loans, at approximately a 4.65% interest rate. I started with $75,000 and have paid off around $27,000 since December 2015. That's approximately $9000 a year. At this rate, it would be 5 years of around $800 a month before I could pay it off.

I am very fortunate and work in the tech industry. I have a decent amount of Amazon stock that I am strongly considering selling to pay off my student loans be done with it. I have had this stock for around 3 years and it has tripled. I have about $50,000 worth of stock. 

My take-home after taxes and 401K is around $3600 a month. I pay $1200 for rent (Seattle area), $200 for car insurance, and about $800 for student loans, which leaves me $1200 a month for all other expenses. I also have no emergency fund right now (yes, I know this is bad). 

I have held the stock for as long as I have had it, but recently I am anticipating a downturn in the economy. I imagine the stock price will tank and so might my pay and livelihood. My other reasoning is that Amazon is already nearing a trillion dollar market cap, and it reasonably can't go up much more, right? It traded at $2000 earlier this year, which would be another 10-12K I could make.

My heart tells me this would alleviate a lot of stress, but my brain tells me to just tough it out for another 5 years and hold onto the stock. 

Maybe there is an in-between? Sell like $25K worth of stock and since the amount doesn't seem so daunting, I can use the lower amount as motivation to aggressively pay off the rest, but even at $1000 a month, it would take 2+ years. 

Amazon has done wildly well and this is pure speculation but my heart tells me at best, they can double and be worth around 1.6 trillion, at which point my stock is $100K. My risk-averse instincts are telling me to sell my stock and be done with it.

Any advice is appreciated. I recognize I am extremely fortunate and I am very thankful for those around me who pushed me in this direction.

Tomorrow on the 13th of December 2018 Dayz will leave early Access and release their 1.0 Build.

After almost 5 years (4 years and 346 days to be exact \[for the guys who say it's not 5 years in EA\]) the standalone of the highly adored Mod for Arma 2 (June 2012) will enter it's ""full release"".

For a more in depth Dev. cycle visit [https://dayz.gamepedia.com/Development](https://dayz.gamepedia.com/Development)

**What happened so far? (STABLE RELEASE)**

* **2018 ""The Year of Dayz""**

**Release 16th Dec. 2013**

As may of you already know, the development of the Game was rocky. ( kinda like the mountain the former Lead Developer Dean Hall climbed on in May 2013)

First they used a slightly modified version of their RV engine and ported their map straight from Arma 2. All the problems this old Engine had where more or less ported over, e.g problems with melee, flying of stairs , breaking bones from a 2ft drop, and the overall clunkyness of animations and inventory management.

The spirits where high in the community and Dev-team alike. We would be finally getting a polished version of the Mod which exploded the ""Survival"" Genre into main-stream existence. At the first day of release it sold around 170.000 units on steam and 1M units after the first month.

Dean Hall had the vision of the ""Anti Game"" , a hardcore, realistic survival game. With Sickness, body temperature, health and medical system, crafting, foraging, farming , looting , hunting and battling Zombies and Players.

A game with so many complex mechanics, it sounded like the game i dreamed of making at 6 years old with some friends of mine, when we sat in front of the N64 and brainstormed ""The perfect Game"".

Sadly as many as you know feature creep is a big issue in projects this size, so under the extreme high from the Devs and the community (who only fed the unrealistic imagination of the devs with ideas) they began shoveling content into the game which made the core Game-play Loop of spawn, gear up, kill , die , repeat to more of a chore than an actual recreational activity.

**Dean ""Rocket"" Hall leaves the Dev. Team**

[https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-02-24-dean-hall-to-leave-bohemia-and-step-down-as-leader-of-dayz](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-02-24-dean-hall-to-leave-bohemia-and-step-down-as-leader-of-dayz)

*""Originally I wasn't going to do this year, but it would be stupid not to, and it would be unfair to the community. I have to be on the project as long as it's important to. Whether that role is as the leader, whether that role is in a more creative sense... But at a certain point there will be diminishing returns. ""*

...

*""I feel like DayZ is a fundamentally flawed concept,"" he went on, ""and I've always recognised that. It's not the perfect game; it's not the multiplayer experience, and it never can be, \[with\] the absolute spark that I want in it.""*

*The perfect multiplayer experience: ""I want to chase that.""*

This was the first big outrage this game sparked within it's community, at this time the game was in an awful state, bug riddled, no satisfying Game-play Loop, constant crashes and hackers.

Brian Hicks stepped up as Lead Developer and steered the Development in an even more ""Hardcore"" Direction.

More survival mechanics, more focus on the PvE part of the Game.

**The 2015 Roadmap**

[http://www.dayztv.com/standalone/dayz-2015-roadmap/](http://www.dayztv.com/standalone/dayz-2015-roadmap/)

The (in)famous 2015 roadmap, finally a concrete plan on how and when all this development payed of.

Q4 2015 Beta release? Base Building? Ooohhh boi I'm in!

NOPE! Said the Dev. Team, can't be done.

At around v.0.61 we where informed of an complete engine overhaul, everything from AI, scripting, network structure, sound, visuals , physics ....etc. so basically everything.

The Stable branch received no big notable updates between 0.61 and 0.62

From then we had the announcement that at the end of 2017 (v.0.63) we would enter beta, which was then followed up after a short time by this:

**Soon after that Brian Hicks stepped down as Lead Developer in May of 2018**

Eugen Harton takes his place for the ""final stretch"" the ""year of Dayz"" the year of fast iterations...

This last year was full of Up's and Down's

personalfinance,Is it worth it to take out a private loan to double my income?,"Right now, I work for a healthcare company making about $34,000 a year. I was recently accepted into an accelerated nursing program through the company's university where I would qualify for a tuition discount. However, because it is a second bachelor's that I will be getting, they can only offer a certain amount in federal loans. I plan to take the maximum they will allow, but it will still leave me about $15,000-20,000 short which I am considering taking out a private loan through my credit union for. 

The federal loans I have now (and would take out) would qualify for PSLF working for the same company. So, that would just leave me maybe $20,000 in private to rapidly pay off once I'm done. Becoming a nurse would at least double my salary though. The average BSN salary in my state is over $80,000. I just wanted to check if there are any other things I should be considering to decide if it's worth it and how a private loan might affect my credit?",finance

personalfinance,How can I most effectively consolidate my student loans?,"I currently have $7000 in federal student loans through Mohela with a fixed interest rate of 6.8%. It's technically across 5 different loans, in different amounts. I'm hoping to consolidate them and get a lower interest rate. From what I can tell so far, to get a lower interest rate I'd need to go through another lender, the 6.8 won't move for me if I keep the loan where it is. I'm confident I can make monthly payments, and I have a credit score of 723 according to Credit Karma.

I'm ultimately hoping for a lower interest rate and lower monthly payment (Currently $293/month.) What are the pro's and cons of doing it this way? Would I be better off keeping them where they are and paying them off from smallest to largest? 

If it is more favorable to consolidate through another lender:  

I went through SoFi to see if I could get a quote to do this, but the minimum they loan is $10,000, which is more than I need. If I agree to the 10k, would 3k just bounce back to them? I feel like I'm stuck in a limbo considering my loan is a relatively small amount.

personalfinance,Refinancing car loan when financing through dealer,"I bought my first car (2017 Honda Civic) last year, putting down a payment of $10K with a $500 new college grad bonus promotion Honda was doing. I ended up financing the rest of the car through the dealer (Honda Financial Services) as it was the only way the bonus was applicable. The loan I took out was $12,000 for 5 years at 5% interest. When I initially got my car, my family was upset at how high the interest was, but the dealership told us it was because I had no credit history (true, got first credit card 5 mo prior) and they said that I could refinance the loan and get a lower interest a year later after I had build my credit. Well it's been a year now, and I'm starting to figure out the refinancing part.

Honestly, I want to get rid of this car loan as quickly as possible without damaging my credit. I'm thinking about renting my own place some time next year and maybe would want to save for a nice condo or house in the far-ish future and having an extra $290 a month albeit small, would be nice. I have roughly $10,400 left on the loan and I *technically* have the cash to just straight up pay off the loan right now, but my sister told me not to do that because it would ruin my credit score since the car loan is my second oldest ""credit"". I'm actually not even sure if I'm allowed to pay off a loan in its entirety early?

Forgive my idiocy as I've never had to deal with debts and loans before, but how does refinancing even work? Do I call the dealer and say ""hey, can I please have a lower interest rate?"" Also, I'm thinking about if it would be possible to get a shorter loan, preferably a 3 year loan, and in order to offset the potentially higher payments, I'd like to put down an extra $5,000 since I have it readily available. Would the dealer even allow that? What would even motivate the dealer to give me a better loan? Or should I expect that they won't and that refinancing entails going to a third-party loaner? Or am I strictly only allowed to finance through the dealer?

Sorry for all the questions, being it that it's my first loan, I haven't a clue as to how this loan and refinancing stuff works.

Note - not sure if it's important, but last I checked credit score is 734 (might drop to 700 as I just opened a new credit card)",finance
personalfinance,I've been neglecting my long term finances (Partially) How can I do better?,"Hey All,

&amp;#x200B;

Throwaway to keep my finances off my personal account. Let me start by saying my situation is not negative by any means and I'm not in trouble. In fact, I'm in very good shape. But I'm inexperienced and don't really know what I'm doing with my money besides some very basic research I've done and some talks with my Grandfather who is a good, albeit safe, investor.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 26 years old and I make an annual income of around 60k before tax. I've done a lot of scrambling, and changing around between companies in the past 7 years. Everywhere I've ever worked I've done maximum 401k contributions that were matched. Here's my first area of pain. Upon leaving these other companies I've totally neglected those 401k's and not kept up on rolling them into my next fund. I know. I'm lazy and stupid. My first question is, how can I find all this money that is stored in these 401k's? There's likely up to 4-5 different ones that I'd ideally like to consolidate into my current fund.

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of liquid assets I have close to 30k in savings accounts with the best interest rates I could find. Is this a good place to sit my assets? I feel like I should be doing something with it, but I don't know what. I'd like to make a down payment on a home/condo at some point in the next 5 years so I cannot commit everything but I'd like the money to make more for me if I can.

&amp;#x200B;

The only investing I do right now, is that I contribute the annual maximum (I believe 5200?) to an IRA. I've been putting it into Schwab at my Grandfathers recommendation and I've been doing this for 3 years. I know I should spread my investments over time because of cost dollar indexing or whatever but I usually just dump the 5k in there every January. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have no debt at this time (I worked full time since I was 15 to pay for my own tuition to community college, and later undergrad with help from a company I managed to work for). I've never even had a credit card...So essentially I have no established credit. Debt makes me anxious so I've avoided it like the plague.

&amp;#x200B;

What changes should I make? How can I make my money work for me? I'm very happy using my IRA and my 401k as a safe investment for the future but I'm not averse to using a chunk of my money on some higher risk/higher reward ventures for more short term (next 5-10 years) return.

personalfinance,ELI5: How do I decrease my APR?,"As someone who is in his mid-20s, I'm pretty bad at this stuff

I visited a bank recently and they said that the APR on my Wells Fargo Propel Card was pretty high (23%). I called the customer service number and they said something about how the Federal Reserve (not sure about this) increased everyone's APR by 5% starting in November 2016, which explains how my original APR increased from 17% to about 23%. I asked how I could decrease my APR and they didn't give me a direct answer, kinda implying that everyone's APR is high due to what happened in November 2016

However, when I check their site, APR can range from [14% to 27%](https://www.wellsfargo.com/credit-cards/propel/terms/), so I'm assuming that I could theoretically get it down to 14%, but I just want to know how to get there.

CryptoCurrency,CFTC Approval of Ethereum (ETH) Futures Would Hurt ETH Market,"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ahc7g6dx2x321.png

[https://cryptoiq.co/cftc-approval-of-ethereum-eth-futures-would-hurt-eth-market/](https://cryptoiq.co/cftc-approval-of-ethereum-eth-futures-would-hurt-eth-market/)

 

The Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) [is requesting public comment on Ethereum (ETH)](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/7855-18) regarding its underlying technology, opportunities, risks, mechanics, use cases, and markets. 

Essentially, the CFTC is  trying to confirm whether ETH is a commodity or a security. If it’s a  commodity, the agency must determine whether it is proper to have  official futures markets for it. 

Earlier in 2018, the  Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBoE) and the Chicago Mercantile  Exchange (CME), the same exchanges that host the only official Bitcoin  (BTC) Futures in the United States, [indicated it wanted to launch Ethereum futures markets](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2018/06/18/an-ethereum-futures-future-u-s-commodities-giants-lie-in-wait-after-sec-surprise/#72832a338fde).  This CFTC request for public comment is likely part of the process to  determine whether these Ethereum (ETH) futures markets will become a  reality. 

[There is strong evidence that the Bitcoin futures markets on CME have directly caused the Bitcoin (BTC) market to decline](https://cryptoiq.co/cme-bitcoin-futures-are-poisoning-crypto/).  This has been confirmed by the Federal Reserve. Bitcoin (BTC) Futures  on CME launched on Dec. 17, 2017, the same day Bitcoin began to decline  from its peak of $20,000. 

Essentially, paper Bitcoins  (BTC) are being printed in large quantity on the CME Bitcoin Futures  market, and there is tremendous short selling pressure. It is likely  that Ethereum (ETH) Futures markets on CBoE and CME will have similar  negative effects on the ETH market. 

Indeed, the ETH market has  already gotten a taste of what short selling on derivatives markets can  do to price. BitMEX, the largest cryptocurrency derivatives exchange in  the world with billions of dollars of daily trading volume and up to  100X leverage, added Ethereum (ETH) trading in August. At the time, the  CEO of BitMEX, Arthur Hayes,[ said Ethereum (ETH) would become a double digit shitcoin](https://bitcoinnews.com/bitmex-ceo-dismisses-ethereum-as-double-digit-shitcoin/).  This ominous truth has verified and is directly related to intense  short selling pressure on BitMEX. The addition of Ethereum (ETH)   futures on CME might have effects that are similar but more severe. 

It is not certain that Ethereum (ETH) futures will happen since Ethereum (ETH) must survive [the Constantinople hard fork](https://cryptoiq.co/ethereums-hard-fork-could-send-ethereum-below-50/)  before futures can be considered. The Ethereum (ETH) developers have  decided to get rid of mining long term, and this fork is intended to  begin the transition from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS).  Block rewards will be slashed from three Ether to two, and ProgPoW might  be implemented, which would block ASIC miners. 

This will likely lead to a  chain split, where Ethereum (ETH) ASIC miners coordinate to stay on the  old chain while the developers and GPU miners migrate to the new  Constantinople chain. It will not be a smooth transition and could be  just as bad or worse than the Bitcoin Cash war. 

   

Already Ethereum’s (ETH)  price is below $100 after declining from a peak of $1,400 in January  2018. The fork has the potential to bring Ethereum (ETH) far lower,  especially since BitMEX traders will be massively short selling at the  first sign of war. The community infighting and chain split would  probably lead to unacceptably risky conditions for the launch of  official Ethereum (ETH) futures markets in Chicago.

Ultimately, the potential  for Ethereum (ETH) futures markets and the Constantinople hard fork make  the near future of Ethereum (ETH) seem particularly bleak. If Ethereum  (ETH) survives the fork in one piece, it will have to deal with strong  downward pressure when the futures market launches. That being said, it  is not impossible that Ethereum (ETH) will run the course and survive as  a major cryptocurrency long term, especially considering its merits as  the number one platform for smart contract deployment and dApps.",cryptocurrency

gaming,Feeling frustrated with a lot of games this year,"The end of this year was supposed to be gaming valhalla for me with Super Smash Bros Ultimate, Battlefield V, Gwent Homecoming, and Artifact. Well they all turned out to be frustrating: 

&amp;#x200B;

SSBU: have to pay for a piece of shit Nintendo online service to play multiplayer, which includes an app that is terrible compared to free alternatives, peer-to-peer hosting (so my money doesn't even buy dedicated servers??), and a Switch with a weak wifi card as default. I can buy their ethernet USB accessory, but it heats up the Switch if you leave it plugged in all the time, and only operates at USB 2.0, because although their hardware is 3.0, they choose not to support 3.0 via software / firmware. It also increases latency because of the polling nature of a USB port.  The single-player is largely redeeming for this title, but god damn it could have been so great if it was on Xbox / PS4 / PC just for the multiplayer capabilities in hardware and software.

Battlefield V: which already has low player count because of a shit marketing campaign, and today changed the time-to-kill in an attempt to appease a more casual playerbase, and does not have a true hardcore mode which is what I enjoyed from previous Battlefield titles.  

Gwent Homecoming: also nuked its playerbase by having a 2 year long beta and then totally changing the game upon release, while removing core mechanics and even regressing on quality of life features.  

Artifact: Also has a terrible player count, no progression system, bad balancing, and frustrating RNG.

\- I called, and they only do 25% interest loans. Front loaded. Probably 2+ years.

Is it possible to ""beat the system"" by paying off this loan quickly? Will paying it off quick help keep total interest low?

They don't have any early payment fees. But the front loading loan makes me think even is she pays it off within a year, she will probably be paying $1k+ in interest.

personalfinance,"Another post-grad what should I do thread. 25yrs old, 70k in student loan debt, what retirement options should I be pursuing?","Hey all, thanks for all the wonderful advice on here. /r/personalfinance has been quite the amazing resource!

I recently graduated law school, studied/passed the bar, and am now gainfully employed by my state at an agency since September. In order to live while I studied for the bar, I stretched my loans as far as I could, but coupled with a month-long payroll lag it sill meant virtually wiping out my savings to move, pay rent, etc.

So for the last two and a half months I was just putting money in a high-yield checking account I'm treating as my savings/emergency fund. Now I've been doing my research and crunching the numbers for my student loans. 

I make $55k a year and am sitting on $71k in student loans, no other debt besides budgeted for credit card payments and a manageable car payment. Part of my paycheck already goes to the pension fund, which for me vests after 10 years of public service.

I'm PSLF eligible, as all my loans are direct sub/unsub fed loans. I'm therefore going with the lowest IDR plan, which looks to be roughly ~ $300 a month (numbers seem to be the same for PAYE, REPAYE, and IBR for new borrowers, any info that can guide which I should pick?). I can afford that, but I think I can get that lower. More on that below.

After budgeting for my expenses and my loan payment, I can/want to put away 20% of my take-home pay, and thats what I've done the last two months. That roughly comes out to about ~ $600 a month. So, what I ask of you all, is what makes sense to do out of these options:

* ***Stay the course***, put all $600 in that high-yield checking account. I'll have over 1800 in the account by the end of the month, and it yields 3.25% interest. My loan payment will remain the same, but I'll have roughly $9k saved (or 3 months worth of funds) before interest at the end of 2019. Account only gives this interest rate till $25k, so once I hit that or get close to it I start to invest in retirement vehicles.

* ***Begin a traditional IRA***. Options with that aside, my understanding is that it will lower my AGI. I'd shoot to contribute $3500 annually, or roughly $300 a month. That lowers my AGI to 51500. According to studentloans.gov's calculator, that'll reduce my IDR payments to about $270 a month, and over the course of 10 years, knock off roughly $4400 of what I'd have to pay before PSLF takes over and wipes out my balance. I could still put away $300 a month on my budget, getting my emergency fund to about 5k, or almost 2 months worth of funds pre-interest.

* ***Begin a Roth IRA***. I have no idea what my earning potential would be if after 10 years I go private, or if I go private before my 10 years. I know first year associates in the region are making anywhere from $60-80k at firms where I'd even remotely have employment opportunities. I'm not eligible for a pay raise at least until 2020. So Im basically assuming 10 years from now I'm at best just scratching the phase-out income levels at ~100k if I'm lucky. My girlfriend and I will, if all goes to plan, be married and starting or at least contemplating starting a family during that time period as well. I'd still probably do a 50/50 split still between the roth and my account. This route I can't reduce my AGI for student loan purposes, correct?

* ***Do my states 457(b)***. This I literally have no idea about, how well it performs, fees, etc. I'd have to do a lot more digging. I do know they offer both trad. and roth options though, so I'd imagine they would at least for tax/loan purposes, operate similarly two IRA's. Again, I'd split 50/50.

* ***Combo of the last three*** ....Ugh.

personalfinance,[US] Question about Credit Scores &amp; Payment,"**Background**:  Early 2018 (between 3/2018 and 4/2018) I left Federal Service.

I made sure all addresses that I knew of are updated to my most recent address which is new for at least 2 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Between 5/2018 and 6/2018 I was in Europe doing international studies.  Between 7/2018 and 9/2018 I was in another European Country and the US however never being at the address of my residence.  Nonetheless, I received all mail as not only am I signed up for ""USPS' Informed Delivery"" but I also have family at the address to which my mail should be going to.  Thinking nothing of the silence I made sure to put the \~20k on the side and continue waiting.

&amp;#x200B;

Between 9/2018 and present I hear nothing.  Out of some kind of fluke I sign up to see my Experian credit score today (12/12/18) within the past 4 hours.  Apparently on 8/1/2018 USDA NATL FINANCE CNTR opened a credit in my name with a 1 month due date.  The balance on this is about 12.9k - it's  significantly less than what I have paperwork indicating I owe (\~20k). My assumption is that somehow this was mailed to my old/former address but I have absolutely no information if it even is the same amount due.  My credit score went all the way down to 630 from over 790.

I have a personal loan for about 6k with a 15% interest rate. 

I also have about $3,000 in credit card debt, with about 20% interest rate, which I know sucks a lot. 

Should I even have money taken out of my checks for 401k and the employee stock purchase plan?  The 401k match from my employer is 50% of the first 6% that I invest. The employee stock plan is apparently pretty cool, “You may set aside up to 25% of compensation through payroll deductions to purchase [company] Stock every six months that are at least 15% below the fair market value. The discounted price is locked in for a 24-month period.”

personalfinance,How to be successful with a balance transfer CC,"So I am new to the idea of a transfer CC but have a lot of debt that I want to pay down asap. Want to know if this is the best solution. I am currently putting all money but living expenses ($300) a month towards the debt but interest rates are killing me. I am a college student, so I am only able to put $300-330 a month towards balances. My current minimum payments are $160 a month.
My cards are BofA $2700, store card $600, store card $250, Cap One $650, and Discover $740. My interest rate is around 22% on each card. I’ve never missed a payment and this is the only debt I have. I’ve been irresponsible in the past and I’m ready to change my habits!",finance

She currently makes $45k, and we're trying to come up with a strategy for paying this off. I'm well set with my own finances, and we're working through a budget together. There's not a lot of fat to trim there anyway... housing and utilities is less than $310 a month and groceries are at around $250. She just got a large $10k pay increase to $45k so she is on the right track career wise, but the ""consider making more money"" advice is not an option just yet.

What I am curious about is whether there are tips and tricks to consolidating student loans somehow. I was able to pay my way through school with work, scholarships, cheap school, and parent support, so I am unfamiliar with the federal loan system.

Besides targeting the highest interest rate loans first, are there any options here?

Car loan @ 2.74% - $160 a month owe $3,693 in total

I'm not sure what to do about the money I will be receiving. I was thinking of paying off my school loans in a lump sum as they have the highest interest rate and will free up extra money to put towards my car each month. I would want to put aside 5k as my emergency fund and just toss the rest into a savings and use that towards a down payment for a house in the years to come as my rents is $1205 essentially paying someone else's mortgage. I'm not really sure on what to do with the remainder of the money, or if paying off the school loans at once is a smart thing to do.

Forex,How I traded the May confidence vote - and why I failed,"Before I start, I'm no expert by any means and this was trading on a real account with IG on their mt4 platform. I currently work in a hedge fund in London, although I'm only a techie and don't have anything to do with the fund. 
I'm writing this so maybe I can pass on some knowledge of things I did right and wrong. 

I knew the result would be given at 9pm GMT so I set four stop orders on the GBP/USD &amp; EUR/GBP. Each stop order was set roughly above and below the current asking price on each pair, I never actually set a pip amount, I just chose a place where I thought there was no risk of a premature order, mistake No1 maybe? 

So I'm sat at the screen with the live stream from the BBC and both charts open. The price is barely moving, at about 20:58 the price starts to fluctuate slightly, obviously people knew before 9pm and this was maybe either the market speculating, or information had been leaked. Either way no stop order executed yet. 

All positions are for a lot size of 2.0 with a trailing stop of 50 pips. 

9pm - the result. I'd been reading about how the market would react most of the day. Odds were already in favour of a vote of confidence, which would signal a stronger Brexit stance for the UK maybe? However a vote of no confidence would obviously cause a huge dive - obviously /s. 

So the result is given - she has the vote of confidence. At this stage I've minimized the BBC stream and I'm watching my charts, the price on both moves so quickly I have no clue what is going on. It look as though my sell stops hit and I should be making some nice profit. I couldn't have been more wrong. Because the price had spiked up so quickly it hit my buy stop on the GBP/USD. During the carnage I was getting messages from IG saying my account balance wasn't big enough for all of these 2.0 lot size orders (thankfully.) 

I look down to the bottom right of my screen and see a flashing red line - £1500. I am instantly getting margin call emails from IG telling me to add more funds. An overwhelming feeling of sickness comes over me, how did I get this so wrong? 

I sit and watch the price, hovering over the 'close position' button. Two hours go by and the price looks like it's settling down for the night. I'm back at £-800 by 11pm, finally out of my margin call. I debate whether it's worth staying up any longer to see what will happen, by 11:20 I've had enough, the price movement is flat and I'm tired and pissed off. I set an indicator for the break even and a stop of £-1500, I figure there's no way it'll hit that over night. And according to the guys at the fund, the £ is the cheapest it's been since 1985, so something that's already cheap, shouldn't be able to go much lower. How true that is I don't know. 

I wake up at 6am, I'm still £-800. Again I consider the close position button, but decide to leave it. By the time I'm getting into work I get a buzz on my leg. It's a notification from the mt4 phone app: TP on GBP/USD 

My account is now exactly where I was at 20:58 the night before. I let out a huge smile, my patience paid off albeit in a situation I never wanted to be in. 

So what did I learn? I'm definitely a technical trader only, trading the news is like the wild west, and I'm going to avoid it at all costs in the future. I have EAs that work well and take some small profits on most days, not enough to live off, but better than any interest rate from a bank. I also learnt that it's next to impossible to guess what the outcome of news is, regardless of what all the news sites say. 

TL:Dr I dont trade news anymore, if you do, be smarter than me and set wider pending orders maybe, with smaller lot sizes.

personalfinance,Question About Capitalizing on Credit Card Rewards,"I have one credit card that I have used since my early 20's. My credit has improved significantly since I was a college student, and I know I can get a better interest rate on a different card.

Since my credit card balance is $0, I was thinking of cancelling the account and getting a different credit card that accumulates travel rewards.

My question is two-part. First, will my credit score take a hit if I close out my oldest credit card account? I would leave it open, but it is really a terrible card with high interest rates and annual fees.

Second, is it a good idea to use a travel rewards card for daily spending (so I can accumulate reward benefits) as long as I can pay it off each month? I've heard of people doing this and I am not sure how sound this strategy is. I know I won't spend out of control on it, I am pretty responsible, but if this strategy has a long history of failing for one reason or another I'd like to know.

personalfinance,Paying off debt question.,"I am getting a bit of a windfall in January. I’ll be getting $20,000 and with some money saved up I’ll have about $25,000 total to throw at debt. Debt totals $35,000. I have two options and I think I know the answer but I’m not sure if I’m missing something in the equation. 

Option A: pay off the $10,000 in consumer debt and a little over half of my student loans. Which frees up ~$650 a month. 

Option B: pay off my entire student loans which only frees up $260 a month but the largest debt I have is gone. 


Either way I end up with $10,000 in debt remaining so I believe the best choice is A since It will give me more  breathing room each month and allow I can just pay extra in student loans. The student loans have the lowest interest rate if that makes any difference as well in this case.",finance
CryptoCurrency,"France invests heavily in Blockchain, Prime Minister: We must have a ""conquest philosophy""","A parliamentary report released today by consensus among several parties in the political spectrum recommends investing up to € 500 million in the field.  More recently, France seems to be crying out after cutting taxes on capital gains, signing joint declarations with other European countries promoting the use of cryptocurrency and even starting to sell Bitcoin and Ethereum in local tobacconists. Today, several French media are reporting on a parliamentary recommendation to invest up to € 500 million in blockchain technology over the next three years.  

In an interview with local media, Laure de La Raudière, one of the undersigned prime ministers, gave the opportunity an urgency: ""I raise the alarm: It's time to invest. There are no established positions in the world yet.  It believes that governments should implement a blockchain to follow the example of the private sector: ""The state could therefore do the same to reduce public spending and be more efficient"", certifying diplomas or administrative documents referred to as potential use cases.  Another implementation case is the agri-business, in which the Prime Minister cites the benefits of decentralization:    ""Take the example of agribusiness. In order to have an interesting chain of traceability and food security, it is necessary to bring together distributors, producers, logisticians, industrialists ... And do not let only an actor manage the network as Carrefour or Casino can today ,  De La Raudière believes blockchain technology has a deep potential for change and wants to encourage their country's position: ""France must have a philosophy of conquest with the state in the first place, both as a user and as a federator of projects"". From a common European perspective, she also endorses the creation of a multi-state crypt, based on backgrounds, referring to locals from Sweden and Estonia, although she does not appear to be willing to sponsor the European Central Bank.  Other legal changes proposed in Parliament's report include the possibility of opening bank accounts for block-centered companies that need to register with the AMF (Autorité des Marchés Financiers), which appears to be an amendment demanded by local companies.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

 

Ein heute veröffentlichter parlamentarischer Bericht, der von mehreren Parteien im politischen Spektrum Konsens erzielt, empfiehlt, bis zu 500 Millionen Euro in das Feld zu investieren.

In der letzten Zeit scheint Frankreich alles in Krypto zu gehen, nachdem er die Steuern für Kapitalgewinne gesenkt, gemeinsame Erklärungen mit anderen europäischen Ländern unterzeichnet hat, die die Verwendung der Kryptowährung fördern und sogar anfangen, Bitcoin und Ethereum in lokalen Tabakläden zu verkaufen.

Heute berichten mehrere französische Medien über eine parlamentarische Empfehlung, in den nächsten drei Jahren bis zu 500 Millionen Euro in Blockchain-Technologie zu investieren.

In einem Interview mit lokalen Medien gab Laure de La Raudière, einer der unterzeichnenden Ministerpräsidenten, der Gelegenheit eine Dringlichkeit: »Ich wecke Alarm: Es ist Zeit zu investieren. Es gibt noch keine etablierten Positionen auf der Welt '.

Sie ist der Meinung, dass die Regierungen eine Blockchain implementieren sollten, um dem Beispiel des privaten Sektors zu folgen: ""Der Staat könnte daher dasselbe tun, um die öffentlichen Ausgaben zu senken und effizienter zu sein"", wobei er die Zertifizierung von Diplomen oder Verwaltungsdokumenten als mögliche Anwendungsfälle bezeichnet.

Ein weiterer Umsetzungsfall ist das Agrargeschäft, in dem der Ministerpräsident die Vorteile der Dezentralisierung anführt: 

„Nehmen Sie das Beispiel des Agribusiness. Um eine interessante Blockkette in Bezug auf Rückverfolgbarkeit und Ernährungssicherheit zu haben, ist es notwendig, Händler, Produzenten, Logistiker, Industrielle zusammenzubringen ... Und lassen Sie nicht zu, dass nur ein Schauspieler das Netzwerk so verwaltet, wie es Carrefour oder Casino heute können.

De La Raudière glaubt, dass die Blockchain-Technologie ein tiefes Veränderungspotenzial mit sich bringt, und möchte die Position ihres Landes ermutigen: 

""Frankreich muss eine Eroberungsphilosophie mit dem Staat in erster Linie haben, sowohl als Nutzer als auch als Föderator von Projekte “. 

Auch aus einer gemeinsamen europäischen Perspektive billigt sie die Schaffung eines Kryptos aus mehreren Staaten, das sich auf Hintergründe stützt, wobei er sich auf Einheimische aus Schweden und Estland beruft, obwohl sie sich offenbar nicht dazu bereit sieht, die Europäische Zentralbank als Geldgeber zu haben.

Weitere im Bericht des Parlaments vorgeschlagene rechtliche Änderungen umfassen die Ermöglichung der Eröffnung von Bankkonten für Unternehmen mit Blockketten-Zentrum, die sich bei der französischen Börsenaufsichtsbehörde AMF (Autorité des Marchés Financiers) registrieren lassen müssen, was anscheinend eine von lokalen Unternehmen geforderte Änderung darstellt.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,BoA Credit Limit Bump Question,"Hi pf, I had a question about my credit limit on my BoA cash back CC. I'm a college student with good credit history, have never missed a payment, use my card responsibly, and always pay off the balance in full. That being said, I'm an older college student at 27 and have bills to pay each month, and general living expenses (gas for a long commute, car ins., groceries, eating out occasionally if I forget lunch, etc.) that top out around $800-$1000 a month, give or take. My take home as an intern at the moment is around 1300 per month, so living within my means and still able to save a tad here and there when I graduate in May. This brings me to my CC question. I usually put purchases and transactions all on my CC for the security benefit and to earn the little cash back I'm qualified for. This puts my credit usage at around $1000 per month, but with only an $1800 limit its dinging my credit score for having such a high usage. My question is: would it be worth while to ask BoA for a limit increase simply to mitigate the ding to my credit score? I understand theres a hard pull for limit increase requests. I've had this card open for 3 years now and only had a single limit increase, and with graduation coming soon, my fiance and I will be looking to make a few purchases once i begin my job, and look for an apartment, and I'd like the best possible opportunity for interest rates when this time comes.

personalfinance,Cars and student loans,"Sorry in advance for the novel. An unexpected $1100 repair has me all stressed out.

Facts:

$110k in student loans - 6.5%-7.5% interest on most of it.

2015 Colorado worth $25k. Owe $5k on it. Very low interstate rate on both vehicles.

2013 Ford Escape worth $8k - Owe $6k on it --- Car is at the dealership right now. Coolant and sensor problems. $1100 to fix --- CPO Powertrain warranty is good for another year, but this issue not covered under it.

Wife and I make about $145k combined. $1600 house rent payment, but otherwise we live pretty frugally.

I had long been considering straight up selling my truck because I work from home and don't need it. We are good with one car. The original plan was to use the money and make a big ass loan payment. This Escape though has been nothing, but a pain in the ass. I do not trust it to not need another $1000 repair within another year, and more down the line.

I've really been thinking about selling both and getting us one new/used vehicle in the $18-$22k. Specifically a Hyundai Santa Fe (great warranty, plus extra room for future kids, would own for a long time). Our interest rate on a loan I think would be like 2-2.5% since that's what we have now on these. I figure a $3-5k down payment. Put the rest of the Colorado sale money towards that big loan payment.

Am I an idiot for considering this? Should I just bit the bullet and make a repair that cost 1/8 of the cars worth and just *hope* no other major repairs are needed? Do I buy an extended bumper to bumper warranty after making the repair and cover ourselves for 2-3 years?",finance

However, this claim now appears to be dubious given comments by the director of the SIPC, who, in an interview with Bloomberg, [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-14/sipc-says-it-has-serious-concerns-about-robinhood-s-new-product):

&gt; ""I disagree with the statement that these funds are protected by SIPC,"" Stephen Harbeck, president and chief executive officer of SIPC, said in an interview Friday. ""Had [Robinhood] called us, I would have told them what I just told you in that I have serious concerns about this. This has gigantic ramifications for the banking industry.""

Current media coverage of this issue tends to support the idea that Robinhood checking funds would not qualify for SIPC coverage ([here](https://www.axios.com/robinhoods-new-checking-account-b2b0df32-40c6-4bd1-b336-2408b27f16b0.html), [here](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/14/sipc-chief-raises-concerns-to-sec-about-robinhoods-free-checking-accounts.html), and [here](https://www.barrons.com/articles/robinhood-app-is-offering-a-3-interest-rate-to-take-on-the-banks-51544723146)).

Thank you all for the replies in my 401(k) thread - [https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a5qjuf/seriously\_how\_can\_anyone\_afford\_to\_max\_out\_their/](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a5qjuf/seriously_how_can_anyone_afford_to_max_out_their/) I really appreciate it! I haven't had time to read through all of the comments or answer DMs but I plan to later today.

Some of you were asking if I could add a budget so you could get a better understand of my spending to give advice.  I've included my bi-monthly paycheck amounts, monthly bills, and monthly spending for the last 3 months here -

One thing I was curious about was whether or not I was paying too much in Federal Income Tax.  I had to set up my contributions on my own and I'm not sure I did it correctly.  Any tax lawyers out there than can give advice on this?  Does the amount look correct or is it inflated?  I live in TX btw.",finance
personalfinance,ESPP vs Mega Backdoor Roth?,"Hi Everyone,

My employer just announced that they are allowing after tax contributions, and in-plan Roth conversions. I’m trying to figure out what my next steps should be, as I was planning on participating in ESPP for the first time this year before this change.

Current salary: 85,000

401k contribution per year: 18,500

Employer match: 13,875

Roth IRA: 5,500

HSA: 3,450

Debt: 0

ESPP has a 15% discount, and is purchased based on the first/last day of the purchase period, whichever is lower. I read an article on TheFinanceBuff that broke down the math on how this is an annualized return of 90%+.

Would I be better off ignoring the ESPP plan, and just going straight for the Mega Backdoor? Or should I try to contribute to the Mega Backdoor at 11.5% and ESPP at 10% to use the 15% discount to provide a slight boost to my Mega Backdoor contribution? I’m not very confident in our company stock at the moment, and don’t see it increasing over the next year or two, so I have no desire to hold it longer than needed.

&amp;#x200B;

My post was removed on r/financialindependence \- The general consensus seemed to be that I should contribute to both to take advantage of the ROI on ESPP, and use that to fund the roth accounts.

&amp;#x200B;

u/CasioMonkey had a great post that I think is worth sharing here:

Let's start with the ESPP ROI. Anyone please check my math, I'm not sure I did this right. Assuming:

* 6 month purchase period
* 15% discount on share price
* Biweekly paycheck withholding
* Share prices fell or you don't have a look-back provision (more conservative)
* 25% marginal income tax bracket
* Shares are sold immediately
* Ignore income taxes on the contributions

Let's use X as the amount withheld each paycheck. There are 12 paychecks in the purchase period. You buy the stock at 85% of it's list price. The difference between your purchase price and the sale price is taxed as ordinary income (disqualifying disposition). So at the end of the purchase period, you sell and get this much after-tax cash:

&gt;12X( ( (1/.85) - 1) (1 - 25%) ) + 1) = 13.59X

From here I used the future given annuity equation (F/A). The annuity is X, there are (12) two-week compounding periods. This looks like:

&gt;13.59X = X(F/A, i%, 12)

The X cancels out and you are left figuring out what interest you need to give yourself 13.59 over 12 periods. You could solve the actual equation, but I'm lazy and looked it up in a factor table. A **2%** interest rate gives you (F/A, 2%, 12) = 13.41, which is pretty close. But that's a 2% return over two weeks. You can get the APY from that with:

&gt;i(effective) = (1 + ( (2% \* 26) / 26)26 ) - 1 = **\~67%**

Using your numbers, contributing to the ESPP at 10% with an $85,000 salary gives you at a minimum an additional $5,695 just for playing. That's a free... 6.7% raise after-tax. That only goes up if you buy at a deeper discount or reduce your marginal tax bracket. So my suggestion would be tap the ESPP for everything you can. You can't dump the proceeds into your 401(k) directly, but you can live off the proceeds and up your 401(k) contributions.

To answer your question, I don't have math to compare to the tax shelter of the after-tax 401(k), but I doubt you're getting better than 67% return in your 401(k) and I don't think they have to be mutually exclusive in the first place.

Now that I think about it, there's a strong incentive for Traditional IRA/401(k) contributions vice Roth to get your marginal tax bracket down to improve the ESPP ROI. First time that's occurred to me.

personalfinance,How do you plan for a financially unpredictable year as an independent contractor?,"* 26 years old living and working in NYC
* have about 15,000 in the bank.
* I work two catering gigs and its holiday season so I’m making 646 a week. (There are slower seasons maybe $300 a week.)
* I can keep my monthly expenses extremely lean, around 1100/ a month and pay off my credit card in full each month. 
* My  card is the BOA cash back card- I get $130 in cash back a year. I am  responsible with my credit card and in five years I’ve only paid late once (resulting in $1 in interest). I recently set it up for auto pay. I  think I should sign up for a card that has better rewards!
* I  have 18141 in federal student loans, down from 26000. 17886 in principle and 254 in interest (if I pay on time through IBR my interest is not added to my principle, I always pay on time).  Average of 5.54 percent. 3 loans at 6.8$  ($3356, $3019, and $614) five more loans with highest ones at 3.86%.

Before a drastic life change in September 2017 I was throwing 700 a month at my loans. Now after a year of expensive medical visits, finding/kicking out roomates, and losing my job, I'm MUCH more tight-fisted about not having this money in my checking.

* I  have 3500 in an online checking account (Simple) that gets a little interest.  And the rest is in a regular BOA checking account. I know I could be getting a better interest rate, even Simple's saving account is 2%. 

The  caveat is that I have recently signed to a modeling agency in New York  resulting in attention from agencies world wide. I anticipate travel in 2019 to foreign markets (Asia, Europe). Some of it staying in these markets for a month  at a time. I want to have enough money in checking accounts for buying my own flights, lodging, food (as opposed to borrowing from my agents). And I need to keep in mind payments might take up to 90 days to get to me after which they will have US, foreign taxes, and agency fees removed.

What do you think guys? Pay off loans? Put money in a retirement account? A health savings account? How do you plan for a financially unpredictable year?

gaming,(SPOILERS) fallout 4 epic showdown,"I’ve played fallout 4 several times through and every time I’ve enjoyed myself. It has decent story plots, loads of different gameplay style and is just overall a blast to play. 

This recent play through, I’ve decided to stick with the institute and wipe out the brotherhood and railroad. I mean, the crazy old coot down under the C.I.T.  is my son, so fuck it, I got his back.

First victims were the railroad. Cool dudes and all, but barely put up a fight. It was a slaughter.

The real reason I am writing this is because of the confrontation and extermination of the brotherhood of steel. This isn’t your “drop in and take a few guys out” mission. This is all out war. 

To start, you can’t even relay into the camp because they’re ready for you with all sorts of relay stopping tech. Instead, you pop up in a graveyard of airplanes right outside the base. It’s dark and with plenty of cover, however they’ve got scouts already patrolling the place. 

If you manage to get past their guards and power armor ridden blockades, Now it’s a scramble to find all the relay blockers and fight your way through waves of soldiers. The brotherhood is no joke, they’re armed to the teeth with weaponry. 

After the gruesome task of mowing down soldiers I once called my brothers and finding a way to let my new synthetic allies in, it was time to finish what I started. My directive to infect liberty prime with a virus was at hand. We are to send a message to all of the commonwealth that the Institute is not to be trifled with.

At first it seemed too easy. Scribes and initiates falling at the every pull of my trigger. Only until the knights and paladins showed up, with their monstrous Gatling lasers and a thirst for vengeance to match it. So many of their brothers have already fallen to a traitorous scum of commonwealth. 

As my power armor is blown off piece by piece, I watch as coursers and synths become obliterated, disintegrated to ashes. With a second wind and my body pumped full with psycho drugs, I pull out my gauss rifle and tear down every living soul there is. Nothing is safe from my fury.

In the midst of the fighting, I see a familiar figure approach from the gates. I couldn’t see paladin Danse’s face from up top, as I took cover behind liberty primes nape, but I could imagine how he was feeling. The one person he let close to him in this distant and cruel wasteland has turned the barrel of his gun straight at everything he stood for. In that moment, Danse aimed his rifle with hatred and sorrow burning in his heart, and then I heard him, as if the gunfire and explosions went deaf upon my ears. Three words that still resonated through the framework of my power armor: For the Brotherhood! It was in this moment that I lost a companion and a friend. Before he could fire, I made it quick. One fully charged blast of my gauss rifle to the head silenced his battle cry forever.

The fight was nearing an end, the viral synth was 75% finished downloading death. Suddenly the process stopped and my infected friend was annihilated. As I turn behind me, like a meteor falling from the sky, Elder Maxson leapt from the Prydwen and landed with a deafening boom as his power armor hit the roof of the airport. Without hesitation, he opened fire with his highly modified Gatling laser, infamously known as Final Judgment. With nothing but anger in his eyes, he ripped apart my army of synthetic sentinels with an insatiable frenzy. 

My ammo was low and my power armor was failing. Was Elder Maxson to be MY final judgement? Was he to deliver me to the grotesque gods that rule this horrid and insufferable wasteland? I couldn’t let it be, it wasn’t my time. I’ve come so far to find Shaun, the last ray of light left in my life. I picked myself off the platform and searched my arsenal for anything I had left...

The Fat Man. Don’t travel the Commonwealth without one. 

With only two mini nukes left, this is surely the time I have been saving them for. It was slow to aim at first, and the chamber needed to be loaded. Time was the enemy now and my health was fading. I couldn’t miss this shot, it would take both nukes to take down an enemy of this caliber. So, I aimed, and I fired. Direct hit to the chest! Chunks of power armor flew in every direction leaving the brotherhood commander exposed and wounded. This did not deter Maxson from his onslaught, as he emptied chamber after chamber of his fusion cells. The second reload felt slower than the latter. I couldn’t take any more hits or i was surely done for.

Just then, a platoon of coursers and synths rushes the the stair case and began firing on Maxsons battered body. His suit was in ruin, his helmet was gone. This gave me enough time to run for cover and reload. Then the time came. S trafing from behind the corner, I aimed steadily this one last time. The sound of the the mini nuke screaming through the air was a voice so sweet to my ears. As it landed, it shook the ground around me and catapulted The defeated commander clear off the roof and into the graveyard of aircrafts. Elder Maxson was no more.

Still in shock of what transpired, I hear the guttural voice of the iron, commie slaying behemoth behind me. The virus was downloaded and death was coming. In one swift movement, Liberty Prime turned its head upon the Prydwen and fired its deadly weapon straight into the heart of the aircraft. The destruction was catastrophic. The Prydwen was in flames within seconds and speeding down towards the planet at free fall speed. 

I looked down at Paladin Danse’s body and jumped the railing, so that I could pull the dog tag off my old friend and honor him in some way. As I rushed towards his body, bluish white light engulfed me before I could reach him. I was no longer next to my friend, but on the outer reach of the airport. 

As I watched the flying juggernaut descend in flames, I wondered to myself if what I done was right? The institute claims to protect the future of humanity, but the brotherhood vowed to defend humanity itself. Have I become the savior of the human race, or just the new boogyman of the Commonwealth?


I started off with just an explanation of what I liked about this quest but then I got real into it, so my apologies for the emotional rollercoaster that is my brain. I hope you’ve enjoyed reading this as much as I enjoyed writing (and playing) this epic story. For the record, I did go and get Maxsons gun after I killed that bitch.

personalfinance,How much are the monthly healthcare premiums for a federal employee in Oklahoma?,"I accepted a full-time electrical engineering position in Oklahoma City, I'll be a civilian federal employee. I'll start after graduation in six months, and I'll get federal employee benefits at that time. I'll be starting at $50,000 gross pay, I'm a 30 year old guy.

I have a budget all made out, and I'm going to check out the area next month and get estimates on apartments. The only thing I can't figure out for sure is health insurance. Some sources tell me that monthly premiums for a single person will be anywhere from $120 a month to $400 a month, while others tell me it's going to be anywhere from $500 a month to $1000 a month.

personalfinance,Question about taking on side work under a 1099,"I was offered side work at my apartment complex doing some general maintenance stuff that I believe I can handle. My Landlord wants to pay me with checks and issue a 1099 so I am basically an independent contractor.

From what I have it understood, basically this means no money will be withheld from my paychecks and I am responsible of withholding money to give to the IRS come tax time.

To date, I have made about $42,500 this year. $1,470 has went to an employer matched 401k (they match 3%), and $7,150 has went to Federal withholding, Social Security, and Medicare.

I will be allowed to work for my landlord when I want and on the ""projects"" I want, I will be tracking my hours and presenting them to him once a project is complete and then he would issue a check. He has also mentioned in paying me with ""rent credits"", this would basically mean that if I work 10 hours at $10/hr, then come my rent payment I would pay $Rent-$100. I would prefer this option as I have no ""need"" for this extra cash flow. If I can just save it off of rent it is fine by me. The only caveat I can see is if I have over 3 or so months worth of rent ""owed"" to me for work I've already completed, how would I go about retrieving this money? Would the best course then be to just get a check and have to file a 1099 for the amount of 3x Rent $$ at the end of the year?

investing,How do investments in stocks compound over time if they are untouched?,"I understand how compounding works with bonds and such, but I’m unsure if the same applies to a portfolio of stocks under the assumption that the holdings are untouched (as in a buy and bold approach). I can understand how if a portfolio is rebalanced compounding can occur, but is it true that compounding works with a buy and hold style of portfolio? (Assuming that no contributions are made for simplicity). 

A follow up to that, is if it is not so, then would it not make sense to sell holdings who have gained, and invest the money elsewhere so as to compound returns?  

Further, since assets like bonds are able to compound returns, and it is generally assumed that the stock market returns on average 7% per year (the exact number may be off but it’s not the point), is there a rate of return on bonds that would equal that of the return of stocks over the lifespan? 

Suppose (as an example)  that over the span of say 20 years the stock market returns in aggregate 200% ($1 invested in the stock market in year 1 would be worth $3 in year 20); average yearly returns would be 10%. The $1 is invested and left untouched until the time is passed, where no contributions are made. Suppose that over the same time span bonds have returned the exact same amount in aggregate including compound returns. What would the yearly interest rate be on such a bond (assume it’s a 20 year bond that has a fixed rate)?

I’ve been lurking for a bit now but because of my situation I have decided to make a whole account based on trying to get my life together. Hopefully my post history will slowly grow from me being here as a fucko into an actual responsible human.

 Generally speaking, my current situation at hand is that I was a complete idiot and in debt about $8.5k to my school which needs to be paid as soon as possible and on top of that I have $5k in federal loans. I was stupid and a complete air head, and did not realize that I had payments due to the school. I understand, I really fucked my self over but now I need to buckle down fix it all. 

Currently, I owe my school $8.5k that was loaned to me. Speaking to a representative  today they let me know that it has become a default delinquent (not completely sure how to phrase it as I am panicking). To my knowledge this means I have to find a way to pay it all at once or have someone pay it all on my behalf. I also have federal loans totaling about $5.3k with an interest rate of 3.8%. The payments for these loans are not due until February, but I want to prepare myself. 

So now, I am stuck wondering what the best solution would be. My income is not very high, I make an annual of roughly $25k, my credit score is okay (~700), but I have no where near $8k saved up. I heard about private loans, but also heard that taking out a private loan can end up biting you in the ass even harder. I also am not sure whether standard or graduated repayment methods for my federal loans would be better for me. Honestly speaking, I am panicking and am completely lost. My knowledge in finance might as well be lower than sea level, but I know I cannot just sit here, cry, and pretend like it will go away. I have been doing research and trying to educate myself but if I could get some advice of even a direction I can start looking it I would appreciate every little bit of it.",finance

We unfortunately had to become reliant on credit cards to stay afloat since I was only getting a small amount that I normally would. Fast forward to this summer and we started to catch up and things were looking positive.

personalfinance,"(UK) Getting £3-4k, want to spend this strictly on a car. Any advice?","Hi, I'm not sure what it's called but ever since I was born, my parents have been setting £10 aside every few weeks up until my 20th birthday. I only found out last year and, given I'm doing my driving lessons at the moment, decided I should probably spend this on a car. The amount I will be receiving as of January should range between £3000-4500. It'll likely vary quite a bit due to interest rates over the years. I suspect I should have finished my driving lessons and earned my driving license by about March or April; to which my dad has suggested I just leave it in my Savings account until I actually **HAVE** my license. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ontop of this, in April 2019 my apprenticeship will be finishing up and my company (albeit not in writing nor guaranteed yet) have said they'll be happy to take me on. I'm going to ask between £16-18k/yr due to be reviewed after my 1st year.  In short, I should be getting a huge pay rise.

&amp;#x200B;

Problem is, I never ever got into cars properly, nor the finance side of it and have no idea what I'll actually be paying. I haven't the faintest clue where to look, what to look at and I'm really not sure how insurance works.  Can anyone point me in a good direction for learning more about this and/or letting me know if there will be any issues leaving that amount of money in a savings account? Anything I should look out for in specific when purchasing my car? Maybe a certain price range?",finance

personalfinance,Getting Laid Off - Pay off Student Loans or Save Money?,"The title is a little misleading, but thought I'd keep it short. Last month, I was informed my position was being eliminated and would no longer exist on 1/1/19. I was offered 2 months of severance or I could take another position at my company with the same pay and compensation structure. 

I was already interviewing with other companies and the timing worked out wonderfully. I will start my new job next month and have 4 paychecks coming from my current job.

Now, on to the numbers. I have roughly $28k of student loan debt left (from $93k initially) with a fixed interest rate of 3.15%. I have a small car payment that I split with my SO that I'll leave be. I've been pretty diligent about overpaying on my loans, so I've been able to get it down quite a bit.

Assuming everything remains as is, I'll have an additional compensation this month of around $6k post-tax on top of my normal salary (each check is around $2150 after tax). The 4 paychecks will be, at a minimum, $8k total after tax.

My initial thought is to put \*all\* of this extra money towards the loans. Is it worth setting some aside for savings, or should I try to get rid of my loan debt ASAP? I thought I'd shoot this whole thing out to r/personalfinance just to see what other things I should be considering.

personalfinance,Mortgage prepaid interest w/ example - closing date pushed to early next month rather than end of this month.,"My mortgage closing date is pushed to the beginning of next month, rather than end of this month.

I have a question about prepaid interest that I need to pay at closing, which depends on the closing date.

 

Is it part of the total interest that I will pay for borrowing? or it is an extra?

&amp;#x200B;

For example, (numbers are just fake for illustration)

Say I'm borrowing $10,000 for certain interest rate, which makes the principle and interest $500 a month for 24 months. 

so in that case, total interest I will be paying is $500 x 24 - $10,000 = $2,000. 

&amp;#x200B;

If close on the first day of the month, I pay $300 (say daily int. is $10 and it's for 30 days) up front.. 

1) then I will be paying $1,700 through out the rest of the time, since $300 is 'prepaid'?

2) or, still I need to pay total $2,000 interest, **and** $300 is just an 'additional' for borrowing $10,000 an extra month since I will be paying my first payment on the next month?

investing,Question about the Yield Curve,"There is a narrative is that as short term rates rise above long term rates the idea is that it becomes more expansive to borrow. But being that rates are historically low  around 3% (at a peak of 5% during the inversion of the Great Recession in 2005), that leads me to believe that it would take longer for the economy to take a hit. Simply because more people are probably willing to pay an interest rate of 3% as opposed to 5%. And this is only the 3y and 5y yield anyway.

On to my question.

If interest rates are low (historically) at the point of the yield curve inversion, does this matter as much as opposed to previous recessions? Does this push a recession further out?",finance
personalfinance,I [34M] was told last month I was getting a 15% raise on my salary [47.5k]; got my first paycheck today and my net pay only increased by $150. Where’d my raise go?,"The company I work for told me last month I was approved for a 15% raise; that seemed like a lot but I have been really busting my ass this year to prove my worth (in preparation for asking for said raise) and felt pretty accomplished when I got the good news. By my calculations it would but my gross pay right around $54k, which for the field I work in is not too bad for a non-management position. My calculations told me I’d see an increase in my after-tax pay of about $400, which I was planning on throwing at my debt and car payment to expedite clearing them out.

To my surprise, I checked my paystub this morning and my net pay only increased by $150. My gross pay seems to check out re: the increase I was told I was getting, but it seems like most of it has been swallowed up by taxes (over $1.1k this month alone). At the end of the day, my annual take home pay is only increasing ~$2k, off a raise that boosted my annual gross over $7k. So here’s my question: am I getting over-deducted in my taxes, or is this what the news means when they talk about the death of the middle class? 

ADDENDUM 1: I am paid monthly.

ADDENDUM 2: Per recommendations from the comments, I went back and pulled my last pre-raise paystub to compare withholdings. My previous gross pay was $3,900 and my federal withholdings were $377/month; adding in Social Security and Medicare + my $60 in health care deductions, my total deductions pre-raise were ~$730. Post-raise: My gross pay is $4,552, Medicare and Social Security withholdings only raised a little bit, but my Federal tax jumped up to $763/month, over double what it was last month and is the bulk of why my total deductions were over $1.1k. I'm gonna check with HR and see if that's where it's supposed to be.

ADDENDUM 3: Talked with HR, they confirmed there was a mistake with the paystub service/program they use in the federal withholding calculations this month; they've fixed the glitch and are crediting me back the difference. So, raise found! Thanks for everyone's thoughtful replies.",finance

AYRE was rich much before buying bitcoin, with a business that ot only is going well day after day, but that happens to be larger than crypto.  His business didn't stop when he decided to put a part of his money in BTC but it GREW, so he is richer than before, he would be RICH  even if all he invested  in crypto runs to ZERO. Then you should consider the price he bought BTC at when he decided to buy , imagine if he bought 1 Million USD in  bitcoin in JUNE 2013 (his site was speaking about BTC well before...) now he would have  10k BTC+ 10k BCH + 10 k BSV  do the math and think that for him 1 Million was and is  ""money he could afford to loose"".  
He is not someone who got rich with crypto so if he ever finish BCH, he could just  take some pocket money from his real and huge business and BUY more BSV.

Seriously it's so obvious that sometimes I ask myself if  people saying he will finish money aren't people paid to say that because Ayre needs people to underestimate him.

On Robinhood's website, it explains that users need to sign up for a Robinhood account to get the checking and savings accounts. But it says users do not need to invest to use the accounts, something Harbeck says is contradictory.

Brokerage firms often offer accounts for customers to hold cash until it can be invested in securities, but those accounts aren't meant to be strictly for savings, Harbeck said. Money sitting in such accounts but not intended to buy securities may not be covered by the SIPC, which insures accounts for up to $250,000 of cash in the case of a broker's failure.

The former Army sniper has had some experience with that. His tenure at the the Securities Investors Protection Corp., beginning as CEO in 2003, spans the liquidations of Lehman Brothers, Bernard L. Madoff Securities, and MF Global.

Cash balances sitting in accounts collecting interest for a long period of time also skirt the SIPC rules on what's covered in the event of a collapse, Harbeck said. It may fall under the category of a loan because the brokerage can take that money and invest it income-generating investments like Treasury securities. A loan wouldn't be covered by the fund. ""We want to make sure that investors know there's some risk there,"" he told CNBC.

The SEC, which oversees SIPC, declined to comment.

Robinhood did not immediately respond to a call and email for comment.

I make $8000 from my FT job and $12,000 from the side gig. 

I'm making $20,000 a month per month but don't expect this to last longer than 1 or 2 months. I have $44,000 in debt, $17,000 of that is student loans, of which $4,000 in student loans has a high interest rate and $13,000 has a low interest rate which I plan to pay off next month.

personalfinance,[Saving] Finishing college and looking to move on from my account at a big bank,"Hi guys,

I've been on a student account at Wells Fargo for a while now, mainly because because I've been too lazy to close it and I never had much money.  However, I'm finally going to enter the workforce soon so I think it's time to start taking finances seriously.  I've done some research, and am hoping for some feedback on my tentative plan for the future.

My current situation right now is as follows.  I've been dumping every spare dollar from my student jobs into Robinhood since the company was founded, so I have around $10k sitting in it now.  ~83% in SPY ETF, ~5% in VOO ETF (not even sure what the difference is...), the rest in companies I think will do well in the future.  I recently got a nice signing bonus, so I have around $30k in my Wells Fargo student savings account.

I'm in the US, and will be moving to the Bay Area in about 9 months.  My biggest priority is to move that bonus out of Wells Fargo and into a nicer bank/credit union.  From there, the goal is to save and make the money appreciate as much as possible.

My plan right now is to keep the Robinhood money as is, and split the bonus 50/50 between long-term savings and living expenses until I start work after graduation.  The reason I'm allocating so much to living expenses is because I don't start work for another 9 months and would like to travel this summer if possible.  I would also like to avoid working this school year if possible.

Long-term savings:

* Open a Charles Schwab Roth IRA account and deposit $5500 (max contribution) from my Wells Fargo account (WF from here on).  Put all IRA money into SPY ETF, since it seems Schwab lets you do ETF trades for free on this account.
* Move $2500 from WF to Robinhood.  $1500 goes to SPY, $1000 'play money' for riskier investments
* Open a Capital One 360 money market account and add $10k from WF.  This puts me at over 50% long-term savings.  Once the living expenses accounts run low, I'll transfer $3k out of this account.

Living expenses:

* Open a Patelco money market account and add $10k from WF.  Dank interest rate and no minimum balance
* Open a Schwab high-yield checking account and add the remaining $2k from WF.  Keep this account stocked from the Patelco one.
* Close the WF account.  I don't see any advantage to keeping it, since the fees are high and the interest is low.  Besides, the whole secretly-signing-customers-up-for-accounts thing really rubbed me the wrong way.  Aren't banks were supposed to be trustworthy?

Specific questions:
* How strict is Patelco with their membership?  I don't live in the bay right now, but I will live there for sure within a year (and have documentation of this) -- is that enough for them?.  Alternatively, I am actually from the area originally; is it okay to pass off my parents' address as my own to get membership?  It's still listed as my permanent address for some services, like my Wells Fargo account
* Is it okay to not have a savings account at all, and only use money market accounts?  I don't really see a point of a savings account since they have lower interest and I never write checks.  Is there a catch to these money market accounts?
* Is there anything wrong with the services I've listed?  Are there any better alternatives?  In case you can't tell by now, I'm a bit of a min-maxer
* And lastly, any general feedback on this plan?  Anything to change?

I claimed 0 on my W-4 for the new job.  We are worried that won't be enough withholding now.

personalfinance,Advice on whether to buy apartment now or wait a year,"Hello,

**First, the long explanation:**

I'm a Junior/mid-level software developer who lives in Berlin. I've been here for just over a year (I come from a different country originally). My plan from the start was to buy an apartment as soon as possible, but prices have skyrocketed in the last 2 years (they raised 20% just in 2017 and 13% this year so far) and Berlin is no longer attractive to me for buying - I feel that while still not so expensive for big Western city standards, it's certainly getting there.

So, I've been looking around and Leipzig looks tempting. It's a nice city of 600000 which IMO is nicer than living than a bigger city like Berlin. Job prospects for web devs are not bad too, the salaries are a bit lower, but the price per square meter is about 1700 euros (compared to 4400 in Berlin atm).

In any case, there are a couple of things that are keeping me in Berlin right now, mainly that I can't leave my current apartment until March 2020, but I'll be able to move to Leipzig in about 15 months from now.

However, prices have also been skyrocketing in Leipzig like in the rest of Germany because of the incredibly low interest rates (1.6%) and the general movement of people towards cities. Leipzig's prices started from a very low level (this being an ex-communist East German city after all), but have increased more than 50% in the last 5 years.

**Now, the question:**

&amp;#x200B;

Should I buy an apartment now instead of waiting until moving there in 15 months (if I wait the prices would have increased by 10-15% judging by the trends of the last 5 years)?

&amp;#x200B;

**The pros:**

* I am outside of the 6 month probationary period at work which means that banks will be willing to lend me money
* I have about 54000 euros in cash and about 6000 euros of overdraft on my card (don't plan on touching the overdraft but it's there)
* I plan to use 40000 for the mortgage and keep 14000 as a safety net.
* The apartment I plan on buying will be around 100000-120000 euros plus 15% fees, so the mortgage will be around 75000-95000. I'll probably be paying around 500 euros a month + about 200 a month in fees for the apartment. I haven't talked to banks so far, my estimation is based on using online mortgage calculators.
* I am single and my current expenses are 900 euros for rent + utilities + transport. And about 900 for food, fun, travel, clothes, etc, so 1800 euros a month and my take home pay is 2300 euros a month (so I can save about 500 euros a month). I can definitely decrease the ""fun expenses"" until March 2020. So, I'll probably be able to cover both the rent here and the mortgage with my current salary or be fairly close to covering it (plus I'll have 14000 euros in a safety net). This situation will last just a year and after that I'll only have the mortgage to worry about.
* If I lose my job I will be eligible for unemployment here which for someone like me will cover about 60% of my previous job's income for about 8+ months (half the time I have worked in Germany in the last two years, so maximum a year). Plus, I'll have the safety net.

**The cons:**

* I am actually not happy at my job and will very likely be switching companies soon. This obviously is a bit of an uncertainty, but the market is pretty good here atm, and I feel confident on finding something for the same pay or bigger.
* If I do it now, I'll postpone quitting my job for 2-3 months until the process in over, plus it has a 3 month notice period, and as I said, I don't like working here. If I decide not to buy it now, I would quit next week.
* Paying a mortgage and a rent at the same time is risky and I am pretty sure it will feel pretty stressful.

**So, is the risk/stress worth it for the potential savings? Or should I quit my job now, find a new job that I am happy with and go through another 6 month probationary period and then do this in a year from now, when a similar apartment will likely cost 10-15% more (based on the trends from the last 5 years)? What would you do?**",finance

personalfinance,Homeowner Fun - FHA/PMI/Home Improvement,"My wife and I purchased a house in 2014 for around $133k, via an FHA loan at 3.75%.  At the time, we wanted to be homeowners, but didn't have the necessary funds for a conventional loan.  As a result, we got hit with mandatory PMI every month, which is proving to be a good chunk of change.  Our monthly statement is around $1200 a month, with probably $150 of that going straight to PMI, which drives me nuts.  We've been paying an extra $100 a month to try and knock down the principal quicker, and our remaining principal balance is around $115k.

Doing a quick comparison to the houses around us (I know, not an appraisal, but it's something), our house feels like it would be appraised at around at least $150k.  To make matters even more fun, there a couple of home improvement projects we're shooting to get completed  in 2019 (finish the basement, insulate the attic, etc.)

I keep going back and forth on the our options around the mortgage:

1. Stay with the FHA loan since the rate is great, and continue to pay the PMI ($150ish a month)
2. Shop around, get an appraisal, and explore using the equity in our home to get a conventional loan, knocking off the PMI, albeit likely at a higher interest rate than 3.75

And also a bonus question:

1. Assuming we get an appraisal of the house, would it be wise to look into a HELOC of Home Equity loan to help with the home improvements?  We plan on being in this house for several more years, and our family is quickly growing.  Finishing the basement at least would provide us significantly more ""living"" room for probably another $20k

personalfinance,"22 years old, owe a few thousand dollars each to 2 different universities, can't continue in college without paying them off. Should I start over as a freshman (if that's even an option) and cut my losses?","So the question sounds a bit odd without context. I started at University A full-time at 18 with a lot of scholarships and the remaining few thousand in expenses covered by fed loans. The second semester, I had a major depressive episode and despite the university's mental health facilities, I failed about half of my classes. My father also screwed over the finances of my second semester and left me with a large amount (3-4 thousand if I remember correctly?) of debt directly to the university. I transferred schools because of the episode to University B, which was much closer to home and also where my then-girlfriend was attending.

Because I made the transfer decision pretty late (about 2 weeks before classes started), I never met with a financial counselor at University B to figure out my tuition and by the end of the semester, I had another episode, once again failing a couple of classes and my tuition remained completely unpaid and no loans/scholarships had been put in place or even applied for. University B wouldn't let me apply for loans retroactively to the first semester and also wouldn't let me sign up for more classes without 1. paying the tuition from the first semester and 2. completing my transcript submission from University A (which stupid young me didn't fully realize Uni A wouldn't send if I owed them money). So I just stopped, completely broke, broken up with by then-GF, and hopeless because I figured even if I had taken classes, I would just fall back into depression and fail them.

Long story short, it's been 2 years, my mental health has greatly improved, I live fairly comfortably on my own now working almost-full-time (I make around $1600 a month and have about $1400 a month in expenses including food, gas, etc). I've also paid none of the college debts. I haven't even contacted the colleges about them. I'm really sick of not being in school and want to finish my degree, but I'm not even sure spending $6000+ to 2 universities for transcripts I'm not sure I even want (because of all the failed and underachieved classes) is worth it. Starting new in school sounds great because my pre-college stuff was awesome (33 ACT score, very high high-school GPA, 23 dual-credit hours) and I hate that my mental health and a few poor choices ruined all that, but the thought of taking another 4 years to get a degree at 26 sounds like a huge waste of years of my life if there's another path.

Should I just start over in school and ignore the debt until I can pay it, if that's even plausible? Should I slowly try to pay off that debt and retake the classes I failed (which seems completely financially unreachable)? Should I just give up on my degree and deliver pizza forever? I know people will recommend I try going to a trade school or something, but I'm a pretty academic person and want a more academic career (my previous degree path was in linguistics but at this point I'm going to take another hard look at what field I want to go into, perhaps economics ironically).",finance

Why is my interest rate so high you ask? Well, I'll tell you. My credit was shot at the time. I think mid 500's with little to no credit history beyond bad student loan payments and no other account types.

&amp;#x200B;

Any time I apply for a credit card I am denied citing things like too many accounts past due, not enough accounts, etc. All the mumbo jumbo they say as to why they wont extend credit to me. Which is odd because you'd think they'd like to extend credit to help someone establish, but I digress and that's another topic for another thread.

I want to figure out what options I have to help me determine what kind of decision(s) I need to make going forward. Ultimately I would love to have lower payments. I don't mind driving around a van and really would love to either pay enough down to avoid roll over, or trade it in for something that better fits my life style and wallet.

&amp;#x200B;

Some options that I have considered at the present is trading in for a vehicle that's around 8-10k, and pay off the remaining balance of my current vehicle. Attempt to refinance (last time I applied was a year ago and was only offered \~$10,800 for my then $15k balance. Apply for a new car, let this one get repo'd.

----------
&gt; **Clone and compile the code plus some edits**

Before, we installed some dependencies that are named differently than the equivalent Ubuntu/Debian package specified at the Armory documentation. The build process fails for Fedora as the name for the dependency during checks won't match the Fedora version. There's [this pull request](https://github.com/goatpig/BitcoinArmory/pull/400) addressing that, but the code is not part of any release yet.

So the fastest workaround (maybe a bit *dirty*) was to edit the build config file and correct the name for my Fedora install. Let's begin.

Clone the Armory repository

    git clone https://github.com/goatpig/BitcoinArmory.git

Enter the BitcoinArmory dir

    cd BitcoinArmory

Switch to release code

    git checkout 'v0.96.4'

Verify commit signature

    git tag -v 'v0.96.4'

you should see the following message:

    &gt; object fee1f91a3137ef1056e15cc606a186b0e508f84c
    &gt; type commit
    &gt; tag v0.96.4
    &gt; tagger goatpig &lt;moothecowlord@gmail.com&gt; 1522530739 +0200

    &gt; Primary key fingerprint: 745D 707F BA53 968B DF63  AA8D 8C52 1176 4922 589A

if it looks the same, everything is ok.

Edit the file 'Makefile' file with

    gedit Makefile

And click the **three dot menu** &gt; **Find and Replace...**

Configure the options as follows:

https://i.imgur.com/hpS01Kd.png

Click **Replace All** and close.

Go back to the terminal and run the following commands in order from inside the BitcoinArmory dir. Wait for the previous one to finish before running the next one:

    ./autogen.sh

...

    ./configure

...

    make

if everything finishes without error you are all done! Run this to start Armory:

    python ./ArmoryQt.py

you are all set. Please let me know if I missed something.

CryptoCurrency,In case you missed it: Major Crypto and Blockchain News from the week ending 12/14/2018,"### Developments in Financial Services

* A cryptocurrency exchange-traded product (ETP) that trades on Switzerland’s Six Exchange saw record trading volumes on Thursday and Friday last week, suggesting that institutional investors may be buying the dip in cryptocurrencies. Four major cryptocurrencies underlie the HODL ETP, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ripple (XRP), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). While HODL ETP’s one-month average daily trading is 20,000 shares, on Thursday, December 6th, and Friday, December 7th, 53,233 shares and 62.986 shares were traded, respectively. 
* A report published last week by global anti-money laundering policymaker, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), indicates that cryptocurrency exchanges in the United Kingdom pose a, “low risk,” for money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The report, however, does highlight that such activities on UK cryptocurrency exchanges are an, “emerging risk,” although there is not yet enough evidence to suggest that these activities are occurring through cryptocurrency exchanges. In its report, the FATF urged UK regulators to, “Continue to develop an understanding of emerging risks (such as virtual currencies) and intelligence gaps, and take appropriate action.” 
* Andreas Utermann, CEO and CIO of Allianz Global Investors, called on global financial regulators to ban cryptocurrencies while speaking at a panel discussion in London. According to a report by Reuters, Utermann said, “You should outlaw it,” while participating in a panel alongside Andrew Bailey, the head of Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority. Bailey responded by saying that Utermann’s comments were, “quite strong,” before adding that cryptocurrencies have, “no intrinsic value.” 
* Basis, a major US-based stablecoin project, is shutting down its operations and returning most of its funds to investors, according to a report by crypto news outlet The Block. The report by The Block cited, “multiple people with direct knowledge of the situation,” in claiming that the algorithmic stablecoin project, which generated UDS$133mm of funding through private investments in April, will return funds to investors. According to the Co-Founder and CEO of competing stablecoin project Nevin Freeman, Basis’ shutdown is due to regulatory concerns around one of its token types.

In many cases, regulators like the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) consider these secondary tokens to be securities.  
* Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by daily trading volume, announced that it has added Circle’s US dollar-pegged stablecoin, USD Coin (USDC), to its combined Stablecoin Market.

While speaking to Bloomberg today, Cameron Winklevoss said that, “A lot of our decisions have perhaps given off a perception that we’re more institutional-based. The reality of the situation is that we have a diverse customer base. And the retail story is just beginning.” The Winklevoss twins went on to detail of a goal to expand reach to Asian markets by 2019’s end.    
* Good Money, a US neo-banking platform, has closed its Series A investment round that generated USD$30mm led by cryptocurrency-focused merchant bank Galaxy Digital and the founder of EOS (EOS) Block.one.

### Regulatory Environment

* De Nederlandsche Bank, the Netherlands’ central bank, will soon require domestic cryptocurrency providers to obtain a license from the regulator to operate, as per a report by Dutch news outlet DeTelegraaf. The Netherlands' central bank is taking these measures in the hope that it will, “prevent such cryptocurrencies from being used to launder money obtained through crime or to fund terrorism.” In order to receive a license, cryptocurrency firms must maintain Know-Your-Customer procedures and report any suspicious activity to the Dutch central bank.

* Following a case in Canadian courts that resulted in a ruling ordering mistakenly sent crypto funds to be returned to their owner, a blog post from the University of Oxford Faculty of Law is noting that there could be repercussions with the case potentially setting a precedent for lost or stolen cryptocurrency claims. The Canadian court case’s ruling will require defendant Brian Wall to return USD$370,482 worth of Ethereum (ETH) tokens to the plaintiff, Copytrack. The blog post from the University of Oxford Faculty of Law reads, ‘This precedent may have major repercussions for the enforcement of claims regarding lost or stolen cryptocurrencies,” adding that the ruling allows the plaintiff to recover tokens, “in whatsoever hands those Ether Tokens may currently be held.” 
* Japan’s government is considering plans to ease cryptocurrency taxes in an effort to revitalize the domestic cryptocurrency and blockchain industry. This week, Japanese Congressman Takeshi Fujimaki proposed four significant changes to taxation requirements pertaining to digital assets, which include: a reduction on the cryptocurrency gains tax from 55% to 20%; elimination of taxes on crypto-to-crypto payments; elimination of taxes on miniscule cryptocurrency payments; and an adjustment that would allow cryptocurrency investors to carry forward losses across quarters and years, effectively until cryptocurrencies are ‘cashed’ out. 
* Jay Clayton, Chairman for the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (US SEC), said during a speech that Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), “can be effective,” for fundraising, but that, “securities laws must be followed.” Clayton went on in his speech to comment on the US SEC’s work regarding distributed ledger technology (DLT), digital assets, and ICOs, saying that it is an, “area where the Commission and staff have spent a significant amount of time,” and, “that this trend will continue in 2019.”   
* Jay Clayton, the Chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), expressed his optimism for distributed ledger technology’s potential impact on traditional financial markets in a testimony before the US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs yesterday. According to a transcript published on the SEC’s website, Clayton said, “I am optimistic that developments in distributed ledger technology can help facilitate capital formation, providing promising investment opportunities for both institutional and Main Street Investors.” Additionally, Clayton highlighted that the SEC is, “Focusing a significant amount of attention and resources on digital assets and initial coin offerings (ICOs).”  
* Maxim Akimov, the Deputy Prime Minister of Russia, announced that no significant changes will be made to the draft of a bill concerning cryptocurrency regulation in the country, as per news outlet Finmarket. The bill was already approved by Russia’s parliament, the State Duma, in May 2018, although the bill has generated substantial discussion since. Since approval of the bill, all cryptocurrency and token-related terminology have been removed and replaced with the term “digital rights”. At the beginning of December, Pavel Krasheninnikov, Chairman of Russia’s State Duma, said that the bill needed to be, “significantly,” changed. 
* Pan Gongsheng, a deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China, highlighted that Security Token Offerings (STOs) in China are illegal while speaking at a summit in Beijing. As per a report by news outlet the South China Morning Post, Gongsheng told the summit that, “illegal financing activities through STOs and ICOs were still rampant in the mainland despite a nationwide clean-up of the cryptocurrency market last year.” In citing reasoning for the continued ban on STOs, Gongsheng explained that, “Virtual money has become an accomplice to all kinds of illegal and criminal activities.” 
* Pantera Capital, a blockchain and cryptocurrency-focused investment firm and hedge fund, is warning investors that as much as a quarter of their ICO project could potentially be violating US securities laws, according to a Bloomberg report.

As for payments, they’re not happening yet.” 
* South Korea’s representative body, the National Assembly, held its first official meeting with seven of the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges on Monday. The purpose of the meeting was to debate cryptocurrency regulation between stakeholders of South Korea’s cryptocurrency industry. Cryptocurrency exchanges Bithumb, CobitCoin, Coinone, Upbit, Gopax, Coinplug, and Hanbitco were among the attendees of the debate, which reportedly focused on Anti-Money Laundering (AML) customer protections and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures. 
* The United Kingdom’s Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental financial security body, is calling on the country’s government to increase monitoring of cryptocurrency markets. According to an official report last week, the UK must overhaul its Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and combat terrorist financing (CFT) efforts in order to prevent illicit activities with cryptocurrencies. “Virtual currency exchange providers are not yet covered by AML/CFT requirements,” the report details, adding, “this is an emerging risk and there is not yet evidence to suggest that broad scale ML/TF is occurring in the UK through this relatively small sector.”  
* The United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is interested in learning more about the Ethereum (ETH) network, its technology, and the markets build around it. On Tuesday, the CFTC published a Request for Input (RFI) that requests the public’s feedback on different questions concerning Ethereum. The RFI explains that its goal is to inform the CFTC about Ethereum and similar emerging technology, saying, “The input from this request will advance the CFTC’s mission of ensuring the integrity of the derivatives market as well as monitoring and reducing the systematic risk by enhancing legal certainty in the markets. The RFI seeks to understand the similarities and distinctions between certain virtual currencies, including here ether and bitcoin, as well as ether-specific opportunities, challenges, and risks.” 
* The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (US SEC) is ordering that cryptocurrency asset manager CoinAlpha Advisors LLC pay a USD$50,000 fine, alleging that the firm conducted an unregistered securities sale. After forming in October 2017, CoinAlpha raised more than USD$600,000 from investors to invest in digital assets. In an official release, the US SEC said that CoinAlpha did not file a Notice of Exempt Offering of Securities, meaning that the firm breached securities laws by soliciting securities investors. Additionally, the firm allegedly did not adhere to proper know-your-customer procedures to verify that investors were accredited. 
* Venezuela is reportedly beginning to convert its citizens’ monthly pension payments into Petros, Venezuela’s controversial state and oil-backed cryptocurrency, according to a report by local economics blog the Caracas Chronicles. The conversion of Venezuelan pensioners’ payments into Petros came after the country already sent pensioners their monthly payment in the form of a check for Venezuelan Bolivars -- normally, upon receiving their check, pensioners would deposit their funds into a bank account where they could then withdraw fiat from local branches. The Venezuelan government, however, converted pensioners’ fiat payments into the Petro upon their deposit into a bank. In the first few weeks of the Petro’s existence, its value has risen from 9,000 to more than 15,000.  
* Warren Davidson, an Ohio Congressman and notable advocate of blockchain and digital assets, is floating blockchain technology as a solution to fund US President Donald Trump’s prospective US-Mexico border wall. While interviewing with NPR, Congressman Davidson suggested, “the American people, or whomever should choose to donate,” could pay for the border wall, adding, “you could do it with sort of like a crowdfunding site or you could do a blockchain and you could have WallCoins.”   


### General News

* “The long-term value of Bitcoin (BTC) is more likely to be USD$100 than USD$100,000,” says Kenneth Rogoff, a former Chief Economist for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the current Harvard University Professor of Economics and Public Policy. While writing an article for major UK news outlet The Guardian, Rogoff highlighted that, because BTC’s use is limited to transactions, it makes the digital asset more vulnerable to a bubble-like collapse.

personalfinance,When can I move out?,"I'm graduating in June of next year with my MBA and will start a new job making 65k a year to start, with sizeable raises and bonuses with each promotion (Big 4 accounting firm). I took out one unsubsidized Stafford student loan when I began my program back in Fall 2017 that will total 22k by graduation and it has a 6% interest rate. I will have around 17k in the bank at graduation, based on my current income and expenses. I live at home with parents right now, which is nice because all I pay is gas and insurance for my car, which hasn't hit 100k miles yet. My job is in downtown LA, and I currently live about 2 hours commute from downtown LA. 

I'm looking to rent an apartment closer to work because of the long commute and to become independent. I will maybe take the train and live about a 1 hour commute away. Rent is steep around here, about $1700+ for a one bedroom for places I've seen online that are an hour away by train. Does anyone have any insight as to when I would be at a comfortable level for moving out? What should be my savings goals before moving out? My plan is to aggressively pay off the student loan as fast as I can with my new income, maintaining an emergency fund I can live off and saving enough for startup costs for when I move out. I'm fortunate to have the safety net to live at home, but don't want to have to deal with the 2 hour commute and would like to be independent and move out at some point.",finance
personalfinance,IRS Debt Update - Question #2,"Hello there,

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks to those who replied last time and had patience with me and my situation.

I'm posting now cause I'm hoping people here can help me with the new updated situation my father and I find ourselves in.

He owes $28,000 to the IRS in a single payment (about $38,000 in payment plan) along with \~$25,000 according to him to creditors.

Today he received $25,000 from relative of his to help with his situation. We're not sure if he should pay his creditors or the IRS first and foremost. The issue being that he owes about $700 monthly due to credit cards and such but we don't know how the IRS works in terms of interest. We been looking it up and we don't understand.

If anyone can help me out here give some information on interest rates or what they think is best please feel free to let us know.

Thank you",finance
personalfinance,Wells Fargo are still SCAMMERS,"wells fargo is still a bunch of hacks; same scoundrel learning new tricks. you have

i ordered my credit card the 29th of october. 5-10 business days later, still nothing received. as a precaution, i called in &amp; cancelled the card to order a new one on the 14th on november, 12 business days later. surprise surprise, i received my defunct original card in the mail 3 days later on monday november 19. i figure their incompetence will repeat itself on my 2nd card and decide to wait 17 business days until i call in to ask about the status of my card. all they can tell me is that i had ordered it on the 14th of november. so on the 7th of december when calling in i decide to give it 5 more business days and still nothing. i call in on today, the 14th of december and request that they put some pep in their step and they inform me that they can FedEx my card and that it should arrive in 3 days, monday. i don’t get upset with the representative and ask if my promotion period to spend $1000 in 3 months would be set back to a reasonable date, somewhere like the 14th of november when i ordered my 2nd card. they inform me that it is a set timer that began when i first “opened” my acct on the 29th of oct and that i’d have to wait 15 months before i could be eligible for any promotional offer again. 

my warning that if possible, obtain a credit card from a brick &amp; mortar bank that can hand a you card that day. wells fargo has gone from opening duplicate accts on people’s mortgages to delaying when you would ever get a card from them so that it is less likely you’d spend the full $1000 and receive the $200 reward. they are still criminal and although my current bank of america is ghetto by imposing a bank charge when you turn 24 years old, id rather drive down the street and get a card with the same cash back.

if you currently have a WF acct that you're not willing to part ways with, i hope you can at least take away that if its been open for 15 months, i suggest you cancel it and reap promo rewards before they devise another method of scamming you out of more money. if you’ve recently ordered a card and are still waiting on it, i suggest you cancel it so they can FedEx to you so that the same trickery doesn’t happen to you as it did me.",finance

I maxed out a credit card this year to get chemo for my cat. Good news is his cancer is in remission- I was originally told he most likely wouldn't live past March. The vet's office dubbed him as ""The Legend"" . Anyway, this card has a 9.4% interest rate. 

Secondly, I have a car loan at 4.59% interest. 

The car loan is 1/3 the amount of the credit card.

personalfinance,Questioning if I can even GET a mortgage at this point... Need advice.,"Greetings!

&amp;#x200B;

I am questioning if I can even get a Mortgage with my finances the way they are, and I am in a sort of time crunch.  

&amp;#x200B;

The Situation:  We have rented the single family home we live in for about 6 years now, never missed rent or anything.  Our landlord has expressed his desire to sell the house we live in sometime in the near future.  We have a great relationship with him, and we are interested in buying this house.  He is willing to wait as long as he can for us to fix our credit so we can qualify for a mortgage.  With that being said, here is our financial situation:

&amp;#x200B;

My Wife is disabled, and does not work.

I am a Veteran, and would qualify for a VA loan.  While I would love to be able to put a down payment down on a house, I have nothing to do that with.  

Debt:  I HAD some collections accounts out there, and now according to the ""big three"" I have no collections accounts on my credit report.  I've recently payed off 3 different collections that I managed to secure ""pay for delete"" letters for.  They have indeed been removed from my credit report altogether.  I have about 76K in student loan debt, and the payments are currently deferred due to a borrowers defense to repayment claim filed by me. (for profit school lied quite a bit)  My account never went into a default or missed payment status. 

 I have ONE judgement from 2004 that I know about, from an accident that I didn't even know I got sued about that happened back in 2001.  Long story short, i was taken to court while I was on federal active duty (which they are not supposed to be able to do) and because its been so long I cannot appeal it.  That amount is NOT able to be payed by me.  The debt got sold around for a while, and I have NO idea who owns it now. NOW:  I haven't even been contacted about it in over 10 years.  No letters, no calls, no nothing.  It is NOT on my credit reports, and I have NO public records on my credit reports.  Collections statutes in Wisconsin say that 20 years is the limitation for collection, and as of 2014 the debtor cannot sanction property or title owned by me without renewal.  I spoke with a lawyer recently, and while it still shows in records, he thinks its likely collecting dust in a filing cabinet somewhere and that since I have not heard from anyone in a LONG time, its extremely unlikely that it would be acted on in this last year of it's eligibility. In fact, they would have likely renewed it back before its enforcement date in 2014 if they were likely going to.  According to a couple of Home Loan agents that I spoke with, its not going to show up on a Title search during the loan process, so its not going to affect my eligibility to get a mortgage.

I have ONE old payday loan that was written off by the company over 5 years ago.  Paying this off would only raise my credit score up, and If i don't need to do this immediately to qualify for a Mortgage, I shouldn't need to.  ( this was according to Veterans Home United, as well as a local mortgage agent.  They both pulled a copy of my credit report prior to stating this.""

Other than those things, I have a combined total of 3600 in mixed debt, credit cards, installment loans, and store accounts.  My two credit cards have some missed payments from 2 years ago, but I have a perfect payment history on all of the other accounts that I have.  I am currently at an average of 89% usage across all of these accounts.  

Credit Score:    My middle credit score is currently sitting at 608.  Veterans Home United has said that all I really need to do is lower my percentage of credit used below that 30% mark to have my credit score jump enough to get a really decent Mortgage rate.  Veterans Home united told me that its likely that I could see a jump of almost 50 points in my middle score if I pay off the smaller ones and reduce the two largest ones below 30% usage.  I currently do not have any derogatory remarks showing on any of the ""big three"" credit reports, and all of the information they contain is correct.  

&amp;#x200B;

I make between 40K and 70K a year depending on how much overtime I work, and we currently pay almost 800 dollars a month for renting our house.  We have no car payments, and no other debts other than whats listed above.  We want to stay in the town we are in due to the quality of the schools and the fact that we've built real relationships here in town with our neighbors and the community as a whole.  I know that even with no down payment, we would be paying WAY below what we pay in rent right now if we would be paying on a Mortgage, that's including insurance and taxes.  Owning instead of renting would allow us to finally save up some money and pay off the rest of our debts. Moving to an apartment is simply not an option, as we have a large dog as well as several vehicles.  Our goal is to stay in the house we are currently in and buy it when the time comes.  I've been working for the last two years at my finances just in case this situation ever came around (the landlord selling).  I've spent many sleepless nights trying to figure all of this out, and I'm starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel.  I can likely get my credit cards payed down to the level they need to be my early February of next year.  

&amp;#x200B;

My question is this... With the mess I've just posted above, am I going to be able to get a mortgage?  Am I just not seeing this in the right way?  I've come a long way in the last 6 years, and I'm getting nervous again.  

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading my novel. LOL I know that its a bit convoluted and all over the place, but if you need me to clarify anything, please let me know.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 17th, 2018.

# **Fed meeting could be pivotal for stock market looking for ‘knight in shining armor’  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/14/fed-meeting-may-be-pivotal-for-market-seeking-knight-in-shining-armor.html)**
*****
&gt; The Fed may not be able to turn the tide for the stock market in the week ahead, but it could soothe some of the wild volatility that has been crushing stocks since October.
*****
&gt; The Fed is expected to raise interest rates Wednesday by a quarter point, and the pressure is on for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to sound dovish — but not too dovish. Fed officials are also expected to revisit their fed funds rate forecasts and roll back some of the rate hikes expected in the next several years.
*****
&gt; “Equities are hoping that the Fed is almost done or [for] signals that they’re going to pause. I think it’s too premature for them to do that,” said George Goncalves, head of fixed income strategy at Nomura. “The Fed was a little too optimistic for next year, and now they’ve got to come down. The recent price action is almost an overshoot on the bearish side.”
*****
&gt; The Fed should tweak its economic forecast, and it could note that it has concerns about global growth. Powell is also expected to hold a briefing, where he could discuss Fed officials’ concerns about the impact of trade wars and possibly financial conditions.
*****
&gt; There has been some speculation the Fed could hold off on a rate hike Wednesday, but it is widely expected to move forward and use its forecast and dovish tone to ease market fears that it is moving too aggressively.
*****
&gt; “Is the change in tone going to be enough to jump-start this market that only reacts to bad news? It may well be. It may be the pivot point,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR.
*****
&gt; Some strategists said if the Fed sparks a rally, there’s a chance stocks could find a near-term bottom.
*****
&gt; Robert Sluymer, technical strategist at Fundstrat, said key for the stock market will be how it trades coming out of the Fed meeting. “I think it’s huge,” he said. “A tremendous number of stocks have been selling off through 2018. You have a lot of weak stocks, but they’re also deeply oversold from an intermediate standpoint. ... My guess is coming out of the Fed you’re going to see some relief from that.”
*****
&gt; Sluymer said the market is testing the lows of its 2018 trading range. The S&amp;P 500 closed at 2,599, off 1.9 percent Friday and 1.2 percent for the week. It is now down 2.8 percent for the year.
*****
&gt; “I think the markets want way too much out of the Fed. Market participants want a knight in shining armor,” said Goncalves. Goncalves said Nomura expects the Fed to eliminate one of the rate hikes in its collective forecast for next year, taking it to two instead of three on its so-called “dot plot.”
*****
&gt; Trade-war worries and the Fed’s interest rate hikes have topped the list of what’s scaring risk markets and sending buyers into safe havens like Treasurys. On Friday, stocks plunged after a surprise slowing of consumer and industrial data in China, even though U.S. retail sales were strong and economists upped their outlook for fourth-quarter growth to 3 percent.
*****
&gt; But the U.S. economy is expected to grow at a slower pace next year, and the Fed is expected to emphasize its policy decisions will be dependent on data. Economists expect growth to fall from about 3 percent to 2.4 percent next year, according to CNBC/Moody’s Analytics rapid GDP update.
*****
&gt; “If the Fed sounds overtly too dovish, it sounds like they’re trying to appease the equity market. If they end up being too dovish they run the risk of having us wonder what they know that we don’t know,” said Goncalves.
*****
&gt; Patrick Palfrey, equity strategist at Credit Suisse, said the economic outlook and earnings expectations are still solid but the global economy has weakened somewhat and the market has to adjust. “If you look at valuations in the sell-off, what the market is pricing at the moment is a recession, an economic recession or a profit recession. The question is when you look at ISM or the pace of job gains, the question is are they recessionary? And the answer is no,” Palfrey said.
*****
&gt; Goncalves said the Fed will be careful not to be too fearful about the economy. “The economy is not yet at a point where you can say clearly that we’re heading for a downfall,” he said.
*****
&gt; Besides the Fed in the week ahead, there are a few earnings reports, including Oracle on Monday, Micron and FedEx on Tuesday, and Nike on Thursday.
*****
&gt; Economic reports include homebuilders sentiment on Monday, home sales Wednesday and personal income and durable goods Friday.

The table shows all years in which the S&amp;P 500 fell 10%+ in the fourth quarter. As shown, Q4 2018 is tracking to be just the 10th time since 1928 that the S&amp;P has fallen 10%+ in Q4. Not good. And unfortunately, when Q4s have been bad for the S&amp;P, the following Q1s have been bad more often than not as well.

# US Stock Market Performance During Years Ending In…

&gt; Below is a quick market stat to log as 2018 nears an end and 2019 approaches. In the chart, we show the S&amp;P 500’s average price change in years ending in 0 through 9. This data goes back to 1928 when the S&amp;P 500 begins.

&gt; As shown, years ending in “8” have historically seen the S&amp;P 500 gain an average of 10.7%. At one point earlier in 2018, this type of gain seemed likely, but not anymore now that the S&amp;P is down 2% YTD.

&gt; Years ending in “9” have historically seen an average gain of 8.1%, which is just a hair above the average of 7.5% seen for all years since 1928.

&gt; The best years have come in years ending in “5” with an average gain of 22.4%. Years ending in “3” rank second with a gain of 15.4%.

&gt; On the negative side, years ending in “0” and “1” have both averaged losses throughout history.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/yearsending.png))**

&gt; Below we show the consistency of positive returns for the S&amp;P 500 in years ending in “0” through “9”. As shown, years ending in “5” have been positive 88.9% of the time (8 out of 9), while years ending in “0” and “1” have been positive just 44.4% of the time (4 out of 9).

# Stocks Tend to Ignore Shutdowns

&gt; Next week could bring the third government shutdown of 2018, especially after the fireworks out of Washington yesterday. In a widely watched live TV debate, President Trump sparred with Senate Minority Leader Schumer and House Minority Leader Pelosi regarding funding for the proposed wall on the Mexican border and potentially shutting down the government.

&gt; What exactly does a shutdown mean for stocks? “Although shutdowns get a lot of media hype, the reality is that stocks tend to take them in stride. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 has gained during each of the five previous shutdowns,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, shutdowns rarely push stocks significantly lower and have corresponded with a flat median return in the previous 20 shutdowns going back more than 40 years.

&gt; One would think shutdowns in December might be rare, but they’re actually fairly common. Three shutdowns in the same year, however, is not. Could this year be the first since 1977 with three separate shutdowns? If yesterday’s drama was any indication, the odds may have increased. However, next summer’s debt ceiling debate will be a more important issue when Treasury interest payments are at risk.

personalfinance,"Delinquent, Fedloan dropped credit score by 200 points","I graduated in December 2017 and was unemployed up until November. Because of this, I couldn't afford to make payments for the loans. I'm overdue by 152 days and considered delinquent. I was getting charged $200/month when I had no income coming in. I never received any letters through the mail and I realized that all the emails were going to my college email which I no longer used.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I have a stable job now and can make payments on time or sign up for auto-payments. I know I should have contacted them much earlier and that's completely on me, I decided to ignore my problems and am now suffering the consequences. I was saving up money to lease a car but I doubt I will be able to in my current situation with my credit score barely in the 500s. All my past due payments sum up to around $1,200. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone knowledgeable/someone who has been in a similar situation tell me if there is a chance that they will clear this delinquency off of my score? If needed I do have enough money to pay off the past due amount in full. I will contact them on Monday but I would appreciate some advice now.",finance

personalfinance,Would you rent or sell this house?,"Final Edit: Thank you all for your responses. We reviewed them, researched based off of them and crunched the numbers. We have decided to go ahead and sell the house. 

We are moving to a new city quickly due to a new job and are considering having a property mgmt company rent our house in our old city (*city* burbs). We are doing the math and could use other opinions. 

House is in a good area, great starter neighborhood, 2002. It was purchased with the intent of renting in the future. We haven't hit 2 years since our last property sale yet so we would pay capital gains on a sale. House has new HVAC, Water heater, tile &amp; various fixtures. Only major thing that hasn't been replaced is the roof. 

Property mgmt company charges 1 months rent for a new tenant and 1/2 for renewal plus a 8% mgmt fee. (then repairs as needed). Here's the numbers assuming a new tenant each year. 



* Expected Monthly rent = 1250/mo; Annual = 15,000
* Property Placement: 1250/yr
* Monthly Mgmt: 100; annual 1200
* Mortgage (incl taxes+ins) Monthly: 880; annual 10560
* HOA: 600/yr
* Net after all expenses: $1390/yr


We owe 117k. From a brief look at Zillow and having some understanding of the market and the improvements we have done, let's say we can sell for 180k. 


* Sale price: 180k
* Agent Commission of 6%: 10800
* Mortgage Payoff: 117k
* Net: 50,200
* Short Term Taxes on net - 24% Fed &amp; 6% State = 30%:  15,060
* New Net: 35,140


Source on tax rate: https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets/


Our thought is that long term we can eventually sell the house with a lower mortgage that someone else paid at a lower (long term gains) tax rate. Or we can keep it forever and have a nice side-income in retirement (we are late 20s). We have fully funded emergency accounts, make a decent enough living, save some for retirement, &amp; don't have any debt outside of this mortgage. 


Please correct my numbers if needed. Writing this out i'm thinking we should keep it even with the very low profit. But I suppose the question is can we make more money with the 35k? Thoughts appreciated. Thanks!! 


Edit: I got comps from my realtor. It seems that a safe estimate, assuming the market is stable for 6 months, would be 175k. If we wait until after May of 2019 to sell, so rent for 6 months, we could sell under the 2 out of 5 years rule and not pay capital gains. So new numbers:

* + Sale price: 175k
* - Agent Commission of 6%: 10,500
* - other sale fees, cleaning, prep(since we will be remote): 4,000
* - Mortgage Payoff: 117k
* = Net: 43,500

It's also been clarified that now I will pay long-term capital gains, not short term, since we have lived here almost 3 years now. We sold another house under the 2/5yr rule 1.5 years ago.",finance
personalfinance,Student debt,"Hi reddit,

I'm a recent college grad in the states trying to figure out my financial plan. It took me 6 months post grad to finally find a job but I've found one.

Understand what interest rates do to a currency. Understand how another countries currency can be MORE appealing to institutions and businesses because of the YIELD (key word) of their currency.

Bitcoin,Looking into the future?,"A futures thread without a graph...shocking I know.  I'm semi new to bitcoin and believe in the concept of a global, trustless currency...but I'm wondering what that would look like since intermediaries do provide a lot of beneficial services to the vast majority of the public.  Unfortunately I don't have a lot of faith in man kind as a whole to implement complicated solutions even if it is a better system, therefore the system has to be not only vastly improved, but easily implementable and replicable.    

&amp;#x200B;

So with that said what does the vision of the future look like with some of the following items (PS all of my references are based on US systems where things are backed and insured and relatively stable)?

\-Banks:  Obviously they are a pain in the dick but they do provide a valuable service of a safe place to store your money.  Storing your entire lifes savings, retirement seems very risky with zero insurance to back it.  It reminds me of the idea of burying money in your backyard or in your walls.  It seems like there would be a drastic increase in personal crime where thieves are looking to steal these devices/paper/software wallets.  What is the solution to this without having a regulated system that doesnt involve trust on some sort to safeguard your coins/privatekeys?

&amp;#x200B;

\-Escrows - when transferring large sums of currency for a good or service you're never going to want to transfer directly to the person as that involves trust...but so does an escrow which I can't see anyway around without a 3rd party that also involves trust.  

&amp;#x200B;

Also wonder about things like interest rates, investment tools, markets etc.  Maybe I'm missing the point and these things aren't going away, but reforming in another way...but without regulation and protection wrapped around them they would be riskier than fiat.  However the only way I see this happening is via government and bringing the government in to regulate things could potentially put us back to where we are now...which means we could fork but then we are back at square one.

personalfinance,Large downpayment vs investments?,"Illustration

**Small downpayment $10,900, Lump sum investment $21,800**

* Interest 3.29% over 20 years on $207,100 loan

* $1178.70 monthly repayment

* $282,927 paid towards loan by end of 20 years ($75,827 interest paid)

* $21,800 lump sum for investment at 11% annualised returns (tax-free)

* Appreciation of investment is likely $175,758 by end of 20 years

**Large downpayment $32,700**

* Interest 2.05% over 20 years on $185,300 loan (more generous interest given a higher downpayment to loan ratio)

* $941.80 monthly repayment

* $226,032 paid towards loan by end of 20 years ($40,744 interest paid)

* Invest the difference in the monthly repayment figures of $236.90 every month towards 11% annualised investment (tax-free)

Are my figures correct? Am I better off in this scenario to make a larger downpayment and invest the difference I save from having lower monthly repayments towards a tax-free investment?

This assumes the interest rate on the mortgage remains constant (cannot lock in for more than 5 years).

How do I approach overpayments (I am fine with risk) if I am to mmake a larger downpayment? My understanding is to invest while interest rates on mortgages are low, but overpaying reduces my monthly repayments once recalculated.",finance

I have about 2K taken out and put into an FSA to deal with a bunch of medical issues I’ve been experiencing, and spend approximately $500 on a car note and insurance combined.

personalfinance,When to sell tax-exempt bonds?,"Hi there, I currently hold bonds that are exempt at the federal level (VWITX). However, I'm planning on leaving the US. I was wondering so as to not pay federal taxes on them, do I need to sell them before I leave the US? Or if I will be a tax resident of the US for the year, could I just sell them at the end of the year?",finance
personalfinance,Should I cancel some of my student loans; pay some of them off; or keep the money for next year?,"At the beginning of the year, I did not technically have medical insurance, though my application for Medicaid was in. As a result -- since my university mandates that all students have medical insurance -- I had to purchase around $3600 of health insurance for the whole year, from the university. With this added charge, I had to take out around $5500 of student debt to pay for the year. Luckily, I was able to take out all of this debt through Federal [Direct Subsidized Loans](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized#subsidized-vs-unsubsidized), aka ""Stafford Loans"", so to my knowledge I won't have to start repaying these loans (or pay interest on them!) until I'm 6 months out of school. So that's cool.    
            
Fast forward to a few months ago, and my application for Medicaid was approved. So now I was double insured. I contacted my university and, to my surprise, they actually were able to remove the entire $3600 charge for their health insurance! I had never used it, but I still didn't expect them to remove it all. So that was like, the best Christmas gift ever!     
     
-----------------------------------       
       
**The upshot:** I now have both of my semesters paid for, with $2000 in the bank, and $5500 of Federal Direct Subsidized loans to my name.     
         
My question is... what should I do with this new found money? I do think I should keep about $250 of that money in the bank, just for odds and ends expenses for next semester. But aside from that -- shouldn't I use it some of it to lessen my loans? The way I see it, I have three options (though of course I'm open to other things if I'm not thinking correctly. You're the expert!):    
         
1. **Cancel around $1750 of my loans**. If I'm recalling correctly, this is perfectly possible; I'd just have to email them that I'd like to lessen my loan amount.     
        
2. **Pay off around $1750 of my loans**. I actually think this one might be a better option then above; because wouldn't it help my credit score? And it'd had functionally the same effect. I'm not sure though.    
      
3. **Just keep the $1750 to help pay for next year**. Initially when I started thinking about this I was dead set on reducing my loans, somehow, because that number scares me. But, as I thought about it more... should I actually keep some the money to help pay for next year? My reasoning is, since they are Direct Subsidized Loans, I don't pay interest on them until I'm 6 months out of college (which is a ways off for me -- I'm just a sophomore/2nd year). Further, I don't have to start repaying them until I'm 6 months out of college either. (This all assumes I understand Federal Direct Subsidized loans correctly; but I *think* I do). So, should I just keep the money for next year? It's not like I couldn't pay it off later... and I don't think that would necessarily harm me, since they aren't going to accrue interest for quite a while.    
         
So that's the situation I'm in, and I was just hoping for some feedback/advice. Right now I think I'm leaning towards option 2, but I'm still unsure.

personalfinance,I'm delinquent on several credit cards/personal loan accounts - will I run into any trouble traveling?,"26 years old, over $35k combined in credit card/personal loan debt. Last few months have been rough and I'm 30-60 days past on all my accounts. I will likely be filing Chapter 7 after the holidays.

I basically just quit making payments on everything except for rent, car, and insurance. 

I get 10 calls per day between Upstart, American Express, Barclays, Chase, and Symphony Bank (Amazon) - all of which get sent to VM. 

Barclays and Upstart are probably the most aggressive. I accidentally answered an Upstart call several weeks ago; their collections spoofs their caller ID to a local number - and since I'm applying for jobs I answer local calls. Lady demanded I pay $600 even though I explained I don't have the money.

Also, I stopped using my primary checking (Navy Federal) because I have a credit card with them and they are auto debiting my account. For the time being I'm using cash for everything, and am expecting my debit for Go Bank to arrive today (Uber driver). 

I also got a ""we missed you"" note from USPS the other day, looks like Chase tried deliver a letter that required my signature - a little worried about this?

I looked up my name on my current and past county in the court records and can't find anything.

Anyways, because of this I'm a little worried about running into trouble when I travel home for Christmas in a week - airport security, hotels, rental car, etc.

personalfinance,I have biweekly specialist appointments and regular monthly prescriptions. Should I do an FSA or an HSA?,"My current employer offers both an FSA or an HSA option, both for free for myself (I have no dependents) and both deducted from my paycheck as pre-tax dollars.  This year I did an FSA and ran out of funds before the end of the year, but I looked over my payment history and feel confident that I know roughly how much I'll spend next year.  I estimate I spent $2200 on health expenses in 2018, excluding my eye doctor appointment and glasses (I typically go to the eye doctor only once every two years).

I've read threads in the past in this sub that mention that an HSA is almost always better than an FSA.  However, I have regular, predictable expenses.  My FSA plan means that I have a low deductible and pay a flat $30 per appointment (except for my dentist) and $15 for my regular prescription.  My expenses are:

* Appointments with a psychologist every two weeks
* Meetings with a psychiatrist about once a month, along with a corresponding generic Adderall prescription for which I pay $15/bottle.  IIRC my pharmacy charges around $30 for a bottle.
* Dentist appointments every three months (instead of every six because I have weird teeth)
* Eye doctor appointment and glasses (I'll probably wait until 2020 to go again)

I also went to a primary care doctor four times in 2018, and found that an FSA was nice because the cost per visit was a flat $30, so if I was on the fence about whether to go to the doctor I'd always go.  This helped me catch pneumonia on Day 2 of dealing with it, rather than me waiting like a week to go.

On a related note, I also still have about $70K worth of student loans (max interest rate is 6.5%) that I'm working on paying off.  So if people here are leaning towards recommending an HSA because it's also an investment vehicle, please keep that in mind.

I'm not hurting financially so there's no issue of me not being able to afford any of these regular medical procedures.  But I'd like to make the best financial decision I can and save myself the most money.

**EDIT:  Based on the advice in this thread and checking my Explanation of Benefits, I’ve submitted the paperwork for an HSA.**",finance
gaming,Witcher 3 is great! But not mind blowing. (Spoilers),"Not trying to bait or anything but I have played witcher, assassin of kings and wildhunt. I haven't read the books.
Best about the game series is continuum. Switching from 1 to 2 was fun when things I did in 1 had effect on things on 2. I also got to keep swords and armor which made the switch so much more fun.

Minor thing bothering me was change in wild hunt character. In 1 it was semi god like character, it still was like that in 2, but by the end of 3 they were just buffed elves.

decisions don't have effect on gameplay: everyone praise the effect of decisions and I agree to some degree. For example if keira doesn't come to kaer morhen Lambert dies or if I don't save one sorcerer in side mission i get another chance in free roam. However effects are shown mainly in the end when they don't matter so much anymore. For example  killing Radovid doesn't have any immediate effect. Guards still patrol, only minor dialogue changes. Only in the end it is told that it had some effect.

Empty world: all the villages are generic with  similar setup. Inn, shacks and notice boards. There is plenty of different monsters which is really cool, but human enemies get boring really soon. There are factions like fallen knights, cannibals, pirates etc. They are always attacking and loot gets repetitive. Few exemptions are bridge bandits in velen and slave traders in skelliges and ulrich and his crew. With these you can actually reason with.

*Roth 401k: meeting employer match, ~8%
*Mortgage: just under $230k, 3.8% interest rate
*Emergency fund: 1 year saved in non-interest earning checking account
*Income: ~100k

I've thought about just leaving the old retirement account alone but without any new contributions it isn't growing much. But I don't know the consequences of moving from retirement to taxable brokerage account.

The whole reason I started looking into an investment account is to put my extra money beyond emergency fund to work. I'm thinking about putting ~1k into the account every four months and was thinking to use the old retirement account as a lump sum to start it.

personalfinance,"Just got a promotion, now missing overtime hours on paystub; haven't heard back, but am expecting to get stiffed due to poor ethics of employers. How to do a proactive?","I work at a charter school through a recruiting agency. I have been working with the school and agency since the beginning of 2017 school year. I normally submit my hours on a timesheet every week, take photos of the timesheet, then hand the physical copy to the school principal for approval, and receive a paycheck from the recruiting agency.

Recently I received a promotion at the school. After briefly speaking with recruiting agency about pay, but never agreeing to anything (specifically stating ""it would all depend on responsibilities and expectations), the school and recruiting agency negotiated my rates together without me; first red flag. Recruiting agency comes back and says I'm going to be getting paid a good amount more now for a new job, I ask what the responsibilities and expectations are and my recruiter doesn't f'ing know.

I speak with the head of my department at the school. Explain that I'm angry with recruiting company and I never agreed to the rate and would like to speak more about pay and responsibilities. Department head is (understandably) very busy, but we have a talk about pay and they tell me to include **extra hours** on my timesheet until they can get all the approvals from HR etc on my pay. So the school tells me to include an extra hour per day, to make my rate effectively closer to what I wished for, *until they can fix the problem properly*.

So! I hand in a timesheet with 43 hours on it at my new rate. Worth noting, **before my promotion I never worked more than 35 hours in a week.** I take my timesheet to the principal, mention the extra hours, the principal literally tells me ""Oh, Mr Telephone, you do so much for us, I'd approve any hours for you.""

So then, I receive my paystub via email; all of my days are cut off at 3:15 when I actually work odd hours and leave at different times each day, and I have only 37.5 hours on my paycheck.

It's Sunday and I email the recruiting agency first thing, emailing my point of contact and the person in payroll that I normally speak with and telling them that my hours are wrong and I'm missing pay. I immediately receive what I'm assuming was by accident, my paystub again with no changes and nothing in the body of the email; this was sent by the automated system, not by the actual people who I emailed, so I imagine this means someone in payroll is just bumbling around after having seen my email.

I'm trying to assume this was a goof up on the part of the recruiting agency and I'm not trying not to assume the worst, but due to the BS that I've had to go through with them and the fact that they cut my hours down to a specific time everyday, I'm partially expecting this to turn into a proper shitshow where they tell me I'm not allowed overtime hours and this and that, in which case I wouldn't know what to say.

I know I fucked up by not demanding a renegotiation of pay in the first place and I know I should have probably put my responsibilities down in stone before accepting the position, but since I'm a contractor, are they just allowed to tell me that I can't work above 37.5 hours a week? And who would I even complain to; the school, my recruiters boss, the DOL?",finance

This is a lie.

Mick Mulvaney has a history, and when you look at it, what you find is that he has been consistent in his favoring of banks and institutions ([Equifax](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-equifax-cfpb/exclusive-u-s-consumer-protection-official-puts-equifax-probe-on-ice-sources-idUSKBN1FP0IZ), anyone?) over regular people.

Wether it’s attempting to protect banks from being fined for defrauding customers, or shutting down consumer protections, Mick is not afraid to show what side he fights for.

He [tried to drop the $1B in fines against Wells Fargo](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-wells-fargo-exclusive/exclusive-wells-fargo-sanctions-are-on-ice-under-trump-official-sources-idUSKBN1E12Y5) for their involvement with defrauding customers. (Wells Fargo was eventually fined, but were allowed to decide how everything was settled)

He’s the guy that [protects predatory lenders who give him lobby  money and kickbacks, like payday loan sharks](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cfpb-payday/mulvaney-led-u-s-cfpb-slashes-payday-lender-penalty-sources-idUSKBN1JO17J).

[He fought to shut down a public forum for filing complaints against banks, firms, and other businesses.](https://www.americanbanker.com/news/mulvaney-to-drop-public-complaints-against-firms-change-cfpb-name)

He’s also the guy that [asked to fund military parades and border walls through cuts to programs like Meals On Wheels, Public Broadcasting, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/22/us/politics/trump-budget-cuts.html). ([here’s a little bit more on this topic](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/us/mick-mulvaney-budget-director-consumer-bureau.html))

He’s also the guy that said that the current tax plan would not add to the federal deficit, yet [the 2019 US federal budget would “add $984 billion to the federal deficit that year, and $7 trillion over the next 10 years.”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/budget-fy2019.pdf) Is that what fiscal conservatism looks like?

[This article has a left-leaning bias, but goes into detail about how Mulvaney tries to do everything in his power to avoid penalizing banks](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/4/10/17218774/mick-mulvaney-cfpb-consumer-wells-fargo-equifax)

I know that you should should pay off the debt if you can’t get a better return on investments.  I just wonder how the math works if you calculate tax dedications from investing in a 401k, etc.

Scenario: 
Student loans around 40k
Average interest rate of 4.7%
Yearly interest amount $1800

Question:
If I contributed $7,200 in a 401k, it would/could lower my tax bill by $1800 a year.  So if I “offset” my loan interest amount and still earned the growth of an investment account, how would this not be a better scenario?

We’re able to have the loan out for 20 years at a 6.25% interest rate and it doesn’t need to be paid back immediately if something unfortunate occurs. I have 35k in another account that does very well. 20k in my current account and have basically made 0 gains this year due to all the ups and downs of the market. The mortgage I’m looking at is around 80K. 

I plan on increasing my 401K contributions to fund my 401k to preloan amounts and that will take around 1.5 years to do. 

I’d have around $110 back in cashflow in terms of mortgage payment if I didn’t meet PMI and if I decide to become a landlord, it’ll be easier for me to rent out the unit at ~850/mo and get emergency funds than if I didn’t put a 20% down payment down and mortgage was already at ~850/mo. 

I know it’s always viewed that taking 401K money out isn’t the way to go. But given the length of the loan, no negative repercussions if I lose my job and such, the lower mortgage payments per month. What would you do?

Any help/advice about adulting such as paying taxes and budgeting appreciated.

As my post's title stated I am 21 years old and I've recently been hired into what I would consider a pretty well paying job.   I start in early January and I will be making roughly $62k before taxes in my first year before overtime, with OT closer to $70k is likely. I will be moving to an expensive large city for my new job and I've realized that I don't really have a lot of financial experience so I'd love any advice you have for budgeting and living entirely independently for the first time.   Other factors which may affect advice you give:

1. I'm finishing the final two classes for a Bachelor's online by May.  I have no college debt but am considering a Master's Degree at some point within the next few years.

2.  I will have 6 months of paid training before I move to the city.  For 3 of those months all room/board will be paid, for the other 3 months I will likely be living out of a hotel and paying for meals.

2. My girlfriend will likely be coming to live with me after I've gotten settled, I will be helping support her while she looks for a job after which we plan to contribute to joint expenses based on salary (i.e. If I make 60% of our joint income I pay 60% of joint costs, she makes 40% of our joint income she pays 40% for example).  She will likely have about $12-15k saved up to help out with costs. If her current job is a decent metric she will probably make between $25k and $30k after she finds a job.  She also has no college loans to pay off but may pursue a master's in the future. 
 
3. I have no personal credit history at the moment, I was worried about going into debt before I found a real job after college so I held off on a credit card until now.  I plan to work on building my credit in the coming months but I am unsure the best way to go about doing so.

4. I will be employed with the government so I will have a Federal Thrift Savings Account rather than a 401k (I think they're similar but admittedly I don't know the specifics of differences between Thrift Savings and a 401k), my employer will match up to 5% of my salary contributed and I plan to contribute up to the matched amount every year.

My main questions would be:

1.  Is there anywhere that offers a breakdown for budgeting about how much is acceptable to spend on housing, food, etc.  Any other easy to understand resources to learn about budgeting also would be appreciated.

2.  Are there any financially responsible ways to go about creating a favorable credit score for myself in light of my lack of credit history

3. What is the best way to go about educating myself about paying taxes and what are the best places to actually go about doing so?

4.  Are there other major financial considerations I should be making based on the information provided which I am not?  Accounts I should be contributing to or investments I should make, etc.",finance

personalfinance,Seeking advice for going back to school and following passions at a huge cost,"Hello,

Thank you for taking the time to read. I have been accepted into an Accelerated Bachelor of Science in Nursing program that is about 750 miles away from my hometown (in another state). I am set to start the beginning of February, however I am in need of a plan to finance my education. The total cost of attending this school (including personal finances, etc.) will be about $70-80k. I am in the situation to where I will get about $20k in federal loans, but will need to cover the rest with private student loans. My problem is that I do not have a cosigner who is willing to take on the favor due to the high cost of these loans. I am needing to make this huge decision quickly, all while not knowing whether I will get approved for a private loan by myself (I have applied twice and got denied due to limited credit history; am currently waiting on the third application). A few questions I have: 

1. Is it worth the risk of going to an out-of-state nursing school, especially since it is an accelerated (1.5 year) program and knowing it will be full of stress (literally blood, sweat, and tears haha..)? The risk, of course, being that it is such a fast-paced program and I will be in $70-80k+ worth of debt, not to mention another $20k from my previous undergrad degree. A note: I plan on moving back to my home state of Cali immediately after graduation, where the starting salary for new grad RNs is at least $60k annually. I am taking into account that if I do not have a cosigner, my interest will be significantly higher and could reach 10-14%.
2. Does anyone know of any private student loan lenders that do not require a cosigner? Also, how many times should I try before it becomes too much of a burden on my credit score? And how much is too much to ask for at a time?
3. Any more financial advice for making this big decision?

personalfinance,Erase $230k student loan or reinvest in real estate...,"Long time reader and now need help. 

In March, I am going to sell my rental house that coincidently has the same amount of equity as the balance on my federal student loans, $230k. Should I pay them off in full, reinvest the funds in another rental for passive income, invest it, or what?

I'm 32M an attorney and just left the public sector last year for private practice. I was 5 years from PLSF but it was clear to that long-term I would be more satisfied with building my own own practice. Found a great firm that said do our overflow as an associate and build your book. One year in private practice and I was right- I am much happier, work harder, and the future is exciting. My wife is well employed but that may change. We have one kid and one on the way and she wants to keep working but not in an 8-5 job. Together we made about $200k this year. I expect we will make close to the same next year.   

Because I was PLSF, I let the loans ride. Well at 7% interest, $60k in interest accrued in those five years. Pension did not vest so collectively we have about $50k in retirement savings, $10k in college savings. 

We have owned the rental house for five years. Lived in it from Sept 2013 to Dec 2016. We paid $270k for it and now conservative estimates from our agent suggest we have $200k-$230k in equity. From Dec 2016 to present we rented it out for $2,000 a month which covered the mortgage plus $700. I have to sell it this year to avoid capital gains tax on the equity. 

In Dec 2016 I screwed up. Bought a house that was out of budget for $450k with PMI and our house payment is $2,700/mo with PMI! I have spoken to several lenders and our payment won't drop significantly with a refi. House has increased in value to close to $600k. This is a debt that we could also pay down to get the payment more manageable.  

If the theme is not clear, in addition to living in a hot real estate market that may cool  as rates go up, I have a good eye for undervalued real estate. My first house I bought for $110k in 2009 and sold for $180k after four years and $25k in renovations.

I can only speculate as to what it would feel like to pay off the student loans. I'd still have two car payments and a mortgage so no ""debt free scream."" I can also only speculate as to how quickly I could roll these funds up and make 10-20% return on a house buy, hold, fix deal in 3 years. I even have a great tenant that has asked for the next place.

My stomach also turns at the thought of writing a check for $230k to the Department of Education. It is not clear to me whether forgiveness at 20 years is possible/likely based on my earnings. By the time that happens though, the debt could be nearly seven figures. The other problem is that with a house of four, my student loan payment under an income-driven repayment program would be below $500/mo. 

I also know that I will sleep better if I never have to think about whether Betsy DeVoss can cancel all the IDR programs again, or wake up in the middle of the night to re-read my promissory note on the loans to ensure there may be some contractual remedy... I digress. 

I could pay off the loans in full, reinvest the funds, or do some blended approach... 

I know I am very lucky to have this problem. Please help.

&gt; Dow futures implied a slide of about 52 points at the open on Monday, as of 7:45 a.m. ET. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq futures also pointed to a slightly lower open.

&gt; Recent economic data have reignited worries of economic slowdown around the globe and kept a lid on stock returns. The Dow fell nearly 500 points and the S&amp;P 500 closed down 1.9 percent on Friday to 2,599.95 — its lowest closing level since April — after China reported industrial output and retail sales growth numbers for November that missed expectations.
*****
&gt; The latest economic data offered yet another hint that Beijing’s economy may be decelerating amid rising trade risks as President Xi Jinping tries to broker a permanent truce with President Donald Trump. The two nations have slapped tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods over the past year as disagreements over the handling of intellectual property and a yawning trade deficit pit the world’s two largest economies against each other.
*****
&gt; Investors are also on edge ahead of the December meeting of the Federal Reserve’s policymaking arm. The Federal Open Market Committee is expected to hike its benchmark overnight lending rate for a fourth and final time of 2018 this week. While fears of rising interest rates and an ambitious Fed have spooked markets throughout 2018, such concerns have evolved over the past month as inflation and growth expectations recede.

&gt; The Bloomberg analysis found that loans issued about six years ago have the highest cumulative loss percentage compared to any other year since the financial crisis ended. This indicates that students who took a loan in 2012 have had a much more difficult time making their monthly payments compared to students who received loans shortly before and after -- students who have had a similar amount of time to pay them down.

&gt; A large percentage of those who took out loans in 2012 are currently 24-33 years old, an age where many are generally establishing themselves in their careers. Borrowers in this group entered the labor force when the unemployment rate was twice as high as today and may have found it difficult to find a career track in their desired field. Further adding to the difficulties faced by this group was that finding a position in 2012 took almost three times longer than today, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

&gt; Borrowers in the 25-34 age group owed $489 billion as of the third quarter, slightly less than $530 billion balance for 35 to 49-year-olds.

&gt; **Many Americans are taking student debt with them into old age too. At the end of September, 1.8 million borrowers age 62 and older owed $62.5 billion in federal student loan debt and those in the 50-61 age group owe $213.6 billion, according to data from the Department of Education. In just one year, the aggregate amount owned by borrowers over the age of 50 increased by $28.8 billion or 11.6 percent.**

My credit took a dive, because I had person financial issues but everything is back on track. Basically my car is on its last leg so I've been looking at seeing if I can get a newer car. 

Basically my credit union say I would need a cosigner, however they said....

"" Interest rate is going to be based on credit score, year of vehicle and term.  Anything 2013 or newer, you would be looking at about 15.99% based on your credit score. We would not use the co-signers credit score unless they were on the title and registration. ""

He also said there's a 10% early withdrawal fee that applies down the line (since I'm 20 and not 55) and he mentioned that withholding more than 20% might be a good idea to cover the other 10%.

personalfinance,"14k in CC debt. I opened up a new credit card to consolidate debt, but the credit line is significantly lower than the balances I want to transfer","So the long and short of it is I (31) opened up a new credit card to transfer my balances and work on paying down my credit card debt without the stupid interest. Unfortunately, the credit limit is $2,500, which as you'll see below is significantly lower than the balances I want to transfer.

Card 3 has 0% APR for the first year, but will go up to 16% this coming July. Because of this, I was planning to just consolidate Card 1 and Card 2 for now.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my question here is really twofold: 1. What should I do about the credit card I just opened? I'm guessing I shouldn't try to cancel it, but instead just leave it alone? Or should I transfer a partial balance? and 2. Any suggestions for dealing with the credit card debt?

&amp;#x200B;

Like most people, I got into this situation due to careless spending and not budgeting properly. I'm working on that going forward. And like everyone else, I have rent and bills. I also have quite a bit of student loan debt that I've consolidated as well as I can for now. I also have a car payment, and to top it all off, I'm also saving for a wedding next year.

personalfinance,[Advice] Need help deciding on how/how much to invest now that I can afford to.,"Hi all, long time listener, first time caller.

For the first time in my life I make enough money that I've started accumulating a significant amount of savings. I'm 28, living in NYC. Living with my girlfriend in a 1br apartment in Brooklyn.

At the beginning of 2018 I got a job offer that significantly overpaid me at $135k (I was earning $85k before that). Worked there for a few months until they laid off my department (""restructuring"") and I landed a job in June that pays me $110k + $10k bonus ($2.5k quarterly). Best job I've ever had, love working here.

I'm pre-paying my federal and state taxes and I'll have accumulated about $20k in savings by the end of 2018. I want to start investing. First step I've decided to take is to invest in a Roth IRA and max out my contributions for 2018 (and then 2019 as soon as the period rolls over). If I'm $120k pre-tax, what should my max contribution be? I've now been told a range between $4550 and $5500, so I don't trust that.

Additionally, I'm having trouble deciding between Vanguard / Fidelity for my Roth IRA. Anyone here have any experience with either?

Beyond advice on the above, does anyone else have suggestions for places I can start saving for the future? Hope this was enough information.",finance

personalfinance,14k Credit Card Debt - best way to dig out,"I'm 38, single, $50k annually.

I got stupid and have 14k on my (only) credit card (16.something% interest).  

Previously I kept my card paid off.  Once I started carrying a balance it just blew up.  

I think the best thing for me to do is get a loan (at a lower interest rate) so I can keep better track of credit card. (Do prefer to use it at gas stations, other potentially skimmer locations as CC has better protections than debit).

Structured payment likely better than 'minimum payment, and whatever else I can/feel like).

(My other thought is 0% balance transfer credit cards, but more credit cards just don't seem like the best option.)

&amp;#x200B;

Where is the best place(s) to look for a loan?

I assume my credit report will make it clear that it's credit card debt, is there any use denying that/trying to hide it (would application ask?)

Anything else I need to think of?

&amp;#x200B;

I have $3k emergency funds I would rather not tempt fate by using all of. (I'm scared of Murphy)

I have $3k from hurricane insurance relief that I currently cannot use for intended purpose (fence repair) because I owe too much to make up the rest. (Hurricane deductible's suck.)

I have $1k that is to be this years Roth contribution.

I have a nascent car fund (when car was paid off I just put the same amount into savings each month - $200/mo)

Other savings that I'm pretty good about not spending because it's earmarked, but could be pilfered if that's the best option. (I'd have to look at my cheat sheet to see what all the earmarks are.  They are not all necessary, but I think they do help.  Per bank balance that would be another $5k (includes putting aside for house insurance, car insurance, house taxes, so not all of it is really available).

&amp;#x200B;

At some point the carried balance just became an abstract concept to me, so I really think I need to get it off the card.  With concrete numbers for monthly payments, I'm confident I can pay off any CC balance I do generate.  My family has also offered to cut up my cards for me.

I have a decent amount saved up, but I would most likely only be storing about 1k. I believe I've done something similar like this in the past, but it was when I was younger. 
The dividend and APY is higher at a similar credit union, so would I be able to open a new account with them just to use their share certificate? Also, how many can I have open at the same time? Are there any similar things available where I can ""deposit"" money (in which I can't use or withdraw) and earn higher interest on than if it was sitting in my saving account? 
The terms are only going to be for 3 or 6 months 
Thank you all",finance
personalfinance,I’m a little confused on how federal taxes work on paychecks and have some questions,"My hours per pay period will vary pretty wildly, and I also get to choose how many hours I work for the most part. My paycheck from 2 weeks ago had 21% taken out for taxes ($1,343), I worked less hours on the paycheck I received today and had 14% taken out ($656). But from what I read online they calculate your tax bracket based on how much money you’ve made so far that year, and once you hit certain milestones your tax rate goes up. I’m guessing I’m misunderstanding something and your tax rate is determined check to check based on how much you would make in a year if all of your paychecks stayed constant. So my first question is if that’s even remotely correct?

Is there a certain gross pay I should aim for on each biweekly paycheck to stay in a lower tax bracket?

And with my tax rate fluctuating like that, how does that affect my tax returns at the end of the year?

Thanks!",finance

Since I will be very involved with my studies, I wont have as much time to work and my new house will be quite a bit more expensive.

personalfinance,Refinancing private student loans,"The interest rate on my student loans kills me. About 2/3 of my payment goes to interest. I want to refinance, but when I tried earlier this year I was denied. I missed some payments when I first graduated college, so I had late payments on my credit report. 

I recently had my government student loans consolidated. I use credit karma, and on my Transunion report, the late payments are no longer there. This helped my credit score a lot. On the Equifax report, they are still there. 

I consolidated very recently in the last 1-2 months, so I’m guessing it takes time to update.

&amp;nbsp;

- How would mortgages be impacted, both from a origination and refi perspective? (There's precedent for rebate checks in other countries for those who obtain a negative rate)
- How would issuing negative rate mortages impact the following: ability to normalize the economy, potential for default, equity holding disparity, renting to ownership ratio, housing prices.

What are my options here? This deal happened today. Can I go back and cancel this loan? I'm in NJ, if that means anything.

personalfinance,Question on when/how to distribute my money,"I have been reading this subreddit for a while and have read through many of the applicable wikis but I just wanted to have a conversation to see what specific advice y’all would have for me.  

I (M, 23) recently started a job that pays for my travel, food, and lodging while I travel for work and I have minimal expenses. I make ~$5,000 a month. So, I have been accumulating money. After research, I deposited $6,000 into a savings account with 2% interest that is essentially my emergency fund. I have ~$20,000 (3.5-4% interest rates) in student loans after paying them down the last few months. My next step is to make an IRA (still researching on traditional or Roth) and deposit the $6,000 max for 2018. I have ~$7,000 in my checking account after the savings account transfer. 

My main question is if I should focus on paying off student loans or deposit into an IRA first? Will the interest in an IRA or student loans compound quicker? Since the deadline for IRA is April 15, is it worth it to make that $6,000 deposit soon to start gaining interest or will waiting make a negligible difference? Personally, I really don’t like having debt and want to pay off my loans quickly. 

Any other advice is welcome. I grew up seeing my parents live paycheck to paycheck and so I don’t have too much experience with money but I am fairly frugal myself and don’t have issues with spending too much but I’m also risk-aversive and the idea of investing in the stock market is overwhelming at this point.",finance
personalfinance,Looking for high yield savings that can deal with a Living Trust account,"I have a revocable Living Trust (I am the trustee) and was told that I should put any accounts I have in the name of the Living Trust.  So my first choice would be to actually be able to open the account in the name of my Living Trust, while the second option would be to have the Living Trust as the beneficiary at the time of my death.  I'd prefer the first option because that's technically the right way to do it, but the second one works as well.

The problem is that I can't seem to find any online savings accounts that can deal with this, other than Alliant Credit Union and there are reasons I don't wish to deal with them that I don't want to discuss online.  But I have called several that have been mentioned in this forum and invariably I get a response to the effect of ""We're an online bank, we only do individual (or sometimes joint) accounts, we don't do Living Trusts.""  So my question is, has anyone had any success opening an account in the name of a Living Trust at an institution that currently pays around 2% or higher on a regular savings or money market account?

Just to be clear, I am not interested in accounts that force you to have a debit card or to meet certain conditions to get the high interest rate, other than perhaps maintaining a reasonable minimum balance.  I'd also prefer an institution that does not charge fees, and obviously one that doesn't have a bunch of negative reviews.  I'm willing to be a little flexible but ultimately I'm willing to give up a little interest to avoid hassle.  Still, if possible I'd like to get a bit more than the pittance my local credit union is paying.

I do NOT need smart phone access at all, and only plan to move money to and from my existing credit union account via ACH transfers, so not having ATM access is not important to me.

So if you know of any financial institutions with high yield savings accounts that don't act like you're asking if they have a branch office on Mars when you inquire about opening an account in the name of a Living Trust, please let me know!",finance

personalfinance,Personal Loan Suggestions/Recommendations,"Hey guys, looking for some advice here and attempt not to not bash me.  My fiance and I are looking into getting a personal loan and will outline below why:

My current situation is fairly positive and will be moving forward.  Currently contributing 4% to 401k with employer match and maxing out a Roth IRA.  I have around $3,000 in my checking at this time each month and currently have $3,800 in my emergency savings account earning 1.90% interest.  I also put $200 in this account each month.  Current salary for CY 2018 is going to be approximately $76,000 gross (I'm 27).  My spending habits are for the most part conservative while hers are a little more spontaneous, which she knows she needs to reign in moving forward if we want to get a house.

Why looking into the personal loan: Before I get it started, I hate having debt.  Aggressively paid off student loans and pay my CC in full every month.  Our dog last week came down with Pneumonia, and agree with it or not spent $3,100 on his hospital stay.  We also have a wedding coming up and a honeymoon to pay for.  We are looking at getting a personal loan knowing the interest rate will be farless than the current credit cards we have and would put these expenses on. I put the pet expense on one of my cards.  The loan with also help consolidate our current CC debt and help pay for a little of our wedding/Honeymoon.  We also know we will not be ""dumb"" with CC spending moving forward if we were to get the loan.   I do not want to empty out my emergency fund in the hopes we will use this for a down payment in the future.

Does anyone have any pros and cons of doing this or suggestions for going about it a better, more effective way?",finance
personalfinance,Personal Loan to Pay Off Credit Card?,"Hello, relatively new lurker that's been gathering the courage to ask for advice. I realize that others may be in a worse place with debt, but I feel incredibly stuck and unsure of what to do to best help myself. This is definitely an all-time low for me, so throwaway account for privacy.


I'm in my late 20s and work a full time job averaging about 40k per year. I'm looking for a new, better-paying job at the moment but I currently get good benefits and am able to take public transit to work every day. 


Several medical bills, stupid impulsive spending decisions and other life events have cleaned out my meager savings completely. The credit card I've had for a while now has a balance of around $9,500 at about 15.9% APR. I've been making payments on time and my credit score is decent but I'm just throwing money at the interest because I have to pay for rent, utilities, food and random other expenses (I've been sick on and off for a few years and my beloved cat has also had several expensive vet bills as he gets older), and I don't have a lot of additional money to go towards paying it down.


On top of that, I have about $30,000 in students loans (paying about $320/mo) and my car just died for the final time so I'll need to look into getting a used car soon. I'm wondering if I should take out a personal loan for $10,000 to completely pay off my credit card (and then try not to touch it) and see if I can get a lower interest rate.


I've been looking into UpStart and Payoff, but wonder if it would be safer to go with a personal loan through my bank? Or should I try a smaller credit union?


Thanks for your time and thoughts - any advice is appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Another PAYE vs REPAYE question,"Sorry if this is repetitive and gets posted frequently. I am just trying to make sense of all the options out there.

Background. \~260k unsubsidized gov loans, avg interest rate of \~6%.

Not currently married, but likely will be in the next 1-2 years.

I am a 1st year Anesthesia Resident, making \~59k/year. I am currently enrolled in PAYE, and first payment is end of Jan 2019.

Lately, I have been going back and forth trying to determine if REPAY would be a better option for me.

Currently, using the calculator on [StudentLoans.gov](https://studentloans.gov/), it seems to make sense to stick with PAYE based on monthly payments being the same, but projected total payed being considerably less with PAYE.

With REPAY I would be looking at 220,299 paid over 300 months.

With PAYE I would be looking at 149,119 paid over 240 months.

I imagine this assumes that my income will remain \~59k for the duration of repayment, which it will not. In 4-5 years, projected income in my specialty will be 200k+ depending on where I decide to practice.

My question is, does it make sense to switch to REPAYE before my repayments start to avoid capitalization of all remaining interest? Reason I am considering switching is with REPAYE 50% of the accruing interest will be subsidized by the gov.

I initially planned to make the minimum monthly payments, but seeing that I have extra money left over at the end of the month, I have been thinking of paying as much as I comfortably can each month. Would this approach only make sense with PAYE as with REPAY, any additional payment is first applied to outstanding interest meaning less (possibly none) would be subsidized by the gov?

Sorry if this post wasn't clear. There are so many factors to consider, and I find it difficult to make an informed decision. Mainly, I am looking for the an option that will afford me the largest amount of saving (least amount paid) in the long term.

Thanks.",finance

investing,What’s A Bull Market And How Did We End Up In The Longest One Ever?,"*A bull market is when stock prices continue increasing by 20 percent from a previous drop of 20 percent, or when the securities market keeps rising. Bull markets can also refer to other markets like housing, investment, or commodities.*

*Even though it is not easy to predict when a bull market will occur, they are too often the outcome of a robust gross domestic product (GDP), high investor confidence, declining unemployment rates, an improved demand for stocks, and corporate and investor profits.*

*The three principal stock indices – Nasdaq (NDAQ), Dow Jones Industrial Average (DOW), and S&amp;P 500 – increase alongside each other during a bull market.*

*Experts believe the stock market is experiencing the longest bull market ever, hitting 3,453 days on August 22nd, 2018, from a low on March 9th, 2009.*

*The S&amp;P 500 has had seven bull markets since 1970, five of them resulted in a market rise of over 100 percent. The most significant bull markets of the past fifty years are:*

***1970’s*** *– In the seventies, assets grew quickly during several periods despite worries of financial turbulence. A protest started in 1974 came after a recession following the post-Second World War expansion. It lasted a little over six years. The S&amp;P 500 grew by 122 percent during that time and the decade also experienced high inflation.*

***1980’s*** *– The Reagan-era bull market was the briefest of the five and the S&amp;P 500 increased more than 100 percent. On an annual basis, however, it was the most well-performing bull market, with the S&amp;P growing 26 percent each year. It was powered by massive tax cuts and job creation, and record revenue creation. It lasted between August of 1982 and August of 1987.*

***1990’s*** *– This bull market occurred during prosperous times, with healthy job growth in the United States and a tax relief act that made several stocks attractive. Tech companies flourished as the internet became accessible and ended in a robust bull market that went to great heights before failing in 2000. This bull market began in October of 1990 and lasted over nine years. The index rise was 417 percent overall.*

***Early 2000’s*** *– After the 9/11 attacks and the dot-com bubble, this bull market went on from October of 2002 to October of 2007. Low-priced interest rates and lenient access to credit lines fueled this bull-run, which was mainly invested in the housing market. It stopped when estate prices started to drop due to the subprime mortgage disaster.*

***Today*** *– Today’s bull market is the longest ever, starting March of 2009. It has been fueled by record-low interest rates and the easygoing fiscal policies embraced by central banks which has made it inexpensive to borrow capital. President Donald Trump’s tax cuts, which decreased taxes paid by American corporations, have extended the current bull-run.*

$518.72 old phone bill paid off - again, didn’t realize this was there

I’ve been promoted and my new base salary is $58k. 

All this to say I still don’t know how I haven’t put more of a dent in this.

personalfinance,Employer offers a tax allowance - is there any reason *not* to contribute to a Roth 401(k) versus a Traditional 401(k),"My employer provides a tax allowance to US nationals.  It is meant to reimburse most of (but not necessarily 100% of) my federal, state, and self-employment taxes.  This tax allowance is calculated as if I do not make any pre-tax contributions.  I was informed that contributing to a traditional 401(k) would not change the tax allowance I receive.  This would allow me to pocket the additional amount since my tax allowance could exceed my actual tax burden.  However, I could instead opt to contribute to a Roth which would also not affect my tax allowance.  

Are there any good reasons not to go with the Roth?  Is there a good reason not to pay the taxes now (which are essentially reimbursed) and letting it grow tax free?  Taxes are still fairly low at present, and I don't foresee the tax rates in the US being reduced significantly in the next 35-40 years.",finance

I'm a public servant in the federal government. I have been employed continuously since January 2000 (next month I will have 19 years of service). My plan is to retire at 30 years of service (at age 60). 

I have 3 months at the very beginning of my employment during which I was not contributing towards my pension. I can buy this period back at a cost of $962. It will increase my pension by $24/month when I retire. It will take approximately 40 months to recover the cost of buying back the pension. 

Should I buy back this pensionable time? 40 months seems like a long time to recoup the cost. Am i missing some other benefit of buying back?

personalfinance,Trying to assist friend with Student Loan Black Hole,"Hi everybody. Thanks in advance for any assistance/advice that can be offered.

  

I am posting on behalf of a friend of mine who called me to ask about whether he was paying down his student loans correctly. A screenshot of his account history is here: [https://imgur.com/a/FS2YwIh](https://imgur.com/a/FS2YwIh)

  

I had a scholarship all through college, and so was fortunate enough to never have to deal with student loans. I have experience with fixed-rate auto loans, but the transaction history on this student loan looks to behave differently and I'm not sure I understand it very well myself. Some of my observations:  

* We're looking at the website and it looks like he has a ""Stafford"" Loan
* He has informed me that his interest rate is 6.8%. This matches the fixed value for an unsubsidized Stafford loan.
* The loan appears to be subsidized given the ""Interest Subsidy"" payments being applied each month. This has us confused, because it looks like it's an unsubsidized loan (see bullet above).
* The website also shows that he is under a ""Income-driven repayment"" plan, which based on some quick reading, appears to apply to low-income earners who may have trouble making steady payments on the loan. The website also states that he can ""begin the renewal process"" early next month.
* It appears that for much of the account history, little or none of his payments have been applied to the principal. He says that when he logs in, the website tells him he needs to pay a different amount each month, and that's what he pays. It appears to me that the website is only telling him his minimum payment to pay the interest, and I have to assume he didn't realize he wasn't paying anything on the principal.
* He told me that the loan was originally split into 3 'sub-loans' (not sure of the right term) of $10K each. In march of this year, his parents helped him with eliminating one of those sub-loans, which put the remaining principal at around $20K. Since that time, any payment he makes seems to be split equally (or near equally) between the two remaining sub-loans
* For background, he is currently working as a server in a restaurant while he seeks better employment opportunities. He states he is living paycheck to paycheck.

  

Questions that we need the most help on:

* Why are ""Interest Subsidy"" payments appearing on the record when the 6.8% interest rate would indicate this is an unsubsidized Stafford loan? I'm not sure what to make of this.
* Is this practice of splitting payments between 'sub-loans' normal? Does he need to try to work with the lender on getting this combined into a single pot?
* It appears that every single payment being made over the last \~8 months has been applied strictly to the interest. Is this a side-effect of the ""Income-driven repayment"" plan, or simply a matter of not paying enough each month to tackle the principal?
* The website states that he can ""begin the renewal process"" early next month. Is that something he needs to look into, or should he be hopping off this ""income-driven repayment"" system altogether?
* What kind of conversation should he be having with the lender? He says he's called them a few times and gets told that this is all normal and he is making the right payments -- this doesn't sound right to me at all if everything is going to interest alone!
* Are there any red flags here? I'm quite worried, as it looks like he's throwing money straight into the trash can by not tackling the principal. Are there some basic actions that can be taken to start working this down?

I hope I've given enough info and asked the right questions. He is committed to becoming debt free, but it doesn't look like he'll be able to put much more money towards the loan each month for the foreseeable future. What is the fate of these student loans and people with these loans in these types of situations? Sincere thanks to anybody that can shed light or offer some advice. I wish I had better answers for him off the bat but I'm out of my depth when it comes to student loans.

personalfinance,I'm a 21-year-old recent college grad who just landed a job. Looking for some advice about how to handle my money.,"Hi PF, the title explains my situation pretty concisely. I've recently accepted a job offer in Texas that pays $32,500/year with a raise to $37,000 after 6 months and additional raises based on performance evaluations. I currently live with two roommates in a pretty cheap apartment, and we will be moving to a nicer place in about 8 months. Here is a current rundown of my expenses.


**Income**

$1250 bi-weekly, before taxes

**Rent and Water**

Around $410/month, with renter's insurance at $12/month

**Electricity**

Around $30/month

**Internet**

$21/month

**Food (Groceries and eating out)**

Around $100/month, depending on how often I eat out

**Gas**

Around $50/month (Thank god for Texan gas prices!)

That's pretty much it. Food and gas values are rounded up, and thankfully my health insurance, phone bill, and car insurance are being paid by my parents for the time being. I live a pretty frugal lifestyle already, and that combined with the fact that most of my expenses are split in 3 means that a good chunk of the money I earn (about $1000/month) will be left over after everything is paid for at the end of the month. I currently have a bank account at Wells Fargo but I'll be switching over to a credit union when I return from the holidays. I plan on getting a savings account, checking account, and a credit card from the credit union so I can start building credit. I also plan on getting a second savings account with American Express because of their 2% interest rate. 

My questions are:

1. How much of my paycheck should I put into my 401k?
1. Should I start looking into other investment options right off the bat? If so, what should I look into?
1. What portion of my paycheck should go into my savings accounts?

Any advice y'all have would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",finance

Question is - should we take distributions from their taxable retirement accounts now, take advantage of the 10 &amp; 12% federal tax bracket, and reinvest in an after tax brokerage account subject only to capital gains tax?

Bitcoin,"Why Decentralization is a naive dream, why BTC cannot achieve it completely, why Satoshi Nakamoto may be a Intelligence Service creation and why it all may be a good thing. Plus some warm and fuzzy philosophy at the end.","Hello everyone. I am new to reddit and have created this account to hear your thoughts on the topics that I am now going to present to you. I really like cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology as a whole, but I am increasingly disillusioned by some interesting facts that I had not thought about until now. I would love to hear from you and learn from your responses and insights. Have fun reading and all the best to you.

Concretely, I want to discuss:   
 (1) The theory that true decentralization is a naive dream because of the physical infrastructure that underlies all web-based transactions and which is being controlled by the exact elite Bitcoiners aim to disrupt.  
 (2) All web-based protocols and also BTC run on top of hardware that is in the hands of highly centralized companies and Internet providers that collect personal data all the time.  
 (3) BTC cannot decouple from the current financial system because the growth of the BTC-Network requires capital, which in turn favors those who possess the investment-power a.k.a. the already rich.

(4) The highly unlikely theory that intelligence services neglected the danger BTC poses to the current financial systems and its masters. I want to ask how it can be possible that the entirety of intelligence services (who had an eye on the dark web from the beginning and must have known about BTC and its disruptive potential) have failed to foresee the danger it poses to the empire of the dollar and their masters?! They didn\`t IMO and I\`m playing with the thought that BTC has been introduced by some financial elite as a test environment to make people become accustomed to the idea of digital currencies for later introduction of crypto-dollars. It would explain the anonymity of Satoshi for once. Also, it would only make sense because you have to accustom the masses to new ideas and let them get a taste of it before you spend countless billions on resources and processes on something that has been completely unknown up to this point. Just imagine how we would have reacted if Amazon or HSBC suddenly declared that from now on they will only trade something called Crypto-dollar?! It would have resulted in a hard rejection imo and would have pushed back the introduction of cashless societies many years.  
 

But for now, let me begin by stating some obvious facts about the physical infrastructure that is needed in order to keep the interweb and the BTC-network running and why it actually serves the centralized powers most and is therefore far from decentralized.  
 

1. Some people seem to forget that each and every digital transaction is still hosted by some form of hardware. Be it actual servers, undersea cables, satellites, your PC or mobile phone or the mere electricity supply coming from electricity plants, the interweb and also the bitcoin network is fundamentally relying on these essential hardware components. Let me ask you: who controls this hardware?   
All of this infrastructure is far from being decentralized. It is being controlled by elitist, centralized companies all wanting to maintain their power and control for the sake of future profits and influence. Prove me wrong.   


Saying that BTC is decentralized is like saying that cake can be made without flour, butter and eggs (no, you cannot post a vegan recipe here). There is always a need for physical resources and the BTC network is no exception. And since this physical infrastructure is more fundamental to BTC than BTC itself and since these physical hardware components are being manufactured, controlled and tied to dollar-based industries of centralized companies BTC is essentially relying on the very systems of centralized powers it aims to decouple from. Also, this fundamental physical infrastructure upon which BTC runs is upheld not by BTC but by national currencies such as the dollar. And since it requires dollars to build, run and maintain the physical infrastructure of the BTC network it is those who posses the most dollars who have the most power over it. (more on this topic on point 4)  Am I wrong here guys?! Please enlighten me.  
 

2. Furthermore, when it comes to the internet internet itself, which is the digital infrastructure of the BTC network and acts as its access point, we are all relying on internet providers and PC\`s themselves, which are all in the hands of multinational companies that have been proven to collect our data. Remember, the internet itself is an invention first created within large corporations and has then been adapted and refined by the military. Who controls, stores and regulates the majority of internet traffic in nuclear bunkers and high-security warehouses all around the world? Certainly not us bitcoiners. Remember, data is the new gold. Wanna connect to the BTC-Network? Sign up to a centralized internet provider and buy a PC or a mobile phone first! It\`s so obvious and it has become so normal that we forget that the essential hardware needed to live out our naive dreams of decentralization is actually in the hands of highly centralized and elitist companies and individuals like Apple, Microsoft, AT&amp;T, etc. And guess what, they are all connected to banks and the monetary system! So, when we support them by buying their products to build the infrastructure upon which we run our network of decentralized illusions we are actually paying those very institutions, which some people here want to overthrow. It\`s absolutely crazy if you think about it. 

Some examples. Exaggerated I know, but there\`s some truth in it:  
 „Oh yeah, let me buy the newest phone from a centralized company that collects all my data to look at my decentralized currency on a centralized app that collects my data too.“  
 „Oh boy, let me buy this mining rig from a centralized company with federally issued money and let me plug into the centralized electricity supply that makes me completely dependent on state controlled infrastructure in order to make a decentralized transaction on my centralized exchange that is funded by investments of banking institutions getting boners from all the countless transaction fees that arise from me trading myself into a wreck of despair.“   


You cannot help but laugh at our own naivity sometimes, can you? I\`m guilty of these examples myself so please don\`t think that I\`m picking on you. After all, I started to think more deeply about the entire topic of BTC because I screwed up myself.   


So, we\`ve been allowed to play with cryptocurrencies so far, but do you really think the Dollar-based empire would let such a disruptive technology evolve if it didn\`t benefit the current power structures in the end?   
 

3. This point is actually huge. It\`s about Investment power. Remember, the bitcoin network still relies on hardware components in order to run at all. These components are expensive and require a lot of maintenance. Now, who has got the most investment power and money supply to buy, run and maintain these components? The normie next door ranting on his iPhone about how he will free himself from centralized powers because it\`s trendy atm? No. The tech-savy nerd trying to mine dogecoin for lulz? No. It\`s the already wealthy, it\`s the guys who already have the liquidity to scoop up the rising technologies of the future. After all, this is the game they\`ve been playing for a long time and which has made them wealthy and powerful in the first place! And guess what they are in for? Compassion and decentralization of power? You\`d be naive to think so for even the ordinary crypto-enthusiast aims to ruthlessly accumulate as much BTC in their OWN account as possible and compared to these guys we absolutely suck at it. 

4. In terms of developing cryptographic web-based applications and secure data transmissions who do you think is most involved in such research and development? Freedom loving, open-source saints with hearts of pure gold and benevolence? Sure there are many of them and I\`m truly grateful for their effort. But you\`d be foolish to think that they have been spear-heading this development.  
 It\`s the military industrial complex as it has always been because they have the incentive, the resources, the infrastructure, the competition from rivaling nations, the recruitement processes and the best brains on the planet to work on these things.   
 Also, any new patent that is submitted is being vetted by national security agencies and if it poses a threat to the nation and its socio-economic processes, its publication will be withheld until the necessary countermeasures have been taken. There has been a fungus researcher (Paul Stamets) who has developed a process to extract something of interest out of portobello mushrooms whose patent application has been removed because it posed a threat to national security (there is a Joe rogan podcast where he explained it all)! If intelligence agencies are able to detect the threat a fungus can pose how the hell could you possibly believe that a technology able to disrupt the global monopoly of the dollar goes undetected?! Especially considering that the intelligence agencies have had an eye on the dark web from the beginning. If they wanted to stop BTC\`s rise they would have had the time to do so. The fact that they didn\`t and the fact that the U.S. seems to want to introduce BTC and cryptographic payments to the masses makes me think really hard about the disruptive potential that we tell ourselves BTC has.   
 

Knowing about the way power structures work and knowing about the far reach of intelligence services and global elites I must conclude that this entire crypto hype is actually allowed to happen, maybe has even been fabricated intentionally and thus decentralization is actually a catch-phrase for more centralization and an extension of power for the elites. Satoshi Nakamoto is a ghost because he does not exist and has been fabricated for the sake of this anonymous introduction of a new financial system.  
 

It\`s really startling to realize this. It seems as if we are being deliberately mesmerized once again with the seeming promise of personal freedom and decentralization only to buy into and strengthen the elitist power structures that underlie this technology.   
 One must understand that access to infrastructure, technological innovation and also the personal empowerment of the masses is a two-edged sword. Because everything that we use to improve our lives with, every new technology, every resource and behaviour is being weighed against the impact such implementation would impose onto the distribution of power in the global economy, banking institutions and multinational corporations. For example: Sure, there may already be a patent for a working long-distance hydrogen motor and a concept to produce it cost-effectively. It would seemingly improve many environmental problems and slow the greenhouse effect. But you know what? If it were to be introduced at once the Petrol industry, the petrol based automotive industry and all its connected industries and networks of power would suffer a blow that is detrimental to global economics. We all want a clean atmosphere. But guess what? Innovation MUST ALWAYS be supportive of current economic processes and global powers for if they get disrupted the very system that upholds the lives of the ordinary citizen would get disrupted too. The fact that Bitcoin is allowed to continue its rise shows me that it is actually supportive of current political and institutional powers and not as liberating as many people hope it is.  
 

So, what does this mean? It\`s very simple. There is no such thing as innovation or disruption from the bottom up at this point. (Except maybe large-scale strikes and coordinated revolution)   
You see, global power and global economy are not separated entities. They are one and the same and in the hands of a few compared to entire human population. Thus technological advance and empowerment of the masses is not a process that is guided by ethics and benevolence but a process that is judged by whether or not it helps to maintain or improve the current power structures and economic processes that human civilization depends upon.   
 

Certainly, BTC and pseudo-decentralized networks can be an incredibly valuable tool to advance certain interests, improve many processes and to expand certain structures of influence for both elite institutions and ordinary citizens as well. It will not go away. BTC will grow and be used the masses. But remember, always remember: That, which the masses love is the best tool to control the masses as well. For they do not know that the thing they love does not belong to them completely because it is always linked to some fundamental infrastructure or resource that is controlled by others. And yet, being able to use or pay for a technology that you do not own entirely is better than not being able to use it all, isn\`t it?  
   
 So, what does this all mean to us crypto-enthusiasts? We must come to accept that compromises must be made. We cannot have it all. There is some amount of external, centralized control that we must become comfortable to accept. Already, the power structures that we aimed to disrupt have taken over the BTC universe. Who owns most BTC? Jup, a tiny amount of lucky fews who have had the investment potential to buy up all the nice BTC´s in the first place. Who owns the largest mining facilities and who owns the physical carrier network of cables, satellites, processors and electricity? Guess what, it\`s not you, not me, nor Mr. Nakamoto. It\`s the global corporations as always. Who owns and controls global data transmission infrastructure upon which blockchain protocols and the entire internet are running? Jup, not me, not you, but the same powers that we aim to disrupt. Who is most advanced in cryptographic technologies and secure data transmissions and who would be able to come up with and introduce concepts of cryptocurrencies without being shut down by the masters of the dollar? Jup, the military industrial complex in conjunction with the intelligence agencies vetting and regulating pending patents and their application. The clues just add up my fellow introverts. I cannot hide from them anymore and wanted to hear your opinion on it. But after all these disruptive ideas I wanted to end on a positive note.   
 

You see, we cannot change the fact that human civilization is a construct that demands compromise in order to function at all. We are all different in terms of our level of knowledge, personal development and ideology. I cannot have it all, nor do you. But if we make some compromises we can live together peacefully and progress to a level that benefits all of us. In terms of disruptive technologies and the advancement of human civilization we must accept that you cannot introduce something to society for which we are not ready. And in our current state of development this means that technological advancement must not disrupt global power hierarchies and socio-economic process too heavily for this is the system upon which we build our lives and upon which our wellbeing depends. And it is indeed a fragile one.   
 Yes, I hate the excesses of corruption and manipulation that occurs in the financial sector same as you do. But I know that I cannot tear it down at once for it would harm many processes that offer me and my family much opportunity, comfort and wellbeing in the long run. Sure, our systems are flawed and even sick in some cases. Sure, people are afraid to loose power and are afraid what would happen when other people gain too much power. Thus the keeping of power over others by our leaders and elites is fundamentally an effect caused by us humans being afraid of each other. To truly advance in a liberated and unhindered pace we must first overcome the fear of each other. Because in that fear lies all our trouble. We fear to not have enough resources, we fear to loose influence and power, we fear to loose our culture through the growth of another, we fear to loose our wealth through inflation and all the while we forget that we could actually be kind to each other and cooperate in spite of it all. We fear too much and sometimes we do so for good reason. As long as this does not change and as long as we do not grow up as one human family there will always be the desire to rule, to control and to deceive those who we fear. In that regard we can actually be thankful for having all the nice technology that we have atm. We can also be thankful to be able (or to be allowed or even lured into) to use cryptocurrencies. The fact that this empowerment through technology comes with a certain degree of control and centralization may actually be a good thing. It reflects our current state of development as the human beings that we are. Always striving to advance forward, but fearful of what we or others may find. Thus we tread cautiously, making sure that we control each step that we take for we may not know where our steps lead us next. Keeping some control and power to ourselves is the trait of a fearful mind wanting to move forward towards freedom. It\`s a sane reaction.   
In that we are all the same. Bitcoin maximalists as well as bankers. Compromise. It\`s the magic word and it\`s what is necessary if two fearful minds want to advance together in peace.  
 

I want to end here now and I want to thank you for your attention. I am thrilled about all the developments that are going to take place in 2019. I wish the cryptosphere nothing but the best and hope that you all may get rich both physically (or digitally rather) as well as emotionally.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Home Insurance Company Denied Appeal to Remove Claim from Record,"tl;dr I was given bad advice to open a home insurance claim and it's resulting in me being red flagged and unable to find other coverage. I'm seeking any consumer protection representation and advice on how to go about that.

....

I'm in a pinch and hoping this sub can offer some sage advice. We had a rough summer with our insurance company. One legitimate backup sewer/flood situation that was covered as well as two minor fender benders. It's been ugly and I know my premiums are going to take a hit. My insurance company, who I'll keep nameless because I don't think it is an important detail, was really great about everything.

To get to the issue at hand, there was a fourth potential incident. While my remediation company was cleaning and applying a mold barrier, we found some mold behind drywall in my basement. It looked as though it had been there a long time. I wanted to hire the same team to take care of that as well. They suggested that if i had mold coverage, that I should open a claim for it as well. 

At that point, I called the insurance company and relayed the recommendation. A couple of days later, my insurance adjuster shows up and shares ""I have no idea why you were told to open a claim or even why the claim agent opened a claim. This sort of mold is NEVER covered. It's just not a situation that makes sense. Mold that is covered needs to be from a previous claim and since your claim was two months ago there couldn't be any mold."" End of story with him and a $0 payout.

Now all that claim work was also because I was selling my home and moving. I've moved regions and found a great insurance offer on home and auto that can save my hundreds of dollars per year. However, I can't get coverage from that company because I had two claims open within 90 days of one another with my current provider. I'm a red flag situation now. 

I just tried appealing the mold claim which should have never been opened. I was denied. I feel as though my current provider sees that they just lost a lot on my and is (A) jacking up my rates to recoup their money, which i sort of understand, but (b) denied my appeal because they know that they have me handcuffed as a red flag for the next three years.

What can I do beyond the appeal? Is there some sort of consumer protection council I can talk to? I feel like I was given bad advice and not steered clear of it by my insurance company. I made a mistake, but feel this is unfair treatment.

Thanks in advance for your help and for reading this lengthy post.",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage Interest Rate Seems High?,"Hello,

I have a mortgage loan from Quicken scheduled on closing to be a 30 year, $81,005 for 3% down first time home buyer FHA. The interest rate is **5.75%**. The original number before down payment is factored is $82500, Mainly because closing costs were high for my area, making the seller assist of 6% and my down of 3% still making me have to pay $3,400 out of pocket on my own.

When I started the process, noting how much I would put down, the pre-approval agent said it would stay in the 4%'s and the pre-approval ended up being in the 4%'s. Are they taking advantage of me? If so what types of bargaining techniques should I employ? What questions should I ask? The catch is that I don't want the monthly payment to increase anymore. It is already sitting at a whopping $790 for this loan. I just feel like for a 30 year loan, this is high. They are making 110% return on interest over the life of this loan.

Any advice is appreciated. I have been encouraged to shop around, but closing is supposed to be January 11th, and I don't feel like going through everything with another lender (auditing my bank and wanting my life's history).

&amp;#x200B;

 

UPDATE:

After approaching them about it, they were able to lower it to 4.99% while increasing cash to close by a measly $100. They explained it was due to them trying to keep the closing costs as low as possible. To me, it seems like they didn't think I would come at them trying to bargain so they were going to keep it high until I did. The increase in closing cost is so small to merit an entire .075 decrease.",finance

Currently Have $7,000 on an Amex with a fairly low interest rate.

I'm due to hand back my leased car on February 1st, which I intend to buy on finance. The residual is $11,000 (car value $12,500).

Credit score is currently 680 due to high credit usage (Amex limit is $8,000) and that I only moved to the US ~3 years ago (also why I have such a low credit limit).

I'm thinking of moving the Amex credit to a 0% balance transfer card (this would also increase my available credit, lowering my utilization/increasing my score).

Is there a preferable order or time to do this all in? I'm worried that if I do some of this in the wrong order (say move the Amex credit, then pay down, then apply for a loan) that either my credit score will be lowered or that the credit I owe might be shown on both the old card and the new.

Much appreciate any input!",finance

How should I disburse funds?,"I was recently approved for the ""Marcus"" personal loan offered by Goldman Sachs, to consolidate some credit card debt at a better (and fixed) interest rate. I have the option of having GS disburse the funds directly to my creditors, or depositing the funds directly into my checking account. Which is the better option?

(Please assume I will strictly and immediately use these funds to pay off credit cards if I deposit directly into bank, and not be frivolous or irresponsible with the loan.)

What effect will my choice have on my credit report and score? (For example, would paying card balances directly from a loan somehow ""look bad"" on my credit history vs. paying the credit cards from my checking acct?)

Is there any benefit to disbursing into checking? I intend to pay off my credit cards in full right away, wouldn't earn any interest sitting in my checking (which is negligible anyway).

Is there any danger to disbursing into checking? There is some fine print that says GS is authorized to automatically debit from my account to correct any ""errors."" I guess I'm concerned that down the line, if there is an overpayment or any kind of error, they'll just take the money unexpectedly from my bank account to cover the problem without notifying me first. I'm wary of granting anyone permission auto-debit my account at any time.

investing,Old Fortune article on Jeffrey Gundlach. It’s a fun read.,"Firing the $70 billion man: Full version



By Mina Kimes, writerMarch 10, 2010: 10:10 AM ET
NEW YORK (Fortune) -- On November 19, 2009 Jeffrey Gundlach was named a finalist for Morningstar's award for bond fund manager of the decade. For Gundlach, the nomination recognized 10 years of stellar results, exceeding even the returns of the legendary king of bonds, Bill Gross.

Two weeks later Gundlach was confronted, fired, and then pursued on foot out of a Los Angeles skyscraper by two lawyers working for TCW, the money management firm with $110 billion in assets where Gundlach had worked for 24 years.

Not only did TCW oust Gundlach, but the firm also announced that it was acquiring an entire company -- crosstown rival Metropolitan West Asset Management -- to replace him. That in turn set off a wave of defections from TCW, as 45 of the 60 staffers who had worked for Gundlach streamed out the door to join him at a new firm that he had opened within days of leaving.

Then things really turned nasty. TCW filed an incendiary lawsuit in January accusing Gundlach of conspiring with confederates at TCW to steal proprietary information as part of a long-running plot to form their own competing firm. The suit added a salacious twist of the knife, perfectly calibrated for maximum media interest -- Gundlach had allegedly stashed a trove of illicit material in his office: 70 pornographic magazines and videos, 12 ""sexual devices,"" and several bags of marijuana.

Gundlach has countered with his own lawsuit. He charges TCW and its owner, the French bank Société Générale, with pushing him out so that they can get their hands on his lucrative fees. In addition to his mutual funds, Gundlach had managed what were effectively two hedge funds for TCW, each of which commanded the amped-up fees typical of those vehicles. Gundlach calculates that he would have personally reaped $600 million to $1.2 billion over the next few years.

What in the name of Peter Lynch is going on here? Sure, we've come to expect shenanigans from Wall Street. But even if the mutual fund world hasn't been exactly pristine (remember the market-timing scandals a few years ago?), more often than not its managers and executives have been well-behaved schoolboys compared with the leather-clad (in spirit, anyway) rock stars among the investment bankers and hedge funders.

But unlike most mutual fund companies, TCW has always aspired to a Wall Street culture. In particular, it cultivated a star system. The company grew by importing ambitious money managers and granting them autonomy. They could invest as they liked; TCW would handle sales and marketing. The two sides would then split the fees, with each manager cutting an individual deal. The result could be huge rewards for managers -- Gundlach made $134 million over the past five years -- but some came to view themselves essentially as sole proprietors.

TCW seemed content with the arrangement and did little to tie its managers' fates to the company as a whole. Few of them, for example, received significant stakes in TCW. That bred frustration in multiple generations of standout performers, who viewed corporate executives (some of whom did receive ownership shares) as getting rich off their toil.

So it went for Gundlach, a bona fide investing star who, by the end, oversaw about 70% of TCW's assets, some $70 billion, putting him in charge of one of the biggest pots of money in the country. Gundlach didn't just generate steady returns; he avoided the blowup of the century. A specialist in mortgage-backed securities, he publicly warned in 2007 that ""the subprime mortgage market is a total, unmitigated disaster, and it's going to get worse."" He invested accordingly, not only delivering positive returns in the blighted year of 2008 but also earning himself a growing role as a media sage. His ego grew along with it.

There are few people like Jeffrey Gundlach in the mutual fund world -- or in any world. A former rock-and-roll drummer, Gundlach, 50, is a math whiz (but not a quant). He views everything in binary terms: Either you perform to his standards or you don't, and he won't hesitate to let you know which category you fall into. Nor is he shy in articulating his view of himself. ""I was by far the biggest revenue generator at TCW, by far the biggest performer,"" he says. ""I created $4 billion in value for clients in '09. If telling you that is self-promotion, so be it. It's just a fact.""

With Gundlach, it's hard to tell which is largest: his brain, his self-regard -- or his resentment of TCW. He claims that his recent firing was actually the third time the company tried to get rid of him. ""All three of them were an attempt to just steal the economics,"" Gundlach contends. ""And this time they did it. Except they didn't steal the economics. They blew it up. They blew it up. They tried to steal the economics, but they didn't understand. They never understood.""

TCW customers, meanwhile, have been watching the blood feud in disbelief. Investors have fled, with assets shrinking $25 billion since Gundlach was fired. For those who have remained, it seems that their patience is limited. ""I'm aware of the investment prowess of both [Gundlach and the new TCW team],"" says Mansco Perry III, CIO of the Maryland State Retirement and Pension System, which has $50 million invested in TCW. ""But right now I don't believe they're acting in the best interest of their clients.""

frey Gundlach is the sort of boss who inspires sharply divided opinion. He fostered loyalty among the members of his60-person team at TCW, handing out generous bonuses to his group. He also openly mocked the company's other divisions, especially its stock team.

Many outside Gundlach's orbit viewed him as an ill-tempered bully. He subjected subordinates to withering cross examinations and relished pointing out errors. Some in TCW's New York offices celebrated his dethroning by posting printouts of his scathing e-mails in the halls.

By contrast, loyalists valued his directness. Some would preserve his occasional written compliments as treasured mementos. ""You don't have to guess where you stand with him,"" says Bonnie Baha, a portfolio manager who followed Gundlach to his new firm, called DoubleLine.

An interview with Jeffrey Gundlach is less like conversation than like listening to a manic stream-of-consciousness monologue. Consider Gundlach's description of his aborted stint in a math Ph.D. program at Yale (after getting an undergraduate degree in the same subject at Dartmouth): ""It was a four-year Ph.D. deal. And they gave me a full scholarship, and it was very hard to get into. There were only seven people accepted, and they had hundreds of applicants. And one of the guys, he was Korean, he had come in via Toronto. I was the only American left. The other American had flunked out. There was a Chinese guy who had polio. That guy was smart. That guy was something else. He had crutches. He had horrible dandruff. He never took a shower, but he was one smart motherf----r, let me tell you. That guy is probably the smartest guy I ever met in my life. And he was my friend. I was the only guy he would be friends with, and there was this other guy, this Korean guy out of Korea, out of Toronto, and I didn't like him very much, and I was walking down the street, and there he was. It was like, 'Hey, Jeff!' They called me Jeff in the day. 'Hey!' You know, good to see you. I was Ike -- I had this really heebie-jeebie feeling, and he goes, 'Let's go to the bookstore and get our books.' And I was like, 'Uh, I don't know.' And he was like, 'What do you mean?' I said, 'Uh, I don't know.' And it hit me right then. I said, 'I'm not going back. I'm not doing it. I can't do it. This is pointless.' ""

Gundlach's mind combines that feverish quality with a near-total recall of endless minutiae. But somehow, when it comes to investing, he's able to process huge quantities of details and extract a big-picture message. The result has been superb performance: His flagship $12 billion TCW Total Return Bond Fund returned nearly 8% annually over the past decade. Those results beat 99% of competitors, and his nonpublic funds have done even better.

For all Gundlach's prowess with numbers, it was anything but obvious that he'd go into finance. He grew up outside Buffalo in a family of modest means. Their only savings, he says, consisted of some Xerox stock, courtesy of their uncle, Robert Gundlach, the inventor of the modern photocopier. ""We owned Xerox, and it went way, way up, and for the first time it actually felt like we had a little money. And then it crashed,"" Gundlach says. He was 12 or 13 at the time. ""It was my first experience with a bear market, and I remember it really well. The rallies are pennies, and the selloffs are dollars, and that's always the way bear markets behave.""

In his mid-twenties Gundlach played drums in a variety of rock bands that performed in L.A. clubs but never made the big time. Meanwhile he was holding down a dreary day job in the actuarial department at Transamerica. One night in 1985 he was watching an episode of ""Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,"" that described the most lucrative careers. Gundlach decided he would, as he told one interviewer, ""figure out my life.""

The program identified investment banking as the richest occupation. Gundlach didn't know what investment bankers did, but he contacted 23 firms. Impressed by his math credentials, TCW invited him in and offered him a $30,000-a-year job as a research assistant in the firm's bond department. (This despite the fact that, according to Gundlach, he didn't even know what a bond was at the time.)

Gundlach was thrilled. He loved wearing a suit and tie to TCW's elegant offices. He became fascinated by bonds. ""I felt like I was in the middle of something that was important and exciting,"" he says. ""I loved it! When I would walk into a meeting and be able to say, 'I'm from TCW and here's my business card,' I was proud.""

As a young analyst, Gundlach zeroed in on the mortgage market. By age 27, he says, he had developed a reputation in his niche as a ""young hotshot."" After four years at TCW, he was promoted to co-chair of a new division -- mortgage Bonds -- and then made a managing director in 1991. ""That doesn't happen,"" he says. ""You don't go from a trainee to managing director in seven years. I was running the most important department at the firm, but the firm didn't like the fact that I was growing so much."" Gundlach is getting ahead of the story, but it appears he would later be right.

When Gundlach arrived -- and still to a large extent today -- TCW seemed like a museum version of a Wall Street firm. Even in ultra-casual Southern California, for example, the firm had a suit-and-tie dress code. Gracious meals were served in its white-linen dining room.

TCW was founded in 1971 as Trust Co. of the West by Robert Day, who inherited millions as the heir to the Superior Oil fortune and hobnobbed with the Martha's Vineyard elite. Day was a hard-nosed boss who used to smack errant employees on the head with his cigar, Gundlach says. (Day says he doesn't remember doing so.) In those days 80% of TCW's assets were in stocks, the rest in bonds. By the end of Gundlach's tenure, the ratio would almost flip.

Day built the firm by luring in Wall Street talent. One prominent star, who joined in 1985, was Howard Marks, a junk bond manager who came over from Citicorp. Marks thrived, accumulating $7 billion in assets, about 15% of TCW's total at the time. But he grew increasingly dissatisfied with having to fork over half his fees to TCW. And he resented the fact that TCW would give him no more than a nominal stake in the company. In 1995 he announced that he was leaving and taking his team with him.

Marks' departure was a less lurid, but still bitter, harbinger of what would occur with Gundlach almost 15 years later. Day sent a furious letter to clients blasting Marks' exit as ""disloyal at the very least,"" according to press accounts at the time. TCW then quickly replaced Marks' team by purchasing Crescent Capital, a small high yield bond firm in West Los Angeles.

The equity issue took on new importance when TCW decided to sell itself. In 2001, Société Générale bought 51% of TCW for $880 million. The deal, former employees say, meant lucrative paydays for a cadre of executives, including the founders of Crescent, who had received large chunks of the company. Some longtime TCW employees were embittered by the newcomers' windfall.

Management tried to mend the problems that led to Marks' departure, but the lack of equity for many managers remained a sore point. SocGen announced it would escalate its ownership to 70% and leave 30% for TCW employees. But that 30% turned out to consist of SocGen stock options rather than TCW shares. By 2007 the French bank owned 100% of the company.

Meanwhile Gundlach was accruing more and more influence and renown. In 2005 he was promoted to chief investment officer of TCW. And he was named Morningstar fund manager of the year in 2006. His decision to pull his mutual funds out of riskier debt and his accurate forecast of a looming recession brought him favorable publicity and a steady presence in the press. (Another division of TCW, also under Gundlach's umbrella but not his main focus, was a giant issuer of CDOs, many of which imploded.)

It was Gundlach's time. His reputation was growing, and bonds were beginning to enjoy their moment in the sun. The result: Investments in his funds swelled. So, too, did his ego, according to former co-workers. ""He started to think of himself as a god,"" says one who worked with Gundlach during that period.

Gundlach remained mostly satisfied until January 2009, when SocGen announced that it intended to take TCW public in five years. The uncertainty, he says, made it harder to drum up new business. And he grew even more vexed a few months later when he was passed over for the job of TCW's new CEO. Instead, the position went to the company's former president Marc Stern, who came out of retirement to assume the position.

Gundlach was infuriated by Stern's return. He was offered the job of president but turned it down. Always outspoken, Gundlach grew openly critical of TCW's management, even deriding executives while they sat a few feet away in the company dining room.

Rumors began to circulate that Gundlach would be fired. By the summer of 2009, he says, it had become difficult to work under that stress, as well as to face TCW's uncertain future. In September, Gundlach met with Stern and offered to purchase the firm at a valuation of $700 million. TCW says Stern passed the offer onto SocGen, which rejected it.

TCW and Gundlach disagree about exactly what was said at the meeting. What's clear is that Gundlach at least broached the possibility of taking his team and leaving. TCW interpreted the statement as a threat and prepared for combat: The company hired investigators to look into the affairs of Gundlach and his closest lieutenants, tapping their office phones and monitoring their e-mails. At the same time they initiated clandestine talks with MetWest, the $30 billion bond house that would eventually replace Gundlach's team.

Gundlach was preparing too. He and his ""co- conspirators"" began e-mailing one another in September about their plot to steal information, according to TCW's complaint. The suit alleges that the group referred to Gundlach as ""the Pope"" and ""the Godfather"" and swiped 9 million pages' worth of client contacts, trade tickets, and software routines used to process the complex data that go into analyzing mortgages. They retained a realtor to find an office space with 50 trading desks.

Gundlach acknowledges that his team looked at commercial real estate. It made him feel better, he says, to be making plans when he knew he was going to be fired. ""I felt powerless,"" he says. He insists, however, that he had no knowledge of the downloading, his e-mails prove otherwise. Gundlach says he hired a third party to expunge his employees' computers of TCW data and returned all their hardware to the company.

The crescendo of rumors -- of his ouster, of a sale -- was wearing on Gundlach. Still, he had no inkling of what was in store for him on Dec. 4, 2009. At 1 p.m. that day, when the markets closed on the East Coast, he was summoned to the 17th floor of TCW's headquarters. Michael Cahill, the company's general counsel, was waiting for him in a conference room with John Quinn, one of Los Angeles' top litigators.

Cahill told Gundlach that TCW was putting him on administrative leave. Gundlach argued that the move would cause a disastrous customer exodus unless they negotiated a settlement that resolved various fee and management issues. The lawyers asked him to read a draft of the complaint TCW was planning to file against him. When Quinn tried to place the papers in his hands, Gundlach got angry.

He stormed out of the room and began walking down the stairs. Quinn and Cahill trailed him, thinking he was headed for the trading floor one level down, but Gundlach kept going. It was a surreal procession, says Quinn; they marched down 17 stories in total silence. The lawyers followed Gundlach out of the building and onto the street until Gundlach finally turned around and told them he wasn't planning on stopping anytime soon.

While all this was happening, chaos had erupted on TCW's trading floor. CEO Stern sent out a companywide e-mail announcing Gundlach's termination and the acquisition of MetWest. Then Stern appeared to reiterate the news in person. Analysts watched in shock as a team of private detectives and attorneys descended. Gundlach's suspected conspirators were herded into offices and conference rooms, where the investigators interrogated them and seized laptops and records. Some company-owned BlackBerrys went dark without warning. Nervous employees scurried around the floor, trying to figure out who had been terminated. By the end of the day, the tally was five.

TCW proved inept in its efforts to stanch the turmoil caused by Gundlach's departure. On the rainy Monday morning after he was fired, TCW employees gathered in conference rooms for a companywide conference call. CEO Stern told his troops that the downpour was a sign of renewal, and that TCW would emerge as ""a firm that has respect for everyone within the firm.""

But Day, TCW's founder and chairman, was less temperate in his remarks. He told the employees that he had been through this before -- i.e., with Marks -- and that there was no other choice. ""It sort of reminds me a bit of General Washington crossing the Delaware,"" he said. ""The general was in the back of the boat. It would be like a soldier getting up, trying to rock the boat, expecting to sink the boat. His choices are very simple. You shoot the soldier. You throw him off the boat.""

After a pause, nervous laughter emanated over the speakers. Some of Gundlach's former colleagues were horrified. A few started crying. Others walked out. ""Whatever people may say about [Gundlach], here's a guy that has been working for his company for over 20 years and has made a lot of money for investors,"" says Luz Padilla, a fund manager at the company. ""After that call, I was just incensed.""

Padilla hadn't been set on leaving TCW, she says, until she realized the current imbroglio bore an uncanny resemblance to the Howard Marks controversy -- a talented manager leaves after a fight over money, and a new team takes control. ""It was a different set of players,"" she says, ""but almost the same movie."" There was also the fear that the arrival of the MetWest group would make the current bond team redundant. Dozens more followed Padilla out.

Then came the surge of customer defections. By late February TCW's assets had dropped by some $25 billion. The most prominent deserter was the U.S. Treasury, which pulled out of the $4.1 billion Public Private Investment Fund it had started with Gundlach.

Less than two weeks after he was fired, Gundlach announced that his new firm, DoubleLine, was partnering with a respected L.A. money manager: none other than Howard Marks. The onetime TCW star has thrived on his own, building a firm called Oaktree Capital with $70 billion in assets. Marks is buying 22% of DoubleLine and in exchange will provide the administrative backbone for Gundlach's new operation. Needless to say, an alliance between two of its former stars is also a not-so-subtle poke in the eye to TCW.

After weeks of relative silence, TCW struck back. On Jan. 7 the company filed its explosive complaint. It emphasized the alleged plot to steal information. It also tarred Gundlach personally, referring to the pornography, sexual devices, and marijuana retrieved from his office. TCW justified the inclusion of the prurient material in the suit under the whisper- thin pretext that it constituted a breach of company policy. Asked about the contents of his office, Gundlach offers only the mildest of quibbles: ""Not all of the items are mine."" In a letter to investors, he noted, ""I had every expectation of privacy in these spaces, which stored vestiges of closed chapters of my life.""

On a recent Thursday afternoon, Marc Stern sits in one of TCW's dining rooms with Jacques Ripoll, the head of SocGen's asset management division. The two couldn't look more different. Stern, 65, is barrel-chested with white hair and a loud, raspy laugh. Ripoll, 43, has a slick, dark coiffure and a heavy French accent. As Stern talks about growing up on a vegetable farm in New Jersey, one can't help but notice that his story resembles Gundlach's. Both were gifted kids who came from working-class families, and both share a love of art (Gundlach has an extensive collection of contemporary paintings; Stern is the chairman of the L.A. Opera, a passion he developed while riding on his father's tractor and listening to opera on the radio).

Despite the controversy, Stern insists that TCW is better positioned than ever, and its new team, he pointedly adds, is ""delighted to be here."" Stern predicts that TCW will double its assets in three years. He stresses the importance of having ""mechanisms where people share information and are willing to help each other."" While not specifically naming Gundlach, the message is clear: The star manager didn't play well with others. TCW's new head of fixed income is MetWest founder Tad Rivelle, a self-effacing, professorial type -- the anti- Gundlach -- and no slouch as a manager. His Total Return bond fund has beaten 94% of its peers over the past decade.

""TCW is ready for growth,"" Ripoll says. ""To be transparent -- this was not possible before."" And what of Gundlach's long-desired equity stake? TCW is giving shares to the new team from MetWest (as it did with the Crescent group) but is less definite about handing it to others. ""When you have a company like TCW, it is very important that you have equity held by the employees,"" Ripoll says. ""That is what we are putting in place.""

TCW's basic business model -- a collection of autonomous managers -- seems unlikely to change. In a separate interview, the founder and chairman defends the approach. ""I started the company with $2 million, and it has $115 billion today,"" says Day. ""The formula that has worked for 40 years is going to continue to work."" (Day also insists Gundlach really didn't care about an equity stake; when given the choice, he always opted for more fees.)

Gundlach, meanwhile, is still setting up shop. He has been through a lot of late. He showed up at meetings in January with a black eye and cuts on his face, which he says came from tripping and colliding with his desk at home. On Feb. 1, his wife of more than 20 years, Nancy, filed for divorce. And Bill Gross was named fixed-income fund manager of the decade; Gundlach thinks he would have taken the prize if he hadn't been fired. That said, Morningstar clearly still views him as legitimate: The organization invited Gundlach to deliver the keynote address at its annual investors conference this summer.

DoubleLine has registered three mutual funds with the SEC, and it expects $10 billion in new accounts this spring. Gundlach says the most gratifying thing about the firing and its aftermath is that 45 people followed him from TCW -- proof, he says, that he isn't such a difficult guy to work with. As Gundlach walks through his new firm's offices, he looks happy. To reign there, it seems, is better than to serve at TCW. To top of page

personalfinance,What to do about my Mom's retirement,"So about a year and a half ago, my Mom, who is now considered disabled at age 60 and collecting SS, let me know she has 5k in Credit Card debt. All things considered, this wouldn't be an issue, but the only income she receives is from SS, and she has a Roth IRA with about 20k in it. 

We were able to have her refinance an auto loan she has and include that CC debt, so she has that now with about 10k left to pay, and a pretty solid interest rate given the age of the vehicle (2.75%). Public transportation isn't a real option where we're located, so having the car and loan is fine, since it should last her a very long time for how little she drives. 

What I don't like is that she also opened a home equity loan while refinancing her vehicle, and I've noticed she has started to draw on it in recent months (up to about a 2k balance now). Her budget was already stretched super thin before, and she now has a loan that I can't imagine won't continue to grow if left unchecked. Even worse, I noticed small payments every month to the credit card we paid off, so who knows where that's at. 

If this was your issue, would you take the Roth IRA funds and pay all of her debt down to $0? I want to suggest this to her, as I don't want to problem to continue. If the lack of loan payments frees up her monthly budget, maybe she'll stop leaning on a credit card (also clearly need to talk to her about that). 

This is part vent, but really would like some ideas on what I can do to help her figure this out. For what it's worth her home is paid off. Thank you!

personalfinance,Net pay is 66% of gross pay on my bonus. This doesn't match up with the amount of taxes I pay on my paychecks. Is this normal? Located in California.,"So, I received a VERY generous bonus from my company this year of $4,500. For reference, I make $30/hr or about $62,400.00 a year and live in California.

Gross Pay: $4,500

Social Security -$279.00

California State Income Tax -$331.84
  
California State Disability Insurance -$45.00

My paychecks seem to be about the same ratio from gross to take-home, but that also includes my retirement contribution and benefits. (My paycheck is usually $2,400. I pay $647.71 in taxes, $42.62 in benefits, and send $120.00 to retirement. So my take home is about $1589, which is 66%.)

personalfinance,Need advice on getting everything stable,"Hi everyone, long time lurker here and made a throwaway because I'm doing my best to keep this anonymous.

Situation: My wife and I are at a crossroads with our professions and are currently in a bit of debt as well. For our entire twenties (we're both 30 now) we've worked for environmental nonprofits. We've moved around the country a couple times for career growth, but rarely have gotten much financial gain in return, just improved titles and improved resumes. The problem is that there are limited employers that our skillset is understood by, mostly more nonprofits or federal jobs that also don't pay much. We've both worked our way up to top tier positions (think directors) but the pay never followed suit, so I actually left the line of work and started doing graphic design full time recently for more money(around a 10% pay increase) and I'm pretty happy with it. We were both pretty tired of the nonprofit high stress low pay grind and am pretty eager to get my wife out of the workplace as it's honestly pretty hostile given the stress level everyone operates under. Trouble is, because of the narrow scope of options career wise, we end up feeling a bit trapped and my wife has started a graduate program with the hopes of having more options moving forward.

Every time we've moved we've accumulated debt, and we got married this year, accumulating a fair amount of debt as well (we thought we'd get more help from family, but life happens). I like to think we actually live within our means, we go out to dinner twice a month but otherwise cook all meals. We own one car and have a loan on a used subaru that is reliable. We live in one of the most expensive small towns in america because there is a bit of a housing crises here (mountain town with limited housing options). The average rent for a 1BR is around 1400, and we've paying maybe the cheapest in town we could find at 875. We don't have kids yet but want to go down that road before we get too old. We're very open to moving to a more affordable location as well, but feel like if we move too soon, I wont have enough experience in this new line of work to find work (I went to college for this 10 years ago, but recession meant I just now got back into it).

I think I'm hitting most things, most of this debt has come from the cost of our wedding, moving cross country expenses like a uhaul, and random medical stuff like needing a crown. I'm sure I missed some expenses on there but thats most of it. As you see, we do try to save but these credit cards are killing my credit, and if we want to ever buy a home or even really afford to move again to a cheaper place, I don't know how to get us back on track. Is a debt consolidation loan worth it? Am I missing something? I feel like we have decent incomes but are struggling so hard to get by. We'd prefer to not touch our house saving fund for anything but a down payment. Looking for sound advice and thanks to anyone who takes time to help us figure this out!

PS: I forgot to mention with my current employer there's a maybe 60% chance they'd let me work remotely from another city.

""WARNING; WHAT IM ABOUT TO SUGGEST IS HIGHLY UNUSUAL. 

This technique depends on your banking institution. And I also want to say this requires ALOT of SELF-CONTROL on your part. So be very very careful thinking about this. Credit scores are very easy to screw up. ALSO, this may be considered by some to be a VERY DUMB idea, I admit that. I did this when I was 18 and it worked out fine in the end. 

Now, let's get into this. 

You may be able to take a personal unsecured loan from a credit union or bank. (Unsecured means there is no collateral such as a house or car to put up in case you default on the loan) if you have a savings account at a CU/bank that you can take a loan at, they may consider it as collateral against the loan. However, they will most likely require a parent to co-sign. 

That being said, you're probably going to get a high interest rate for that. (think 10%+) AND since you're under 18 they may not even approve the loan at all. 

IF they let you take a personal loan. Put all the funds into a checking account (say 1k to 1,500, I pulled 2k out but I had a savings account of 5k at the time) Setup automatic payments from the checking acct to the loan account. 

DO NOT TOUCH THE MONEY, DON'T SPEND IT, DON'T EVEN ACT LIKE IT'S THERE. DON'T GET A DEBIT CARD ON THE ACCOUNT, YOU ARE NOT TAKING THE LOAN TO SPEND IT, YOU'RE TAKING IT TO BUILD CREDIT.

Then, if you're currently working, make sure to transfer some cash, on each payday, from your primary account to the checking account covering the loan interest, you will accrue, 12 months will roughly be $100 of interest on every $1k borrowed {@ 10%}. 

(IF YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB, BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL DOING THIS, YOU WILL HAVE TO PULL THE MONEY FROM SAVINGS TO COVER INTEREST) This should establish a credit history with no missed payments over 12-18 months. Should help you establish credit in a decent range. 

If the loan route isn't an option, you can look into opening a student credit card with a set limit so you won't overspend. Credit cards aren't the devil, but YOU HAVE TO HAVE SELF CONTROL. Make sure to 1.) Check the balance weekly and pay it in full for the first few months till you can trust yourself to not overspend. 2.) As soon as you establish a credit score ease off the card use. You need to get away from it if you can. 

Most people spend more money when using a card versus cash. You have to retrain your brain to understand that even though it's not leaving your wallet, you still have to pay a credit card off or the interest will tear you up. Realize that most credit cards carry a 17-24% interest rate. That means if you buy something one month and don't pay it (say $100, it will take you $110 to $115 to pay it off the next month) you should be extremely careful using CCs when you're young.

I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH, taking a loan or opening a CC means you are opening yourself to owing someone money. You are NOT creating income for yourself. Be very careful with this move. Financially it can ruin you if done incorrectly. 

Reasons why you might do this;

1.) It doesn't give you a chance to run up CC debt because you won't have a card to spend it with. 2.) Putting it on automatic payments helps make sure you don't miss a payment and take a late payment hit. 
3.) Putting the money in a separate account without a debit card leaves you without regular access to it, making it MUCH harder to spend it. 4.) You will be subject to a much lower interest rate with the loan then the CC route. 
And 
5.) The loan SHOULD automatically close itself upon receiving the last payment making the whole process an automatic issue. 

DO NOT TAKE A PAYDAY LOAN TO DO THIS. DON'T TAKE A PAYDAY LOAN EVER. LIKE EVER EVER EVER.

Only do this with a personal loan and a very small amount. Small enough that if something happened you could cover it with savings.""""""

personalfinance,Late 60s uncle entering retirement with ~$100K settlement and no other savings. Should he buy a house?,"My uncle in his late 60s recently received a personal injury settlement check for just under $100K. He was a school janitor, and the injury put him out of work for the last couple of years. He wants to move from the northeast US to the southeast US to be closer to our family.

Background info:

- He'd like to buy a house. He has a credit score in the low 700s (I think?).
- He has no other savings.
- He has just under $25K of debt. $13.5K of the $25K is from a personal loan with an 18.99% APR. The rest is from credit cards.
- He receives $700 a month from social security. Now that workers' comp will be stopping, this will be his only income.
- He has a paid-off early 2000s car that has been costing a lot in repairs recently. You need a car in the area he'd  like to move to, so he might be buying a car in the next few years.

He doesn't know much about retirement savings, investing, and financial principles in general. As an example, I recently had to clarify for him that he has the option to pay off the personal loan early instead of paying on the monthly schedule set out by the bank. He thought that the interest baked into the payments was compulsory.

This is why I wanted to be a part of the process of looking for a house and managing his settlement money. He is very open to influence from family on these decisions, which is great.

How should he go about managing and allocating this money?

- Should he wipe out the debt immediately? (My instinct is yes, considering the interest rates)
- Does it make sense for him to buy a house? (He's open to a fixer upper; currently considering houses around $100K)
- Given the short time horizon, how should he go about investing the money to make the most out of it for retirement?
- Is it advisable that he go back to work (if he's physically able) instead of considering himself retired immediately?

Any input or stories of relevant experiences is much appreciated.

personalfinance,27yo married couple making $163k jointly - traditional or Roth IRA?,"My husband and I both got better paying jobs in the last year after living much closer to the poverty level for most of our adult lives. I deal with our finances and I need help understanding whether a traditional or Roth IRA would be better for us.

* I am 26 and he is 28
* We generally follow the flowchart in the wiki - currently working on paying down credit card debt
* I make $120k/yr, he makes $43k
* No kids yet but we will in 3-5 years
* We rent but plan to buy in the next 3-5 years
* Other debts: fed student loan $30k, private student loan (refi'd to ~5%) $28k, 2 cars $38k total  
* I'm currently contributing 7% to a traditional 401k, with an employer match of 3% for a total of 10%, with $1500 currently invested (just started this job)
* He is currently contributing ~4% to a traditional 403b with about $7.5k total currently invested
* I also have a Roth 401k from a previous employer with about $2k in it waiting to be converted to an IRA (i.e. why I'm here asking this)

We don't come from wealthy families and don't own significant property, have passive income, etc. However, I do expect to have a fairly aggressive income increase timeline - think about $150k in 2-3 years and upward from there. My husband may or may not go into a more lucrative career in the near future as well.

Given that

* we are not anywhere near retirement
* we plan to move from an expensive state (CO) to a cheap one (TN) in the near to mid future
* our combined income is likely to push the bounds of $200k in the next 3-5 years

what IRAs are best for us right now, traditional or Roth?

Edit: Specifically I'm looking for what to do with my previous employer Roth 401K now that I am being kicked off the plan and have to convert it to an IRA. Can you convert a Roth 401k into a traditional IRA, or does it only work for traditional -&gt; Roth?",finance

personalfinance,"Unmarried couple splitting up home equity, questions about cashing out w/ private funds","Hi PF, I'm going through quite a tumult here and could really, really use your advice.

I'm breaking up with my partner of 4.5 years. We tried to make it work, but just simply grew apart and realized it too late. We're amicable and aiming for a 'conscious uncoupling' process.

We purchased our 1BR log home 3 years ago. We both love it tremendously. I'm trying to determine whether I can cash him out with private funds. (I don't want to refi as interest rates have gone up.) Though we are not married, we have a Tenants in Common agreement in place, where we both have 90 days to cash the other out, or the property goes up for sale. (Edit: The TIC also dictates a 50/50 equity split, and we have both contributed equally to the property and all expenses.)

Here are some details:

* Annual salary: $69k
* Purchase price: $262k, conventional loan balance $222k
* Monthly payments: $1400 including PMI
* Zestimate: $329k
* Cash assets: $20k (includes all savings!)
* 401k: $45k

I expect to be in this town for 2 more years, and leave for a neighboring city to pursue a doctorate degree. I was hoping to rent the home while I'm away.

Can I realistically cash this person out with private funds, including borrowing against my 401k? Or would I totally be shooting myself in the foot here? He's also assessing whether he can buy me out as well.

Any advice or insight you all have would be incredibly appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Can someone check my logic for using a Roth IRA to purchase a house?,"Disclaimer: I opened a Roth IRA ~8 years ago specifically to use to save for either retirement *or* a house purchase. I aggressively save for retirement in my 401K (it is maxed, $18,5K this year) and I consider it my primary retirement fund, it's well over 10X the values in the Roth... The Roth I have always considered OK to draw to $0 when/if I bought a home.

My understanding of Roth's is:

- You can withdraw all contributions at any time w/o penalty or income tax

- You can withdraw up to $10K if you're a first time home buyer, this withdrawal is not subject to 10% penalty, but would be subject to income tax.

I am buying my first home.  I have about $38K in a Roth.  $30K of that is contributions, $8K is earnings.

I plan to withdraw all of it -- based on my understanding above I think that only $8K of that will be subject to income tax, so if I have my brokerage withhold the appropriate amounts of federal/state tax, then I should be fine when it comes time to file my 2018 taxes.

I don't think there's any specific declaration I have to make at withdrawal time, but I would need to be able to prove to the IRS that the $30K was contributions and that I used the $8K for direct costs related to home purchase (which will be occurring within 40 days)

Am I doing this right, or have I totally screwed myself?",finance
personalfinance,Refinance Auto Loan Through Credit Union?,"Im not very knowledgable about loans and how refinancing a loan would work. First some background info, I graduated from college about 3 years ago and got a pretty decent job soon after. For about the first year, I used an old family car so I did not have to pay any money for it. But then my sister graduated and was in a less financially stable position than myself, so I let her take that one and bought a car of my own on a loan. At the time, my credit wasnt necessarily bad but I did not have much credit history, and it was my first large loan besides student loans, so the interest rate was high for an auto loan(8%). 

At this point, 18 months later, my credit score is pretty good at 740. I see flyers at my place of work for the credit union offering auto loans at 2-3% and am wondering if that would be an option for me, as opposed to refinancing at a large bank again or not refinancing at all. The current loan is through Chase. When I look the loan on my online profile, it breaks down interest and capital, and says I have paid off the interest portion of the loan. Would that have any impact on refinancing?",finance

What are some good online alternatives?,"So I currently have an account at an unnamed credit union and have had my account since I was 16 (I'm 20 now). They recently have fallen on hard times because they are a relatively small credit union so they have started raising their fees. 

Skip this if your not interested in the fees. 

\------------------------------------------------------------

They have raised the monthly minimum deposit amount 1k a month while I only make around 800 a month after taxes. $25 a month instead of the old rate of $8.99. Overdraft protection was removed and they now charge $50 for debit overdrafts and charge immediately even if your current balance is still positive. Savings now requires a minimum balance of $30 instead of $5 and I didn't have one but they are also raising the interest rates in their credit cards. Also they removed ATM reimbursement

So right now I'm in the market for a new bank/credit union. I have heard good things about online banks but am no sure where to get started.

I work for a small company and just found out through the grapevine that we got bought out by a major competitor. This is being announced tomorrow (I know this info is legit).

One of my co-workers who was a contractor has already been let go (I am a full time employee).

I'm assuming they are keeping the rest of us (for now) but I doubt the business will stay open for more than a year. The competitor we were bought out by is known to just buy smaller competition and absorb the client base into their system.

I'm very unfamiliar at how this all works as this is my first job in the industry (I've been there for about 4 years). My no longer employed co-worker was given 4 months severance, which seems low and we are known to be underpaid in general (but that is a different story).

Do I just keep working there until the company eventually closes? Can I normally ask for a severance and just be done with it? If I take a severance can I apply for unemployment while looking for a new job?

I'm just not sure how this all works and don't want make some mistake that ends up costing me money or screwing things over for me.

I have found out today that somebody had my online login information for my bank account. I have no idea how they had that information as I have never told it to anybody.

Last Friday I had noticed a $555 transaction on my account not made by me. The description of the transaction was ""withdrawal bill payment billpay paypal add money billpay paypal add money"". Freaking out, I drove to the bank and spoke with a lady there. She helped me dispute the transaction on the mobile app, shredded my old debit card, and gave me a new one. I asked if there was anything I could do to prevent this from happening again she said ""no because there's really no telling how they got your card information"". I said thank you and walked out the door.

Today, I checked my account to see if the money had been returned yet to find yet another transaction, with the same description in the amount of $450, gone from my account. I called the bank this time. After explaining the situation and the guy looking at my acc, the first thing he said was ""well both these transactions were made with bill pay which can only be set up through mobile banking"". Excuse me what? Why didnt the first person tell me this on Friday? I could have avoided this second transaction.

After talking with him for a while, I've found out the first payment was sent in check form directly to paypal. Again, why did the first lady not tell me this? I could have put a stop payment on it, changed my online password, and everything would be ok. Now this is where I'm stuck at. He said the only thing they can do for me is put a stop payment on the first charge and hope it hasn't been cashed yet. He said since the second one was an electronically sent transaction he cannot do anything for me about it and I would have to call paypal myself.

I have the account number that the money was sent to. Although during my researching I've found that paypal accounts dont have account numbers, just email addresses. I'm currently waiting a call back from them but I'm not sure if they will be able to help me at all. I've checked my paypal account and there's no money in it and I paid off my paypal credit card in April of last year.

If I look in my banking history, there is the movement of $450 from my savings to checking on 12/13. On 12/14 it was sent to paypal. Again, on 12/17 $450 was moved from my savings to checking. Today it was sent to paypal. How fucked am I? I have literally no money, only getting $600 on Friday, and have $1500 worth of bills due next week.

Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated. This is the first time this has ever happened to me and being told by the bank they cant help me has me feeling totally lost.

Edit: just got off the phone with paypal. After searching both my old card, my new card, and my bank account number, they have no record of any monies being sent from me. It is starting to sound like whoever stole money from me spoofed their name to look like paypal. After realizing the first amount was sent by check, they tried a lower amount to get it to send digitally.",finance

SCOTT WAPNER: Welcome to Los Angeles Jeffrey. Thank you for having us back.

JEFFREY GUNDLACH: Welcome to DoubleLine.

SCOTT WAPNER: Almost a year to the day we were last with you.

JEFFREY GUNDLACH: I think it was December 13th last year.

SCOTT WAPNER: That’s right. We’re still volatile in the market. Today is another representation of that. We’re still about 50 points above on the S&amp;P of the February lows.

JEFFREY GUNDLACH: Yes.

SCOTT WAPNER: Do you think we’re going to go below that?

JEFFREY GUNDLACH: Well in the fullness of time, I think absolutely we’ll go below that. I’m pretty sure this is a bear market. People like this definition of 20% down as a bear market, but that’s obviously very arbitrary. I’ve been around over 35 years in the business and have seen a number of bear markets. It’s more about how you lead into it, how it develops and how the sentiment changes, and I think we’ve had pretty much all of the variables that characterize a bear market I remember going -- usually something happens that really doesn’t make any sense at all and I’m kind of amazed how it goes on longer than it should like back in the dotcom days when companies were being IPO’d and had no sales let alone revenues that’s hard to be and they would actually explode to the upside on the IPO. That’s kind of crazy and then we had the subprime lending with pick a pay loans back in ’05 and ’06 and that was kind of crazy and that went on longer than it should have. This time like we talked about a year ago it was crypto, bitcoin which was truly a mania, we talked a year ago it just went up. Maybe in the end it’s a good thing or the block chain technology is a good thing. The way it was being treated and believed in was a mania and then it crashed about a week after we met a year ago and it was at 17,500 when we were speaking right in this spot and of course now it’s down below 3,500 so an 85% decline. And one after another you start to see various sectors of the global financial markets give it up. The global stock market peaked January 26th. And so did the New York Stock Exchange composite, January 26 but the Dow Jones Industrials, the Nasdaq, the S&amp;P 500. All of these things, one by one, started to roll over and come the summertime or later in the summertime you were down to the FAANGs and then you were down to two stocks it was amazon and apple and then amazon gave it up. And then finally when they decided they weren’t going to tell you how many phones they sold anymore apple gave it up.

SCOTT WAPNER: That was the last straw.

JEFFREY GUNDLACH: That was kind of the last straw. It was October 3rd when the tariffs -- well, it was that USMC -- whatever it’s called, it’s really NAFTA but it was announced we would have this change in NAFTA that would lead to a requirement that a certain fraction of car parts be made in higher costs locales which basically meant not Mexico. A senior executive at ford motor said, well obviously we’re going to have to raise the prices on our cars if input prices are going up. Suddenly the market seemed to wake up to the fact that this was real and the next day the stock market tipped over in fact, on October 3rd, Jay Powell said we’re a long way from neutral. And that was a big problem, too.

SCOTT WAPNER: That seemed to be the tipping point.

JEFFREY GUNDLACH: Yes that with the USMCA thing and the Ford Motor executive, those things seemed to come together and coalesce into we’ve had enough. And, yeah, the Jay Powell thing was interpreted by the market as a scary thing, the fed was going to keep going a long distance further and then the market dropped over 10% and suddenly the Fed had to massage the rhetoric. And suddenly it was, well, we have a new definition of neutral maybe. We’re actually within the lower bound or close to the lower bound of neutral in an attempt to stabilize the market. So, yeah, it seems like a bear market to me in the way things trade with late day volume being bad and the like the best thing for the near term, I think, is that the most export sensitive stock market, South Korea, the Kospi bottomed October 29 so at least that’s not pushing to new lows and emerging markets broadly are doing better because they’re extremely export driven. Maybe this leg down is getting toward an exhaustion point the sentiment is pretty dark right now. I’d be happier on the short term outlook if the VIX would go above 40 which is usually a sign.

SCOTT WAPNER: That would be quite a spike.

JEFFREY GUNDLACH: Well, that’s typically what happens when you get to the bottom, there’s so much nervousness and fear but the Vix is a little bit disturbing how it doesn’t go higher. Actually as the market pushes to the down side. But i think this is a bear market and i think we’ll go below the February lows almost with certainty.

SCOTT WAPNER: Is it a long lasting bear market or it can be short term as some have suggested on our air and then this secular bull market will resume?

JEFFREY GUNDLACH: I don’t think so. I think it’s a bear market. I think we’ve had the first leg down and the second leg down is usually more painful than the first leg down if this is indeed a bear market. Maybe in the short term we’re getting flushed out. I think it’s lasted a long time. It has a lot to do with the fact i believe we’re in a situation that maybe unprecedented was too strong but it is highly unusual that we are increasing the budget deficit so spectacularly so late in the cycle while the fed is hiking interest rates. I know you’ve teased the segment by talking about the suicide mission I’ve been talking about for months. The fed almost seems to be on a suicide mission. What i mean by that the deficit in the United States is extraordinarily high from where we are in the economic cycle and given what the debt level accumulated is already. In the first two months of fiscal ’19 it was just announced last week there’s a funny thing that happened in November where the payments for December ended up being pushed to November because December 1st was on a Saturday if you take that out it’s $44 billion that’s a big number. So if you wake that out and say that’s December and not November. Still, the first two months of fiscal ’19, the budget deficit is going up at an annualized rate of $1.62 trillion. And that’s the official budget deficit. The actual budget deficit is larger than what the report -- for example, for fiscal ’18, which ends September 30th, the deficit was around $800 billion. But the national debt went up by $1.3 trillion almost now. Why? What’s the difference there? There are items that are off budget. So the budget deficit really for fiscal ’18 was $1.3 nearly trillion that’s 6% of GDP and we’re supposedly having a good economy and we’re supposedly having jobs growth and all this other great stuff. In actuality we increase the deficit by 6% of GDP since government deficit change is a significant fraction – a significant variable in the GDP equation it seems to me there’s no real economic growth that’s happening away from the deficit. So what worries me is that as we move into a weaker economy, which will happen at some points and certainly the economy looks weaker now than it did entering 2018, that the deficit will continue to expand at a rate which could be prohibitive for the usual decline in interest rates helping to stimulate the economy. That’s what I think is the real big variable investors need to focus on. And while this is happening with the deficit exploding, the fed is raising interest rates which means the interest expense is going to be increasing year by year as these zero interest rates that we had for a number of years start to roll off and the bonds have to be refloated once they mature, the next five years we have something like $7 trillion of treasuries that are maturing the average coupon on those treasuries is almost as low as 2%, slightly higher, 2.1%. When they roll over, they’re going to be at a higher interest rate because the fed has been on the suicide mission of raising interest rates so the interest expense on that $7 trillion of treasuries is going to be -- maybe the rate will be at 3% like it is now or maybe 4% and you might even see we have an expense that goes up $100, $140 billion. So kind of the … of our government is coming back to haunt us ultimately. In financial markets, these things go on so much longer than they should Ross Perot ran for president running infomercials about we were doomed on the deficit and there was a book written in 1992, that same year, that was somewhat sponsored by the Peterson Foundation called bankruptcy 1994. And the idea behind the book was we have this compounding curve and this debt problem that is going to come back and really cause us problems. Well, he was early. He was early by at least 26 years. But he’s right, you can’t keep going on with the debt finance scheme, and I’m worried when the next recession comes we could be looking at, well heck, we’re supposedly in a good economy and the next two months we’re running $1.6 trillion what if we go into a recession what’s the deficit going to be $3 trillion? And does that mean interest rates don’t go down during the next recession, which is an idea I’ve been noodling around for a long time maybe they go higher with I’ve had a call the next two years that come 2021 the ten-year treasury will be at 6%. I get a lot of pushback a lot of debt deflation is out there in the twitter-sphere absolutely wrong the economy can’t handle higher interest rates. Interest rates might have a life of their own. It might not matter what the market can handle or can’t handle.

SCOTT WAPNER: they haven’t to this point. It’s been somewhat surprising that rates have remained where they are you said 3%. They hit 3%. 3.25%. Here we are below 2.9% today.

JEFFREY GUNDLACH: yes, on the ten year. I was focusing on the three year when it broke above 3.25% that was incredibly important frankly, I didn’t think we’d go back below 3.25 once we broke above because it seemed like such an important level. Here we are back below 3.25. But not impressively not in a way that would be consistent with a big decline in the global stock market. There’s a thing called the death cross. It’s a 50-day moving average goes below 200 a day particularly when they’re both declining. Presently about 80% of the countries in the MSCI World Index are in a death cross 80%. It’s amazing. And there was a chart that got a lot of play put out by deutsche bank about how many risk assets globally are in officially bear market down the arbitrary 20% number that, again, i don’t really ascribe to but so commonly used at that they used it and the highest in the data series going back to 1901. It’s like 90% of the risk assets around the world in dollar terms are in bear markets. So it’s a pretty widespread and coordinated set of weaknesses.

SCOTT WAPNER: Are you saying that by embarking on this suicide mission that the fed shouldn’t raise interest rates this week?

JEFFREY GUNDLACH: I don’t really think that’s the main thrust of my idea this week, yeah, they shouldn’t raise them this week.

SCOTT WAPNER: They shouldn’t?

JEFFREY GUNDLACH: No I don’t think they should. The bond market is saying, fed, you’ve got no way you should be raising interest rates look at the 2s, 3s, five-year part of the yield curve which are flat at 270 I guess that corroborative of a hike. But it is basically saying in the year 2019 you’re going to have a cut, this big, but a cut that was priced into the yield curve and in 2020 another cut. The problem, though, isn’t that the fed shouldn’t be raising rates. The problem is the fed shouldn’t have kept them so low for so long.

SCOTT WAPNER: Sure.

JEFFREY GUNDLACH: The problem we shouldn’t have had negative interest rates like we still have in Europe. We shouldn’t have done quantitative easing which is a circular financing scheme. The problem really is the deficit. The fed is kind of helpless here. The fact that the deficit is so out of control this late in the economic cycle, we have never before had the fed raise interest rates while the budget deficit was expanding it’s never happened. Because usually the budget deficit expands in response to a recession. It’s a way of stimulating to get us out of recession. Instead, we did it as a last gasp of keeping this economic recovery going by making it completely deficit based.

SCOTT WAPNER: So this morning, President Trump once again Tweeted about the Fed. Quote, “It’s incredible that with a very strong dollar and virtually no inflation, the outside world blowing up around us, Paris burning, China way down, that the Fed is even considering another interest rate hike. Take the victory,” he stayed. Stan Druckenmiller, today, Op-Ed “Wall Street Journal”: The Fed should quote “Pause its double-barreled blitz of higher rates and tighter liquidity.” So they’re right, you agree with them?

JEFFREY GUNDLACH: I do agree with them. I’ve been saying this pretty much all year, the double-barreled was actually -- he may have borrowed that from me, that’s how I’ve been talking about – it’s how I’ve been phrasing it all year – that we’ve really been tightening interest rates in a way that’s more than people understand. There’s a duo of economists at the Atlanta Fed called Wu and Xia, who did a study a few years back ‘What was the effect of quantitative easing?’ If they hadn’t done the quantitative easing and instead had taken the European model and gone to negative interest rates, how negative would those rates have had to be to have the same stimulative effect as the quantitative easing? And they concluded – and I don’t know if they’re right or not it’s very hypothetical – but their conclusion was that the quantitative easing amounted to 300 basis points of further cuts. So if they hadn’t done quantitative easing, to have the same stimulative effect, the Fed funds would have had been negative 300 basis points. Well let’s just say they’re right. Since they did about 2.5 trillion of quantitative easing and it was 300 basis points, 2.5 trillion divided by 3 is roughly $800 billion. Okay? So $800 billion is -- $800 billion divided by 4 means that’s what quantitative easing is one cut. So 100 basis points is $800 billion. So divided by 4. 25 basis points is $200 billion of quantitative easing. Well so far we’re pushing towards $400 billion -- we’re not there yet but we’re soon to be there -- of quantitative tightening. That means we’ve had would more rate hikes from quantitative tightening if Wu and Xia are right. So the Fed hasn’t just raised rates in that context eight times. They’ve raised them ten times. And the quantitative tightening is stated to be as high as $600 billion over fiscal ’19. So that’s another three rate hikes. So if they were going to follow their dots and raise rates so many times, there’s another three on top of that. So the amount of tightening has been underappreciated, I think, and Stan is right as he often is – he’s one of the greatest investors ever for, him and Chanos, the two titans of the hedge fund industry. They’re right that we are seeing the bond market react in a way that is historically very predictive of the Fed should not be doing this. And yet, we have this strange dynamic that they’ve almost promised a rate hike here in December. And then the President shows up with his Tweets trying to bully them into not doing it and it puts Jay Powell and the team in a very tough position. Because they’re damned if they do and damned if they don’t.",finance

Tesla makes no profit, Chipotle makes burritos and has health dept issues, and Facebook is hemorrhaging users.

27, married, no kids, 3 giant fur babies

$84k/year in Georgia, $10k\~ bonuses. I have been working here for 2 years now.

Wife is hourly at a passion job and makes $1,500 a month after taxes. She does some side work and can get up to an extra $2k a month if she's motivated (modeling) I don't count this as reliable because I encourage her to only do it when it's fun for her. I'd say an average of an extra $500-1k a month.

Property:

1 in Northern California worth $440k and I owe $290k. It generates $2,850 gross profit after utilities

1 in Georgia worth $350k I owe $300k. It generates $3,500 gross profit after utilities/lawn and HOA 

1 in Georgia is our primary residence we just bought for $255k, 5% down in November

Credit card debt (this is all 0% APR, I'm a churner so have access to about $400k credit lines): $60k ($25k from investing into a game I'm making, $25k into the house we just bought, otherwise I've always been the person that pays it off every month)

Wife credit card (0 APR): $14k

Student debt: $20k

&amp;#x200B;

Life summary:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a self-made man. I've had no inheritance and have been living on my own since 17. I work in video games as an artist. I've been doing it for 8 years. I graduated with a BS in CS at 19. Bought first house at 25, 2nd house at 26 and 3rd house at 27. I'm really damn good at my job. I loved my job and get paid very well especially for being in Georgia, got promoted within 6 months of my hire, everyone loved me and my work. But we hired a new manager earlier this year and it has been a living nightmare working under him (he is friends with the owners of the company and other high-up positions). He has incredible insecurity issues and I get punished when I perform better than him which leads me to having to work less effectively and keeping my mouth shut if anything would contradict his methods. I feel more dumb by the day working at this company having to hold myself back. I have tried everything professionally as possible to iron out incompatibility issues but it results in him flat out lying about our conversations which has resulted to me having to keep paper trails. My therapist, close friends and coworkers (even other managers) all suggest it's not a relationship that can be mended because of his issues currently.

&amp;#x200B;

It didn't get impossibly bad until after we JUST bought our new house, the new manager writ me up for a warning but I fought it with facts and documentation and it was thrown out but the Chief HR doesn't want to be accountable for it due to drama. I was looking for other work opportunities before that and due to my industry it's pretty slim pickings, most companies said they'll hold my files until they work on an appropriate project for me. So a new salary job is out of the question. We also really love where we live and we love our new house we just got so would prefer to stay put.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been working on my own game on the side and have invested about $25k into it over the past year from 0% apr cards. I project about $30k more to have a pristine product.

&amp;#x200B;

We dropped about $25k into our new house for home improvements and some furniture which is also apart of the credit card debt.

&amp;#x200B;

My strategies:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Continue going to work until I completely pay off outstanding debts. Should take about a year and everything is staggered to not pay any interest on my credit cards. I've had a few breakdowns over the past few months related to work. It affects my relationship greatly because I take it home with me which makes life overall worse because my wife has her own mental health issues (borderline personality disorder).
2. Talk to the owners and offer taking a 40% salary cut to only work 3 days a week due to mental health, etc. Use the extra 2 days to work on my own game and have mental breaks from salary job. I would be satisfied with this. 3 days a week is what I can handle before it starts to bleed into my personal life or ""i'm fed up"" for the week.
3. Talk to the owners and express my interest in working on my own game (this will hit close to them I think, coworkers have suggested) and ask to be able to do contract work for the company. If they agreed to this I honestly would bring in more income than my salary job even including having to pay for health insurance. While doing contract for them I expect no more than 20 hours per week contracting to them to be able to make $10k (minus taxes) a month due to what they pay contractors.
4. Go all in on my passions. Quit my job, invest in my product with another 0% APR card I just got, ship product in 6 months. If it fails go get another job, take the losses, safety net use a HELOC on mortgage to pay debt. My wife can sustain us off of her job due to our income / expense ratio. Fuck it, I'm 27 and have never paid interest on personal debt, I deserve a year to try and can bounce back if I fail.
5. Quit job, take up freelancing to make enough money to mostly pay off debts and not accrue interest. Use freelance downtime to work on my game. Ship game in about 12 months. If I transition to freelance I expect due to having to find new clients and unreliable-ness of freelancing, probably $2-3k a month of income minus taxes

&amp;#x200B;

Ending notes:

&amp;#x200B;

1. I am generally in very good standing with owners and company. Everyone loves my work. They have backed me up on many past requests. I get to leave work a few hours early one day a week for a class. Granting me extra PTO for educational purposes, etc. It's just complicated because the new manager is even closer friends.
2. I would be generally satisfied with life working at my company if my manager did not work there. I was before he started.
3. I've been battling depression for the past couple of months. Worked with my therapist that it's due to work circumstances. Do not take meds for it, I have a great support system and overall strong mental wellness.
4. I am familiar with working from home and what it's like. My first job was a remote contract for 2 years. I am a self-starter so it's non-issue.
5. Yes, I know it's beyond scary that I have $0 in saving especially with how over-leveraged I am with 3 mortgages. I've been in the rental game for 6 years (renting out rooms during the start of my career so I could live rent free) so I'm not worried about those paying for themselves.
6. My rentals generate so much income because I rent them by the room on a monthly basis. Similar to Airbnb but 2 month minimum.
7. My wife would prefer I keep my job since I'm the bread winner, but she is down to do whatever makes me happy
8. Utility expenses are for all 3 properties. It's an average.
9. I do have options at other salary jobs, they are what I would consider downward moves as far as location, pay and the company itself.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL:DR** Was doing amazing at my new job, soaring past expectations left and right, got promoted in 6 months. New manager is hired and suppresses my work, and retaliates towards me, which makes me, as an ambitious person miserable. Should I count my blessings, stick it out to clear off my debt and save some more money or should I take a year off with no savings and give my best shot at something that might just leave me even more in debt while sacrificing my very good stability and pay. Are there any other routes or ways to approach this that I might be missing?

It's my understanding that the cadence of updates can be quicker than in the past due to the groundwork established in 1.4 but we're still in the first phase.

I'm super excited about everything that's happening. Really looking forward to 2019 and seeing where we will be at this time next year!

1.    Byron (Cardano 1.N) In the Byron phase a completely new cryptocurrency technology stack was designed and built, including entirely new code and the implementation of the first generation of Ouroboros, a provably secure proof of stake protocol (PoS) at its core. The settlement layer (Cardano SL) of Cardano was launched in a federated fashion with the system operated by IOHK, Cardano Foundation, and Emurgo. It enabled the launch of ada cryptocurrency and allowed users to transfer and trade ada.

2.    Shelley (Cardano 2.N) The Shelley phase will transition the settlement layer of Cardano from a federated to a completely decentralized system which will allow all users to participate in the protocol, and get rewards for producing blocks by staking individually or within stake pools.

3.    Goguen (Cardano 3.N) The Goguen phase will bring the second collection of protocols with the computation layer (Cardno CL) deployed as side-chains to Cardano with support for smart contracts.

4.    Basho (Cardano 4.N) The Basho phase will be focused on performance, security, and scalability improvements. It will enable Cardano to scale to millions and billions of users.

5.    Voltaire (Cardano 5.N) The final development phase, Voltaire, will add a treasury system and governance, enabling sustainability and self-sufficiency for Cardano.",cryptocurrency

financialindependence,Renting for life/Buying a home post FIRE?,"Sorry if this question has been asked before. I was hoping to hear some thoughts on whether it is wise to buy a home on the path to FIRE. From my perspective, it isn't:

* It's extremely difficult to save for a downpayment and put money away
* Most of my savings would be tied up in one home. That's one asset, in one neighborhood, and in one asset class. There is no diversification.
* I'd also be paying a fuckton of interest, money not tied to the house, which could otherwise have been saved
* I'd be subject to interest rate risk if I took on a variable interest loan
* Money would have to be spent on upkeep, insurance, and property taxes. It's likely that these costs, plus the debt, would in total be equal to, or greater than renting for 30 or so years. Being in debt for 30 years also horrifies me.
* Home prices trend up in the long-run, but from what I've read, they underperform equities
* Cash flow from dividend yielding stocks can be as good, if not better, than renting your property out (and there's no upkeep/need to worry about tenants)
* There's more flexibility attached to renting. It is easier to move if I need to downsize, or relocate

I'm not really sentimental about owning property. I feel like the best move for me would be to rent into my fifties/sixties at the very least. I would invest my savings in stocks and bonds, realize higher capital gains, reach FIRE, and then, if I felt I needed to, buy a house outright, without paying interest. What do you think?",finance

Those are both offered at my community college, along with other things relevant to the degree. But I'm so scared about juggling hours at work with school. 

I've done school and work combined in the past, but I was working 33 hours and only doing 12 credit hours back then, and they were general study type classes. I found myself struggling to maintain study habits (mostly because of my naivety thinking it would be a breeze, only to realize I wasn't focusing near hard enough and I underperformed grade-wise) i only got through 2 semesters before dropping it.

OPEC emerged with a serious factional split between OPEC original and OPEC with Russia. There would have been no agreement without Russia and its old Russian Federation members as producers. Moscow is the new world oil price-setter indirectly while OPEC Original becomes a collaborator in cartel for now. Simply put, Saudi Arabia no longer is the “residual supplier” alone.

The production roll-back of 1.2 barrels per day by both “OPEC” is not enough for “balance” supply and demand for world crude oil.  It is being tested daily by commodity traders. In a briefing to New Mexico independent and small producers before the meeting in Austria, this writer warned that 1.7 million b/d was needed for balancing stabilization. Without that size of a production and export reduction, the average price of WTI oil in 2019 will average $50 per barrel.

Nearing 12 million b/d and over the Permian producers voluntarily will be required by this price to revise capital spending and place production into DUC (non-completions) and storage. There is doubt that the export of tight or shale oil would continue if the Brent price falls lower and loses its premium over WTI. A net cutback of Permian between 500,000 to 750,00 b/d should be a non-OPEC response to an oil glut even more serious than 2014.

Saudi Arabia is untouched as an American strategic ally in confronting Iran in the Middle East as a hegemonic threat.""",finance

personalfinance,Removing a paid state tax lien from cr,"We are trying to buy a home but the one thing preventing us from this is a  tax lien.   About 3 years ago I was making payments to IL Dept Revenue for back taxes. They took out automatic payments for 6 months and then they stopped. I was irresponsible and didnt follow up and never recieved a letter or notification. 3 months later we recieved a tax lien. We paid it off within 3 months of this. 
When we applied for a mortgage this was the thing keeping us from a good interest rate. I immediately called IL Tax and recieved the lien removal/release letter.  I mailed it to the 3 cr bureaus and experian showed it removed. Equifax said liens were no longer put on cr reports. No reply from TU. We had the mortgage co. Pull our credit again and its still there on all 3. I'm at my breaking point. Are there professionals that will only help to remove these without doing the whole credit repair program? I dont want to go this route but honestly I feel like I'm over my head and just want help from someone way more qualified to deal with this. I will gladly do this on my own if I can figure it out but I feel lost. Does anyone have any advice? Thanks ahead of time.",finance

investing,Portfolio Allocation for the next few years - How are you preparing?,"So, I wanted to build a portfolio that was still aggressive, but value based since value stocks have under performed for a long time now vs growth stocks.  Also with all the fears in the market and how we could be entering a bare market, I'd like to be protected as much as I can.

  
So this was what I was planning on:

&amp;#x200B;

75% Value Equities in low cost etfs (Split around 50% us equities and 50% international) 

15% Commodities 

10% Long term bonds 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Any suggestions on a good value ETF is greatly appreciated... especially if anyone knows of a smart beta one that is good.  

&amp;#x200B;

\-Regarding the long term bonds... From what I read they tend to do better as interest rates are rising... Any thoughts on this is appreciated or if anyone knows of a good bond ETFs that are out there that they suggest...

&amp;#x200B;

Really curious to hear everyone's thoughts on this for the next few years... I'd probably plan to reevaluate this after a recession and adjust accordingly, but until then, this was the plan I came up with.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not a financial expert, so any feedback is greatly appreciated...",finance
gaming,The Bad Santa Veigar who stole Christmas. A league of legends Story,"**Every champ on the rift Liked Christmas pre-season a lot...**

**But Veigar, Who stayed in the midlane of the rift, Did NOT!**

**Veigar hated Christmas fun! The whole Christmas Pre-season!**

**Now, don't ask me why. Only one knows the reason.**

**The yordle was snatched when the time wasn’t right.**

**The warlord that loomed and kept him chained tight.**

**But after some time the warlord would fall,**

**However the damage done, to the one who was small.**

**Based on this reason, his power revamped**

**He stood there on Christmas Eve, hating all of those champs,**

**Staring down from his nexus with a sour, yordle frown,**

**With the towers and inhibs still not broken down.**

**For he knew every champ down on the rift beneath,**

**were busy now, pinging and trying to avoid defeat.**

**""And they're feeding the poros!"" he jeered with a sneer,**

**""Tomorrow is Christmas! It's practically here!""**

**Then he growled, with his yordell fingers agitated drumming,**

**""I MUST find some way to stop Christmas fun from coming!""**

**For Tomorrow, he knew, all the champs would run their paces,**

**Would wake bright and early and they'd rush from their bases!**

**And then! Oh, the noise! Oh, the Noise!**

**Noise! Noise! Noise!**

**That's one thing he hated! The NOISE!**

**NOISE! NOISE! NOISE!**

**And when the victory sounded, all things would be fine,**

**The champs would gather and act like things were sublime!**

**Then the champs, young and old, would sit down to a feast.**

**And they'd feast! And they'd feast! And they'd FEAST!**

**FEAST! FEAST! FEAST!**

**They would feast on Cass-pudding, and rare Ali-roast beef.**

**Which was something Veigar couldn't stand in the least!**

**And THEN They'd do something He liked least of all!**

**Every champ down on the rift, the tall and the small,**

**Would stand close together, with sona’s etwahl a ringing.**

**They'd stand weapon-in-weapon. And the bands would start singing!**

**They'd sing! And they'd ping! And they'd SING!**

**SING! PING! SING! PING!**

**And the more Veigar thought of this League Christmas-Sing,**

**The more the Veigar thought, ""I must stop this whole thing!""**

**""Why, for years I've put up with it now!""**

**""I MUST stop this Christmas fun from coming! But HOW?""**

**Then he got an idea! An awful idea!**

**VEIGAR GOT A WONDERFUL, AWFUL IDEA!**

**""I know just what to do!"" Veigar laughed in his throat.**

**And he made a quick Santy Claus hat and a small red coat.**

**And he cackled, and cackled, ""What a great yordle trick!""**

**""With this coat and this hat, I look just like the yordle Saint Nick!""**

**""All I need is a reindeer..."" Veigar looked all around.**

**But, since reindeer are scarce, there was none to be found.**

**Did that stop the dark yordle? No! Veigar simply said,**

**""If I can't find a reindeer, I'll summon one instead!""**

**So he pulled up his staff, it raised above his head**

**A Hecarim appeared with his glowing green look,**

**The yordle had done it, and all the players were shook.**

**Hecarim turned to the yordle and made a gruff face**

**“If you think I’ll submit, I’ll kill you and leave not a trace”**

**Veigar turned and said with a small wicked grin,**

**“Just charge little horsey and I swear we will win”** 

**Hecarim stomped his hooves and the ground gave a shake**

**Veigar chuckled and chanted and made not a mistake**

**Hecarim buckled and cried and fell to his knees**

**Veigars plan set in stone, he prepared for a killing spree**

**Veigar jumped on the sleigh and said with such glee,**

**“Don’t forget little horsey! Your soul will come to serve me.”**

**Hecarim ran and charged still full of rage**

**But veigar just laughed and struck up his baby cage**

**Hecarim cursed and roared but knew he was defeated**

**Veigar now knew he had what he needed**

**Then Veigar yelled, ""Giddap!"" And the sleigh started down with great pace,**

**Toward the lanes where the champs Lay AFK in their base.**

**The minimap was dark. Quiet snow filled the air.**

**All the players were all dreaming sweet dreams without care.**

**When he came to the red base, and he thought he was dead**

**But the towers grew dark and did nothing instead** 

**""This is stop number one,"" the Bad Veigar Claus hissed,**

**And he strolled past the inhibs, empty bags in his fist.**

**Then he strolled into fountain. His fingers tightly clinched.**

**If others could do it, this would be quite a cinch.**

**He glanced at the shop for a moment or two.**

**Then he stuck his hand out and made the shopkeeper subdue.**

**Where the potions all sat in a nice little row.**

**""These potions,"" he grinned, ""are the first things to go!""**

**Then he trotted and jumped, with a smile most unpleasant,**

**Around the whole item shop, and he took every present!**

**Negatron Cloaks! And daggers! Chain Vests! And Sheens!**

**Bloodthirsters! Hydras! Zeals! And Blades of the Ruined Kings!**

**And he stuffed them in bags. Then Veigar, continuing his count-in,**

**Threw all the bags, one by one, outside fountain!**

**Then he slunk to an inhib. He took the Champs feast!**

**He took the Cass-pudding! He took the Ali-roast beef!**

**He cleaned out that inhib and quick as he flashed.**

**Why, that yordle even took their last can of Tahm-hash!**

**Then he threw all the food towards the nexus with such glee.**

**""And NOW!"" grinned the Grinch, ""I will destroy another tower-tree!""**

**And Veigar grabbed the tower-tree, and he started to shove,**

**When he heard a small sound, like the coo of a dove.**

**He turned around fast, and he saw a small girl!**

**She smiled very meekly and gave herself a twirl**

**Little Annie looked down while holding her bear.**

**Veigar had been caught but he wouldn’t despair,**

**She’d come from the blue buff for a new special potion.**

**Veigars face twitched with annoyance but he controlled his emotion.**

**She stared straight at Veigar and said, ""Santy Claus, why,”**

**""Why are you taking our Tower-tree? WHY?""**

**But, you know, that old yordle was so smart and so slick,**

**He thought up a lie, and he thought it up quick!**

**""Why, my sweet little girl,"" the bad Santa Claus lied,**

**""There's a bug in this code that we can’t let ride.""**

**""So I'm taking it down for the developers, my dear.""**

**""They’ll fix it up there. Then I'll bring it back here.""**

**And his fib fooled the young one. A fib worthy of Swain,**

**And he got her the potion and he sent her back to her lane.**

**And when Annie was gone to lane with her cup,**

**Veigar went to the next tower and blew it right up!**

**Then the last thing he took was the last cape of sunfire!**

**Then he started his back, that clever old liar.**

**In their base he left nothing but minions and rubble,** 

**And that Ryze AFK would soon be in trouble.**

**He released his spell and sent Hecarim running**

**""These champs will soon find out that no Christmas-fun is coming!""**

**""They're about to spawn! I know just what they'll do!""**

**""Their mouths will hang open a minute or two,**

**Then the champs on the rift will scream, “Oh F\*CK YOU”!""**

**""That's a noise,"" grinned Veigar, ""That I simply MUST hear!""**

**So he paused. And Veigar put his hand to his ear.**

**And he did hear a sound rising over the snow.**

**It started in low. Then it started to grow.**

**But the sound wasn't sad! Why, this sound sounded merry!**

**It couldn't be so! But it WAS merry! VERY!**

**He stared at the minimap! And Veigar blinked his small eyes!**

**Then he shook! What he saw was a shocking surprise!**

**Every champ on the rift, the tall and the small,**

**Were pinging and singing! Without any items at all!**

**He HADN'T stopped Christmas fun from coming! IT CAME!**

**Somehow or other, it came just the same!**

**And Viegar, with his tiny-feet ice-cold in the snow,**

**Stood puzzling and puzzling: ""How could it be so?""**

**""It came without XP! It came without skins!""**

**""It came without Coins, or items or wins!""**

**And he puzzled three hours, till his puzzler was sore.**

**Then Veigar thought of something he hadn't before!**

**""Maybe Fun,"" he thought, ""doesn't also come from a win.""**

**""Maybe a fun game...perhaps...comes with just playing with friends!""**

**And what happened then? Well... on the SubReddit they say,**

**That Veigars small heart grew three sizes bigger that day!**

**And the minute his heart didn't feel quite so tight,**

**He whizzed with his load on the bright monitor light,**

**And he brought back the items! And the food for the feast!**

**And he, HE HIMSELF! Veigar carved the Ali-roast beef!**

CryptoCurrency,Why the next crypto bubble will be revolutionary.,"The next crypto bubble will be ground breaking. In the previous crypto bubble, though it seemed large, was minuscule in its ratio to other assets, as well as, users. For some context, the dotcom bubble popped at around 9T in total market caps, inflation adjusted that's around 13T. Crypto in total at ATH was 800b , so it's fair to say that's peanuts. 

The previous bubble was based a lot on speculation. Everyone was buying, but no one truly understood what they were buying and why they were buying it. As long as the price goes up who cares. Now that the price is drastically lower, people have two choices: 1 sell at huge losses and forget about crypto or 2 increase your conviction. After such a large loss, giving up psychologically is hard so you take option 2. The people that stay and learn about the fundamentals and increase their convictions, tell their friends, family, who ever. This is how every bubble has started for crypto. With each bubble there is a new group of crypto cheerleaders larger than the last. 

This time around though, the media is on board too to convince the masses. Also, social media continuing to grow will greatly increase the information flow. We got a taste of this late 2017. Not to mention the immense amount of infrastructure that is being built by institutions. Liquidity, volume, and participants will dramatically increase. The amount of eyeballs on crypto now has gone up exponentially, regardless If they have any or not. 

All this coming at a time when the economic cycles are turning. We are closing in on the short term debt cycle, which means a recession is very likely in the next 2 years. Not only this, but we are at the tip of the end of a long term debt cycle. Our debt burdens are continuing to rise as income cannot keep up with debt. A few ways a central bank can try to fix this issue is : cutting costs, default on the debt, redistribute wealth, and inflation. All this can be explained in Ray Dalios video here: https://youtu.be/PHe0bXAIuk0 .The last decade the fed has been trying inflate away the problems but they won't go away and Defaulting on debt will cause an instant global collapse as the dollar is the world reserve currency. 

The next step the fed is taking is to deleverage their balance sheet which they announced recently they will be doing. This is deflationary, but when the economic fundamentals are broken, deflation will only cause more of a debt burden because there is less dollars to pay back debt and less dollars to collect in taxes. So what will the fed do? Print more dollars! This will create a state of hyperinflation as global currency values drop dramatically. 

When this happens, there will be a redistribution of wealth. The populous is divided where the middle/lower class hate the upper class and vice versa. The current wealth distribution is almost the worst it's ever been where the upper class holds most of the wealth, as it was in the 1920s. 

This is where crypto comes in. When hyperinflation take place, people flock to real money that is scarce and cannot be created out of thin air, like gold and silver, creating a wealth transfer. Crypto is a new asset class that is Decentralized, immutable, scarce, censorship resistant and unconfiscatable. These qualities make it perfect for sound money. 

This is where the true revolutionary era of crypto will begin. As the fundamentals come to light and people understand they have been robbed for decades at the expense of the central bank/ government, a Decentralized sound money option is extremely valuable. No longer will there be a speculative use case, but rather a necessary one. 

We may witness the most intense and powerful wealth transfer in history. This will take at least a decade to fully complete, maybe even longer. There is no doubt in my mind though that crypto will be revolutionary in the future. Feedback on this idea would be appreciated, thanks!",cryptocurrency

I recently graduated and my $87,000 in federal student loans went into repayment. I signed up for an income-based repayment plan, and my monthly payments for the next year are $0. Because these loans accrue just under $400 in interest per month, I'd planned to pay that much every month just to keep the interest down. I also do a bit of freelancing and planned to pay a certain percentage of those earnings every month to my loans as well.

I realized today that I can either pay off all interest accrued across all 11 loans (at different interest rates), with the rest going to the principle of the loan with the highest interest rate, or I can apply it to just one loan, paying off the interest accrued on that one loan and then the principle of that loan.

My question is—assuming that  I don't expect to default on my $0 payments and I expect to refile for income-based repayment every year so the interest accrued doesn't capitalize—is there a problem with letting the interest on my loans accrue without paying it off in an effort to pay off the principle of the highest interest rate loans one at a time? Or, is it better to keep the interest accrued in check by paying it off every month and making a smaller principle payment?

&amp;#x200B;

ETA: I'm specifically in the Pay As You Earn repayment plan, in case that is relevant.",finance

personalfinance,Student loans consolidated without my knowledge,"This morning I logged into my Fedloan account to find that all my balances were at $0 and unable to access any of my loan details.
 
After calling Fedloan, they initially said my loans were in default and had been sent to collections, but then saw that I was current on all my payments. Then they put me on hold and came back and said I had requested a loan consolidation last month and all my accounts had been moved to Great Lakes (with whom I do have one smaller loan). The issue is, I have no recollection of making this request. I was not sent anything regarding the details of my new interest rate or any of that except for something they forwarded me today that was apparently mailed to me. I am almost positive that I did not authorize this change, unless I somehow accidently went through the whole process on Fedloan's site without realizing it. I told them this but they pretty much said tough luck. I am really at a loss by how to approach this or how I can refute the consolidation request.

personalfinance,Ally Bank vs Alliant Credit Union,"I'm looking to open a high yield savings account later tonight, and have been looking a lot at Ally bank and Alliant credit union.

I know Ally gets mentioned a lot, but rarely see Alliant mentioned and was curious as to why.

I'm looking for a place to hold my emergency fund and once that is set up, start saving for other goals such as a house, new car, and various other ""large items"". Savings, interest checking, and CDs are my main interests for now in choosing an online bank.

From what I can tell:
They have the same savings interest rate at 2%. Alliant does require $100 minimum to earn interest, I didn't see any mention of an Ally minimum.

For low checking account balances, which I would usually always be within, it looks like Alliant has 0.65% and Ally has 0.1%. I'm not seeing minimum balances for either required to earn checking interest.

On CDs for the types I'm currently most interested in, Alliant currently beats Ally by 0.05%. Ally didn't list a minimum that I was able to find, Alliant requires a minimum of $1,000. I do like that Alliant's minimum CD length is 1 year, where Ally's is 2 years.

It looks like Alliant has double the monthly ATM free reimbursement over Ally,. $20 vs $10.



Given the above, is there anything I'm missing or not considering? Is there something that makes Ally seem like it is 20 times more mentioned here than Alliant?
Can anyone fill in any missing info, such as minimum balances needed to earn interest at Ally or on the Alliant checking?
Are there any other HYSA banks or credit unions I should check out and compare against these 2?",finance

Not sure if this is the right place to post this, so please let me know if it's not.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently moved to the United States from United Kingdom.

&amp;#x200B;

Back in the UK, I left behind a Guarantor Loan and a car payment. I am still keeping up payments with them.

The car I accept I will have to pay off. This will be completed in 12 months from now.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I have any options for the Guarantor loan? It is in my name, and I do not want to screw over my guarantor at all. The options I'm currently aware of are:

\-Pay off in full

\-Stop paying, meaning the guarantor will have to pay

\-\^Unless guarantor files for bankruptcy, which I would not at all ask them to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Are these my only options? Or is there anything else that can be done? I'm here in the US for at least 3 years on a work visa, but I expect that to be extended past that.

Just looking for feedback regarding my current debt repayment plan.

For reference, I am 29, this is my second year working and my first year at a new company.

Debts:

4 student loans - 1 car loan.

$5k in savings(Capital one Money Market 0.8%APR) as emergency fund, which currently is \~3 months survival.

$73k Salary (FL resident) with $4k net take home each month, with 2 months at 6k (bi weekly pay). After 401k (3% contribution of the 7% my company matches, diminishing returns after 3%. i.e. 1-3% 100% match, 4-6% 50% match, 7% 25% match)

CC bills are paid off every month in full(previous statement balance). 

Have not gone over my budgeted amount ($2,400) which includes fun, rent, essential bills, and a small ($75) dollar transfer monthly to savings account.

Table of loans.

||Total|Interest|Min Payment|Actual Payment|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|United Accounting Services (UAS)|$97,730.16|6.0%|$687.68|$700.00|

|Totals|$119,946.68|\~6.0%|$812.18|1,600.00|

&amp;#x200B;

* Thought process: Pay down the 3 smaller student loan balances first, then move to the large balance.
   * I chose to do this to get them out of the way due to their smaller magnitude and didn't see a HUGE difference in interest paid if i focused on the larger loan first. (Avalanche vs. Snowball) 
   * Maybe I am wrong in thinking that closing these three loans will help my credit score(\~660)?
   * For the AES loans, I plan to pay one down then move to the next highest interest rate until they are gone. 
* I plan to keep the $1,600 monthly payment set as the minimum I pay until my loans are gone. Keeping the car loan at a steady $300 until it is gone. 
   * I.E. after my 3 smaller loans are paid off, $1,300 will then be the payment on my large student loan.
* I receive a performance bonus yearly(%3-%10 of salary). 
   * My goal is to place $1,000 of that bonus to a loan each time I receive it regardless of its size. 
* I also plan to increase my monthly payment by $100 each time i receive a raise, regardless of the amount. 
   * Yearly is 3% raise and promotion is likely 10% based upon conversing with new co workers
* By my calculations, I should have the debt paid off sometime in 2024. With a final monthly payment of $2,200. 
* After that I plan to take that $2,200 I spent the last several years without and continue to never see it. By maxing out 401k contributions, then HSA and then a Roth IRA, like the flowchart in the wiki states to do. 

These are all without any huge life changes - marriage kids etc, which likely couldchange the amount I am able to put toward loans.

I am mainly looking for guidance on my thought process and plan. 

Is it too aggressive? 

Am I going to stunt my prospective growth of 401k significantly by not contributing the full 7% currently. 

Just want to ensure that what I am doing is not detrimental to my future and am turning to people with more practice in this area than myself.

I spend a lot of time worrying about my financial future and want to be able to provide to my potential family down the line. So getting outsiders points of view on my situation would help me immensely.

I make 45k a year in the southern part of the state where property itself is cheaper, just rarely the taxes. Think about 3.5% of the property value a year. I want to buy a home, my relative will be gifting me 20% down for a home and I will probably buy something in the 120k range. With taxes and the mortgage the total monthly payment will be around 850ish, depending on mortgage interest rates, Currently I have 34k in my savings account and 1k in my checking account. I have 18k in my roth IRA. I also have federal student loans of the following:

3,441.02  @ 3.15%

&amp;#x200B;

4,499.67 @ 3.15%

&amp;#x200B;

5,527.11  @ 3.61%

&amp;#x200B;

= $15,638.92 of total loans.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to do the following before I purchase a home:

1. Pay off my student loans
2. Boost my savings up 40k to put an additional 10k towards the home for closing costs and minor repairs and leave 30k for an emergency fund.
3. Put away another 5k to put towards classes for a career certification I've wanted to do for a long time and will get started on in the spring and cash flow my way through (my employer won't pay). These classes will transition me to take an exam and start a career where I'll have a lot more income potential. I'm not transitioning to this until I'm fully licensed and I will maintain my full time job still for probably at least the next two or three years.

Currently, I don't pay rent but help with household expenses with my parents. I want to continue to put $500 a month towards my roth and $100 a paycheck (paid biweekly) towards my brokerage account while I'm living at home and while I move out. So basically my plan right now is to save up money and pay for the classes as I go and take any extra money and save up to pay each student loan in full as I go down the list. I'm going to use the snowball for this, since the interest rates are all similar. So roughly, my savings balance will stay at 34k while I'm paying off my classes and student loans and than after those are done I'll focus on building it up to 40K. Than I'll start house hunting. I think this will take me until the spring of 2020. I don't think renting is for me and I plan to get a roommate and getting a small two or three bedroom house. I think even if I move in a few years after I buy it I'll keep it as a rental.

I think my home owning budget to look like this:

Income: $1375 (paid biweekly from job) + $1375 + $500 (maybe more?) rental income = 3250

Home (mortgages plus taxes): 850ish

Investments: $700

Insurance: Probably about $900 for auto and home owner's, but paid in one lump sum bi-annually with third monthly paycheck from biweekly cycle.

So I'll have roughly $1700 a month to cover everything else from home repairs to food.

I feel like buying is the best option for me as rent where I am can be higher than what I would be paying for a mortgage + insurance if I live with a roommate.

I've figured I need roughly 26k to meet my goals and I should be able to do that by next spring. Anything I'm missing?",finance

We're also both contributing to 401ks. She, about 5% which her employer doubles. I have yet to contribute (will in the next pay period), to which my employer gifts a flat 3%. 

We have drawn up a rudimentary budget based off of the last 12 months of our credit statements (we spend everything on credit and then pay off the balance in full). 

My Q: what should be our priorities for ensuring good financial hygiene. Here's what I'm toying with. I could use help. 

1) Rainy day fund. I'm planning on putting away 15% of our take-home pay (about 1000 per month) toward this, to having maybe three months expenses put away. I'm opening a Discover savings account to that end, which we'll skim off the top of our income every month to make sure we don't dip into it. 

2) 401k. How much should I be contributing to this given that my employer gifts a flat 3% (no matching). What would you do? 

3) Student debt. Currently we're paying a paltry $140 per month toward this behemoth, which strikes me as sort of equivalent to pissing in the wind, however, it keeps them off our back. How should we go about repaying this? How should this priority interact with the two above? Also, given that those interest rates are pretty ridiculous, would you recommending refinancing our loans? Which company (ies) would you recommend? 

4) Stress. What should be my degree of worry about our debt? I'm from Canada and this is all new to me. It stresses me out thinking that we owe 25k at such high interest rates. But I'm not sure how to make sense of it all. Maybe this isn't so bad? I know some folks have some real horror stories.",finance

investing,Banks that underwrote debt are delaying selling them,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-19/eaton-vance-lord-abbett-seen-shedding-risky-loans-amid-rout

&gt; Investors have turned sour on the loans amid global economic jitters. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday hiked rates for the fourth time this year though it dialed back projections for interest rates and economic growth in 2019.

&gt; That is making corporate loans, seen for much of the past year as an attractive shelter from rising rates, less attractive. “If the reason for people flocking into loans was to have floating-rate exposure, that rationale is less compelling now,” Greg Zappin, a portfolio manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management LLC, said in a phone interview.

&gt; The plunging debt prices are making it difficult for banks to offload loans they’ve underwritten but not yet sold to investors. Lenders including Wells Fargo &amp; Co., Barclays Plc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have taken the rare step of holding on to the loans -- which are typically made to finance buyouts -- with the hope that they can resell them to investors later.

&gt; The reversal in leveraged loan sentiment came quickly. The debt had gained around 4 percent this year through the end of September, making it one of the best performing parts of credit markets. Now gains are closer to 1.4 percent for the year. Prices for loans fell to 94.8 cents on the dollar on Wednesday, as lower stock and energy prices have sapped investor appetite for risk.

&gt; Some high-profile loan deals have suffered: $2.9 billion of loans borrowed by Apollo-owned Rackspace Hosting are now quoted at about 89 cents on the dollar, declining steeply since late September. A $6.5 billion loan sold in September by Blackstone to buy a stake in Thomson Reuters Corp.’s financial terminal division is now quoted at 95.6 cents.

&gt; It’s all added up to a tough time for banks trying to sell risky loans used to fund buyouts ahead of the transactions closing. They’re offloading the debt at steep discounts with sweeter terms and -- in some cases -- they have opted to hang onto the loans themselves as they wait for the market to improve.

&gt; Similarly, Wells Fargo and Barclays had to hold on to a $415 million loan to help finance Blackstone Group LP’s buyout of Ulterra Drilling Technologies and now plan to wait until January to offload the debt.

&gt; These delayed transactions means the banks will have to bear the risk of the loan prices falling further, as well as costs associated with holding the debt on their balance sheet.

&gt; In some cases, private equity owners are stepping in to help get deals done.

&gt; As a lender group led by Credit Suisse Group AG struggled to find buyers for the riskiest portion of a buyout of roofing company Tecta America Corp., Canadian private equity firm Altas Partners agreed to pony up more equity rather than force the banks to sell the $100 million loan at a steep discount, people familiar with the matter said. The banks also took some pain by giving up a chunk of their fees in the process, one of the people said.

TL;DR: Banks that underwrote debt are bagholding them in order to avoid recognizing a loss if they were to sell it to the market.",finance

I am paid biweekly and only social security and Medicare come out of my paychecks. Missouri income tax and federal tax do not come out - I opted for this when I started this job May 2017 as I wouldn’t make enough to file for taxes last year, and I continued this for 2018 because I thought I wouldn’t make enough to file taxes.  
In 2018, at work, I made $7,445.57.  
  
Other pertinent information is my scholarship money from college. I live at home with my parents, so I don’t have to pay for room and board. This also means I am a dependent for my parents (they are divorced and my mom would claim me this year). In the Spring 2018 semester I received $10,460 in scholarships, $4,519.56 of that was excess and paid directly to my savings account. In the Fall 2017 semester I received $9,323 in scholarships, $3,442.10 of that was excess and paid directly to my savings.  
The money from my scholarships that was not paid to my savings was used for tuition and school fees. Part of the money paid to my savings was used for books and class required items, probably $500 over both semesters.  
  
I received $6,008 from FAFSA in the form of the Pell Grant over both semesters. I received $3,00 from Bright Flight over both semesters. I received $2,025 from the Missouri Access Grant over both semesters. I received $500 from the Federal Support Education Grant over both semesters. The other scholarships were through my college or private.  
  
To sum it up, I received $7,461.66 in excess scholarships to my savings account and $7,445.57 from work, for a grand total of $14,907.23.  
  
I don’t know if my excess scholarships are included in my taxable income, or if I have to file 2018 taxes. Any advice on understanding this and helping me out is greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance and if I’m missing any other important information, please let me know.",finance

worldpolitics,Fight for the Arctic,"Nowadays, there is a growing awareness that in the foreseeable future, the Arctic will become the main resource base of humanity. According to the latest geological survey data, the northernmost corner of the Earth is rich in everything that any country can dream of: oil, gas, precious and non-ferrous metals. In our eyes, the struggle for control over these natural resources is unfolding in the Arctic Ocean.

After the abolition of the sectoral principle of dividing the Arctic territory, each state clearly defined its sea borders in the North - 12 miles. Another 200 miles each country was ""presented"" as an ""exclusive economic zone."" That is, a given state can develop natural resources within the boundaries of this area and earn them. Everything else has become a ""common use area"".

However, the Convention on the Law of the Sea, adopted in 1982, still laid relief for the Arctic countries - they can expand the boundaries of their marine areas, if they prove that the Arctic Ocean shelf is an extension of the continental platform on which these countries are located.

From this point on, all applicants for this territory began to study the seabed. The northern states began to look for signs of kinship of their continent with the strata of rocks in the Arctic Ocean.

Russia, on the basis of international law, claims a seabed area outside the 200-mile zone in the entire Russian polar sector with the inclusion of the North Pole zone and the southern extremity of the Gakkel Ridge. This is the area of the extended continental shelf in the Arctic Ocean, which is 1.2 million km2.

In December 2001, Russia, the first of the Arctic countries, submitted to the UN Commission the first application for expanding its Arctic shelf. The rationale cited data indicating that the Mendeleev and Lomonosov ridges, located on the deep ocean, are a continuation of the Siberian continental platform. In 2002, the commission concluded that the information provided was not enough to classify the areas indicated in the application as the Russian continental shelf.

In this regard, extensive data refinement work has been carried out. Altogether, seven expeditions were carried out on the scientific ship Akademik Fedorov, as a result of which sea bottom measurements and seismic surveys were carried out, bottom sediment samples were collected from a depth of several kilometers. In particular, in August 2007, a unique scientific experiment was conducted in the North Pole area. For the first time in the history of scientific exploration of the Arctic, Russian oceanologists and polar explorers with the help of deep-sea apparatuses ""Mir"" have sunk to the bottom of the Arctic Ocean to a depth of over four thousand meters.

Scientists took samples of soil and water, took photographs and filming, and also installed a Russian titanium alloy tricolor on the ocean floor. Having studied the basalts and dolerites extracted from the bottom of the northern and southern parts of the underwater range, the scientists found that they have the same nature as the ancient base of the Novosibirsk Islands, which is an integral part of the continental shelf. The last expedition was completed in the framework of the preparation of the second application in October 2014. For the first time, scientific work was carried out in the area of ​​the Podvodnikov and Amundsen basins - beyond 200 miles.

Thus, according to scientists, the Russian application for expanding the boundaries of the continental shelf in the Arctic is based on reliable and unique data.

As a result, the repeated Russian application for expanding its borders at the expense of the continental shelf in the Arctic Ocean was submitted to the UN in 2015. The Lomonosov Ridge, the Podvodnikov Basin, the Mendeleev Rift, the Chukotka Hollow, which are a continuation of the Siberian continental platform, are mentioned here.

The main argument of Russia: a significant part of the underwater territory claimed by the country is a continuation of the continent, constituting a whole with it, there are no faults filled with oceanic crust.

Consequently, this is part of the continent, which for some reason plunged into the water, which means that the Lomonosov Ridge and the Mendeleev Ridge can be considered the territory of the Russian continental shelf. To date, the Russian application is still under consideration by the UN Commission. However, Russia has every chance that this application will be accepted.

At the same time, Norway, the United States, Canada and Denmark also claim to different parts of the Arctic Ocean, including the extended Lomonosov Ridge. At the moment, only Denmark has submitted its application for expanding the borders of the continental shelf of the Arctic, in addition to Russia. Thus, the main struggle for the shelf and the Arctic as a whole is still ahead. The Arctic race is just beginning, and the main prize is billions of barrels of oil and gas.",energy

personalfinance,Lost my Job at the beginning of december,"Let me give you a little background,

I am 29 years old with mediocre credit, I have a credit score around 520 or so...

For the first time ever in my life I lost my job involuntarily.

&amp;#x200B;

I was quite fortunate in my ability to pay Decembers rent, and I am pleased to announce I have started working again.

Problem is, I have started working in the middle of the pay period of a paycheck to be paid on 01/04. By the time I get my second check, it will be too late to pay January's rent.

&amp;#x200B;

I can already expect my Landlord (as they are a company) to move forward with eviction regardless of circumstance as soon as I am past due on rent 01/14 I anticipate them to file an eviction notice with the courts.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been seeing a lot about these ""Refund anticipation loans"" and am aware of the extremely high interest rate. And at this time am ok with being forced to pay a 30% Interest rate as my terrible credit leaves me no choice. I expect a return of around $6,000 MINUS the amount the state will be taking from me due to unpaid child support for December ($550). (I have two other children in my current household I am responsible for, and 1 that I pay child support for) .

I worried that my credit score, and my expectation of a deduction for this year will render me non-eligible for a RAC from any company. BUT I WILL HAVE A DEFICIT OF $450 in my ability to pay rent on time as I will only have less than 1 week of work under my belt.

I do not be forcibly removed from my apartment, and will lose EVERYTHING. I have already sold my entire coin collection to be able to pay the deficit in rent for December and have been working hard to make whatever I can happen.

Does anyone here have any experience with RAC services (Refund Anticipation Checks) or any other services that may assist in low credit score loans or any suggestions at all? I am depressed and feel like I have failed my household.

In addition to the down payment, they gave me 500$ off for being a recent college graduate. My mom wants to bring it down to $20k after a 3k down payment. I don't know if that is plausible even if 2019 cars are rolling in soon. Is this a good deal?  Is is plausible to bring it down? I can afford 385 a month but I would prefer to bring it down to 360.

personalfinance,"Private sector, paying loans quickly. Any reason to NOT refinance federal loan?","I have $85,000 in student loans.  I'm getting an offer to refinance to 4.8% fixed for 5 years, or variable of 4.5% for 5 years. I've taken my loans from $140K to 85K in 14 months. Currently paying $3000/month to highest interest rate and \~$600/mo for others. Overall current interest rate is about 5.5%. By rough calculations, it looks like the best case scenario of a constant variable rate of 4.5% would save me about 1 month's payment (about $3,500) for getting this extra 1% lower interest rate.  \[Edit: actually the difference is closer to just $1,500 for a constant 4.5% variable best case, and a little less than $1000 for the fixed 4.8% rate\]. We are also thinking of having a kid soon and buying a house ASAP after student loans are done, so the delta would obviously be bigger over a longer period.

&amp;#x200B;

My current loans are all federal and have the following balance and interest rates:

|$12,000|6.06%||
|:-|:-|:-|
|$35,000|5.59%||
|$21,500|5.06%||
|$16,000|5.06%||

I dont have any plans to work in a PSLF job. Any reason to not refinance?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm inclined to take the variable rate of 4.5%, given how aggressively I am in paying off the loans, with the intention of refinancing again if life turns sour. The monthly payment would be $1,600, and I'm comfortable with that if we weren't able to continue my current $3,500/month contributions.

&amp;#x200B;

**Current income:** $95,000 plus $35,000 spouse (not included in loan quote)

**Retirement Contributions:** 6% to 401K plus 5% match; $3,500 yr to HSA; $5,500 to ROTH IRA

**Savings/checking:** about $25K total for emergency, future housing fund, and ongoing expenses. I know this is high and I want to reduce, but spouse feels more secure with this amount.

**Retirement Savings:** have about $25,000 total in retirement when I last looked, but market fluctuations...

&amp;#x200B;

Our checking balance averages the same amount month to month, so we're operating at dynamic equilibrium with respect to expenses.

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,Treasury Bill vs Bank CD,"I wanted to get your opinion on treasury bills vs bank CDs. Say for example you wanted to stash $20k away for 6months. Would a 6 month treasury bill make more sense or a CD? 

Or, say you wanted to ladder it a bit and stash $10k away for 6 months and $10k away for 1 year. What would make sense then?

I guess the question comes down to the interest rate for the most part. I believe treasury bills are exempt from state tax, so does that increase their interest rate to beyond that of a CD when you factor in say a 5% income tax rate?

personalfinance,"21 - Student Loans, Saving, Investing..","Hi all,   


I'm new to reddit (actually just created my account a couple of minutes ago while at work since we have nothing to do before we go on vacation). I've been thinking about my financial planning and need advice as to what would be best for my financial status. For now, I'm only thinking about 5-7 years from now (when I'm 26-28). 

&amp;#x200B;

Some things about me: I'm 21 and live in Miami. I currently live with my parents and plan on living with them for at least 2 more years, but that could very well extend into 3-5 years as well, depending on my financial status. I'm going into my last semester of university and hopefully graduating in May 2019 with a Bachelor's in Accounting. I'm currently an intern for an accounting firm that pays $20/hour. I have about $3,100 in my MMA (2.20% Sallie Mae annual interest) and $1,900 in the stocks (I put in around $2,300 before all this crashing unfortunately). I have around $500 in my checking and owe just about $550 in credit cards at the moment (the christmas spending has been killing me but my next paycheck should be around \~$1,000). I do not plan on selling my stocks at a loss clearly so I'm holding on to them - I'm more in for the long term when it comes to the stocks.   


I'm about $24k in student-loan debt, which will increase by $39k next year when I do my Master's, so in total I'll be around $63k\~ in student loan debt. The interest rate on those loans range from 4.5%-5.5% and they're a mix of subsidized and unsubsidized, which the former being the majority type for loans.   


Once I graduate, I plan on working full-time with this firm (thankfully they've been really happy with me and they want me to stay so it's almost a guaranteed position post-graduation). I'm not too sure on the pay, I believe \~$53k starting is the lowest depending on what I choose.   


Anyway, I'm not exactly sure how to go about with my finances with these situations, like how much to save, invest, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I try to pay off my student loans as quick as possible? Should I just make the regular monthly payments they ask of me? And with the rest of my income, how much should I put in savings vs investing, or if I should even start investing now? Would really love some advice, thank you.",finance
personalfinance,Pay off credit card debt in one lump sum or large monthly payment?,"Thank you in advance for any and all advice and help, and I'm writing this on mobil so I apologize for punctuation and grammar.  Here's the situation, I am remodeling my house (additonal bedroom for newborn) and refinanced my home to do so. I have approximately 13000 in credit card debt that I have been paying on, I've never missed a payment in the last 8 years never had to pay a late fee always paid on time and more than the monthly minimum payment but would like to eliminate that debt altogether.  For the simple fact of the interest rate on my credit cards (14% APR) exceeds the interest rate of my home mortgage (5.1%) I have been paying down my home mortgage considerably over the last couple of years (6 years) and acquired a good amount Of equity in my home that I can now use for this. I guess really my question is since I pulled out additional money on my home mortgage to pay off this credit card debt should I just pay it off in one lump sum or make large monthly payments of the next 6 months until it is paid off ? also additional question, Should I contact my credit card company and ask for a discount or a write-off of certain amount or any other benefits there could be to just paying it all off at once. Again, never missed a payment nor late payments in the last 8 years so there is no debt collection or anything, just want to avoid paying more for interest if I just keep paying on the card as I have been.

For her it's easy, log onto her payroll account and change it virtually on the fly.   She did and as a result she had a nice check without seeing most of it go to Uncle Sam.

personalfinance,Can anyone provide a convincing argument why anyone should have checking or savings accounts at a large bank rather than at a local bank or credit union?,"In college (almost two decades ago), I banked at Bank of America. The justification was that there would always be a branch no matter where I traveled. I was still with Bank of America when I got my first real job. Soon after, I saw a banner ad for a local bank that offered 4.0% interest on a checking account. This was better than the 0.0% that I was receiving on BoA. Further, the local bank had a branch across the street from BoA in my hometown. I went to the BoA bank and asked if there was any good reason why I should keep my money there in light of the offer across the street. There wasn't even an attempt to sell me on remaining a BoA customer. I opened a new account at the local bank that day and kept that account for over a decade. Needless to say, that 4.0% interest rate dropped to 0.75% (Great Recession, among other things), but that was still better than the 0.0% I was receiving as a BoA customer.

&amp;#x200B;

I have another checking account at another local bank (2.25% on a checking account), and earlier this week, I had to get a cashier's check. I got that account almost ten years ago and kept it even when I moved thirty minutes away. My current hometown doesn't have any branches of that bank, but with ATM refunds and direct deposit for most of my checks, I didn't need a local branch. However, I actually had to go there to get the cashier's check. But I had a delightful experience. When the teller asked for my ID, the branch manager (whose desk was about ten feet away) said, ""Don't worry about it. We know who he is.""

stocks,This Point in History: Birth of the Federal Reserve,"Hey everyone, I’m here today for another This Point in History post. This is post number 3 of our subreddit’s series that covers historic and important events involving the stock market. To read two previous posts, click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9uoo27/this_point_in_history/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/9xccw9/this_point_in_history_enrons_bombshell/). A quick reminder that the goal of these posts are to highlight important events involving the stock market and economy. Please note that because of timing constraints, limited topics, and how these events can play out over the course of days or weeks, these posts are a little different from a This Day in History post in that the posts don’t always fall on the same day of the event. I would also like to give credit once again to Wikipedia and a few sites out there dealing with history of the markets. With that said, let’s begin.


Interest rates and the Federal Reserve are both hot topics in today’s market and the timing of this post perhaps couldn’t be better. On December 23, 1913 the birth of the US Federal Reserve occurred, a financial banking system that oversees and helps regulates the US financial sector. Regardless of how one feels about it, the Federal Reserve plays a critical role in the stock market and economy.


So how did the Federal Reserve come to be? Well, let’s go back to nearly a decade before in the leadup to the Great Panic of 1907. I already covered the event in a previous post but to sum things up fast, between 1905 up until 1907 the US saw tensions mount and confidence drop in the state of the US economy and banking system. Americans felt great uncertainty in the strength of its country’s currency, banking system, and stock market leading to a devastating crisis in 1907. The year saw bank runs, bankruptcy of massive companies and banks, market liquidity issues, and the NYSE fell nearly 50%.


If it wasn’t for creative government maneuvering and the help of wealthy, powerful individuals such JP Morgan, things may have turned far worse. The US managed to fight its way out of the crisis with things wrapping up by the end of the year yet it was clear things needed to change. Regulation and better monetary control was desperately needed so in 1908 the US government created the National Monetary Commission along with the Aldrich-Vreeland Act with its intended goal to study the US market and US banking system to determine means of improving things. Things didn’t go quite so smoothly with some feeling the NMC and Aldrich-Vreeland Act being sufficient but after years of bickering between banking reps, wealthy businessmen, and members congress the Federal Reserve Act was voted into effect by the House on December 22, 1913. A day later, the senate would vote in favor for the act as well with President Woodrow Wilson sealing the deal that December 23, 1913.


While the US Federal Reserve serves numerous functions, the primarily ones are controlling inflation, minimizing unemployment, preventing bank panics, aiding in the regulation of banks, studying banking and market conditions/trends, and serving as a central bank for the country.


Today there are 12 Federal Reserve bank locations within the United States with Jerome Powell acting as the organization’s chairman. What makes the Federal Reserve particularly unique is the fact that it acts more or less independent from the government despite not being a private company/organization and is not funded by the general public. The matter is fairly complicated and I can’t really do it justice in a few paragraphs but how the Federal Reserve works with, rather than within, the US government is certainly interesting and worth reading about if you have time.


Right now things are a little shaky and volatile with the stock market. After nearly a decade of low interest rates, the Federal Reserve has begun to slowly increase rates which has been met with criticism and volatility from the markets. Whether it’s the right move or if the criticism is justified is a topic for another day but I think most people appreciate having an institution like the Federal Reserve around today.


How do you guys feel about the Federal Reserve? Is it the best system our country can realistically have or could it be improved? Do investors place too much emphasis and weight on rates?",finance
Bitcoin,Privacy over price: why I embrace the bear market - and why today's difficulty in being able to buy Bitcoin privately is only the more reason that Bitcoin is sorely needed.,"New users to Bitcoin often either complain about how difficult it is to buy Bitcoin privately and claim that is a huge roadblock to mass adoption, or they blindly use a KYC-compliant exchange and claim they are interested in Bitcoin only for apolitical reasons unrelated to ""libertarian views"" and are ""fine with losing privacy"".

&amp;#x200B;

If anything, the fact that Bitcoin has attracted (and continues to attract) people who don't care about these principles of autonomy, self-sovereignty, freedom, privacy, is evidence that mass adoption is actually happening. Because the masses are fine with the 2008 banking bailouts, fine with electing Donald Trump (or potentially Hilary Clinton) as president, fine with Facebook selling their private information, fine with the Federal Reserve, fine with all the nasty stuff government agencies are doing every day, fine with giving up all their power -- as long as they make some money off their ""investment"" while doing it.

&amp;#x200B;

And if anything, the bear market has been a great purge of exactly those people - who bought a pile of coins from Coinbase (whilst giving away their privacy) and after a disappointing year of not watching $20k become the promised $200k they are finally capitulating, abandoning their ""investment"". Speculation, pure and simple. And typically, these are the same people who want Bitcoin to grow at any cost, loss of decentralization be dammed, loss of privacy be dammed, loss of everything Bitcoin stands for be dammed, as long as \*they make money\*. They are loud, complain a lot, and so very irritating. And accordingly, the ""crypto space"" has now been through the toils of greed - from speculation, to dishonest name-stealing hard forks, to ICO-scams, to whatever else has happened in 2017 and 2018. These have imploded or continue to implode. 

&amp;#x200B;

But those implosions are not to be confused with the change in BTC's price. This ""bear market"" is a cleansing of pure, non-committed speculators.

&amp;#x200B;

With some bittersweetness as someone who owns BTC, I feel like a ""greed purge"" is exactly the medicine the doctor ordered for Bitcoin. And we can get back on track, focusing on improving the technology, and educating people about why Bitcoin exists, why it's needed, and remind everyone that it's great purpose was to be useful, not to make you rich.

&amp;#x200B;

Every crash seems to be a reminder of ignorance. Whether it's blind speculation, trusting a 3rd party exchange like MtGox, or being swayed by contentious hard forks. And it won't be the last time there will be a crash-of-ignorance because it's clear to me that with mass adoption will come mass ignorance too. I don't mean this in an offensive manner, because I was just as ignorant as anyone about the nastyness of the banking cartel and the industrial military complex. But I learned, and it gave me all the reason I needed to want Bitcoin -- no, to NEED Bitcoin. Mark my words, the IRS and SEC and FBI are all putting the infrastructure in place working with players like Coinbase, BitPay, Gemini, and other well-polished compliant sites to make a lot of mass adopter lives completely miserable. And it won't be fair. And this misery will come with yet another price crash - maybe from $200k back down to a mere $60k. Who knows, but it will again be a reminder of why we need Bitcoin. Why privacy matters. Why freedom of financial exchange is as important as freedom of speech.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm excited about Bitcoin's future in 2019, and I hope that we can change the profile of the typical buyer to be those who feel that Bitcoin has a purpose far beyond ""buying coffee at Starbucks"" because nobody is claiming that it is hard to buy coffee at Starbucks. It's never been easier. The hodlers-of-principle are the ones who don't ever need to be reminded to hodl, because the daily turmoil and rage that comes from the wasteland of the banking cartel is sufficient. They buy Bitcoin in a way that the price will not go back down. They know that the forces bent on the destruction of Bitcoin (if not by name, then by how it is ""allowed to be used, by permission of government"") are highly active in this financial war. But will not back down to these thieves of money, privacy, and life.",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin maximalism is best described by Ammous Saifedean, author of ""The Bitcoin Standard""

Relevant considerations:

- How much altcoin investment is fueled by speculation (not active use)? Most if not all.

- What are valid use cases of ""blockchain""? Store of value, that's it.

- How many blockchains can exist long term for this use case, store of value? Only one, along with special purpose sidechains/layers (anonymity, LN, etc)

I’ll have about $2000 extra at my disposal. I owe 800 in back taxes to the IRS for 2017 (miscalculated my allowances) and I also have an almost maxed credit card ~2300 that I’d like to pay off before the introductory APR runs out in May and goes up to 17%. It’s my understanding that the interest rate for back taxes to the IRS is 5%.

personalfinance,"What is a better option for immediate debt relief: a personal loan from my banking institution (low interest rate), a 401K early withdrawal, or something else I do not know about.","Long story short, I am in some serious debt. Behind on credit card payments, school loans and now getting close to missing rent. How I got into this mess is a combination of several things: I had a medical emergency last year that I am still recovering from both physically and financially, I was way too aggressive with my school loan repayment schedule and was making monthly payments that were unsustainable. 

What I do have is a plan for managing debt from this point forward: I am moving into a cheaper apartment, selling my car (one less monthly payment), and I am in the process of refinancing my school loans to make them sustainable. I have sat down long and hard and made sure that once all of these things happen I will be in the green on a month-month basis. 

This doesn’t change the fact that right now, at the moment, I am very much in the red and I need help before I end up paying off credit card interest for the next few decades. Due to my unsustainable finances the last year I have had to over rely on credit. What are my best options for immediately paying the cards off: 

A low interest personal loan from a bank I trust

An early withdrawal from my 401k. I have about 40k in there, and I’d only need to take out a fraction of it to help myself out. However, I have heard horror stories about early withdrawal penalties and taxes. Also, I won’t be able to make contributions towards my plan for 6 months after. 

Another option I have not thought of.

investing,Did or will the advent of electronic money have an impact on inflation?,"Growing up I was taught that inflation was caused when the Fed printed money faster than economic growth occurred. Therefore the actual “value” of the dollar went down, which in turn caused producers to ask for more dollars in order to get the true value for their good when an exchange was made. The net result being that things “costed more,” i.e. required more dollars to obtain.

If society is switching over to electronic money, possibly one day only electronic money, will this affect inflation at all? Or will the “printing money” of days past just turn into the Fed adding more 0’s to their budget electronically and having the same economic effect.",finance
personalfinance,"Student loans, Majors, and Future with Chronic Illness","Hi, 
I’m not sure if I’m in a unique or just hard to google situation but I could really use some advice or help. 

Tl;dr: I have a frustrating amount of medical issues, have a difficult time balancing them and school as full time biomedical student. How screwed will I be if I have to leave that school to return home and start on entire other degree if already in $21,000 student loan debt. 



School Background: Have completed a year and a half at a 4 year university in biomedical engineering before taking a year of medical leave. I’m supposed to go back in January since after 1 year of medical leave the school will not keep giving you scholarships. I’m typically a straight A student. 35 ACT, 4.0 GPA in college atm, and took multiple AP’s so even though I’ve only had 1.5 years at a 4 year I have the credits of a junior. 

Medical background: Diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) in high school which can cause random flare up and chronic pain. With this, I have physical limitations due to wrist dislocations any d many other joint problems. Also dx’d with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia and Orthostatic Hypotension which cause fainting if I stand for too long or get up too suddenly, I take medicine that helps somewhat. In the last year of medical leave I have been diagnosed with the following: hip labrum tear from EDS and had surgery in June, Moderate Obstructive Sleep apnea and use a cpap, Laryngealmolecia (larynx randomly collapses due to EDS), Narcolepsy with excessive daytime sleepiness and I’m still trying to find medication that works, Vivid dreams that occassionally cause trouble differentiating between memories/ reality and dreams, carpal tunnel and had surgery within the last month.

Currently: 
I’ve had random blurry/double vision and doctors just found a lesion on my brain stem a week ago indicative of multiple sclerosis (ms). As you can imagine not only has my anxiety been through the roof, but random blurry vision along with everything else is not conducive to being a full time engineering student in a city 3 hours from home where it’s an 1.5 hour round trip for a single doctor appointment. 

Financially: I have $4,300 in a private student loan with variable interest rate at discover currently making $25 monthly payments. 
I also have about $17,000 of student loans from the US government mixed between subsidized and unsubsidized stafford loans. I am unable to have a job and go to school full time due to medical issues I just can’t fit that much into a day. I live with my Dad during breaks so far and in a dorm during school (cost covered by those loans and scholarships). My dad is generous enough to give me $50 a month, half of which pays the $25 private loan and the rest goes to savings or buying medication for said illnesses. I don’t have a car either. 

Questions: 

1. If I don’t return to my 4 year school in the city in January I lose scholarships and won’t be able to return. I can take classes for free at my local community college but have completed most core classes anyway. The local state school where I could live at home while attending does not accept transfers for Biomedical engineering, is competitive in most any STEM majors, and is unlikely to give scholarships. Would not attending my 4-year university this semester and having wasted most of $21,000 in a major that won’t transfer and have to complete 2-3 more years at the local state school in a different major be detrimental to me financially in the long term?

2. For anyone familiar with STEM or engineering: I have been unable to complete an internship / co-op due to all of my medical issues popping up or needing surgeries during breaks. I’m at a disadvantage since I have to dedicate so much time to managing health issues that most other candidates spend doing research, internships, co-ops, or working. I am worried about my ability to be hired after graduating. 

3. Does biomedical engineering sound like a plausible path anymore? I need a job with flexibility to go to appointments, have some physical limitations, a ton of uncertainty on what MS may bring vision or weakness wise, and have limited funds to get though school for this. If not a good idea, any plausible similar ideas?",finance

personalfinance,"Put away money for grad school, or max Roth IRA first?","Hello! Longtime lurker, first time poster.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 22 and am in my first job out of college in a high COL city and a high-tax state. After taxes, I bring home about $3200 a month. $800 of that goes into savings, and the rest goes towards my living expenses. I have no debt whatsoever: no student loans, no car, and credit card gets paid off in full every month.

&amp;#x200B;

So far, I've been putting all of my monthly savings into a Capital One savings account with a 1% interest rate in order to build an emergency fund. I now have about $17K in that account. I know I should start saving for retirement, but I'm not eligible for my employer's 401K for another six months. Therefore, it seems that my best option would be to open a Roth IRA.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I also am considering going to grad school in the next 2-3 years, and I'd like to save as much as I can since I'll be paying for that all on my own. Therefore, my questions are:

1. Should I prioritize maxing out an IRA before saving for grad school, or keep putting everything in a savings account for grad school?
2. Would it be a good idea to max out my IRA immediately with one lump sum (using some of that $17K I already have in savings), or max it gradually by diverting my $800 in monthly savings to the IRA?
3. If I am going to keep putting money into savings for grad school every month, would it make sense to open a 529 for myself rather than continuing to put it in a regular savings account?

We are deprioritizing a house at the moment and so have some funds available (i.e. down payment money) in savings that can go to covering the cost of graduate school (we're both frugal people and would likely to continue working during school as much as possible). The point is, we CAN pay cash for this education.

That said, I'm wondering what the smart thing to do is, with the goal being to make sure we're taking advantage of any big tax (or other) savings available. That said, I'm not sure if there is really all that much to really do. For example:

1. I do NOT think that a 529 plan really makes much sense, as it doesn't offer much tax savings
2.

CryptoMarkets,Best Cryptos to Invest in the Year 2019,"Looking back in recent history, it seems as though big investors and financial organizations are changing their attitudes towards Bitcoin and altcoins. The media coverage worldwide illuminated the vast returns being had in the cryptocurrency markets, with many coins up over 100x since their conception. This certainly has garnered the attention from both legacy and newcomer investors. Currently, everyone is waiting to see if cryptocurrencies can continue on their path to new all time highs.

2017 turned out to be a whirlwind year, with most cryptocurrencies soaring to new all time highs at the end of 2017 and early 2018. The media coverage of cryptocurrencies was nonstop, with news reports on financial programs almost daily. In addition, many movies and tv shows mentioned cryptocurrency, including the technology oriented show “Silicon Valley.” So far, 2018 has seen a vast pullback in the cryptocurrency markets. Many of the smaller altcoins are down over 90% with Bitcoin, the crypto leader, still being down over 60% from all time highs.

[Even with the overall market pullback, many investors are still very bullish on cryptocurrencies going into 2019. Many big name institutions are jumping head first into crypto, with NYSE announcing a new crypto exchange, BAAKT. Also Fidelity has announced a crypto support platform for their customers. Even legendary Ivy league university Yale has announced a new 400 million dollar investment fund geared towards cryptocurrency.](https://kinesis.money/en)

With so much bullish news adding up rapidly, almost everyone seems to expect a very profitable year for crypto leading into 2019. While Bitcoin is still currently the market leader there are also some big name altcoins that expect 2019 to be a huge year for them.

__The Altcoin Hierarchy__

[Before investing in the crypto market, let us go through the basic classes of cryptocurrencies that exist in the market. While every class has the potential to have impressive returns, some coins have more impressive use cases and concepts, In addition to more qualified and funded development teams. Simply put, not all altcoins were created the same.](https://kinesis.money/en)

__The Penny Stocks of Crypto__

These are the bottom tier altcoins that could possibly become worthless in the near future. They operate much like penny stocks, advertising big promises of ‘guaranteed gains’. Eventually, many fail to offer a fraction of their promised returns. One of the ways to identify these is to look at their team members, their past experiences, objectives of the project, probability of mass adoption, actual use of the coins and many more.

The reasons for their failure is usually because of unwillingness to work for the vision they once promised in the first place, bad wealth management, inclusion of scammers in their team, unrealistic expectation from the project and also making money via pump and dump schemes.

Some of these coins are Trumpcoin, Russia Coin and Verge.

__Average Coins__

According to the ‘coinmarketcap’ website, there are currently more than 2000 cryptocurrencies listed on their website. Among those, there are around 500 of them that can be considered in this ‘average’ category.

These are the coins that do have a purpose/objective to work on but fail to maintain a good development team. They and their coins don’t really have any kind of purpose in the crypto market and fail to finalize any kind of legitimate deals and partnerships with good investors. This makes their performance very limited as compared to other altcoins in the market.

Some of these coins are Deep Brain Chain, Funfair, Decred, Navcoin, Populous, Cryptonex.

__Good Coins__

There are around 500 of such good coins in the market that do offer a good objective for the project, a solid team with good experience to execute such tasks, a good marketing strategy to reach out to masses to share their ideas and quality contacts to make some good partnerships in the market.

The only reason why they are only classified as ‘good coins’ is due to the lack of uniqueness that the other ‘very good coins’ offer. They don’t really have that ‘point of parity’ in their project/product that separates them from their counterparts.

Some of these coins are NEM, Stratis, Monero, and BAT.

__Very Good Coins__

There are around 100 such ‘very good coins’ in the market. Their objectives are well defined with a solid team to execute their tasks perfectly. Along with that, their marketing teams are also well-qualified to make their ideas reach to the masses. Because of such a wonderful blend, they are able to make better and strong partnerships with a number of good companies.

What separates them from the ‘Good Coins’ category is their USPs (Unique Selling Points). They are unique in what they do and that’s what makes the difference.

Such coins are NEO, Stellar, Cardano, Ripple

__Top Tier Cryptocurrencies__

These are the top tier coins that provide the best functionalities. They have real-world usage, objectives to solve a real-world problem, strong fundamental teams to execute the mission of the project, marketing teams to spread the ‘idea’ and collaboration with a number of media channels to gain early investors.

Also, due to a good PR team, they are able to make a very strong partnership with a lot of Fortune 500 companies that give them an extra edge over rest of the projects in the market.

Some of these coins are VeChain, Ethereum, Bitcoin, IOTA, Icon, EOS, Kinesis.

__Promising Projects Going Into the New Year__

With more than 2000 cryptocurrencies out there in the crypto market, only a couple 100 of them qualify to be a top tier investment. It can be quite the challenge to find a worthy project among the thousands of choices. These next projects are some that show a lot of promise heading into 2019.

Always remember the 3’S’ of the investment – Sane, Smart and Sensible. An investor who is sane, smart and sensible will always look into the facts before he invests in any business or project.

__Kinesis__

This is one of the most promising upcoming projects in crypto. The broad overview of the coin is to offer an alternate and better evolutionary step beyond the basic monetary and banking system available today.

In short, it is a cryptocurrency that is backed by precious metals like gold and silver. According to the CEO of the company, Thomas Coughlin, the Kinesis coin is basically divisible units of allocated gold and silver which you can use as a currency.

There will be two stable Kinesis coins in the market backed by Gold and Silver. The stable Kinesis coins backed by Gold will be tagged as KAU and the stable Kinesis coins backed by Silver will be tagged as KAG.

These stablecoins backed by the precious metals like Gold and Silver are real game changers as these 2 precious metals are definable stores of value for use in trade and investment in the real-world economies.

The Kinesis coin is based on the Bespoke Blockchain Technology, a blockchain network forked off from the Stellar Blockchain Technology in order to suit the requirements of the Kinesis coin.

The cryptocurrency project is headed by Thomas Coughlin who is also the CEO of the Kinesis company. He has 15 years experience in the investment, funds management and capital markets. Before being the CEO of the Kinesis company, he held similar positions for the Bullion Capital and TRAC Financial Group as well.

Apart from Thomas Coughlin, there are other great members in the team as well. Their team consists of people like:

Michael Coughlin, Chief Financial Officer, having 41 years experience as a CPA in the accountancy and financial services professions.

Eric Maine, Chief Strategy Officer, having more than 30 years experience in Senior Management in the exchange and financial markets.

Ryan Case, Head of Sales &amp; Trading in Kinesis, having extensive experience as Head of sales trading &amp; partnership and also valuable experience in commodity, cryptocurrency, forex and derivative markets.

Jai Bifulco, Chief Marketing Officer, having a full-fledged 12 years of experience in award-winning full-stack marketer in Finance. He previously held roles of directors in multiple brokerages, consulting and Fintech sectors.

There are more than 30 different team members in this project spanning their roles from The Executive Committee to the Advisory Board to the Operations and Development team.

The coins are very limited in number as compared to other cryptocurrencies where the softcap is limited to just 15,000 KVT coins and HardCap is limited to 300,000 KVT coins. Minimum token that one can buy is set to 1 KVT which is equal to $1000.

So far, more than 57,000 KVT tokens have been sold which roughly equals to a whopping sum of $57 Million. With such a huge investment already deployed for the development of the project, there are still 30 more days left for the ICO sale period to end.

Also, apart from the investments gained, the Kinesis cryptocurrency is also focusing much on the partnerships with the top companies in the industry. These include companies like ABX (Allocated Bullion Exchange), MLG (Blockchain Consulting), Sigma Prime, Etherlabs and Fine Metal Asia Limited.

This cryptocurrency is certainly the one to watch out for in 2019.

__VeChain__

Broad Overview – In simple layman terminology, Vechain is a supply chain protocol to track logistics inventory. It has successfully implemented blockchain technology in various sectors like agriculture and industries like luxury goods and liquor.

They basically strive to solve real-life problems by providing solutions in various industries like:

Logistics: In this sector, VeChain implements the blockchain technology to improve the flow of information from one department to another by breaking silos yet maintaining the data privacy of every department.
Government: There are more than 111 VeChain nodes deployed worldwide. The municipal governments participate in the VeChain blockchain network as nodes. The VeChain blockchain network offers decentralization and immunity against the data hacking that allows room for transparent information exchange. This indeed improves the efficiency of the municipal governments.
The technologies used to track the logistics are:

Assigning digital identities to physical stocks that can be stored on the VeChain blockchain network
Usage of RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)
NFC (Near Field Communication)
Proof Of Authority Consensus
In-House Temperature Controlled Tracking
Quick Response Codes (QR Codes)
The future potential of the VeChain cryptocurrency looks quite promising as the coin is signing new partnerships every month or so. Some of its partners are PricewaterhouseCoopers, DNV GL, Renault Group, KUEHNE + NAGEL, D.I.G, China Unicom and the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration of China.

Every single company with whom VeChain partnered has millions of customers that will use the VeChain technology embedded in their system. This makes the coin solve real-life problems and have mass adoption.

VeChain indeed makes a big difference in the logistics business. However, given the kind of turmoil that the entire cryptomarket is facing where the total market capitalization has fallen from $800 Billion to just around $200 Billion, no one can give any kind of assurance on the returns in your investment in the crypto assets. However, stablecoins like Kinesis has a reward yield system that incentivizes its investors for holding, depositing and also referring new users. Hence, the investors always stay on the benefit side even if the market collapses for a short duration.

__IOTA__

In simple terms, IOTA is a cryptocurrency which is designed for the Internet of Things. The cryptocurrency was developed to root a new direction to IoT by establishing a standardization called, ‘Ledger of Everything’ which means that the data exchange between sensor-equipped machines would be enabled to populate IoT.

IOTA has the potential to make transactions easy. A basic use case of IOTA can be seen in IOTA enabled vending machines. These machines can dispense the items without involving the associated transaction costs. Some other use cases of IOTA are Reddit Chains etc.

Technology Behind IOTA
Surprisingly, IOTA does not use the traditional Blockchain technology for its design and development. In fact, a new platform called ‘Tangle Technology’ is being used for IOTA to operate on. The Tangle Technology deploys a mathematical concept called Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) which resolves both the scalability and transaction fees issues which we face in blockchain based cryptocurrencies.

In IOTA, for a transaction to be valid, each node present in DAG Tangle must approve the previous two transactions occurring at the other node. And adding to a note, this process removes the chances of mining and makes the system fully decentralized.

Future Potential
Keeping in mind the remarkable result of IOTA, there exists a promising scope for it in the near future in various applications and platforms. IOTA would be standing tall and different in the future world full of cryptocurrencies vulnerable to quantum computers. IOTA has a lot of companies that it is working with. Some of them include Bosch, Volkswagen,Fujitsu, Accenture, Poyry and many more.

When viewed from a macro perspective, so far IOTA looks to be fee-less, scalable and fast which makes it next to perfect. However, if you own IOTA, the chances of you liquidating it into fiat currency via a ‘debit card’ and buying something from a grocery store is quite low. In order to fill this gap of actually buying something from the street market and becoming the global currency, Kinesis has introduced its Kinesis Debit Cards that enables the Kinesis token holders to exchange their tokens against FIAT currency and simultaneously buy products from a grocery shop, something which IOTA fails to offer.

__ICON ICX__

Broad Overview:
ICON is a South Korean based company that develops blockchain technology and accompanies the cryptocurrency called ‘ICX’. ICON is a network framework which has been designed to allow independent blockchains to interact with each other. It allows interconnected blockchain networks to participate in a decentralized system which converges at a central point.

Technology:
ICX token is built on the Ethereum blockchain network. ICON has developed a loop-chain platform that connects different blockchain communities through the ICON Republic which serves as the governing head for the Federation of other independent blockchain bodies.

All the communities are linked to Republic through C-Reps (Community Representatives) which then connects to Nexus. C-Reps functions as the portals to the communities to establish a connection with Nexus. And this way the entire procedure is carried out.

Future Scope:
It is believed that ICON has plans to provide platforms to financial, security, insurance, healthcare, educational industries which can help them to carry transactions on a single network. Thus, ICON (ICX) can be seen having a good time in the coming days.

Also, it has been successful in signing a partnership deal with the tech-giant Samsung where it will be using ICON’s own Chain ID for a new Samsung project called ‘Samsung Pass’. Apart from Samsung, ICON has also signed deals with PORTAL NETWORK &amp; W Foundation.

However, it is notable that ICON is built on the Ethereum network and is an ERC20 token. Hence, the transaction speed greatly depends on the Ethereum network. Currently, Ethereum can execute 15 transactions per second which is quite low in terms of what ICON (ICX) is currently aiming for. However, to fill this gap, we have Kinesis Bespoke Technology that offers a whopping speed of 3000 transactions per second. This lightning fast speed keeps the Kinesis token way ahead than ICX token.

__Enjin__

Broad Overview
The native cryptocurrency of the Enjin Network, the Enjin Coin (popularly known as only ENJ) follows the ERC20 token standard and is used with a smart contract-based blockchain platform. Its typical users include content creators, game developers, and other members of the gaming community, who need to use virtual tokens to manage and trade virtual goods in the gaming world.

Technology behind Enjin
As an ERC20-compliant token, the ENJ functions in accordance with the rules an Ethereum contract has to implement. It is used on a dedicated platform that is designed to support open-source software development kits (SDKs), applications, plug-ins, and payment gateways. As for its users, they will be able to efficiently participate in developing, launching, managing, and trade content and game-related products on the Enjin Network, without having to deal with the technical complexities.

Summary of Potential
The ENJ is expected to solve some performance issues in using similar cryptocurrencies on the market today, including payment frauds where goods are not actually delivered, slow transaction processes, lack of ownership of virtual goods, lack of transaction standards, and centralization problems.

According to its creators, the ENJ coin, which is based on a blockchain, will create a distributed, trustworthy, and secure framework where transactions can be executed smoothly and quickly with minimal transaction fees. Its autonomous and decentralized system will ensure that all offers and deals will be honored.

Conclusion
Generally speaking, the Enjin Coin is good. It helps bring the benefits of blockchain to millions of people participating in the virtual goods market. Its creators are working hard to prevent fraud in the gaming world.

However, it is still a relatively new project. As such, it is still volatile. This means that you still have to take utmost care and be wise when using it.

__EOS__

Broad Overview
EOS is considered by many people who are participating in the virtual goods market as one of the best cryptocurrencies to use, supported by a powerful infrastructure for decentralized applications. Basically, the EOS blockchain is used for the development, execution, and hosting of decentralized applications (dApps) that are traded virtually.

Technology behind EOS
The EOS system is composed of two key components, which are the EOS.IO and the EOS token. As for the former, it functions like a computer’s operating system in managing and controlling the EOS blockchain, with the use of an architecture that enables horizontal and vertical dApps. As for the latter, it is held (instead of spent) by the users to be able to become eligible of building, running, and trading apps, as well as using EOS network resources.

While EOS still does not have an official full form, it supports all core functionalities to allow individuals and businesses to create and trade blockchain-based apps.

It also runs on a web toolkit for interface development, just like Apple’s App Store and Google Play Store.

Summary of Potential
While there are already a lot of cryptocurrencies based on Ethereum similar to it, the EOS system focuses on the critical and problematic points of the blockchain. Specifically, it attempts to solve the problems of scalability, speed, and flexibility that often cause transaction processes to slow down, which is a common issue in blockchain-based systems.

According to its creators, EOS.IO could also address other problems that come with the ever-increasing size of the dApps ecosystem, such as limited availability of resources, constrained networks, spamming, false transactions, and limited computing power.

It is said to be able to support thousands of commercial-scale dApps without hitting performance bottlenecks by using asynchronous communication methodologies and parallel execution across its network.

Conclusion
The EOS system is very advanced. It is designed to address common problems with standard blockchain-based networks. But like other new cryptocurrency platforms on the virtual market today, it still has some weak points to improve. Also, there is again the exposure to volatility, as users hold the tokens to be eligible to trade virtually.

__Nebulas__

Broad overview
Nebulas (NAS) is a new generation blockchain and is open for public collaborations for decentralized application (dApp) development. Its adaptability and scalability are the two characteristics that could propel NAS to be one of the top cryptocurrencies, thus giving it enough leverage to compete in the market.

Technology behind Nebulas
Nebulas is the first crypto running on a 3rd generation blockchain, thus making it the dominant player of the new platform. This makes Nebulas highly flexible and scalable, even giving a good leverage in future-proofing their code. That could help avoid hard forking whenever some issues come up during scaling processes.

Summary of potential
Adaptability, scalability and search-ability are three of the biggest potential NAS has to offer. With the 3rd generation blockchain it uses, it can allow the adaption of other codes based from Nebulas. This means that other cryptos can adapt to its platform soon enough.

Moreover, it can also act as a blockchain search engine. This can let users search particular blockchains based on efficiency and community strength.

Finally, its goal to provide fair incentives to Decentralized Application (dApp) developers is something that collaborators could expect. This means that more developers are expected to come, thus strengthening NAS even further.

Conclusion
Nebulas (NAS) is a promising crypto especially with its adaptability, scalability and search-ability potentials. It can help with the fluidity of crypto into this new generation platform. However, it still lacks the value stability that Kinesis or stablecoins hold. NAS is still unpredictable, unlike Kinesis that backs it value with real gold.

__Sky__

Broad overview
SkyCoin is a full environment system of blockchain technology, and has the goal of endorsing the actual usage of cryptocurrency.

Technology behind Sky
Sky has its own algorithm, the Obelisk, which uses the web of trust dynamics to spread influence all throughout the network to come up with a consensus decision. The consensus decision depends on each node, by valuing its influence score. The influence score of each node is determined by the number of network nodes connected to it. This depicts the importance of the node to the network.

Aside from the Obelisk, Sky also operates its own cryptocurrency which is SkyCoin, its own ICO platform Fiber, a decentralized social media platform called BBS, and a decentralized messenger called Sky-Messenger.

Summary of potential
Sky focuses its potential on being a full ecosystem of blockchain technology that encourages actual usage of crypto. Through its unique algorithm which is the Obelisk and some other dApps associated with it, Sky is a promising crypto technology and could be considered as the most complete one as of today.

Conclusion
Sky, SkyCoin and the Obelisk is definitely a massive platform that could be considered as a full ecosystem of crypto and its related technology. Nonetheless, the SkyCoin depends its value on node influence scores, which could change from time to time as well. This makes Kinesis and Stablecoins still a better choice, especially for investors who want clear investments without hassle.

__Crypto Predictions for 2019__

While 2017 had the masses captivated and investing large amounts of capital, 2018 has seen price drops and sagging hopes. While the returns in 2017 exceeded anyone’s expectations, a strong pullback was predicted by many. Whether or not this bear market continues from here is the real question many investors face today.

Bitcoin’s rapid rise and fall exposed many problems, and the developers of the top cryptocurrencies in 2019 took note. When considering your crypto investments for 2019, factor in the following trends we predict will influence investments:

More Pullbacks
According to the CEO of Vellum Capital, Eric Kovalak, the price of cryptos will reach new lows before they will rebound to new heights. This includes the biggest cryptocurrencies in the market, including Bitcoin. Kovalak believes that it will be priced below $3,500 before it will find its way back up. However, there are many mixed opinions on the current price of BTC, with some arguing the bottom for the crypto markets have already been seen.

Due to Bitcoin-based remittances, uncertainty in global economies like Asia, Turkey and Venezuela, and mobile penetration, there will be a surge in interest and the price of the digital currency.

__A Flood of Institutional Investors__

Institutional investors have been waiting on the sideline for the ETF to rule in favor of Bitcoin. According to Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Capital, once the ETF arrives, “institutional fomo’ will start flooding the market.”

Another factor is Kinesis, the investment blockchain that provides investors with a safe and reliable alternative. Pegged against precious metals, it provides protection against volatility that may be caused by political instability.

The Kinesis Monetary System lets you own real gold or silver when you purchase the digital currency. Your ownership is then digitized and then made available for spending, trading, and transfer. What is even better, the monetary system can be used internationally, ensuring reliability of money around the world.

With the recent crisis around the Turkish Lira, the price of gold has significantly increased.

Mass adoption of crypto by consumers
In January 2019, blockchain technology will be 10 years old. It remains a speculative investment to this day but 2019 could be the year of mass adoption for digital currencies.

For this to happen, however, there has to be some triggers.

Speculation should become a real utility.
People must use blockchain projects in everyday life so they will gain widespread use.
Decentralized applications (DApps) must gain mainstream status to promote widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies.
Improved payment processing, addressing the issue on the current situation of slow transaction times and high transaction fees.
Scalability of blockchain technology with little to no impact on its efficiency. To date, slow transaction times are due to the growing number of users and transaction sizes. This calls for blockchain to grow and have the ability to compete with Mastercard, PayPal, or Visa.
Introduction of off-chain solutions that allow users to complete a transaction through peer-to-peer payment channel instead of within the blockchain. This will address slow transaction times. Security will be provided by the parent blockchain.
Gold Is Still The Standard
Despite the promises and unique functions of many cryptocurrencies, there is still uncertainty in these new markets.

Gold has remained the best form of investment throughout history, and the best store of value, especially through times of crisis in politics and economies.

Kinesis pegs its value to gold which has proven to be the safest investment in history. Therefore Kinesis stands to gain from the stability gold offers while simultaneously fusing it with the unique features of this cutting edge crypto technology.

With the Kinesis Monetary System, investing in gold is no longer the slow process that many older investors are used to. This cryptocurrency is backed by gold and silver and supports precious metals trade.

It has three essential assets.

Tokens that represent an investors ownership of gold and silver.
The inherited system where performance is done.
Complete blockchain security that supports investments and paves the way for the creation of new assets protected in a banking system.
Most importantly, the Kinesis Monetary System allows thousands of transactions to be completed per second in a completely secure channel.

__The Near Future__

Even a decade later, cryptocurrencies are still very much in their infancy. At this time, no one is sure what shape this growing sector will take in the future. Many cryptocurrencies will come and go but the ones that show the most promise, that fulfill their use cases, will stick around for the long term. With any emerging technology, we have to watch how it evolves and how it merges with our everyday life, changing the way we interact with everything around us.",cryptocurrency
investing,Whose Is That Big Pile Of Corporate Debt In The Corner?,"*Global non-financial corporate debt hit record high in second quarter: IIF*

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-economy-debt/global-non-financial-corporate-debt-hit-record-high-in-second-quarter-iif-idUSKCN1NX2WH](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-economy-debt/global-non-financial-corporate-debt-hit-record-high-in-second-quarter-iif-idUSKCN1NX2WH)  


*""IIF wrote in the report that* ***one-third of small firms*** *in* ***France****, the* ***United States*** *and* ***China*** *have an interest coverage ratio under levels generally accepted as optimal, meaning a sharp hike in interest rates could hurt their* ***ability to stay current in their debt payments.****""*  


Furthermore, I couldn't find this article, since it was in my Reuters platform, but here it is;

***Whose Is That Big Pile Of Corporate Debt In The Corner?***

*The Fed's more hawkish than expected tone has triggered a selloff across markets. There's a growing feeling that further tightening of financial conditions is bad news for equity markets but also credit markets which are already looking risky.*

*TS Lombard note this morning that spreads have risen across investment-grade and high-yield debt in Europe and the U.S., reflecting ""****concerns about the high level of U.S. corporate debt and its deteriorating quality****."" One important issue is where that* ***lower-quality debt is actually held****, writes Man Group.*

*""As we head towards the end of the credit cycle, we feel it is important to consider* ***exactly who owns the $3.4 trillion of sub investment-grade corporate debt****,"" analysts at the hedge fund write.*

*That's the equivalent of Germany's GDP last year.*

*Of total sub investment-grade corporate debt, $1.1 trillion is owned by banks with the rest ($2.3 trillion) held by asset managers and institutional owners.*

*Though Man Group says they don't traditionally think of asset managers as a systemic risk, they say liquidity could dry up if sub-investment grade corporate debt drops in value.*

*Moving on down the chain of debt-derivative products, they advise investors to hone in on* ***collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) used to tranche and sell sub-IG debt****.*

*As you can see below, some of these are held by unspecified ""other investors"", according to a breakdown by the Bank of England cited by Man Group.*

*""With very little visibility in this part of the CLO market, how this ""****black hole****"" will react in the event of a downturn remains to be seen,"" the analysts conclude, ominously.*  


I posted this since I regularly see writers at this sub stating that it is buying time and that the downturns are primarily driven by mass-psychology, since the falls of October ensued.  


*(I'll see if I can find a post I wrote in October on this subject-matter, as it had some extraordinary excellent articles that expanded on this topic. If I'll find that post, it'll be posted in a separate post in this thread\*).*  


It is my opinion that this isn't the case and has been very clear right from the start, with explanatory factors relating to the increasing corporate debt sectors as major risk-factors.

I believe the ensuing yield-curve inversion is a reflection of these realizations, and that the current geopolitical battle between the U.S and China in terms of the trade-war, won't have a positive impact *even* ***if*** there is a mutually beneficial trade-deal between the U.S. and China.  


If there'd be a deal, there'd be a ""***sell the news***"" event, since it would be overshadowed by other factors trumping that initial stint of optimism.  


If we see a severe deterioration in debt-servicing by companies and fundamental indicators in the U.S. such as corporate profits declining and interest rates rising further we're going to see this spreading to Europe too via the derivatives exposures of banks.  


It is furthermore a matter of time before wages start eating into corporate profits in the U.S. as demonstrated by the record-lows of unemployment, which is an additional burdening factor coupled with rising interest costs.  


Personally, I have only traded short positions ever since the ViX began its ascent since October this year, due to these underlying factors.  


I believe this will escalate further, and we'll see continuing drops until at least Q2 of 2019, and thus continue shorting.  
   
It'll reverse when the FED comes in and tries to save the party *(as usual\*),* via loosening monetary policy or if there is a debt-crisis, a deleveraging of restructuring has occurred.",finance

stocks,Is the Fed engineering a correction?,"I posted this as a comment on a different thread and I thought that perhaps it would inspire a discussion/correction if I made it its own post. I made a few edits to the original text in the comment... here goes:

Here’s an opinion from me; I’m not an expert, but I’ve been investing and day-trading profitably for a few years. I am trying to learn and be more analytical so that I can get better at this.

It is my opinion that we may be in a small bubble. Due to the recent changes in tax legislation, the way that public companies report profits has been affected in such a way that it makes it SEEM that profits are soaring when in fact they may have remained consistent with historic growth rates and in some cases even declined when viewed through previous accounting/reporting practices.

It seems to me that a big section of the market is overextended due in great part to the hype created by these fictitiously “record” profits that are being posted. I speculate that small investors, perhaps even unaware of these changes in legislation, are fundamentally overvaluing and making bigger bets on these companies than they should. Others that may be aware of the changes may just be riding the hype fully knowing that it’s a bubble.

Could it be that the Fed is deliberately engineering a correction to prevent a larger crash/recession down the road?

I welcome all your criticism and corrections if my line of reasoning is wrong.

Thank you.",finance
CryptoCurrency,End the FED : Some thoughts about the present day financial system,"Have you been watching the financial systems the past couple of weeks?

One bank, the FED, decided to crash the markets because there's too much money floating around.

The markets do not fluctuate according to value, production, supply/demand, nothing in the fundamentals of capitalism. The markets fluctuate because the FED decides to print more money or to soak money from the markets.

This distortion is taken to be normally right now, but it is not normal at all.

In 2008 banks collapsed because they were (surprise!) stealing from all of us. President W. Bush saved the banks through bailouts. YOU paid for the banks' corrupt practices.

Since 2008, nothing was done to change what happened in 2008. The FED simply began to print money day and night, creating massive debt.

What do we have in the world right now? Debt. For instance: [""$250 Trillion in Debt: the World’s Post-Lehman Legacy""](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-lehman-debt/)

Do you realize that $250 trillion is impossible to pay? It's money that will NEVER go back to the creditors. It's fake money, virtual money, call it what you will. The FED printed all this fake money for bankers to lend. This money is equivalent to decades of the US gross domestic product. No entity on this planet could pay this. This debt will be rolled over endlessly.... They keep printing more and more debt, rolling this debt, and this money is basically virtual money. They call it debt because it's convenient, but what this is is fake printed money that someone (not you) received almost for free.

Here's a case for those who've never thought about fractional reserve banking: do you realize that if a large bank that moves billions of U$ per day simply ""invents"" 1 million dollars, that they'll likely never be caught? Especially if they have a branch in some unregulated tax haven. If a large bank transfers 1.001 billion or 1.000 billion, it's the same. The chances of this being caught are near zero. Banks can generate money out of thin air provided that they have enough volume. 

This is the financial system everyone is living in. Millenials can barely afford college. Back in 1980 you'd graduate and buy a home and a car in your first couple years. Now you will work 30+ years to pay banks. 

The present day financial system is broken. The markets are rigged (no it's not a conspiracy, they really are rigged).

What the FED did this week is all you need to witness first person to see how things work. The FED printed 200+ trillion dollars for bankers and now decides they will crash the markets. 

The FED can make or break a US President, the FED can simply make your savings worth nothing, the FED can print 1 trillion dollars out of thin air and give it to bankers for 3% a year while they lend it to you for 10% a year. 

I believe cryptocurrency is the closest we've come to a system that can produce money via an algorithm which cannot be tampered with. You cannot print cryptocurrency for your banking buddies and that's the real reason the banks fear cryptos.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Should I be paying off my student loan? (UK),"So as far as I've always been aware since the new 9k+ a year costs came about, and with the interest ever rising, the best advice is usually to not pay back your student loan because realistically, you're not going to pay it off. However, I am very aware if you start off in a well paid job and expect it to increase in salary you should consider otherwise.

I finished uni this summer, and within 6 weeks I began working in a software engineering role at 28k a year. A couple months ago they increased the grad scheme to begin at 30k so already a payrise. Then every 6 months I get a 1,250 increase for the first 2 years minimum (more would depend on end of year reviews). The promotion system determines most people get promoted by the 2 year mark (which I am on track for). This will be a guaranteed 40k a year minimum.

After a conversation with a colleague  going for promotion the next couple months. He mentioned he's trying to pay off his student loan, but he also commutes from London so it's much less realistic for him to buy a house anyway. I plan on moving back north and buying a house up there(will be setting up a help to buy isa in the next few months).

Therefore, I'm wondering with the mad interest rates right now, and knowing I will be getting significant payrises in future (unless catastrophe strikes ofc), is it worth me paying off my student loan? and if so how much by? My colleague pays off around £600 a month. But I pay £600 a month on rent and then another £250ish on bills and council tax. Or am I better using those savings for a house like I originally planned.

**TLDR: On a 30k salary that will probably increase to 40k in 2 years, is it worth paying back my current 45k ever increasing student loan.**",finance

personalfinance,Federal withholding jumped $1k this month,"Hello all,

I've recently moved from Ireland to California and, honestly, the US tax system is a mystery to me. I've been in this job for USC since August now, and every month I have received the same amount of money in my payslip, as expected. I was paying roughly $300 in federal withholding. This month my federal withholding jumped up to $1300. 

Because of the visa I am on, I am only allowed to claim one allowance, which is what I'm doing. I just checked my W4 which is automatically generated by Glacier as I'm a non-resident alien and my allowances are still at one, last updated in late September. 

I've emailed the university about this but the building is closed until the 1st January.

personalfinance,"First real job, 403b but no match for a year, 95,000 of student debt. What’s the best option?","Like the title says, I just started my first job as an RN. I have $95,000 of student loans with around an average interest rate of 6.06% — highest 10% and lowest 3.4%

My job provides access to a 403b and matches 3% — that match only starts after my first year, so 0% match for 2019.

I expect to make between 65,000 and 70,000 this year including overtime/shift differentials/etc. 

My initial thoughts are to just pay the minimum and stay at a non-profit hospital for 10 years and hope for loan forgiveness. That’s what I heard you can do from a friend. So in that case I’d contribute a reasonable amount to my 403b. 

My boyfriend thinks that I should pay it off as quickly as I can and not contribute to my 403b for the first year. 

What do you all think? Also are there any benefits of a 403b over a 401k?",finance

Here's my problem. I have a bank account in Brazil with around 50k brazilian reais (around 12k euros).

Does any of you have experience with that and have some idea on how to get normal rates? I would like to trasfer all that money in euros so that I can use it here. I think the problem could be solved by moving the money away from the bank account (the 10% rate i think is specific of the bank I'm using) and use a different service to transfer the money abroad with less ineterests. I have someone in Brazil with control over the bank acount so I could make him move the money somewehere else before transferring it here.

CryptoCurrency,"Fed Funds Rate Hiked to 2.5 percent; Stocks Crash; Bitcoin, Crypto Rally","&amp;#x200B;

The Fed funds rate has been hiked from 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent as  of Dec. 19. The Fed funds rate is one of the most closely watched  economic parameters since it determines the interest rate on interbank  loans.

When the Fed funds rate is lowered, it makes cash more easily  available and can help strengthen the economy, while an increase of the  Fed funds rate can cause cash to become more scarce, which can have a  detrimental impact on the economy.

since being lowered to 0 percent during the Great Recession of 2008,  making this latest Fed funds rate hike not much of a surprise.

By November the market was expecting a rate hike after  
 from its November meeting that indicated a rate hike was likely in  December. Traders and investors began pricing in the rate hike early,  with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) declining 2,966 points  (11.5 percent) since Dec. 3. The 1,200 points of this decline have  occurred since the decision was announced on Dec. 19. The NASDAQ and  S&amp;P 500 have declined by similar amounts, and  
 for a brief amount of time during trading on Dec. 21. The DJIA is now  down on the year, and the chart actually looks quite similar to the  trading that led up to the 2008 Great Recession.

It has been theorized that a downward moving stock market would cause  Bitcoin to rally. This is because traders and investors can diversify  into Bitcoin during times of stock market crisis, since Bitcoin is  independent of the stock market and could, therefore, be considered a  safe haven asset. In practice, this effect has not been consistently  observed. That being said, the stock market has been in a strong and  nearly continuous rally since Bitcoin launched in 2009, and the current  stock market situation is one of the worst during Bitcoin’s lifetime.

Perhaps Bitcoin’s rally from $3,120 on Dec. 15 to $4,000 on Dec. 20  can be explained by stock traders and investors diversifying into  Bitcoin as a safe haven due to the expectation that the Fed funds rate  hike would be the straw that broke the camel’s back for the stock  market. This speculation about the relationship between the Fed funds  rate hike and Bitcoin is especially warranted since a large green candle  from $3,750 to $4,100 occurred right after the Federal Reserve’s  decision on Dec. 19.

Stocks have crashed before, and Bitcoin has not gone up, so we can  speculate that this time is different. Perhaps numerous traders expect  this to be the beginning of a serious stock recession the likes of which  has not been seen since 2008, which is why we’re finally seeing this  long-theorized relationship between the stock and crypto markets. Before  now, stocks had been consistently rising or stable with no serious  consensus that a stock recession was imminent, making Bitcoin an  unneeded safe haven.

If this theory is true, perhaps the institutional investors that the  crypto space has long been waiting for will finally come en masse,  providing strong upward pressure on cryptocurrency prices. A positive  feedback loop could easily take hold, where falling stock prices and  rising cryptocurrency prices happen simultaneously, strengthening the  outflow of capital from the stock market into the crypto space. Traders  and investors will see that instead of losing money in the stock market,  they could be making money with cryptocurrency. If this feedback loop  reaches extreme levels, perhaps a powerful cryptocurrency rally could  actually accelerate a stock collapse.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Someone broke into my garage and stole tools,"So this happened a few days ago. I came home around 11:30pm and my detached garage bay door was open. Immediately I noticed my thickness planer and my main tool chest were gone. 

The garage was a mess, I was not going to call the police originally because I thought my deductible was 1500, and I had no clue was missing. Eventually, I realized it was way more than my deductible, I called the cops, they came, wrote me a case number, and gave me a property loss form. 

Next morning was insurance. And this is where the fun begins:  
Many of the tools I had in my garage I’ve had for multiple years. The bulk of the bigger more expensive individual power tools (bench jointer, planer etc) were purchased after I purchased the home. I like wood working, so I had a lot of tools based around that. In total, I had somewhere between 7-10k worth of tools stolen: Thickness Planer, Jointer, framing tools, electrician tools, big craftsman rolling chest (full of tools), you get the idea. 

Of course, insurance wants me to provide receipts for everything I have purchased, but I don’t have any. I don’t even have the serial numbers off any of my tools. I went to Home Depot, asked them and had a receipt of everything I’ve purchased in the last year printed. Was over 100pages of receipts. Tried the same at Lowe’s, and their records only go back 3 months, AND they can only look up receipts by date. I only bought one thing at Menards tool-wise since moving to this state about 3yrs ago (I mostly avoid menards because they don’t give military discounts).  

The tool chest was a craftsman rolling chest that I bought from sears I think back in 2011-2012, and was stuffed with all sorts of goodies. They even stole one of my dollies, most likely to help get that chest on the back of their truck. At least I assume it was a truck and most likely 2-3 guys because it was not light by any means. I’ve been buying tools for over a decade. I don’t generally take pictures, especially of my tools because, well, they are tools in my garage. 

Any advice would be grand, this is partly also be venting, so thanks for your time. 

TL;DR - someone(s) stole almost 10k worth of tools from my garage. Stuff I’ve been buying over the course of 10+yrs. I don’t have pictures or receipts of these things for insurance, what do I do?

personalfinance,Bouncing credit card balances to take advantage of 0% APRs.,"I've been doing this for a few years now.  My wife and I decided to combine all of our credit cards onto a single Chase credit card to take advantage of the year and a half 0% APR.  I kept all of our other cards active but do not use them - the old cards will typically offer us another 0% APR for balance transfers, which we do once the promotional period ends for the previous card.  Given that the balance transfer is 3% of the total balance and the interest rates are insane once the promotional period ends (2 months of interest is more than the single balance transfer cost) it seems to make financial sense to pay the transfer fee once every year and a half and bounce the cards' balance back and forth while we slowly chip away at the debt.  Obviously paying the balance completely off is preferable, but I'm working on snowballing our debt, and this one is currently 3rd or forth in line.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr; Are there any downsides to bouncing credit card balances back and forth to take advantage of a 1.5yr 0% APR when the balance transfer is less than 2 months of interest after the promotional period ends.

The interest rate is currently at 3.375% but will eventually go up to 4% later next year. The monthly payment is around $3,200 (includes property tax and insurance). My currently salary is $100k a year while my parents make about $40k.

My Dad is 65 and my mom is 60. They have no savings besides this house. I suggested that they sell the home and use the equity to retire in their home country or buy themselves a small place but it seems like they want to keep the house and stay in southern california.

The house is under my moms name. I'm thinking of refinancing the house to my name since we are planning on keeping the house long term(I currently have not debt and a high credit score). They will most likely be living with me for the long term. 

Is refinancing the home under my name if we want to keep the house long term the right choice? I know it will help me decrease my tax liability but if we do decide to sell the house short term then I will be taxed on any gains. I'm also hoping the monthly payment will be lower if we refinance to 30 years. Is there anything else that I am not considering by refinancing the house under my name?

&amp;#x200B;

Any other advise about planning long term in my situation where I will most likely be supporting my parents later in their life would be great appreciated. Thank You!",finance

stocks,Buying Opportunity,"There’s a lot of deals out there if you can stomach it, folks.  The economic indicators are very well intact so if you’re long, I would think twice about selling. 

I left the market around 2,800 as I thought we were a bit inflated.  I just bought leap calls yesterday in sectors I think are a little too low. 

AAPL - -40%+- Every time there’s a bad quarter, analysts say “it’s just a phone company”.  Meanwhile, their cash reserves are greater than many sovereign nations. 

NFLX - -40%+- This is a bit of a risky play as they were super high to begin with, and with Disney’s upcoming service, they may take a hit.  Still, I think they’ll be around for a while. 

UPRO - -50%+- 3X ETF for SPY.  This is self explanatory.  Barring a recession which is unlikely, the market should rebound within the next 6-12 months. 

JNUG - -60%+- 3X ETF for gold miners.  Relatively safe play if the economy continues to crap itself.  And, decent volatility to boot. 

USO- -45%+- Oil. Same as JNUG, relatively safe play. 

JNJ- -15+- This company is just solid for any portfolio. 

GE- A LOT+- This is a fairly risky play but I’m banking on the fact they get their act together in 2019.  However, titans fall from time to time. Just look at Sears, though I’d say this is much different than retail. 

FB- -45%+- I’ve always disliked this company based on their subscriber rates being close to full attrition for years now.  However, based on the scandals and market correction, they’ve taken a beating.  People forget they print cash. 

AMZN- -30%+- It’s amzn, what else needs to be said?  The only issue they face is government regulation and that has yet to be acknowledged so they’ll continue to be a juggernaut.  If you look back to 2016 and bought leap calls in February for a mere $10,000 investment, it could’ve netted 2.2 million dollars.  

SQQQ- And here’s the safety net. Should everything fail before expiry, this etf will provide an equal balance sheet, at least.  This is risky as it’s affected by interest rates and contango but if you keep an eye on it, you should be fine.  Short term only or you’ll get eaten alive.  For the more risk centric investors, VXX.  However, you’ll need balls of steel. 

I’m not advising anyone to do anything, I’m just sharing what I started scaling into yesterday.  Before you panic, understand that the market always goes up over time because it has to, based on our economic model.  YoY we’re down roughly 8% and if we hit 2,400, we’ll be down 22% from ATHs just a couple of months ago.  These type of drops don’t happen very often during a spurring economy so do your research and understand the cycles.  

I could be wrong but if I am, we’re going into to a recession anyway.  And if that’s true, I’ll just keep averaging down.  All of my positions are over 2y expirys (except the 3x-6mo) so there’s time. 

Note* the percentages are based of memory, please cut me some slack if I’m a few points off.",finance

personalfinance,I have a stupid question about 1099 taxes. Maybe a few questions.,"I live in Oregon and work full time here as a W4 employee. I write blogs for a company in Ohio, and they are going to send me a 1099 at the end of the year. I will earn $4,875 from writing blogs (30% is $1462.50). I'll earn approximately $39,000 (after taxes -- $52,655 before taxes) and withhold approximately $13,900 total in taxes from my full time job. The federal withholding to date is $5978 and OR withholding to date is $3603. I used the IRS withholding calculator today. It says my anticipated income tax is $3,647, my projected withholding is $3,300, and my anticipated underpayment is $347. I have not made any tax payments at all this year for my 1099 income because I thought it was just an option and didn't realize I might be penalized for it. I do not have any kind of LLC or sole proprietorship or anything like that set up for my blogs; those paychecks are sent from the company's business account and made out to me. I have been depositing them into my personal checking account (I don't know if any of this matters).

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, questions. Should I pay $347 right now to avoid any penalties, should I pay more than that, or is it too late and I just have to accept a penalty? If the estimated tax quarterly payments are for Medicare and SS, but I'm paying those on my full time paycheck, does that matter? Does living and working as a freelancer in a different state make any difference for anything?

&amp;#x200B;

Moving forward, do I need to register as a sole proprietor? Next year, I anticipate earning anywhere between $5,500 and $6,500 for my blogs and about the same for my full time job.

personalfinance,Med school debt vs. Mortgage vs. PSLF vs. Investing in your 20's,"I am a married 26-year-old medical student. I will graduate in 1 year with ~$200,000 in federal direct loans, which are accruing as we speak. Currently, I have $18,000 in Direct Subsidized Stafford loans with 3.4-4.5% interest. Then I have $114,000 in Direct Unsubsidized Stafford with 5.3-6.6% interest.

After graduation, I will make ~$55,000/year for 4 years during residency, then &gt; $350,000/year for the rest of my career. Meanwhile my wife (25) is making $60,000/year currently and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. She has a 401K that we are putting in just enough for her full company match. We have very low expenses (i.e. $800/month total for rent and utilities), so we manage to save most of her income and have ~$13,000 in the bank at this time.

I know if I just follow the cookie-cutter path, I will still be living comfortably, but I want to get a head-start financially by crushing my debt ASAP so I can hopefully bank 100% of my first few years of doctor salary and retire early.

So, I have a few options that I've been mulling over:

A) Keep saving up fiat and make big lump sum payments against the debt periodically until it's gone. Or set up some sort of auto-pay, which I believe confers a small interest benefit, per the loan service.

B) Save up a bit more and make a down payment on a mortgage, potentially saving money in the long run as we would be paying roughly the same as we do currently in rent except it would be towards our own property.

C) Save fiat and invest aggressively over the next 5 years given the time value of money in the setting of anticipated market opportunities, with the ultimate goal of paying the debt off with one or a few large lump sums taken from profits . High risk.

D) Pursue Public Student Loan Forgiveness and hope that the government waves a magic welfare wand and wipes away my remaining debt after 10 years of qualifying minimum payments (could not do private practice with this option). I am highly skeptical of this and am not planning on pursuing it. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is. Also, in the past year, of the ~33,000 people in the first cohort to be eligible and apply for PSLF, less than 100 were accepted. 

E) Some combination of the above? Something altogether different? I would appreciate any feedback you have. 

Thank you.

investing,Thoughts about current market conditions and where we go from here --- from an experience swing trader,"I've been investing for awhile right now and I'm currently up 73% since October 4th, 2018 (the creation of my newest portfolio)

People currently are panicking about a recession thanks to the federal reserve and their quantitative tightening.

My take on the future of the market, I don't trust the fed however they can't allow the stock market to go into a recession so they will be ultimately forced to pause on rate hikes or even go further with a single .25% Q.E.

Donald Trump is not making this any better by acting erratically, however, it isn't his fault the market is slowing down. The deficit , however, is in his court and people are currently afraid of how much debt the U.S is accruing.  
Janet Yellen, the former chairman of the Fed, didn't make this any easier because she put off Q.T off for many years despite a booming economy.

Current 'bets' (if you want to use that terminology are the following;

Current portfolio consists of **6% Gold** \-- (*GLD most stable* but day-to-day swings you can go for 3X direxion NUGT/JNUG)

**Rest in a mix between 35/35 DJIA / SP500 stocks --- 24% NASDAQ tech stocks.**

The market is going to have to rebound because the P/E ratios are becoming too attractive. Consumer behavior hasn't changed over the past 15 days but it is noteworthy to add that people will be afraid of spending a lot of money but consumer debt remains high which is indicative of confidence in the current work-force.

personalfinance,Allow a credit card to close?,"Back in 2013ish, after needing a dental crown, I opened a Care Credit card to take advantage of a 6 month no interest period. I paid it off the balance before that period ended. And I haven't touched it since. 

&amp;#x200B;

The interest rate is about 16%APR if I recall correctly. But what gets me is that interest on this card is actually compounded daily. That is, every day that there is a balance on this card, a finance charge occurs. So I've never used it. It's just been collecting wallet-lint. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just got an email stating that this card will be automatically closed in about 3 months due to inactivity. I'm kind of tempted to just let that happen. The limit is only around $2,300, so I don't see it helping my credit too much when compared to my main card's limit of $16,000 (which I pay off at the end of every month) with a better APR that's compounded normally. And it's just another account that I'd have to occasionally monitor to ensure the balance remains at zero. And even then, I have a decent sized emergency fund I'd go through before I even touched any line of credit. Though the wisdom on /r/personalfinance seems to say that having unused lines of credit open is usually better, so I'm mildly conflicted here. But this card really doesn't seem worth having to me.

personalfinance,22 year old who doesn't know when to get a credit card,"Hello all!

I've been wrestling with the idea of getting a credit card for some time as I know that building credit is important and I don't want to hold my boyfriend back as we continue our life together. He's works full time and has all his ducks in a row, including maxing out what he's paying into retirement.

&amp;#x200B;

I on the other hand have had the same debit card since I was 14. I'm in school finishing up my last semester (spring 19) of undergrad for a degree in Social Work and will be going straight into graduate school (fall 19) and feel it's time for me to really think about credit. I currently make around **$600-$800 a month**, with no rent or car payments, phone, or loan expenses (I pay utilities and internet as my only monthly expenses, and groceries). My parents pay for my schooling out of pocket besides FAFSA (usually around $1,500 a semester) which is the only thing I'll have to pay back after graduation (my parents took out loans for my brother's schooling and felt it was a big mistake so they decided to pay up front for me). We're a very middle-class family, by no means rich, my parents just started planning and saving early enough to be able to do this. I also don't have access to my FAFSA to know how much I'll owe back or at what interest rate.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have 500$ in savings which I only just saved this past summer. I keep it in my checking account because I've been having mixed feelings about the bank I'm at, **Associated Bank** (I live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin). My parents have been and continue to be vehemently against me getting a credit card because of their own debts they've racked up and they feel it's not good for anyone and best to stay away as long as I can. On the other side, my boyfriend says I should really start building my credit because life will hit fast once I get my graduate degree.

&amp;#x200B;

So that's where I'm at. I feel like I don't make enough money to justify having a credit card and am worried about over spending on the credit card and not being able to pay it back before the first round of interest, but I want to begin my journey of credit at the same time. **My question is, is this the right time to get a card to use on small things like gas and food, or is it not worth the risk? And, what type of bank and interest would even be willing to take me on without a steady income?**

First and foremost, I've made a bunch of dumb decisions regarding my credit cards, and I am just starting to work out how to fix them. I had about $10,000 in credit card debt, and I've paid that down to $8,000. I have $4,000 on my BofA credit card, with 22.24% ARP. I have $3,800 on Capital One, with 0% interest until November 2019.

First of all, I live in Quebec, Canada.

I had really good credit. I financed my first brand new car at Mitsubishi for 0%. 2 weeks after I had an accident and the car was declared a total loss. Now a month later, my insurance finally got back to me and are only giving me $16k out of the 23k I owed. This already really hurt me, since I now have a bubble to pay of $7000. I went to many dealerships to see if I could get a better price/car, since Mitsubishi wanted me to pay so much more for the same vehicle I only used for 2 weeks. NONE of the dealerships told me they were going to check my credit, nor did I have to sign anything. I went back to Mitsubishi because they talked to their finance department and were able to give me a large discount. However today, I get a call from the financing girl at the dealership and she told me because there was 7 credit checks in a week on my record, my interest rate went from 0% to a whopping 6.99% (And that's the SAME bank I applied to for a 0% a month ago) ... I have no idea how the hell 7 credit checks happened, since I NEVER AGREED to credit checks from any other of the other dealerships.

I don't know what to do. I'm left without a vehicle, with debt over my head (from other things too), and I already live paycheck to paycheck. I fought Mitsubishi so hard to have a decent price, and now they tell me this.

personalfinance,Looking for advice on prioritizing debt,"Hey all, long time lurker and I feel in a position financially where I have some options and I’d love some advice on how to proceed. I have the following financial considerations:

 - 1 student loan (66k) in my name alone that is currently under a public service loan forgiveness plan. My career is in higher education so I intend all my work over the next decade to be eligible for this payment plan.

- 1 smaller student loan (22k) my parents co-signed on that I have been paying down aggressively, and is a main priority so it is paid off by the time they want to retire, within the next 5 years. Average interest rate about 7.4%.

- An assortment of medical bills. I have had 3 knee surgeries in the past 2 years, plus physical therapy, etc. I have about 1k of assorted smaller bills from my most recent surgery (this past Monday, actually) and 2.2k from the other 2 that have gone to collections. The 2.2k is on a payment plan and is willing to settle at 50%. 

My long term financial plan is to buy a duplex or a triplex as a first house, renting out the other units. I know this is a whole other finance conversation, so for the sake of this just consider that I’m currently renting, and would like to buy a house so I’m not “wasting” money on rent. 

I have about 1k in savings. My most recent surgery has definitely set me back as far as saving has gone, because I’ve been paying off 200-300$ charges as they come up. 

What should I do first? Make minimum payments on loans to buy a house? Rent until I’ve paid off all my debts? Save up to settle the largest medical bill? Paying off the medical debt is attractive, because it’s smaller and more achievable, but I recognize with interest the student loans should be more of a priority. Also, I recognize the immensity of the student debt I incurred. At 20 the debt didn’t seem real. I love my career and don’t regret my education, but would love advice on how to best approach relieving these debts. Thanks for any feedback.",finance
personalfinance,[Goofed] Duplicate balance transfer headache,"Hi all - 

I’ll make this short. I was carrying a balance on my everyday card - to the sum of *well* into four digits. I’d rather not go into specifics, but it was enough. I was having trouble paying it down at the high interest rate (duh) so I opened up a new card with another bank that had a promotional, 0% interest phase of 18 months for a 2% transfer fee. I requested the entire balance be transferred when I applied for the card. I was approved for a credit line just barely over what I needed to have transferred. 4 weeks went by, I received the card, set up my online account and waited. And waited. I did not see it anywhere online that it was in process, nor did I receive communication about it, so I requested another transfer for the same amount.

(Hindsight? Should’ve called them first. Lesson learned)

Both transfers hit at the same time about a week and a half later. So, now my daily card was overpaid by the same amount it was carrying, and my new card was over limit by almost double. For the past 3 weeks I’ve been dealing with who is going to do what, speaking with managers arguing about having to pay the second fee, and it’s come down to my daily card/bank reversing the first transfer to even things out. This should be done in the next few weeks.

My advice I’m needing is my credit took a huge hit from this small mistake, by the tune of triple digit points. Why, I’m not sure - whether it has to do with debt/credit line or debt to income, but it got hurt pretty bad. Are corrections this drastic that are made (ie when the transfer is reversed and posted) updated fairly quickly on my credit report? I would think if it took less than a month to tank my credit, it would take around the same time to repair itself - but knowing how American financial systems work, that may be foolish of me to think. So truly, I’m looking for some peace of mind and maybe even some pointers you all may have to help get me back on track quicker.

Thank you.",finance

Even with a 750 credit score post-short sale, the best fixed rate we can find with 0 points is 5.125% and 4.5% with 2 points. ARMs aren't much better than the 0 point option. We'd have to do conventional as the building isn't FHA approved due to a zero renting policy enacted several years ago. Our landlord is grandfathered in.

&amp;#x200B;

Are we simply being overly cautious or is there cause to hesitate? We've been living here since the house sold and it is more than adequate, we prefer it over a single family house, but we can rent cheaper than the condo mortgage+HOA+tax. We can also pay off those two debts, bank a bunch of cash while renting, then take advantage of a downturned housing market I suppose. Had we timed it right, we could've bought a condo here for $90k instead of $140k a few years later.",finance
personalfinance,"After years of refunds, I owe $7,000 in federal taxes this year due to the tax law changes and not changing my withholding","I've preliminarily done my '18 taxes and after getting at least a bit of a refund for years and years, I will owe close to $7,000 this year.

I had run some numbers and assumed the reduction in rates would somewhat offset the SALT cap, but not even close.

I did not change my W4 withholding like I should have.  The updated W4 worksheet should be used to re-figure out your allowances especially if you are in a high tax state like CA or NY and earn a six figure salary.

I just updated mine and went from 8 allowances to 0, based on the new guidance.

Hopefully next year I will come out around even but this was a big shocker.

Please be aware these 'tax cuts' may raise your taxes significantly!

personalfinance,College Student Loans,"I’m not sure if it’s a good idea to get student loans even though I’m in college. I currently have the BOG so tuition is essentially free for me. I need to move out of my parents home.

1.	My father has NPD and being around him is too emotionally and mentally draining.
2.	I don’t feel that safe anymore because he blames everything that goes bad in his life on my mother and I. He already threatens her life but doesn’t do the same to me. However I feel his hatred and he’s already talking about how I’m a burden in his life even though he doesn’t pay for any of my shit including rent. My mom works two jobs and pays for all the bills. 
3.	I currently have a 30hr/week job and do online classes full time so it’s definitely doable while saving 75% of my income towards moving out. 
4.	I was thinking of getting Federal loans as I can pay 80% of rent with my current job if I live with 2 other people. Private loans are harder bc my mother doesn’t approve of me getting them or moving out. 
5.	Despite that, they both fucked up their transcripts for my fafsa so I have to amend their taxes to get full financial aid. I’ve been too nervous and unsure to turn it in to the IRS. what if they reject it? The deadline is April 25th to get a student loan. 
6.	Now I’m thinking should I just not and continue to save up money and instead move out next year when I’ll start having lab classes that can’t be done online. 
7.	I’m currently so tired at home; I have no social life or hobbies anymore since my school is about 30minutes away. I picked it specifically bc I thought I’d be out by now and he wouldn’t have as much contact with me. Therefore it’s hard to even form friendships at school and I want to be more involved with the campus. I think I’m never going to be truly happy until I’m away from all the commotion and constant fighting and abuse. I’m just getting so tired.

personalfinance,Question about federal loan grace period and in school deferement,"Here is my situation: I am taking spring 2019 semester off to work. I have 4 federal direct loans so far and their 6 month grace period ends in middle of june. I want to register in a class that begins end of may (which would put me at half time status) so that the grace period does not get used up.

I talked to a person at my schools financial aid office and they said that summer is not a mandatory semester for enrollment purposes, and my loans will not automatically resume a deferment status because summer is optional. They said that I will want to get an in-school deferment form from my lender’s website and provide it to the Registrar’s Office to certify my enrollment for summer semester. Doing a search for in school deferement form, I find this [https://ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/attachments/GEN1602Attach18450011SCHFINAL.pdf](https://ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/attachments/GEN1602Attach18450011SCHFINAL.pdf)

I don't see anything in this form that refers to the sixth month grace period, other than in section 3 in the last check box, but I don't have any PLUS loans. Would this be the right form me or am I completely clueless and misinterpreting everything? I am worried that this form is just to stop payments only when I am in classes and after my summer class ends I would have to start paying them again. 

I would post this on r/studentloans but for some reason it never shows up. If you have any input on my situation I would greatly appreciate it.",finance
personalfinance,Any downsides in an income-based repayment plan for a parent student loan?,"My mom took out two Parent PLUS loans for my degree, totalling $12,000 at an average interest rate of 7.2%. It's a Parent PLUS loan, so it's in her name, but I have some federal loans in my own name as well. When I took out the loan we agreed that I would have a moral but not a legal responsibility to repay the loan that is in her name.

I just graduated so I'm taking a look at those numbers. I just found out about income-based repayment plans. It is important to note that my mom is physically disabled, always has been, and has no taxable income. Why should I not set up my mom with an income-based repayment option, considering her payment will likely be $0 per month?

If this is an option, I do not understand why she was approved for the loan in the first place.

I still feel a bit guilty about using this money for college and not repaying it, so I would like to repay it, but not for a few years because I would like to focus on the loans in my name first. I am considering taking the estimated ~$100 for the Parent loan and putting it toward my own loans to repay them faster. Since my own payments are $400/month, I'm hoping the extra $100 would allow me to repay the loan in 7 years instead of 10. Would it come to bite me later if I do this? Like, are there significant fees or penalties in ""making up"" a few years of payments that you were relieved from during the income-based plan? Am I being stupid with the ""feeling guilty"" thing and should I just take the $0 payments for 25 years until the loan is dissolved?",finance

&gt; President Donald Trump has discussed firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell as his frustration with the central bank chief intensified following this week’s interest-rate increase and months of stock-market losses, according to four people familiar with the matter.

&gt; Advisers close to Trump aren’t convinced he would move against Powell and are hoping that the president’s latest bout of anger will dissipate over the holidays, the people said on condition of anonymity. Some of Trump’s advisers have warned him that firing Powell would be a disastrous move.

&gt; Yet the president has talked privately about firing Powell many times in the past few days, said two of the people.

&gt; It’s unclear how much legal authority the president has to fire Powell. The Federal Reserve Act says governors may be “removed for cause by the President.” Since the chairman is also a governor, that presumably extends to him or her, but the rules around firing the leader are legally ambiguous, as Peter Conti-Brown of the University of Pennsylvania notes in his book on Fed independence.",finance

personalfinance,Advice for filing taxes this coming season,"Okay, I'll try to keep this as short as possible, but I will need to give a little background information.

My wife and I have been married for 2 years now, and we've filed our taxes jointly both of the years we've been married. The first year we did this we had just had a kid in 2016, we had both worked most of the year, and she had finished college that year as well. So, come the tax season of 2017 we filed jointly and we ended up getting a pretty substantial refund by our own standards. We used the refund to move out of my parent's house, purchased a used car for myself (she has her own car we bought new), among a few other necessities for coming changes in our lives (furniture, etc...).

All is well.

At the beginning of the year, I was finishing up a seasonal job and needed to look for a new job so I landed on a place in which I would be a tipped worker in the food industry. I'm not very savvy when it comes to these things, and as I was filing the tax information for the new job, I was under the impression that by following the guidelines, I was required to claim the maximum number of dependents possible. Well, since, I guess, myself counts for 1, my daughter counted for 1, my spouse counted for 1, and there was another area asking me to claim another 2 for my daughter. I read over all the information a dozen times, and didn't see any other way to construe that bit, so I ended up claiming 5 dependents.

So a year goes by and it's time to file our taxes again. My wife is entering all the info in and our refund begins to look like last year's, but then she enters the information from my work and all of a sudden our refund drops by about 90%. Of course we're both distraught and I go to check what is going on. At this point, I've barely ever even looked at my check stubs (online and I have direct deposit). I get into one and notice that absolutely zero federal taxes have been taken out of it. I start looking at all the check stubs I have available and lo' and behold, I've never had federal taxes taken out of my payroll checks the entire year I've worked there.

So, on top of having to pay taxes on all of my tipped wages, I also have to pay all my federal taxes for the year since the dependents get reflected properly in the return, as well as claiming a small amount of compensation from a side-venture that just happened to add up over the limit.

I would like to now say, we did still get a refund for last year, it was simply 10% of what we had planned on, which is our fault, mostly mine.

I told my manager that I wanted to change my info several times to not claim so many dependents. I don't know, I'm not really a super responsible guy, and he just never got around to it, and I stopped bugging him about it. Again, completely my fault and I know I'm an idiot for this.

So, here's where the real problem lies. My wife and I are going to be going into this year knowing full well that the exact same thing is going to happen, quite possibly even worse this time around, and we'll receive little to no refund and may even owe. So, my wife suggests the idea that we file separately. Her line of reasoning basically goes like this: We file separately so that her tax return yields us the large sum, and I will just have to owe what I owe. We are in a situation where we're sharing a car since the lovely used car we bought for me broke down after two years (go figure), and she wants the added convenience of us having separate cars again. So, we're supposed to file separately so we can get several grand back and buy another car, and.........and I guess she just wants me to owe the IRS a ton of money that I honestly probably can't really pay back in a timely fashion by any stretch of the imagination. I don't exactly make a lot of money.

Again, I know in the end this situation is entirely my fault. Before anyone says it, I'm going into work tomorrow and bugging the f\*\*\* out of my boss until he gets me what I need to fix my information. I just can't help but feel like my wife's idea is a super bad one. Why on earth should we essentially borrow a bunch of money to spend and not be able to pay back, to one of the largest and most powerful financial institutions in the country? This whole thing just stinks of idiocy, but I want to give her the benefit of the doubt that maybe she isn't just completely wrong, so here I am, asking for your all's opinion.

What could be the pros and cons of filing separately in this situation and would it not be as bad as I'm thinking it will be?

Thanks for anyone willing to read my wall of text and for any replies I get.

TL;DR Wife wants to file separately so that she'll get a decent refund we can use for immediate and pressing expenses while leaving me to owe a bunch of money to the IRS. Need advice on whether this could actually be a beneficial situation as neither of us are well-versed in this field of knowledge.

&amp;#x200B;

\*edit\* It's very late where I am, so I will be going to bed and will be checking back here in about 7-8 hours.

\*edit2\* Given the replies from u/NYCheesecakes and u/wijwijwij I feel like I've learned a lot about our situation, and talking over all these points with my wife, it seems she's starting to understand the situation better as well. She's still not happy about it, but that has to do with our overall situation versus the factual information given. I thank all of you for your replies. Educating yourself, I believe, is one of the most important aspects of leading a successful life. If mods wish to close this thread, I have had my questions answered. Again, thank you all. It is truly appreciated.",finance

investing,Current Investing Environment from Experiences Investor Pro/Cons - Seeking Other Experienced Investor Commentary,"Hello investor friends! I try to maintain a running list of the current economic situation at all times since I trade based on current global news.  I'm looking for some commentary on my current list:

  

**Pros**

Super cheap oil - this helps consumer spending and emerging markets, but hurts the S&amp;P and oil exporters (a segment of the US now). Google the article “The American Consumer Is On Track To Save $40 Billion In Annual Energy Costs”. Every one cent decrease in gas prices saves the consumer $1 billion in yearly energy costs!

Corporate tax cuts are permanent unless congress repeals them - why are people under the impression that this is a one-time stimulus and will wear off?

Potential for at least a temporary trade deal and cut in tariffs to see if China makes due on its promises (my hunch)

Low unemployment - historically this means we’re closer to the next recession though

Some pockets of potential stock value

Historically low interest rates

Household debt ratio is OK

**Cons**

Trump instability.

Russia investigation. 

Strong dollar - hurts US exports and emerging markets. Where will this be in 2019?

Market pessimism and downward momentum

Global growth worries - will these prove to be well justified in affecting US corporate profits?

Yield curve is flattening, though historically it has been this flat and growth continues for years to come

Fed balance sheet unwind - Fed needs to sell lots of securities. Low treasury prices drive up safe yields and make bonds look more attractive, driving down stock prices. 

Fed raising interest rates, though rates are still low historically speaking.

QE unwind. Will bonds end up getting crushed eventually?

Trade war - who long will it go on and what will be the effect? Will Trump fold because of the stock market crashing?

Brexit

Isolationism getting popular hurting trade and the global economy

Decelerating global economy

High P/E ratios. Are earnings declining or still growing and just decelerating?

Lots of corporate debt, and debt getting downgraded - will this matter, and when will this matter?

Companies are holding back on investment due to economic concerns

**Unknowns**

Was the market reaction to the Fed’s rate increase overblown? The market didn’t start crashing until he started speaking of QE unwind being on autopilot and  2 rate hikes next year, and playing ignorant to the equities markets and slowing global growth. 

What will January earnings season bring us? Will the tariffs start taking more of a bite out of profits? Will the corporate tax cuts make up for this and bolster earnings further? Is there a slowing economy when consumer spending is on the rise?

Will there be a wealth effect from securities losses?

Are we at the top of the cycle?

Will there be any January effect and will investors step back in opportunistically to take advantage of fear selling? What news in early January could effect markets before earnings season kicks in?

Will an active management strategy be any different going into 2019 with high volatility expected?",finance
personalfinance,Hiring a nanny,"My wife and I are thinking about hiring a nanny. I know we need to pay federal income, social security and Medicare. Does the employer and employee usually split those taxes??

Thanks in advance. 

Location: Tennessee",finance
personalfinance,Central Payment App?,"Hi all, 

First time posting here!

Does anyone know of a central payment app for credit cards? I have multiple cards, and it can get annoying having to deal with making multiple payments with multiple due dates. 

I am able to make the payments, and could probably set up automatic payments. 

But, I would much prefer an app or something that would be able to analyze my outstanding credit cards, take the required money out of my bank account on the first of the month, and then just make all the payments for me. Ideally, I could set it to make the minimum or a certain percentage or something like that. 

Does something like this exist?

If not, I am a developer and would love to create something like this. Not sure if it's worthwhile though, maybe there is a solution that exists that I am not thinking about.

Thank you!

Edit: thanks to a suggestion I signed up for mint.com which let me put in my credit cards and how much I could afford per month towards paying down debt. 

It then gives you a time table for how much to spend on which credit card based on what you can afford and interest rates.

I combined that with automatic payments and it seems like I’m good to go!

Thank you for your help!",finance

I hope everyone on this sub made out okay last week amid all of the insane market volatility of late, and are ready for the new trading week, albeit a holiday-shortened trading week ahead! :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 24th, 2018.

# **Stocks enter final full week of the year on the brink of a bear market  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/21/stocks-on-brink-of-bear-market-.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks head into the final full trading week of the year on the brink of a bear market.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted in the past week in its worst performance since before the bull market began, in the very thick of the financial crisis in the fall of 2008.
*****
&gt; While the market is seemingly oversold, strategists see little chance for any bounce in the week ahead, and the focus will remain on Washington's fight over a government shutdown. Strategists say it may be too soon for investors to look for bargains among the rubble in what has traditionally been one of the quietest weeks of the year.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq Composite Index, dragged down by tech and biotech, was the first index to close in bear market territory, and is now 22 percent from its high. The Nasdaq lost 8.4 percent to 6,332 in the past week.
*****
&gt; The Dow fell 6.9 percent in the past week, to 22,445, and is now just 3 percentage points away from bear market territory, or a 20 percent decline. The S&amp;P 500 was down 7 percent for the week and is just 16 points away from a key support level of 2,400. It is also just about 2 percentage points from a bear market.
*****
&gt; ""Even if we do [get a Santa rally], it's not going to be meaningful. It's going to be super light volume, with a half trading day,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. ""Normally, this has been one of the strongest months of the year, but so far things in 2018 that normally have happened haven't been happening.""
*****
&gt; In a bad sign on Friday, volume was really heavy. More than 12 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Friday, the biggest volume in at least two years.
*****
&gt; The stock market closes after a half day on Monday, Christmas Eve, and is closed Tuesday.
*****
&gt; **Dismal December**

&gt; December's performance is nearly the worst on record for the month, with the Dow's decline of 12 percent the worst since 1931. December is typically a good time of year for stocks, and this December is on track to be the worst month of the year for the first time ever.
*****
&gt; ""I would imagine trading activity is going to slow down quite a bit,"" said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short rate strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ""Overall, I think the focus is going to be on getting things tied up ahead of year's end. It's possible there could be some outsized moves given reduced liquidity. I think there's going to be a lot of focus on getting a fresh start next year.""
*****
&gt; Technical analysts say the market continues to look weak, with many stocks in bear market territory already and trading well below their 200-day moving averages.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 had been in a range from 2,600 to 2,800 for four months, but quickly fell out of it all the way to 2,400.
*****
&gt; ""The measured move was reached faster and more furious than most people thought,"" said Scott Redler of T3Live.com. ""It doesn't seem like anyone wants to step in the way of the headlines that are piling up. And why would they? The next level traders would like to see tested is 2,250 to 2,300.""
*****
&gt; A negative chart formation that emerged last week, known as a head-and-shoulders formation, points to a level of 2,300 in the S&amp;P 500.
*****
&gt; ""Buyers are just sitting back and instead of playing an oversold bounce, they're just waiting,"" he said. ""Anybody's that tried to position for a Santa rally has been absolutely run over. The calendar issues have been all off.""
*****
&gt; **Government shutdown**

&gt; Hanging over the market in the week ahead are the government shutdown fight, which pits the president against Democrats in Congress, over his plan for a border wall. There was a glimmer of hope late on Friday that a deal could be hatched, with Sen. Bob Corker saying a path forward was being discussed.
*****
&gt; While traders said there was not much concern about the partial shutdown, a bigger worry was the fighting that could become the norm once Democrats have control of the House in January.
*****
&gt; ""It does seem like it's weighing on sentiment. It's more a signal about just how difficult things will ultimately be. It enhances expectations for gridlock in the future,"" said Cabana.
*****
&gt; The Fed this past week was viewed as a major catalyst for the sell-off, after it released a forecast for more rate hikes at the same time it sees a slower growing economy.
*****
&gt; That sparked concerns that the Fed was heading for a policy mistake, and comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell that the Fed's balance sheet rolldown was on ""autopilot"" really spooked traders.
*****
&gt; But on Friday, New York Fed President John Williams kicked off a brief stock market rally when he told CNBC the Fed is willing to reconsider its policy depending on the economy and conditions. His comment was not unlike Powell's, but traders said he sounded more flexible and sensitive to market conditions.
*****
&gt; Strategists point to a few big concerns for the markets heading into next year — the most worrisome being trade and the Fed.
*****
&gt; Wilmington Trust chief economist Luke Tilley said his base case is there will be a trade agreement with China that avoids the next round of tariffs.
*****
&gt; ""The tariffs so far don't have much impact on the economy,"" he said. ""If we moved into 2019 and all tariffs were implemented, that would very quickly outweigh all stimulus we have coming into 2019. That would be a weight on GDP growth and bring our numbers down for next year.""
*****
&gt; Cabana said growth for the beginning of the year looks good, and if sentiment could stabilize that might help markets. Treasury yields fell in the past week, with the 10-year yield at 2.78 percent Friday.
*****
&gt; ""We think rates could be higher. We think 3 percent is reasonable ... but quite honestly risks appear quite heavily to the downside,"" he said. ""The bigger ones are international and geopolitical in nature — what happens to trade, China's economy, Brexit, European populism and gridlock in the U.S.""
*****
&gt; Cabana said the low end of the range for the 10-year yield could be 2.5 percent.

# Average S&amp;P 500 Stock Decline Exceeds 25%

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 may not have reached bear market territory as an index yet, but of the 500 individual stocks in the index, more than 60% are down at least 20% from their 52-week highs. Overall, the average decline from a 52-week high is a staggering 25.7%! The chart below shows the distance each of the individual components is trading from their 52-week highs grouped by 10 percentage point ranges. As of Thursday afternoon, just 72 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are even trading within 10% of their 52-week highs. Meanwhile, 82 stocks in the index are down 40% or more with 24 of those 82 stocks down by more than half! Have their been uglier periods for the stock market? You bet. But not in a long time.

&gt; So which stocks are down the most? There are actually a number of well-known names with stocks like General Electric (GE), Western Digital (WDC), Nvidia (NVDA), Halliburton (HAL), Wynn Resorts (WYNN), Micron (MU), and Applied Materials (AMAT) all having been more than cut in half.

# Is It Time For Santa?

&gt; So far it’s been rough for stocks in December, a month that has historically been bullish. How bad has it been? After 10 trading days, we’re off to the worst start to December since 1980! In fact, the S&amp;P 500 Index is flirting with “worst month of 2018” status, currently held by October (-6.9%). Since 1957, when the S&amp;P 500 started in its current form of roughly 500 stocks, December has never been the worst month of the year.

&gt; Is there still time for a Santa Claus rally? “December has been a month to forget for equities so far, but there is a silver lining. Turns out, the majority of December’s gains tend to happen the second half of the month—so we still have time to believe in Santa,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, December is historically a strong month that has tended to see the majority of its gains late in the month.

# Day Before Christmas: Tech and Small-Caps Best

&gt; For decades we have been tracking the market’s performance around holidays in the annual Stock Trader’s Almanac. In the 52nd edition for 2019, data for DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 can be found on page 88. Of the eight holidays tracked, Christmas has been one of the most consistently bullish with respectable average gains occurring on the day before. Small-caps, measured by the Russell 2000 have been up 74.2% of the time on the day before Christmas with an average gain of 0.37% since 1987. NASDAQ is second best, up 67.7% of the time with an average gain of 0.42%. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have been softer with gains 61.3% and 58.1% of the time respectively. Volatility also tends to be subdued ahead of Christmas as well as the worst decline recorded by any of the four indexes was 0.69% by NASDAQ in 1997. NASDAQ also had the best day before performance, up a staggering 7.56% in 2000. The market did not get exactly what it was looking for from the Fed, but perhaps a pause in trading, to celebrate Christmas, will have some positive impact.

personalfinance,Had fraudulent activity on my REWARDS POINTS - who knew?,"A couple months ago I applied for a card that got me 50K in points, so added to other rewards points I had about 60K total. I am diligent about checking all my bank and credit card account balances online every few days or so (but not points, who checks those?). One day while checking I noticed in passing that my rewards points were only about 2K - I thought ok they've divided them up by card or something and clicked the link. Nope - someone had cashed out about $600 worth of iTunes gift cards using my name, and an address across the country!  

I call the bank and the first response was ""well we knew it was you because they gave us your mother's maiden name"".  I pointed out the lunacy of using (practically) publicly available information as security and asked to be passed to the fraud department. This person had also managed to change my email but only for that credit card (so I received no notices), and had also had a $3K purchase pending on that card (that had never left my pocket).  

So per the banks instructions I put a verbal password on that bank and credit cards for any call ins, put on a credit freeze with trans-union that propagated to the other agencies, and had the police come over so that I could file a report. The bank has refunded the points to me and put everything back the way it was, all passwords changed.  The bank said that if I wanted to know the outcome of ""their investigation"" I would need to submit my police report along with a letter requesting more information - I'm only interested because I have a suspicion it was from someone working at the bank (which it always seems to be for me).   

Also interesting (to me) is that I already have a credit monitoring service due to that monster federal leak a few years ago - this never triggered them.    

So anyways - the tl;dr is check your points - people steal those too.",finance

personalfinance,Advice - making additional payments to mortgage or investing,"I'm looking for some advice on how to manage my extra money. I'm in my mid 30s, making a little over $50k and just bought a condo and have a 30 year mortgage for $124k. My interest rate is 4.375% and I don't have PMI. I'm going to be getting a first time homebuyer tax credit every year for 20% of the interest that I pay.

After my expenses, I'm typically able to save around $800 per month. I'm working to build up my 6 month emergency fund again, and I am almost there. I'm contributing 6% to my 401k currently (paying 1% over company match maximum) and have around $30k between my 401k and traditional IRAs. 

I was playing with a mortgage calculator and I see that if I make an additional $400 payment per month, the mortgage will be paid off in 13 years. 

Is this wise to do? In the long term, if I were to invest instead of repay the mortgage the faster, I think I could probably make more than the interest that I'm paying, and I have the first time homebuyer incentive for tax credits to not repay the mortgage faster. 

If I just paid the minimum mortgage payment, I would likely increase my 401k contributions instead and max out a ROTH IRA. I like the ROTH IRA because I would have easy access to the funds if I needed them for unforeseen housing repairs.

Thank you!

personalfinance,Should I buy my leased vehicle?,"I think I'm making the correct decision in purchasing my leased vehicle once the lease is up but I just want to make sure there's nothing I haven't considered. 

Not sure if this is relevant but I make around $65k a year. Rent + utilties cost me about $700/mo. Lease payments are around $230. I have $8k student debt left. I'm not hurting for money but I want to make the most efficient move possible. 


I have a 2016 honda civic Ex-L. I expect to have about 55k miles by the end of a 3-year lease that charges 15 cents per mile over $36k. This equates to cost me $3200 (19k miles * 15 cents + $350 turn in fee) to turn it back in. The residual value is $15,332.60. I see cars online on craigslist with similar miles that sell for a couple thousand more. KBB also says the same thing. 

Is this uncommon for the value of the car to be more than the residual value and do you guys think I should absolutely finance the car? I'm not exactly sure where to look to finance a car... (bank, credit union, insurance company, Honda financing). I asked all my friends and the lowest interest rate they got was through State Farm at 3.9% for a new vehicle. My lease ends March 26, 2019... where should I go and how early should I start shopping around?",finance

I bought some BTC back then.

I also can prove Satoshi IS NOT CSW but it would cost me my anonymity &amp; my state is not friendly toward people like me who have never declared ownership of some BTC wallet without paying any taxes lol.

So it's not my Fucking problem I just told you my Story.

Also I bought with my own saved money back then because my bank didn't trust that investment… (I hope my old banker is dead since !) &amp; It was the biggest wealth transfer of the century !

I'm looking to buy my boss's established Environmental Consulting firm which has been in business for about 20 years. I was hired on 2 years ago specifically to take over his business and buy it. I'm buying it for $250k, and have $150k ready, I just need to find another $100k. I've got about $250k equity in my house, no debt other than my mortgage, but the last 2 years my income has taken a dive bomb from taking a pay cut to train in this business so my debt-to-income ratio is bad. My credit score has a couple blemishes on it, so it's at around 700. Anyways I have to get this 100k together by the end of January. As soon as I own the business at the end of January I have scheduled 60k worth of contracts alone (NOI = $55k), so I'm willing to pay a high interest rate (like 20%, 1 year term).

I don't think I can get a $100k loan through Business Development Bank of Canada or my regular bank. Does anyone know of venture capital firms, angel investors, or anything else where I could get this sort of loan?

I'm located near Vancouver.

personalfinance,"Considering getting a credit card, not sure where to go","I'm a college student (21) and I've been planning on getting a credit card for a while now, but never really knew where to go so I just kept pushing it off cause I didn't want to just get one randomly. I have 0 loans, and the soonest I'll (probably) be needing one is my senor year of college. Because of that, I also have 0 credit, so I'd like to start building some in case I ever need a loan for a house or to pay a ransom or something. 

I'm not super concerned about budgeting it, I'm pretty good with my own finances, and I only tend to pay for rent with it, which I've never been late on.


I don't have anyone in my family I can really ask for advice, and the only credit card advice I ever got was from my old econ professor, and he only ever said two things about it, pay it monhly and I should only get a credit card if I was pretty much being paid to use it with rewards. but that guy had a masters in econ and fucking *loved* it. but it's still the best (only) advice I've been given.

If the latter is true, then where do I go for best rewards? He also said to look for the lowest interest rates, but does that matter if I have 0 intent to ever let it gain interest?

I live in south florida, but go to school in north florida, and the options are slightly different. I think I heard somewhere that the best options are usually the smaller places, so would I use something from where I go to school, or something near home? Or just stick to my debit bank (PNC)?

personalfinance,I'm a poor grad student set to receive nearly 100k from an insurance settlement. How should I use it most effectively?,"So long story short I was in a car accident a while back, and now I'm set to to receive more money than I know what to do with. Considering my relatively low income and high debt this will be nothing short of a financial miracle, however I want to make sure to use it at efficiently as possible. 

For some background, I'm a 26 year old graduate student working on my doctorate in the biomedical sciences. As part of this my tuition fees are waived and I'm paid 25k a year. I'm currently funded by a federal fellowship so this is exempt from FICA taxes, but I believe this prevents me from contributing to an IRA or 401k through my work. 

I'll need to speak with an accountant in regards to taxes, but a rough estimate would give me about 75k to work with.

&amp;#x200B;

Debt:

Student loans: 45k. Approximately half are subsidized and are 0% interest until I graduate in \~2 years, the other half have varied interest rates around 5%. 

Credit cards. \~$4000 out of $14,000 available credit. Interest rates 18-20%

&amp;#x200B;

Savings: 

4k in the bank

$1500 in retirement account from my old job. I think its though TIAA

&amp;#x200B;

Mandatory Bills:

Rent/utilities: $450/month

Credit cards: \~200 in minimum payments, but I've been paying more to reduces my balances from prior medical bills

Miscellaneous: $200

&amp;#x200B;

My first thought was to pay off my 49k in debt, put aside 10k in a high interest savings account for a used car once my current car eventually dies (it has high milage and is nearing 20 years old), put \~14k into a mix of retirement, savings and/or investments, and then use the last 1-2k on a vacation for a bit of celebratory fun. I currently have a pretty low cost of living and good job security so my current 4k in savings would cover most emergencies.

&amp;#x200B;

Other considerations:

\-Tax benefits for paying student loans are capped, so I may benefit from delaying some payments (especially since some are at 0% interest right now).

\-My salary is basically guaranteed to increase from 25k to 50k in 2 years during the next step in my training, and has very good potential beyond that once I start my actual career. This makes me want to be irresponsible and use more for fun and travel while I'm in my 20's, but I know I probably shouldn't.

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

401(k): firm matches 5%, I am contributing 10% ATM

I live in Chicago, so rent would be ~$1500-2000/ month for a desirable location.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Thanks quite interesting.   
&gt;  
&gt;I can see that Bitcoin is ""hard"" money and might qualify as a store of value.  
&gt;  
&gt;At the moment the biggest problem is the volatility of the price. It's not a strong store elf value of the price fluctuates so stongly. The guy in the video says that once mainstream consumers and investors have adopted it the price will stabilize.   
&gt;  
&gt;My only question is how will the mainstream start using it?  
&gt;  
&gt;Bitcoin has little inflation, this means there is little incentive to spend Bitcoin - in fact most people advise to hodl it. On the other hand Fiat has a good amount of inflation - in the best countries central banks try to create exactly the right amount of inflation to increase spending. Furthermore, fiat is strong as a medium of exchange because everyone is accepting it --&gt; strong network effects.

&gt;There are some good stories of censorship that will start creating the case for Bitcoin as an alternative un-censorable payment method, the most recent being for Gab.com [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alt-twitter-gab-moves-bitcoin-001343266.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alt-twitter-gab-moves-bitcoin-001343266.html)  
&gt;  
&gt;Also, it’s becoming quite quick &amp; easy to install your Bitcoin Payment Gateway (through BtcPay Server) with as little as 5-10$ per month in hosting costs and that’s it. You can integrate this with Wordpress, or your e-commerce site and start processing purchases directly in BTC. ([https://medium.com/@BtcpayServer/launch-btcpay-server-via-web-interface-and-deploy-full-bitcoin-node-lnd-in-less-than-a-minute-dc8bc6f06a3](https://medium.com/@BtcpayServer/launch-btcpay-server-via-web-interface-and-deploy-full-bitcoin-node-lnd-in-less-than-a-minute-dc8bc6f06a3)) If you see this link, the setup is very easy as well, just few clicks. The process is straightforward so that also not techies can set it up quite quickly.  
&gt;  
&gt;I don’t know you but when I was younger, I had many business ideas I wanted to realize and most of the times the complexity of the process for setting up a business (in Italy), just demotivated me. If I had Bitcoin + BtcPay Server then, I am sure things would have been different.   
&gt;  
&gt;I believe many people in many countries where it’s even harder to setup a business than Italy will realize the potential for this.  
&gt;  
&gt;The point is that this BtcPay service and many other amazing things that are being built on BTC are completely free and built by the best Devs out there, just because they want to contribute to something that it’s bigger than them, and they are very passionate about the project.   
&gt;  
&gt;This doesn’t happen on any other cryptos. With few exceptions, it’s mostly greed.

personalfinance,"Traditional IRA question regarding the $63,000 income limit for full deduction","Appreciate this subreddit as it has changed my view on finances over the last 15 months.

I am going to make $62,100 this year, here is how it broke down:

* $16279.73 in 401k contributions (between two jobs)
* $3075 in medical deductions
* $4259.35 paid in income tax (did not pay any income tax for second job which was $9100 in salary)
* $1625 in traditional IRA contributions so far

I read that as long as your income is $63,000 or less, you can fully deduct the $5500 for the IRA. My quick calculation was that as of now, I had $29,168 in taxable income and would end up owing $3310 in federal income taxes. And if I put $5500 into the traditional IRA, I would owe $2845 in federal income taxes. Does this sound right, or am I missing something?

Not sure if this matters, but I had a second job that generated $9166.56 of that income (from January to August). I contributed half of that money to the 401k and then moved that into my IRA once I stopped working there. I am not sure what happened but for some reason I did not pay any income tax at that job, but the taxable income was only about $4600 so I'm not sure it matters.

Anyways, does my math sound right? I would be very happy with the $1400 tax return and use that to pay off 1/3 of the $4500 remaining on my car loan.",finance

personalfinance,Financial advice for my dad??,"Hi all,

My dad hasn’t been the greatest with his finance. He is 56 years old and currently makes about $100k a year. He has total savings of $200k in cash from selling his house, and unfortunately he also has parent plus loan of $140k. I do know he has retirement savings, but he did not disclose how much he has. 

I suggested to him to pay off the loan first with cash because the average interest rate for his loans is 6.5 or something like that. If he does that, he will be left with about 50k in cash, no home, and $450 monthly payment from me for the next 10 years. 

OR I can tell him to extend loan repayment plan to extended graduated and pay $833 month for now, eventually to $1,311 while getting the $450/month from me and use his $200k cash to invest in something more profitable. This loan repayment plan will create an interest of $174k. I don’t see him being smart and saavy with highly involved investment like real estate, so keep that in mind. 

What do you think? Should he invest the $200k in a retirement plan or stock and repay the loans over longer period of time, or just bite the bullet and pay the loan off now?

Btw, I know me repaying me $450/month over 10 years doesn’t equate to $140k. My brother also owes him, but isn’t making concrete plans to repay dad. I’m also not paying my dad back fully. He overborrowed and deferred on payment without telling me. 

I’m thinking paying the loan now with his cash might be better overall. If so, what’s the best way to grow his left over $50k? Should he try to buy a home?



Tldr; my dad’s 56 and has no house, has $140k debt, and $200k in cash. Suggestions?",finance

Bitcoin,Launch of Bakkt Physical Bitcoin Futures Likely Delayed Further from Government Shutdown,"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/jz4ury8ey2621.png

[https://cryptoiq.co/launch-of-bakkt-physical-bitcoin-futures-likely-delayed-further-from-government-shutdown/](https://cryptoiq.co/launch-of-bakkt-physical-bitcoin-futures-likely-delayed-further-from-government-shutdown/)

The crypto space has been greatly  anticipating the launch of physical Bitcoin futures on Bakkt. However,  the original launch date of Dec. 12, 2018, was scrubbed due to a lack of  regulatory approval from the Commodities Futures Trading Commission  (CFTC). 

This may have contributed  to Bitcoin’s price meltdown from $6,500 to $3,100 since the physical  Bitcoin futures on Bakkt were expected to lead to a Bitcoin rally.  Speculators who priced in a Bakkt rally may have dumped en masse when  the original launch date was canceled. [Bakkt now projects that futures will launch on Jan. 24 2019](https://medium.com/bakkt-blog/launch-and-faqs-e1a3f7691d7b), but it appears this launch date will be delayed even further.

Bakkt apparently needs an  exemption from the CFTC to custodian its own Bitcoins. The CFTC usually  requires that custodianship is operated by a third party bank, trust  company, or futures commission merchant. 

Even if the CFTC votes in favor of this exemption, [a 30 day comment period is required](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/tiny/bakkt-might-not-get-the-necessary-approvals-to-meet-its-target-launch-date-in-january-2019/).  Christmas is coming up, so the CFTC will not be able to vote until Dec.  26 at the earliest. The CFTC would then have to read the public  comments after the 30 day comment period. This would mean that, even  under ideal conditions, the approval date for this exemption will be at  least several days after the Jan. 24 projected launch date.   

That said, conditions are  less than ideal due to the partial shutdown of the United States  government. President Trump has refused to sign a bill that will keep  the government funded since Trump is trying to force Congress to pay for  a $5 billion wall between the United States and Mexico. 

One-quarter of the Federal  Government has been shut down since 12:01 am Saturday. Roughly 380,000  workers have been sent home, and 420,000 are working without pay until  the new budget is passed. The CFTC is among the organizations that lost  their funding until the government shutdown is resolved. [The CFTC will maintain a small workforce](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/electric-power/122118-with-shutdown-in-question-us-cftc-has-plan-for-limited-staff-to-oversee-markets)  of 61 employees during the shutdown for critical monitoring and  enforcement actions, but the rulemaking part of the CFTC, the branch  that Bakkt is depending on, will be out of business until the government  shutdown ends. 

[The House has passed a bill](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/22/us/politics/shutdown-trump-senate.html)  that will end the government shutdown by including $5.7 billion of  funding for the wall. However, the Senate will not go back into session  until Dec. 27 and is not expected to pass the bill since 60 votes are  required, and the vote will likely go down party lines. 

There is speculation that  there will be no resolution until after Democrats take control of the  House on Jan. 3. If this comes to pass, it would push back the approval  of Bakkt’s CFTC exemption until at least February. 

The reason the crypto space  has been so excited to see the launch of Bakkt Bitcoin futures is they  will be the first official physical Bitcoin futures. Currently, futures  markets for Bitcoin exist on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and  Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBoE), but these are cash-settled and do  not increase Bitcoin’s spot demand or price. In fact, [the  cash-settled Bitcoin futures in Chicago are likely a primary reason  that Bitcoin has fallen from $20,000 to $4,000 during 2018](https://cryptoiq.co/cme-bitcoin-futures-are-poisoning-crypto/), due to immense short selling pressure and the diversion of investment away from spot markets. 

The physical Bitcoin  futures on Bakkt will directly increase Bitcoin’s spot demand and price  since they are backed by actual Bitcoins. Further, the futures will  settle each day, which will make them a mechanism for investors to buy  actual Bitcoins on major stock trading platforms. 

The Bakkt physical Bitcoin  futures will be operated by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the  same organization that runs the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), making  it likely that these physical Bitcoin futures will be widely available  and popular.

Whether the Bakkt physical  Bitcoin futures can overcome the price suppression caused by CME  cash-settled Bitcoin futures remains to be seen, but they should at  least cause some increase in Bitcoin spot demand and price. However, the  crypto market will have to wait until the CFTC gives the green light to  get excited about Bakkt, and for now, there is no set date for when  CFTC approval will occur.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Budgeting for savings and student loan payments,"Wall of text ahead but I will try and post all relevant information and all relevant questions.  I will add edits as questions are asked.  I will also try and format better once I see the whole post.  Thank you for your responses and your patience.

28 year old male.  Graduated DPT May 2017, began work Nov 2017.

Annual salary: $74000/year.  Recent (November) raise from 70K.

401K: None, will be beginning in January with employer match of 100% of up to 4%.  I will be placing 4% for the time being.

HSA: Approximately 150/month

Student loans: 

Total: $225,936

Private: $56705.  Spread over 3 loans.  2 variable interest (9.63%, 10.4%). 1 fixed (9.49%).  Currently overpaying on all loans by about $200, increasing to $600 next month.  Trying to maximize overpayment due to variable interest rate.  Have been denied for refinancing and consolidation due to DTI ratio and age of accounts.  I have not tried to call the lenders directly to see if they could refinance my specific loan but will be attempting this next month as well.

Federal: $166043.  Currently enrolled in PAYE.  Currently paying $0/month.  This may change next November.  Not necessarily concerned with this debt at this time.

School specific loan: $3187.65.  5% interest rate.  Not concerned with this loan at this time either.

Total required payment: ~$800, have been paying ~$1050, increasing to $1500 as of next month.

Current savings account: $19800.  Have accrued this much over approximately 14 months of working.

CD at approximately 3k, unsure of interest rate, quarterly access.

Current spending:

Rent/utilities: ~$850/month.  Variable due to grocery bill.

Groceries: ~$400.  Split 3 ways between myself and 2 roommates.  They pay me in either cash or pay for my portion of the utilities

Gas: ~$130/month also variable.  If I have cash from groceries I go to gas stations which offer discounts for cash pay.

Date nights, clothes shopping, pet supplies, car insurance ~$300/month budgeted but not usually all spent.

Total budget using BoA site ~3500/month with ~$1500 into student loans.

Next potential big purchase by necessity:  Vehicle.  Currently driving 2004 with 200K+ miles on it, purchased in 2014 with 80K miles.  Currently no major issues but let's knock on wood a little longer.


So my questions are as follows:

What should I aim to save per month, aside from 401K, based of age and salary?

At what amount should I begin to transfer funds from savings into my CD?

Currently bank with BoA and have seen bonuses to start with Merril Edge investing.  Is this a worthwhile endeavor to start up while I try to nuke down my student loans?

My overall aim is to continue paying down my student loans especially the loans with a higher variable interest rate, so if I can find extra funds through your assistance those funds will be directed towards those loans monthly.

I have read through the wiki regarding methods of payment and would optimally like to take the highest interest and highest principal loans out of the picture first especially due to their variable interest.  There is a possibility that I can get one college loan forgiven however  I need to reach out to my school directly to see if this is possible due to a late submission on my part.  I",finance

personalfinance,Need help with car situation,"Hey guys I’m writing this because I need some advice since I don’t know what is my better option. 
       So recently I was in a car accident and my car was deemed a total loss thru my insurance. I was still paying it off but I have gap insurance.  

Anyways now I’m not sure if I should get a rental  for now or go for a used car at a dealership. I found this car that the price it says online is about $14500 and I really like the car.

I’m assuming I will get denied no matter where ever else I apply so i feel like my only option is to go and get a loan thru a dealership but I’m just worried I’ll get a really bad deal. 

On the other hand should I get a rental car until the loan gets paid off so I can try to get a loan thru my credit union ? My insurance would be the one paying it. 

If it matters my credit is about 745. And typically how much of an interest rate do you get for a used car loan? I also would like to get a loan for 3-4 years max. Do you think it’s possible ?",finance
stocks,Belt &amp; Road Initiative and my bigger picture thoughts.,"Don’t confuse me with the facts. Just let me vent. I’ve paid hundred of thousands in taxes. I deserve at least the right to vent.🤪


The Belt &amp; Road Initiative is now in the Chinese constitution. It will serve 70% of the worlds population with Chinese goods through 90 countries as partners. WTO who? 

China took advantage of the financial crisis in Europe and created an opportunity for themselves.  By gaining access to countries starving for money with the creation of the Belt and Road Initiative. They got great deals at bargain prices along with political influence to be used in the future for anything they want. These countries now owe China and they will collect through strong arming. It’s already apparent when several European Union members cast objections to voices concerned with China’s actions in the South China Seas, for example. 

In the US of A, Capitalistic markets were screwed by greed which became manifest as a housing loan crisis. Thank you, to the system that allowed everyone who shouldn’t have but did get a mortgage they couldn’t afford. To combat a worse outcome, the federal reserve floated the banks with Quantitative Easing. This isn’t free market behavior. To me this is like the Chinese devaluing their currency to benefit their objectives. 

The largest transfer of wealth occurred when homes in the US eventually were taken away from the middle class through mortgage loan default and sold to huge funds for the purpose of renting them out. The result is, ten years later, we have harder standards to meet for average Americans to buy homes and fewer owning homes. There goes the idea of wealth creation and retirement security because we all know social security isn’t going to be around forever. The only advantage the little guy got was being punished for paying his mortgage on time by buying what he could afford in the form of his home values crashing. Or he got to stay in a home for three years, rent free, because the banks couldn’t process all the broken loans any quicker. I hope those three years gave the little guy a chance to save some money for a new mortgage down payment because the 20% down is a big nut. By the looks of things, according to statistics, many didn’t save. Homeownership is down and developers are building rental units as quickly as they can. What does that tell you?

We bailed out the banks and flooded the market with free money which elevated share prices across the board.  And now we see finally more people are working and finally have a chance to catch up, make more money with wage increases and what happens? We raise the interest rates, market is going down, future business spending on development will be slowed, middle class is waning and millennials are in for an education with student loan debt which many say is the next big financial crisis when they realize the machine their in doesn’t give a sh!t about them. 

Here’s what makes me laugh out loud, we’ve got talking heads who are clueless as to why the market is dropping. How about we ask ourselves a few questions like what level would the market likely be at today if QE never happened and is our GDP forecast based on history from a QE infused economy? If the answer to the second question is yes, we’re fu€ked. 

It seems to me we are at war.  The Chinese are a communist/socialist/ lets-pretend-we’re-capitalists led country. We’ve got people here worried about air quality but we’ve sold our soul to the Chinese business man who doesn’t give a sh!t about air quality at the moment. We float our markets when we’re scared and we’re fascinated with goods created by child labor we can’t see or don’t want to because they’re cheap. Whose country is based on a free market, ours? What does it matter when the Chinese own more American Dollars when we do? The world is upside down and I only see the Chinese getting ahead.  Their quality of living standards has gone up while ours, not so much. 

What’s the solution? You’re not going to like this. We either join the party and accept that China eventually will be THE world financial power or you don’t. The way I see it is their long term goals outweigh anything any president can do because their game is long term. We come across as directionally challenged. 

Once the world is dependent on them for just about EVERYTHING, what do we have left?  We will be making goods for them eventually, at rock bottom prices because their populous with be vibrant and not willing to work cheaply. Life is like a pendulum; maybe our best days ARE behind us for the next 200 years. I can’t see what China’s long term goal is other than this and if my financial retirement security is to be safeguarded, maybe emerging markets is the way to go. 

It seems to me everything we esteem is being thrown in our faces because of our own unbridled nature. The Chinese have figured out our weaknesses and built a plan around them. Our weaknesses are manifested through our actions as an economical aggregate force. We need to fight this problem with the very problem it is- economics. But it may be too late because our population makes us less powerful in the game of economics compared to other countries popping out babies quicker than we are.  If we don’t do everything in-house, how can we combat the sunami wave coming at us that’s filled with refuse in the names of communism, blind eye to reality, abhorrent labor laws, inequality, pollution up the Wazoo, a “gimme mine, don’t care about you” hustler mentality, and plain anthropocentric paradigms including the many ego types running the world. We have to seclude ourselves if we are to combat the inevitable China King paradigm. Being a part of the world isn’t helping us.  I know this idea will have lots of flak but I really see it that way. We either give in and make the best of it or turn a drastic corner.  I don’t blame trump for hurting the Chinese economy right now with tariffs.  We have to do it now while we still have influence to do so. Once this Belt and Road Initiative is complete, we won’t have the economical influence we have currently. Timing is crucial. 

No one president has had the courage to be suicidal and tell the American Public what it doesn’t want to hear.  Only a communist government leader has that luxury.  Because the Americans, we Americans, don’t want to be confused with the facts, the truth is the tariffs will come back on us in the form of pricier products we consume. It’s a brilliant plan. Trump looks like he’s standing up to the Chinese, making them pay for our debt which they own, in turn that messes with their economy and in essence raises taxes for us at the same time but without us knowing it because it wasn’t paraded in front of us through Congress .  It’s almost like a flat tax I guess since it’s based on consumption of electronics, etc. In the end, we’ve been borrowing from the communists to give us freedom to not balance the books as a country even though millions of U.S. households HAVE to do that every month. We are a joke to the Chinese and I’m afraid they are going to win the war with this Belt and Road Initiative because the European Union is no better off than we are. They don’t have the luxury of borrowing without giving more than just interest in euros. 

I’m no writer, as you can obviously tell.  But I do think about these things and they bother me.  I’ve worked long and hard in a unusual business that forces me to be the best in order to survive while battling ageism every day . I have nothing to fall back on except my savings.  I try to grow them using instruments like real estate and stocks/options. So far both instruments are ailing.  I guess this turned out to be a rambling rant and I apologize for that.  2019 isn’t looking to be good for US equities.  I guess I’ll keep those rental units a few years longer I was going to sell in January.  I’m only making 7.9% annually before aggregating tax benefits through accelerated depreciation, etc. but it sure beats the 40% down my portofolio is currently.",finance
personalfinance,US to Belgium expats seeking financial suggestions,"Hi r/personalfinance! I have been lurking for some time and the info here has been very helpful. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm cross posting this to r/IWantOut and r/belgium since we could really use the help. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR** \- looking for help with translating US style banking to Belgium financial products. This is mostly geared towards daily banking and not investments or insurance. I feel like I have exhausted what I can find through my own research and we could use some help. 

**Introduction**: My wife and I are late 20’s/ early 30’s early career professionals with no children (two dogs) and are moving to Belgium for a job relocation for me. The company is a Belgian multinational, it is a direct hire position (ie I am not a contractor), and I will be paid in euros. We are working with a relocation service for most of the nuts and bolts but are struggling with banking and other financial services. I have a feeling that I’m trying to have my cake and eat it too and there may not be a good solution. 

**Background**: We currently use [Ally](https://www.ally.com/bank/online-savings-account/) for checking and savings due to their high rates and no fees. We have been doing so for &gt;2yrs. We feel 100% ok with no physical branch. Our daily purchases are made on a [Citi Costco credit card](https://www.citi.com/credit-cards/credit-card-details/citi.action?ID=Citi-costco-anywhere-visa-credit-card) which we pay off in full every month from the Ally checking to avoid interest. This results in 2.30% (2017) and 1.94% (2018) cash back rewards. To summarize, our current system is:

* Paycheck → high interest rate account → credit card payment → purchases. resulting in \~2% gains between the accounts and credit card points. 

Approximately $65k / yr in spending moves through our accounts in this way. Our spending through the credit card (including some work expenses which are then later reimbursed, not including rent, retirement investments, debt payments or other savings) is approximately: 26% merchandise (includes food), 23% services, 19% travel, 16% restaurants, 13% vehicle (includes gas), 3% entertainment/ healthcare/ other. 

We could probably “game” the points system better but prefer the “set it and forget it” approach. We additionally have retirement investment accounts, minimal debt from residual student loans, what I believe to be typical (i.e. minimal) insurance policies for our stage of life, and 6 months of emergency funds in savings. 

Our finances are pretty straight forward. We additionally like the “protection” a credit card offers but have never had an issue with identity theft nor have needed to make a consumer protection claim for a purchase through the credit card. 

**Current understanding of system in Belgium**: I have had phone conversations with ING as well as BNP Paribas Fortis regarding their account options. For purchases, it seems that there is a preference for payment with direct bank transfers but that the use of debit cards is also common. Credit cards are commonly held but not commonly used. Credit cards with rewards do not exist. There are fees charged for holding an account and even for having a debit card. There are some special deals worked out between the banks and my future employer (discounts on insurance and better rates for loans, other bundled products). Fee free online only banking is an option but seems to be marketed towards college students and has age restrictions.

**Scenarios**: I’m trying to understand if we should:

1. try to “stick” with our current system and use a local bank in Belgium as a pass through
2. keep US accounts open for visits but otherwise convert over to Belgian system
3. find a credit card in euros and configure as close to our current system as possible but with all euro based accounts
4. some other configuration unknown to us. 

*Scenario 1.* This seems possible but with downsides. 

Our Citi Costco card does not charge foreign transaction fees and I have used it for international travel in the past. Citi has said that I can change my address to what it will be in Belgium and generally they don’t see a problem. Although an international fee is not charged, they did not comment on how the currency conversion rate is determined and there could be manipulation there. 

Ally does not make outgoing international transfers but does accept incoming. I have received two international transfers so I know it works and am ok with the delay. Ally does not seem to charge a fee but I have read that other banks (swift network?) along the way may. 

I have looked into alternative platforms outside the swift network such as ofx and transferwise. The fees seem minimal however, I will still need to do a bank transfer to whichever platform. I would suspect there could be a fee associated with that step. The platforms also seem to charge about 1%. 

We would still need to have a local account open in Belgium and pay the associated fees. 

That would mean that our \~2% rewards advantage in this scenario would be greatly eroded or could even become negative. We will also be constantly playing the currency conversion rate game which is counter our “set it and forget it” preference. 

*Scenario 2.* Cleary possible but fees which nickel and dime and lack of rewards to keep up with inflation leave a bitter taste in my mouth. Special deals worked out with banks and my future employer (mostly insurance) are not relevant for us at this point in our lives. 

*Scenario 3.* I’m not sure this is even possible. I have looked for suggestions for cards for use in Europe but they all seem to be geared for travelers to, not people living in, Europe. Citi has said they think payments from a EU bank could work. I have not asked if they would convert the account to euros as well. I would be very open to suggestions for a rewards credit card geared towards people living in Europe. 

*Scenario 4.* Very open to suggestions. We are looking to accomplish some return (2% if possible but but anything is better than nothing) on our daily purchases and banking accounts.",finance

personalfinance,Investing Starting point,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I am another reediter who just reads posts but has always been to scared to post much. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I am currently 28 I am married have one child and a second on the way. My question is that between my wife and I we make an estimated 150k per year. I know that isn't a very large amount but to us it feels like we make A LOT. We have been wanting to start investing however neither of us know a thing about it. We both had tough upbringings when it comes to money. Our goal is to leave our two children in a position where they are ""set"" aka we pay for college, a car, and who knows maybe even help with a house. 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently we ""own"" 3 homes. The total mortgage for the 3 houses is about $4800 a month. We have an additional $1k in vehicle payments. other bills are an estimated 1k a month.  We have not had a renter in one house since August so we have been paying for that house out of pocket. Our other house brings in a profit of $520 per month. Our current income per month is $9500. My wife does do real estate as a side job and averages one sale/buy per month. We try not to count that into the consistent income.   


we have been trying to sell the vacant house and dumped most of our savings at this point into remodel/fixs, we bought a ""lemon"" house. My fear is this vacant house is going to sink us. Since 2015 when we purchased it we have put $32k into fixing the house. We took out a loan for the last wave of repairs and owe $10,500.  I know it is hard because I have not provided a full break down of what our bills/income is per month.  


This is half rant half original question of what to look for when investing and in a financial planner. What should we do to put ourselves in a position where achieving our goals is possible. We currently have $4000 in savings and have our own retirement accounts I think mine total 11k over 3 accounts. During my time in the Military I only saved 3k. Ive been considering rolling that money out of my TSP and into my current careers Roth IRA. I've been told by many not to do that because TSP is such a good thing. The problem there is that I can not add to it unless I switch to federal work. I could roll over my 2nd Roth plan into TSP and then leave that estimated 7k in TSP and continue to add to my PERA (work) plan or roll all 3 into my PERA. We are stressed because of the vacant house and have honestly not managed our money as well as we should. We go out to eat, buy what we want, and just out in general whenever we want. I know its not ideal but we do it because ""we can."" I am looking for advice and seriously want to change my habits so that I can provide a financially stable life for my family. Looking for advice on where to start.  


Thank you all for your time and I apologize for the ranting part. I just feel we should be more financially secure than we are. I am more than happy to share more info and provide exact numbers if needed.

personalfinance,My dad is dying and we need to refinance the house for my mom. Questions!,"Update! Got refinance at 4.62% payments are much lower now. Parents are very happy.  Thanks guys!

&amp;#x200B;

Well folks,

My father is dying from congestive heart failure and kidney failure. I'm here trying my best to take care of him and my mom, he's only in his 60's. I found out recently that my parents owe almost $100k on the property/and or house/ we have quite a bit of land and a ""newly"" built house. I've been trying to get their finances sorted out so that my mother will be okay when he passes and that we can keep on living here if that's possible. Apparently they are paying $901 dollars a month only of which $87 is going towards the actual house the rest on interest. I'm hoping we can refinance and make it possible to pay much more on the actual house instead of mostly on interest which seems like it will never be payed off.  I was able to modify the land arrangement a year ago and now we should qualify for a refinance.

Do you guys have any suggestions about refinancing and suggestions on which banks/ institutions to use?

We are not looking to borrow any extra money, either, just want to financially secure our future.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a snippet from the last payment cycle I found:

The loan is \~8 years old.

The interest rate is 9.470%

Principle balance is $94,053

Summary of payments due says

Principle amount: $86.30, Interest amount: $742.24, Escrow Amount $72.86, Total Payment $901.40

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance.

financialindependence,Proud of myself this year - doubled my savings &amp; dropped my expenses!,"I discovered this sub in 2016 and realized that FI is important to me, so much that it's now one of my two goals in life. But in 2017 I did miserably - only saving 18% of my income when I'd planned for 40%. This year I got really close - did 33% which in numbers was double the amount!! There were some medical expenses that prevented more saving + I really love going out drinking and I didn't have the discipline to reduce it as much as I wanted. 

New things that I did this year: 

* didn't touch my bonus - saved all of it
* increased my credit card repayment minimum (almost fully repaid)
* made sure I have an untouchable emergency fund of 3mo income
* doubled the automatic transfer to a retirement account - in my country I cannot invest in the market either local or international (we're kind of isolated like that) so my only option is stupid retirement accounts with banks or insurance.
* stopped traveling on vacation
* went out less &amp; to less expensive places; drank less per night out, and stopped eating out.

So basically in 2016 42% of my income went to savings + supporting my parents and 58% to general expenses whereas this year I reversed it and 58% is going to savings and parents. 

For next year I'll be looking to do maybe 45% saved (at least 40%) and definitely reduce what I can in expenses. I'll also shop around for better interest rates with banks. I'll try to get seasonal work that I could do during vacation - this would help for small extras. I will also try to get a decent raise from work. I don't know what I could do further, I already live with parents and don't have a car. Might you guys have some ideas?",finance

So I went to the dealership, got denied on a 2017 Mazda CX5 because of a Dodge Caliber that got repo'd in 2015, and had to settle for a 2017 Tucson with 16.95 interest rate and forceplaced insurance in the monthly payment, citing that 'it was a condition for financing', which I'm sure is a load of BS, but accepted anyway. 

Assuming all goes well, and I manage to rebuild my credit successfully in the span of 8 months to a year, what are my chances of refinancing and coming out with a better desl? Is there a way or timeframe allowed to walk back on that forceplaced insurance?

gaming,Reflecting on games making me do stuff I don't want to,"The function of this post for me is to express some stuff on my chest, and to read the experience others are having so that I can use the information to improve my experience. At the least, maybe I can find some laughs and relate a bit. I mean to do this focusing on the stuff that games make you do that you don't want to as that is the thing that I want to focus on at the moment. So in that context, obviously, I am going to talk about things I don't want to do in games. I expect comments from people about things they liked or didn't like doing, personal experiences. Though this is reddit, so I expect several trolls as well unfortunately. Also, this is going to be really hard to read, because I was posting in different spots many minutes apart without reading through the whole thing. It is more like a smattering of thoughts than a composed post. I also post some short ideas to capture paragraphs periodically, so be prepared for that too.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's share our reflection of things games make us do that we don't want to.  


I mean to game as an escape. It isn't working so well right now. I keep having to do stuff I don't want to in games.   
So I came here with this idea that struggling to get into mythic dungeons as a dps in WoW and doing ascendant challenges in Destiny are both things I would rather not do.   


I better back up. Here is what I am doing when I game. I want to do some notable stuff so my friends recognize some cool stuff I am doing, and I can see them doing cool stuff. Basically,I want to do cool stuff with them. I want to crush our enemies, and such. I want us to get cool gear. I want us to make strategies and engineer our builds. I want us to get rewarded for our prep efforts and performances. I believe that happiness comes from making a goal, and then recognizing your achievement when you complete it. Even if your goal is to just be on a journey toward something, instead of focusing on the completion. Like sometimes I want to play a quick round of Killingfloor 2 with my friends to be part of that. I try to spend my time on a class that I think will do a lot of damage. I end up yelling at my friends to get out of my way because I chose for whatever reason to be a marksman, and then found out I get buffed for picking a lane of headshots, crouching, and remaining still. I play Warband, I mean I have so many hours in it, because when I get on many people give me some recognition and space because it is highly likely that engaging me will be result in their character being ended for that round.   


I like to do things in games that I can be happy to be recognized for.   


I might just be picking the wrong style of games to play.  
When I play Wildlands, I go where I want to do things that I want. I can choose my gear however I want. Getting the gear is easy. There isn't a gear treadmill.

Now it's full circle back to Destiny and WoW making me doing things I don't want for gear. First, it is myself making myself do the things. I have this desire to be geared up. I could go fishing instead in WoW, and I have before.   


I like to try to reach conclusions before full exploration, so I think what I am headed toward is this idea that I have picked the wrong games, or I need to think about these games in another way.   


Here is something I hate in Destiny. I hate getting smacked by rocks I didn't see on these ascendant puzzles. So why do I do it? Well I spent 40 minutes getting hit by rocks for some gear. How do I improve this? Well I heard you can group with friends to do these challenges. So that is the first thing I need to do.   


I think I am headed toward finding ways to share these frustrations with some friends in the games. I don't think the problem that I am having is that I am doing challenges I hate, as much as I am doing them solo. Obviously, I would prefer to play with friends and do stuff we like all the time. However, if there isn't stuff to do that is disliked, then it reduces the amount of recognition that can be derived from doing the thing.   


I skipped around my thoughts a bit, and then figured that I need to group with friends for the ascendant challenge.  


I need to group with friends for the mythics.   


I didn't need friends to group with in some other games. In some other games, I had friends to group with. So in both cases the games seemed easier for me to achieve goals that I set to be happy about.   


On another note, I think the reason some games are so popular today stems from them putting players who win on a high pedestal. I speculate that if a game like Fortnite forced player to watch to the end of a match, that game would be even more popular. ( I never played Fortnite itself, so maybe it does that, not sure) I think that the function of being forced to watch the results would both elevate the status of the win and make it that much harder to get into matches to be the one who won. I could be mistaken though because I don't play any of those games since I seemed to plateau at between 4th and 10th position in that genre of the games I did play. I would defend that position, but I wouldn't want to face whatever the reality is. It would end up believing that I should have done more to achieve my goal or that I was not able to meet the goal. I am not really able to appreciate 4th position, as my goal was never to achieve 4th position. I was like I better be 1st in this or I am not interested. Probably too simplified, as I think I analyzed the way I would improve my skills and thought screw that. 

  
After finishing my current thoughts about doing the things I didn't like, I went on this weird tangent.  


TL;DR if you are looking for TL;DR, this post isn't really for you.   
If you were interested in reflecting on doing things you don't want in games to some length, then this might be a post for you.

personalfinance,Paying a 4.75% HELOC off early?,"I know my question sounds silly, but we owe $14K on an HELOC. We have always made minimum payments (not a problem for us), about $160/mo. I looked at a monthly statement recently and saw that we were paying $57 in interest. That sounds like a lot for such a low interest rate. 

OK, I called the provider and they claimed they couldn't tell me how much less interest I'd be paying if I were to make a $1000 lump sum payment (in addition to my regular monthly payments), or or how much less my interest charges would be, if I were to simply pay an extra $50/mo. 

My questions here:

1. Does this even make sense? We do have cc debt that is in the 20-30% range. Should people ALWAYS pay off the higher interest rate debt first, or pay off other loans that have a lot of interest in the minimum payment? 1/3 of the monthly payment sounds like an awful lot for this loan.

2. If answer to (1) is yes, it does make sense, then can anyone help me figure out how much money I'd be saving each month, with either option (1000 lump sum, or an extra 50/mo)? I would assume that the minimum payment would be the same, or would only go down slightly, over time.",finance

investing,Officially a Bear Market - Time to Think About Buying,"We are in the first Bear Market in 10 years. Historically this is the time when long-term investors should be putting money to work. We most likely will have more pain to come, as Bear Markets usually drop about 25-30% off of peak. With that said another 5-10% drop is likely coming.

&amp;#x200B;

Investors should not panic. By the word ""investor,"" I mean someone with a time horizon of years not months. I for one will be putting money to work in 2019. I will calculate how much income I want to contribute to the market and make quarterly buys. Bear Markets should not be scary for long-term investors. We had a ""Great Depression"" and a ""Great Recession"" and the markets have always rebounded. Remember in 08-09 our whole Financial System almost collapsed. That is not happening right now. The fear is not a Financial System/Capitalist Form of Government collapse. The fear is a recession. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are other fears including the Fed raising rates too fast and our debt level reaching unsustainable levels (our debt level reaching unsustainable levels has been a fear since the arguments of Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson). Interest on our debt compare to GDP and Government Spending, including spending on entitlements, are legitimate fears of course, but our way of life and form of government is not going to collapse. 

&amp;#x200B;

Investors should not be putting money into the markets if they will need that money within a year or is part of their emergency fund. Only disposable income should be being put to work. If that is the case, investors should not worry about the market falling. Stress should easily be managed. Be smart with your money.

&amp;#x200B;

A few indicators I am going to be watching are the Russell bottoming (I tend to agree this is a leading indicator), the Schiller P/E ratio, and the forward S&amp;P P/E Ratio. The Schiller and S&amp;P P/E ratios should tell investors it's okay to start putting money to work and the Russell bottoming would confirm. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is not worth it to panic. If you are panicking then either you have too much money in stocks, your time horizon is too short (you are more a trader than investor), or stock investing is not right for you (put money into bonds for guaranteed returns).

Good luck everyone! 2019 is going to be a volatile year for the markets. Pick winners and watch company's debt levels and cash flow from operations. A healthy balance sheet will survive a down turn in the economy.",finance
personalfinance,Received a job offer but struggling to decide on which location,"Hi all,

I’m not sure where to post this but I’m guessing it deals with personal finance. I just recently received an offer from IBM as a Business Consultant for their Chicago office (75k with 10k bonus). My first choice was for NYC since I am from the NYC/NJ area and also wanted to stay near NJ because a family circumstance. I asked my recruiter if I can change to NYC and she put in a request and I will find out the first week of January whether or not I am able to move, however now I am doubting it. I spoke to a friend in the NYC office and he stated NYC is going through a slow period where there are a lot of people benched and I should take Chicago but he said with my personality, I can easily network and find people who would like me on their team. Below I listed pros and cons of each

Pros of Chicago

-Can potentially have more opportunities to be staffed earlier

-New city and can meet new people (when I studied abroad, I loved the people from the Midwest)

-COL is lower and my salary can get me a really nice ""dream-like"" apartment

Cons of Chicago

- Being away from my mom who is going through a tough time and slightly need supervision

- Paying rent (will be traveling Mon-Thurs) so I'll barely be home

- Potentially not meeting people (less of a con because I'm an extrovert but still a concern)

- Just the move in general sounds exhausting (finding apartment, buying all new furniture etc)

Pros of NYC

-Live home rent free and can aggressively pay off 23k in students loans

-Closer to friends and family

-Large network in NYC (already thinking of exit ops)

Cons

-Not being staffed and on the bench a lot (I'll still network but I get bored EXTREMELY fast)

-Commute can be a little annoying (Newark to NYC is not bad but can get annoying especially if you're working late)

Any opinions will be appreciated. I'm not sure where I'll end up and will know first week of January but if I am given both options, I think it'll be a really tough decision",finance

personalfinance,"Is it worth it to buy a luxury vehicle (Audi, BMW, Lexus etc) over a regular vehicle?","I’ve never had a nice car, but I’m fortunate to have a car that runs. My step mother bought a Ford Explorer brand new in 1998. She gave it to me in 2013. It has had its issues. We had to repair the transmission and engine in it. Sometimes when you turn it on the engine revs and I have to pump the gas to get it to come down to shift it into gear without compromising the engine. The windows don’t roll down, the AC barely works when it’s hot in summer, the roof paneling is falling down, seats and console have holes, gas efficiency is awful (12 mpg avg), washer fluid doesn’t work. I drive it around and feel like I’m just waiting for it to break down. I don’t take it on long distances for this reason but it’s a decent around the town car until it’s fully compromised. 

I took a state job in September and make $43,600/annually. I have $66k in student loans but I’m on income based and public survive loan forgiveness now. I have a loan to my mentor of about $3000. Currently saving $1000/mo and saving for an emergency fund of $6000 before starting to pay off the $3000. I bring home about $2900 after taxes and my expenses are $750 rent and utilities, $90 car insurance, $95 storage unit (in process of selling this to get it off my back), and just copays and medications which for the most part are covered by my flex card. 

I know right now I’m in no place to take on a car payment. But I just wanted to think long term for when my car does break down for the last time. I’m 26F with no plans for marriage or kids and not interested in purchasing a home. I’m willing to move states every few years to progress my career. I want to aim for some federal jobs in a couple years if I don’t get a promotion into another position. 

When I rent cars I get spoiled with how convenient the new tech is in cars and how comfortable and reliable they are. Right now they have me on a 140c BMW. Last time I was in a Dodge Charger. I’m wondering if it’s worth spending money on a basic used luxury sedan like a BMW, Audi, Lexus etc or better to just buy a used Altima, Honda, Subaru etc. I dated a wealthier person for a couple years who owned an Audi. When the automatic breaking system went out they sold it and bought a Ford Focus. They said the Audi wasn’t worth the foreign parts when it broke down. I just want to save for a potential down payment around my safety fund should my car break down

personalfinance,Use long term emergency savings to pay off credit card?,"So I've always heard the adage ""put your money on the thing with the higher interest rate."" Like if your car loan is 4% and your IRA makes 6, don't make extra payments on your car, put the extra money into the IRA.  Never really ever had to apply it.  Either I had so much or so little it didn't really matter how I managed things.

Well the wife and I just moved for my dream job, and put a lot of the expenses on a credit card to try and earn travel points. It got out of control (poor planning on my part), and now I can do one of two things: 

* Use ~2 months' worth of the emergency fund to pay off the card in full, then rebuild, or...

* Use my wages to pay ~1k/month for the next year and a half and keep the emergency account as-is.

We carry no other debt aside from the mortgage and car loans, and have fairly well funded IRAs and 401ks.  Monthly budget is dialed in, and allocates 250/mo each to retirement, 250/mo for each kid's college, and adds 250/mo to our smaller ""short term emergency"" savings.  They currently have  45 days salary liquid in the ""short term emergency"" savings and 6 months salary liquid in ""long term emergency"" savings.  

I would use some money from the long term emergency account to pay off the card.

Others have noticed that as well and are somewhat fed up with it and look to put that claim to the test.So in short :  
1)Since Ubisoft has exclusive rights to the videogame franchise you should expect news about something bearing the Prince of Persia brand name but is NOT a videogame.  
2)This new project is set on a type of media that inspires 95% of all the blockbuster movies these days and features top talent from that business  
3)On top of being a return for the franchise as well as an awesome keepsake for fans,  
its commercial success would completely disprove Ubisoft's excuses and put some pressure on them for a change.In short, Ubisoft would have to finally address ''why not ?""  
4)It's handled by that someone who knows the franchise better than anyone else  
5)Don't ask me how I know all that but note that I'm really sticking my neck out with this and I'm not joking about it,I'm not trying to pull a Hiphopgamer and I'm not trying to ruin your Christmas.This is for real  
6)Always keep in mind that for the first time we could have a say of sort.

personalfinance,Debt optimization,"I’m a mathematically minded individual. My friend recently came to me with the following problem:

Suppose I have $5000 per month to allocate to loans A,B, C every month. How would allocate the $5000 every month to each of the following loans in order to minimize my total amount paid plus any remaining balance in, say, 30 years. 

Loan A: 100000, 3% fixed till 2020 then 8% fixed 
Loan B: 200000, floating rate (prime + 3%), has an option to convert to fixed at 7%
Loan C: 250000, floating rate (prime + 4%) till 2025 then fixed at 8% thereafter 

Note that the remaining balance is only non-zero if you accrue capitalized interest.

As a general rule of thumb, loans with higher interest rates should be paid off first, but that’s not the case in all examples. The differing sizes of loans, interest rate structure etc. all come into play. 

So basically, I wrote a giant optimization algorithm to solve this problem for an arbitrary number of loans. Would this be of use to people on this sub? Would you like me to share this program? Would it be helpful?

personalfinance,Stay contractor overseas or go back to the States as a government employee?,"BLUF - I have a feeling the answer will be to stay Overseas, but let’s find out. 

Information about my wife and myself. I am. U.S citizen and she is Philippine. We are near getting her Green card. We are both 35. We have hit our financial peak for two years now. 

I work for a large contracting firm for the DoD. This is our current income/debt/assets 

Annual income
- 150,000 (husband)
- 35,000 (wife)

Debt
- zero

Assets 
- 130,000 land in Philippines
- 100,000 401k
- 30,000 savings
- 15,000 gold
- 10,000 in ETF
- 10,000 car
- 3,000 car

Currently we pay no state tax or federal tax due to foreign tax exclusion, maxing out 401k and standard deductions. 

Out rent is roughly 20,000 a year. 

If we move back to the states my job would be as a GS (government employee) again. I would make 116,000 but now subject to state and federal tax. My wife would have a much more difficult time getting a job that pays as well as she currently makes. She will also be taxed. 

This type of government job is one that only becomes available once a decade due to people never leaving it. 116,000 is a lot for the area (average joint income is around 48,000. 

The job is extremely fulfilling and difficult which is what I like. What I do now I enjoy, but it is not challenging and I have no authority. 

Do I do the smart thing and just stick it out another five years overseas? We are at the point where we max out my 401k. I put another 20,000 in the ETF. My wife saves 100% in her savings account (she is not eligible for a 401k due to not being US). I expect to save about 50,000 in cash this year on top of all the above. 

The original idea was to do this for five more years to be able to buy a house in full when going back to the states. This “once in a lifetime” GS job is so compelling though. 

Any words of wisdom?",finance
personalfinance,Need some help with a question in my Finance course (risk-neutral pricing),"I think this is quite difficult, but I give it a try over here. Basically we received this exam question prior to the exam itself, because it is considered to be *that* challenging by the professor.

This is the setup:

- the derivative is European (only pays out at the end of the contract 1 year from now)
- payoff of the derivative = max(Smax-K; 0)
- Smax is the maximum observed price between now (t) and the end of the contract (T = t + 1) 
- K is the strike price 
The derivative hence locks in the maximum price gain above K.
 
Consider the following situation: 
current price of the asset S(t) = 110; K = 100 

Compute the current price of the derivative, using the binomial tree approach on the basis of a partition of time in three levels t = 1 = 3

- upstate u(Δt= 1/3) = 1.2 
- d(Δt= 1/3) = 1/1.2 
- gross interest rate over the interval Δt= 1/3 is given by Rf (Δt= 1/3) = 1.05

Also, if someone knows about a better fitting sub to post this, I'd be glad to hear it.

personalfinance,"~$30k in credit card debt, 21 and need help...","Hello all, I really needed help as this has been keeping me up at night and giving me anxiety a lot especially lately. 

I am 21, married, and have almost $30,000 in credit card debt. I am looking for a way through this. 

I make $21 /hr and get paid bi monthly (~$1600 twice a month on 10th and 25th). My wife is full time in school. 

Recently, we reached the max on our $15k limit credit card which has a 17.5% interest rate. It hurt when I saw a $280 interest charge on it be posted and just feel completely stuck at this point. Our other card is $9,600 at 7.99% and is maxed as well. We have a couple other cards (PayPal, Amazon, Macy’s) that are each sitting around $1,500. 

Most of this was racked up before I started making how much I make now. I used to make roughly $2200 per month. Our bills add up to that. Here is a list of our bills excluding credit card minimum payments: 

-	Rent: $750
-	Electricity: ~$100
-	Health insurance: $46
-	Dental insurance: $40
-	Car payments: $350 ($240+$110)
-	Car and renters insurance: $192
-	Gas: $~200
-	Furniture: $139 ($71+$68)
-	BestBuy: $150
-	Internet: $55
-	Cell phones: $195
-	Gym: $43 (both my wife and I go)
-	Storage: $44
-	Various streaming services: $60 (Hulu, DirecTV Now, Netflix, Spotify)
-	CareCredit: $50 (almost done, paying a surgery)

A few disclaimers here: the storage unit we have to store my military uniforms that I’m obligated to have but have no room in our tiny apartment for, and consequentially we have other stuff in there that also can’t fit. Our internet I already haggled down from $70. My wife and I both have cars and public transportation isn’t really an option as the timing just doesn’t work (having to wait like half an hour for a bus when we have to be somewhere at x time). She has a 30mpg car which we owe about $10k/$15k on and mine is about 16mpg which I’ve wanted to get rid of for a more fuel efficient one but discovered I’m underwater and owe $3k/4.2k on a car worth about $1k. Poo. The high gas spending is because my wife has to go back and forth between locations for her schooling (some of her classes are 10-15 miles apart) and my work is 22 miles round trip which makes my commute about $4. Ultimately my wife drives quite a bit more than me and it’s more town miles and random so she has the more fuel efficient car whereas mine is all highway so I get the tank. 

My question ultimately is: what’s the best way to beat credit card debt? I tried debt consolidation but got denied by one place and the other one offered a “deal” on a 36% APR consolidation loan. Guess my credit score isn’t good enough for the lower APRs (duh? What do they expect...). I struck this from my options as my credit cards are all well below that interest rate so I’d be better off paying them off directly instead. 

I’ve been told to try contacting my bank to have them stop the interest on my cards and let me pay them off if possible, and that they may agree with the asterisk being that they would close my cards. Is this a good idea? If I’ll be getting charged $280 in interest per month now the biggest thing to make a dent in it is to stop that. 

I’ve looked into potential balance transfer cards but none can offer a big enough credit limit to truly offer consolidation that’s worthwhile or would be willing to give me the credit limit with my low credit score. I’m currently at a 620 credit score. 

If anyone could please help me I would greatly appreciate it. 

Edit: my wife will soon be a teacher (starting around January of 2020) and be making $50k per year. We could possibly get by until then just paying the minimums and then once she starts making that much we can rapidly pay down but I’d like to get a head start if possible and have a solid plan in action.",finance

***Red Dead Redemption 2*** is a Western-themed action-adventure game developed and published by Rockstar Games. It is a prequel to the 2010 game *Red Dead Redemption*, and the third entry in the *Red Dead* series. Set in 1899, it follows the story of outlaw Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van der Linde gang, and also details the time of a younger John Marston in the same gang and his eventual departure. It was universally acclaimed by critics, who praised the story, characters, open world, and considerable level of detail. The game generated **$725 million** in sales from its opening weekend, shipping over 17 million copies in two weeks 😱.

After a heist gone wrong in Blackwater, they're on the run, down a few members, and on the verge of capture, starvation, and succumbing to a snowstorm. As senior member **Arthur Morgan**, you're in the privileged position of being Dutch Van der Linde's right hand, privy to his machinations and included in the most important outings. Simply that been said it's one of the best story alongside “God of War” that you can play this year, It has all sort of emotions but mostly ( without spoiling it cause it’s that good of a story) It's a happy story at the start and than the true feeling begins in the later part.

&amp;#x200B;

* **World:** Red Dead Redemption 2's version of America is vast and wide open, stretching from snowy mountains and the Great Plains down to the original game's New Austin in the southwest. Further to the east is the Louisiana-inspired Deep South, which is still feeling the effects of the Civil War after nearly 40 years. There's a distinct shift when traveling from region to region; as grassy hillsides become alligator-filled swamps, Union veterans give way to angry Confederate holdouts, and good intentions and casual racism turn into desperation and outright bigotry. The makes the world of “RDR 2” feel rich and detailed as the snow leaves your footprints, Mud makes you dirty and you will need to shower to clean it ( and the **horse’s balls** details as well 🙊 ) and it both reacts to you and changes independently of your involvement; new buildings will go up as time goes on, and some of the people you talk to will remember you long after you first interacted with them (for better or worse). With that there is a moral system for been a good boy or bad boy during your playthrough. Been **Good** makes a lot of positive changes to the story as well as the world around you,while been **Bad** takes a opposite direction as cops will hunt you down and you will have to hide OR pay bounty to get rid of them.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/c2jsnqp09f621.jpg

* **Side-quests:** The Side-quests in this game is almost the same like “Witcher 3” has ( but not close to it ) as they feel like their own game. Robbing banks, doing Bounties, Poker, Dominos, fishing, hunting, theater show etc are some of the example of it and they are made really well.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Arthur's journal and himself:** One of the best, most understated details in the game is Arthur's journal, in which he recaps big events as well as random people you've met and more mundane, everyday things. He sketches places you go, doodles the plants and animals you find, and writes out thoughts he barely speaks out loud. The journal changes with your level of honor, but at least for a relatively honorable Arthur, the pages are filled with concerns and existential crises--inner turmoil over being either good or evil, for instance--that make you want to see him become a better person. And Arthur is an really interesting Protagonist as you play throughout the story, you get to know him better and get to know what an life he is living for the gang. Arthur is easily the best main-character “Rockstar Games” has made with the best voice-acting and motion capture they have done 👏

&amp;#x200B;

* **Camp System:** As the story tells that your gang is on the run, each places they place a Camp there ( which is basically your home point in this game ) where you can do many activities in there, example been you can rest there, clean your horse, talk with your gang, play many mini-games or just sit down near a fire and hear the stories they tell to each other.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Soundtrack &amp; Audio Design:** “Rockstar Games” has once again made a outstanding soundtrack to listen to and one of the best in 2018. It fits perfectly to the scene you are in the game and the location where the game is set **( May I! ( Unshaken ) been my favorite one and please do listen to the “The Game Awards 2018” “Red Dead Redemption 2” Music played there live because it's AWESOME ).** With the awesome soundtrack the audio design is top notch as you can hear the world around you alive ( Mud sound, bird chirping, horses riding, people fixing homes and many more ).

&amp;#x200B;

* **Characters:** All the characters you meet in “RDR 2” are really greatly written, All the gang members have there own story of how they got till here and what happened to them before, even all the people that are not in your gang member have their own story behind them. Characters model design is “outstanding” as all of them look great and are different than each other.

&amp;#x200B;

* **(\*) Animations &amp; Physics:** The Animations of the characters almost look like real people, they way like real, bend like real and the overall the capture done behind it is outstanding by “Rockstar Games”, A small bump onto a wall makes your character fly off the horse which was funny each time it happened to me. Physics is also well done as object falls like they should.

&amp;#x200B;

* **2-WAY Dialogue recorded:** What i mean by 2-way dialogue recorded is the same that was in 2018’s “Spider-Man”, when you are riding on the horse and are close to the other character, you hear him talking normally but when you distance yourself from them, he starts to shout talk to you as he is far away than you, This is a really small detail but worth the mention.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Customization:** There are a lot of ways to customize whatever you want in this game, like choosing a **dress**, **hair**, **beard** for Arthur, choosing Saddle for you horse, Customising the weapons and much more.
* I have to mention this as there are 59 weapons to get as you playthrough this game so good luck getting them all if you play to do an 100% run of it 👍

&amp;#x200B;

* Also have to mention, NO BROKEN SECTIONS OF THE STORY FOR DLC OR MICROTRANSACTION ( In story mode ). A+ for that 👍

&amp;#x200B;

* **Combat / Deadeye system:** The combat in “RDR 2” has not much improved than in “GTA 5” but its not a bad thing as combat for me was alright in here, the best part in “RDR 2” which makes a return from the last one is the **Deadeye System**, it's basically the Bullet-time from Max payne ( Oh man! How i miss the max payne series and want another one 😭 ) but here you can point into any part of the body to shoot at which feels badass and is just beautiful to watch how it works.

**Cons:**

* **Menu:** The Menu in “**RDR 2”** is not so great nor even close to been good, Its awful map with no whatsoever details on it, Inventory for food or drink etc is mix up so you be wondering what is what and where it is. I just did not liked it

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/v696x2v19f621.jpg

* **Too Sensitive Controls:** Another thing to mention is that the control could feel too sensitive with no option to change it ( When it comes out to PC, hopefully there we can change it ) which might cause some funny moments like falling of the horse each time but in places like close rooms, you can not get what you want as the character moves way too much even when rarely you just tap the controller stick.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Law will be on your butt all the time:** I felt like the law in this game is too sensitive as doing a small little crime will get you “Hunted” as the cops will hunt you down. And no-matter where you commit a crime, apparently there will always be one guy who witnesses it and than reports it to the cops ( It’s not a huge problem i had but had to menton it )

&amp;#x200B;

* **Too much Realistic:** Another problem that i enjoyed at the start of the game but got way too quickly boring and repetitive at the later part is the Animations of picking stuff up. It has its positives **( Which i mention in the ( \* ) pros section )** but it has its problems, For **Example:** picking stuff up from Tables / bodies etc takes a while, they first pick the body up than put there hand in the pockets and get the item, Same goes on baiting the animals, they turn the animal in the right direction and then slice the knife across the whole body and put the skin in there pocket OR the slow walking in the **Camp** or **Inside a building**, i mean come on let us choose to walk slow or fast there, I respect their attention to details and making the game realistic from But i think its too much ( you can fight me on it if you want to )

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/pun7uww19f621.jpg

* **Can’t get too Creatice during Missions:** During missions, you can not use your creativity to finish the mission which again is not a big deal but i have to mention each and every problems that **I** faced during my playthrough, **Example** given like during a mission where you have to kill a person but before doing that you have to follow him to get to the location where the game is programed to let you kill him. I mean like why follow him if i could just shoot him whenever i want and than run away. I don't understand 💁 ). I can understand that they made this intensenal to tell the story of the game but still i have to mention it.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Economic system breaking down:** I don't know if i am the only one who felt like the first bank heist mission just breaks the money system of the game. By breaking i don’t mean glitches or bugs but what i mean is that after that mission, i felt like i have enough money to almost buy everything in the game and it made me felt like doing the other bank robberies mission was not necessarily for those people who did the main-story only. BUT i had to do them for my 100% run and they were not bad at all.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Final Verdict:**

# 10 / 10 ( MASTERPIECE )

https://i.redd.it/vd116lx29f621.jpg

&amp;#x200B;

Even if i have mentioned a lot of the negatives about the game and things i hated the most, You all though i will be giving it a 9 or 8 out of 10 and you were all wrong, **“Rockstar Games” “Red Dead Redemption 2”** is a **masterpiece** of a game as they have indeed shown us that they worked hard on this game to be as perfect as they could have made, it has great story, great characters, beautiful world ( That snow 😮 ) and many more which has made this game the best game “Rockstar Games” has made as of now **and a “must-to-buy” Game from me.**

**It is available to get on Playstation Store OR Xbox Games Store for $59.99 for Standard Edition, $79.99 for special Edition OR $99.99 for Ultimate Edition**

personalfinance,200k Student Loan Debt Making Slightly under 52K a year.,"Title says it all. I've been meaning to post here for some time, but I saw that someone with a similar amount posted and it pushed it to do it. Long story short, I have a stupid poli sci PhD, and I have a lot of debt that grew from interest since undergrad. I don't blame anyone but myself, but I wish I had parents that were a little tougher on me, but they are immigrants, and really believed in education. Had no idea what I was doing.  I was told, go to XXXXX school, it will pay off in the end. You're more than welcome to call me stupid, because I deserve it. I'm literally on the verge of killing myself over my debt. This is not a joke. This is a bit of a throwaway account due to this.

&amp;#x200B;

I have both federal and private. I am on a rate reduction program with Navient paying around $600 dollars a month. My take home pay is around 1.5K biweekly after everything. I haven't started paying back my federal loans yet. Last year, made only 15K a year working part-time. Now, I have a great job in research administration, working for the state at 52K a year. My coworkers are great and the benefits are amazing, but no way in hell I can pay off this debt with the interest on 52K a year.  I paid off all my credit cards, set up a retirement fund with my job. I moved back with my parents. Do not pay rent, but I offer to pay other expenses when needed. it is not much.  I don't have a car payment, I only pay for gas, as I drive a hand-me-down. I rarely go out to eat, and have been storing money away to start paying back high interest rate loans after I paid off credit cards and put a small emergency fund.  The only expenses I have are gym, pool, and now a boxing class which is the only thing that gives me sanity. The gym is less than 25 dollars a month, the pool is about $100 for the whole year (and I go weekly), the boxing classes will be less than $100 for four months.  I always try to see if I can do something cheaper (i.e. change a logic board on mac and upgrade the OS instead of buying a new computer, learning how to take care of my car myself instead of paying ungodly amounts to a mechanic, etc).  I bring my own lunch, coffee, ect. Doing as much as  I can. Trying to be a little kind to myself seeing that I brought my salary from 17K at a shit job to 52K at a much better place in less than one year. But, the reality is that my job, as great as it is, might not give me much room to grow in the long run. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other option I have is to move to another state that will pay more, but my expenses might be more. Since I'm in political science, DC might be a lot better, but it can get expensive.  Started to teach college classes on the side, but they pay less than 3K per class for the whole semester.  It's a lot of work for little pay, though I love it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought about freelancing, but I'm not sure how much I can rake in. Was wondering if anyone here made some decent extra income with freelancing? 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm screwed forever to the point I don't want anyone to marry me to carry this burden.  Sorry, but thanks for listening. All I can think of this Christmas is how screwed I am, and I really don't blame anyone but myself as I mentioned. If I ever have kids, I will try to teach them proper financial management. 

&amp;#x200B;

I follow this thread with another username, and you all have been great. Open to any and all (brutal advice). Cheers.

worldpolitics,What is Globalism? Globalism is Neoliberalism which is Corporatism,"The term Globalism has been around from at least the 1960's but its origins come from Cecil Rhodes Round Tables which were set up around 1900 as a mechanism for Rhodes and his allies from the British and South African Oligarchs to take over the world.

Globalism is another term for Neoliberalism, which is another term for Corporatism.

It is principally pushed by Neoliberal wealthy elites who pretend to be lefties, but are actually Corporatists or Corporate Fascists.

**Globalism**

The aim of Globalism is to transfer all power and wealth from ordinary people to a handful of Banking Elites, Oligarchs and major Corporate CEO's. The ultimate aim is to set up an anti democratic, authoritarian one world government where ordinary people are effectively serfs and have no say, in a system of Neo-Feudalism. We are very nearly already there.

This is being constantly carried out by transferring ever increasing powers from elected local governments to massive governmental Super States, such as the EU or the Federal government in Washington DC.

A great example of a Globalist policy was Obama's Corporate Power Grab TPP and TTIP, Corporate protectionist deals, which transferred power from elected legislatures to transnational tribunals staffed by Corporate lawyers acting as Judge and Jury.

TPP, TISA and TTIP agreements are massive Corporate power grabs dressed up as trade deals http://ian56.blogspot.com/2015/11/tpp-tisa-and-ttip-agreements-are.html

""Neo-libs"" are NOT Centrists. They are extremist supporters of Perpetual War, Corruption, Corporatism, Authoritarianism &amp; the Transfer of all wealth &amp; power from ordinary ppl to the Oligarchs &amp; CEOs in the top 0.01%.

What is Globalism? Clue: Its NOT what the Corporate Establishment tells you it is http://ian56.blogspot.com/2017/11/what-is-globalism.html

Neoliberalism. The ideology that dare not speak it's name is actually a New, More Dangerous, Form of Corporatism http://www.softpanorama.org/Skeptics/Political_skeptic/Neoliberalism/index.shtml

I’m 28F, and I have a chronic illness (endometriosis, if you’re curious.) I’d like to get advice on the best way to save for future expected medical expenses. Here are the fast facts:

- My disease is progressive, but it won’t kill or (probably) disable me.
- Patients with my disease can expect outpatient surgery every two or so years, along with basic care like doctor visits, prescriptions, tests, etc.
- If you’re familiar with the disease, you might know it causes infertility. I’m not looking to have kids, so no need for advice on saving for fertility treatments.
- I have decent health insurance through my employer. It’s an open access plan (OAP). It does not offer an HSA, but I do have an FSA.
- I am building up my emergency savings through a savings account. There is currently about $2,000 in there, and it has an interest rate of 2%.
- Yes, I have student loans, but no credit card debt.

personalfinance,My Mom Lost over 10K Trading Options... How to fix this,"I told her that the secret is buying diversified funds and holding onto them, but she saw a coworker trading options and secretly started trading them. I don't fully understand options trading and ***neither does she***. That's what so hurtful about this, is she could go into something so woefully unprepared without consulting me. We sold them all at a huge loss so that we can take advantage of tax selling, and I reinvested what was left in VTI. So, the question is, how can we fix this? I've convinced her to put a substantial amount of money in a 5 year CD with a good rate. She told me that she wouldn't need to access the money these next 5 years and she's turning 60 soon, so I imagine she'll be able to access her IRA within the next year (someone correct me if I'm wrong). But we lost 14k. I'd like to know what's a good benchmark for us to aim to earn to replace this, when factoring future value and things of that nature. I'm still so shocked. She told me she lost some money on investments but I didn't know the full extent until yesterday.

Thanks

Edit: ""There's no fixing this"" comments are unhelpful. Please stop being so pedantic. Realistically, I'd like to earn the money back while accounting for the future value, assuming an interest rate of 3%",finance

worldpolitics,Are The Top 20% Here to Serve Others?,"The top 20% of taxpayers pay over 80% of Federal income tax.  This indicates quite a difference between the upper quintile and all the rest: intelligence seems a much more defining property amongst doctors, lawyers, business owners, college profs and the like.

It seems therefore that society naturally must harness the top 20% with things like the IRS and all sorts of regulatory bodies.  Create a republic that votes for such things while giving the 20% the illusion of freedom.  After all, we know who **really** owns the real estate, the stocks and bonds, the small businesses.  Just don’t pay the taxes (protection money) and see who really owns those things.

Instead of black people being the slaves, now the masters are the voting public, the overseers are the IRS and such agencies, and the top 20% is the new slave class.

personalfinance,Continue to save money for down payment of 20% to buy house or aggressively pay off student loans and put down less than 20%?,"Husband and I are looking to buy a house in the next 6 months. We both have student loans and have a goal to pay them off ASAP and have already been aggressively doing so, but know it is a good idea to put at least 20% down on a house. Trying to determine what the best course of action would be. I make ~$110,000 per year before taxes and he makes ~$101,000 before taxes

Specifics:
wife student loans: ~$30,658 left to pay with 5% interest rate + ~$50,000 left to pay parents (with no interest) 
husband student loans: ~$132,000 with interest rates between 5.16% - 6.55%
husband also has car loan of ~$9600 left at 1.99% interest 

I currently have about $65,000 in savings and he has about $15,000 in savings. We recently got married and wanted to revisit what would be the best for saving money in the long run. 

Should we put those savings toward his highest interest loan and then put less than 20% down? What other things do we need to consider?

Edit for other details:
currently we are renting an apartment for $995/month with an additional $200 per month in utilities/internet. 
i am paying the minimum per month on my 5% interest loans and we are putting as much as possible toward husband's highest interest loan. 
husband's loan payments total around $2500 per month for all debts (student loan + car), my loans total around $315 per month for federal loans and $1450 per month for parent loan
we are maximizing matched contributions with employer retirement and in general are continuing to live minimally (basically like we did during school).

personalfinance,"I have a 60K student loan with a 4.6% fixed interest rate and a $1,775/month minimum. I have the ability to aggressively pay it off in 2019 - should I?","Hello! I'm a 29F based in an east coast city in the US. Here are more details on my question in the title. 


At the beginning of the loan's life (I refinanced/consolidated in April 2018), the loan was at $95K, but in Sept. 2018 I started aggressively paying the loan down, bringing me to where it's currently at. I have the ability to continue paying the loan down aggressively in this way, paying it off by Sept. 2019 based on my estimate that I can pay ~8,000 on the loan per month (through my full-time job income and freelance work). 


My question is: should I do that? 


The idea of paying this loan off so quickly excites me so much, but I'm starting to think that I could be doing something more meaningful or effective with the extra money, and just pay my loan down at its minimum.


A few more details:

* Full-time salaried income is $95K

* Take-home after deductions = $4,400/month

* Expenses excluding the loan = $1,900/month

* I don't have other debts

* I'm contributing to my 401K to receive my employer's match

* I expect income from freelance work to be ~3-6K per month (after estimated taxes I'll pay quarterly) over the next 12 months

* The things I can think of that I'd like to do with my extra money (if my debt didn't exist) are things like save for a down payment on buying a home, investing more in my 401K or exploring other investment options, or spending the money on travel and lifestyle


A few more refining questions:

* I've read through a lot of the advice on this subreddit and an emergency fund is something recommended as a top priority before tackling low-interest debts, but I need a really compelling reason to put my money into an emergency fund right now instead of my debt (or something else) because I feel confident that no matter what happens I'll be able to hack-it-together to make ends meet. Thoughts?

* The ultimate question is: should I aggressively pay off my debt with my extra income, or should I put my extra income elsewhere?",finance

Any idea if credit union is the way to go? We don't need to take money out really, I almost never carry cash as it is.

&amp;#x200B;

**Accounts - totalling around $50k.**

* Personal (mine): $10,300
* Personal (partner's): $5500
* Emergency: $4500. Aim to get $15k before slowing down a bit on it.
* Wedding: $900 (wedding is in March, we've been spending as we go along and put down deposits. aiming for $5500  total cost and on track). I deposit $67.57 weekly and that can be put elsewhere once the wedding is over.
* Bills: $3500 (we deposit more in here than we need, just in case we get caught out by a larger than expected bill, etc. I try to keep about $1k float between the credit card we use and the total in bills. We pay off the card in full every month and use it to collect points.)
* University: $11500 - we are waiting until we are permanent residents (applying early 2019, expected approval is late 2019, early 2020). It is for my one partner - however, we both invest equally. Aim is to get $30k total.
* Spending Money: $200/week. We put in around $200 a week that we can use on Ubers, food delivery, nights out, movies, etc.
* House savings: $4000 We only started doing it in September
* Visa: $9000, it will cost around $10k all up including getting records and background checks, etc. Once this is spent, we can begin to invest this elsewhere
* Holiday fund: $2000 - again only started in September. Majority will go towards our honeymoon in early 2019.

Only cards we currently spend on:

* My personal account
* My partner's personal account
* Spending money

The rest we pay via credit card and if the money is from a different category, we do an internal transfer.

I know we are on a really good track. To be honest, I am better than my partner, and a lot of it is due to my planning and getting us on this track. I just want to ensure that I am doing the best we can!

U.S. stock markets suffered their steepest Christmas Eve decline in decades Monday, defying the best efforts by the Trump administration to instill confidence, and coming very close to ending a record 10-year upward run.

By the end of Monday’s shortened holiday trading session, the great bull market that began in the lows of March 2009 lay lifeless, capping a three-week, 16 percent sell-off of the S&amp;P 500.

President Trump and administration officials faced intense scrutiny of their unorthodox attempts to steady nervous markets. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s phone calls Sunday to major U.S. banks further stoked anxiety among traders, while Trump’s Monday tweet attacking the Federal Reserve for not having “a feel for the Market” appeared to exacerbate the day’s sell-off.

Investors have been shaken by recent economic and political ­developments, including the abrupt resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis; a partial federal government shutdown; an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve; speculation that Trump might seek to fire Fed chief Jerome H. Powell; Mnuchin’s unusual calls to U.S. banks; and Trump’s sudden decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria against the counsel of his national security team.

Do you think the stock market will continue to tank?

I commute two hours round trip every day and will continue to do that for Spring 2019 semester coming up, but I need to move out in the Fall of next year(living here is negatively affecting both my grades and my overall college experience). 

My tuition is cheap, I get maximum PELL grant and only have to take out about an extra $6,000 in federal loans every year. This year I applied for the PLUS loan with my parents, and my denial gave me an extra $4,000 in federal loans(for transportation and supplies, etc.), bringing my federal loans to $10,000 for this year. I only needed $6,000 in loans to pay for my tuition though, the rest of that was for any other expenses I may have.

These are the only student loans I have(I went to community college for a year), and after this semester I'll need at least two more years of college before I can graduate. Getting a loan through my parents(such as the PLUS loan) is very unlikely as I do not believe they qualify, since they have bad credit and filed for bankruptcy about 2-3 years ago. 

Finding a co-signer on a loan would be difficult, most of my relatives have denied being a co-signer in the past and I'm fairly certain none of them would co-sign. The only people who would be willing to co-sign would be my parents and POSSIBLY(but not likely), one of my brothers. Any advice/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",finance
Bitcoin,Bitcoin as the Ultimate Haven from Hyperinflation: A Country By Country Analysis Of Worldwide Fiat Currency Inflation,"[https:\/\/cryptoiq.co\/bitcoin-as-the-ultimate-haven-from-hyperinflation-a-country-by-country-analysis-of-worldwide-fiat-currency-inflation\/](https://i.redd.it/h9wdsyr11n621.png)

Bitcoin was created during the [Great Recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession)  that started in 2008, when the governments of the world printed  trillions of dollars to bail out banks and corporations. Satoshi  Nakamoto intended Bitcoin to be a decentralized form of money that could  not be printed by governments at will. In the the [Genesis Block](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Genesis_block) Satoshi included the message “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of the second bailout for banks.” 

Fiat currencies continue to  be the dominant form of global currency, but it seems logical that, if  fiat currencies were to hyperinflate and collapse, Bitcoin would become  the dominant global currency. 

This is because Bitcoin can  be sent instantly anywhere in the world and is cryptographically  secure. It is easy enough to integrate Bitcoin into any e-commerce store  or physical store, and the customers of the future will be able to send  Bitcoin from their smartphones via QR codes. Therefore, if fiat  currency becomes obsolete, Bitcoin could seamlessly take its place and  keep the global economy running. 

There has been plenty of  hype that fiat currencies are collapsing, but this article will explore  the current state of major fiat currencies in the world to ascertain the  true situation. This is important information since the rate of fiat  currency inflation by country is an important factor that will determine  Bitcoin adoption rates and ultimately Bitcoin’s price.  

**United States’ Inflation Rate**

The United States is  perhaps the best place to start an analysis of global fiat inflation,  since the USD is the world’s dominant fiat currency and perhaps the most  stable long term. That being said, [there is 2-3 percent annual inflation in the United States](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/debt/current). 

If we split the difference  at a 2.5 percent annual inflation rate, it means $100,000 stored in a  bank will lose a whopping $22,400 of value over the course of 10 years,  corresponding to 22.4 percent inflation per 10 years. Therefore, even in  the United States, saving money long term seems impractical, and this  essentially forces people to risk their savings by investing in the  hopes that the money earned from investing will outpace inflation.

It appears inflation will only worsen in the United States [since the national debt is approaching $22 trillion](https://www.transparency.treasury.gov/dataset/debt-to-the-penny),  with a budget deficit of $1 trillion per year and growing. This  situation will likely lead to increased money printing, which would  increase the inflation rate. Therefore, saving money in USD long term  does not make financial sense. Bitcoin is an alternative way to store  money long term, although Bitcoin has yet to mature and can be extremely  volatile from year to year.    

**Euro (EUR) Inflation Rate Is 37.5 percent Relative To USD During The Last 10 Years**

One of the primary global  currencies besides the USD is the Euro (EUR). For the rest of this  global analysis, fiat currencies will be compared to the USD exchange  rate to determine inflation, but it must be kept in mind that the USD  itself is inflating at the rate of 2 to 3 percent per year. 

When the EUR launched in  1999, the exchange rate was one USD per 0.85 EUR. By 2002 the EUR  weakened to 1.16 EUR per USD. The EUR then entered a period of vigorous  strengthening, and the exchange rate fell to 0.64 EUR per USD by 2008.  The Great Recession caused the EUR to begin weakening versus the USD  long term, [and currently each USD is worth 0.88 EUR](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-ab&amp;ei=_vwfXK7XGM_U5gKtlKvAAg&amp;q=USD+to+EUR&amp;oq=USD+to+EUR&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..35i39j0i131j0i20i263j0i67j0l6.19695.20928..21251...0.0..0.170.1375.0j10......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j0i131i67j0i10.9LqMGGbr-pc). This represents 37.5 percent inflation relative to the USD in roughly 10 years.

Back to the storing money  in a bank analogy, $100,000 of EUR stored over the past 10 years would  have lost the EUR inflation rate + the USD inflation rate. With this  sort of inflation rate it seems dangerous to store money in EUR long  term. 

It gets worse. The EUR is one of the top global fiat currencies, and there are many currencies doing worse than the EUR.

**United Kingdom’s Pound Has 65 Percent Inflation Relative to USD in 11 Years**

The United Kingdom (UK) is  one of nine European Union (EU) countries that does not use the EUR, and  eventually, the UK will leave the EU via the Brexit. However, the  native Great Britain Pound (GBP) has done far worse than the Euro, with  the exchange rate going from 0.48 GBP per USD in 2007 [to 0.79 GBP per USD currently](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-ab&amp;ei=SCUgXKTTJait5wLpjJ7wAw&amp;q=usd+to+GPB&amp;oq=usd+to+GPB&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i20i263j0i10l9.260496.260937..261373...0.0..0.757.1701.3-1j0j1j1......0....1..gws-wiz.......0j0i71.th3r4brE1so). This is 65 percent inflation relative to the USD during the past 11 years.

**Canada’s Inflation Rate Is 45.2 Percent Relative to USD During the Last 7 Years**

The United States’ neighbor  to the north is similar to the United States in many respects. It is a  fully developed and industrialized first world country. However the  native fiat currency, the Canadian Dollar (CAD), has been experiencing  severe inflation since the Great Recession. In 2011 1 USD was worth 0.95  CAD, and now [the exchange rate is 1.36 CAD per USD](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-ab&amp;ei=CwEgXKjHJ43W5gLB3ovIAg&amp;q=USD+to+CAD&amp;oq=USD+to+CAD&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..35i39j0i67j0l5j0i20i263j0l2.11095.12502..12669...0.0..0.180.1420.0j10......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j0i131j0i131i67.LU6NdnNp6OY).  This represents 43.2 percent inflation relative to the USD since 2011,  and of course, the USD has an underlying inflation rate as well of 16.2  percent during the last 7 years. 

Even in the first world  country of Canada, it is becoming impossible to save cash for retirement  or even for short-term goals like buying a house, forcing people to  invest in the risky stock market. 

**Mexico’s Inflation Rate Is 97.6 Percent Relative to the USD During Past 10 Years**

Since the 2008 financial crisis, the exchange rate of the Mexican Peso (MXN) [has gone from 10.12 MXN per USD to 20 MXN per USD](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-ab&amp;ei=0wIgXPL0H4av5wK2sYTwAw&amp;q=USD+to+MXN&amp;oq=USD+to+MXN&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..35i39j0i67l2j0l7.30248.32925..33191...1.0..4.186.2188.0j15......0....1..gws-wiz.....6..0i71j0i20i263j0i131j0i10i67j0i131i67.c2Z-mBUt8Vg).  This represents 97.6 percent inflation relative to the USD, and USD  inflation means the true Mexican inflation rate is well over 100 percent  per 10 years. This sort of inflation rate ensures that people have to  work their entire lives and can never retire, and overall, this sort of  inflation can cause the entire economy of Mexico to struggle. Bitcoin  seems like an obvious alternative to holding MXN long term.

It is quite shocking that a  country bordering the United States has such high inflation, yet the  mainstream media never mentions it.

**Russia Has 194 Percent Inflation Relative to USD Since the 2008 Great Recession**

Russia is a global  superpower, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $1.58 trillion versus  the United States’ $19.39 trillion GDP. Despite being a superpower, the  native currency of Russia, the Russian Ruble (RUB), [has gone from 23.48 RUB per USD in 2008 to 69.08 RUB per USD currently](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-ab&amp;ei=ABEgXPSXJ8zt5gKKg5TQAw&amp;q=USD+to+RUB&amp;oq=USD+to+RUB&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3.0.35i39j0l2j0i10j0l6.475511.475887..476161...0.0..0.150.395.0j3......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j0i20i263.iFSbX92HC44).  This yields a 194 percent 10 year inflation rate relative to the USD.  Clearly, the Great Recession that started in 2008 is a common point when  fiat inflation accelerated in many countries around the world. 

**Japan’s Inflation Rate Is 46 Percent Relative to USD Over the Past 7 Years**

Japan is a first-world  country and has one of the most important stock markets in the world.  The GDP of Japan is ranked number three in the world at nearly $5  trillion. However, its inflation rate is far higher than the United  States, at least since 2011. In 2011, the exchange rate was 76 JPY per  USD, [but it has now risen to 111 JPY per USD](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-ab&amp;ei=2Q4gXJLQF-aD5wLPvoagAw&amp;q=USD+to+JPY&amp;oq=USD+to+JPY&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l10.549600.550051..550359...0.0..0.138.408.0j3......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j0i20i263j0i10.Rh1PhQhtYuo),  a 46 percent inflation rate relative to the USD over the past 7 years.  This is actually almost exactly the same as Canada’s inflation rate. 

**China’s Inflation Is Only 14.4 Percent Relative to USD Since 2013, but China Tightly Controls the CNY**

China is the second ranking  economy in the world with a $12 trillion GDP. Its position as the  number one trading partner of the United States [gives it power to manipulate the exchange rate of its native currency the Chinese Yuan](https://www.thebalance.com/how-does-china-influence-the-u-s-dollar-3970466)  (CNY). The CNY actually strengthened greatly versus the USD until 2013,  when China relaxed its control over the CNY exchange rate to make it  more competitive in the global import and export markets. Chinese  control over the CNY and therefore, control over the profitability of  Chinese imports, is a primary reason for the “trade war” between China  and the United States.

Since allowing the CNY to lose value relative to the USD, [the exchange rate has gone from 6.04 CNY per USD in 2013 to 6.91 CNY per USD currently](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-ab&amp;ei=3RIgXL7MJ6zn5gLLvKeYAg&amp;q=USD+to+CNY&amp;oq=USD+to+CNY&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3.0.35i39j0l2j0i20i263j0l6.29954.30257..30532...0.0..0.155.436.0j3......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j0i67j0i131.EpXnxImcShc),  a 14.4 percent inflation relative to the USD in 5 years. China is an  outlier and has one of the lowest inflation rates relative to the USD. 

**Switzerland Has One Of The Lowest Inflation Rates At Less Than 5 percent Relative To The USD In 7 Years**

Switzerland has remained  independent of the European Union and does not use the EUR. Instead, it  uses the Swiss Franc (CHF). The CHF actually strengthened greatly  relative to the USD during the Great Recession, but the trend reversed  in 2011. There was a rapid devaluation of the CHF relative to the USD  from 0.76 CHF per USD to 0.94 CHF per USD during 2011. In The 7 years  since then, the CHF has roughly five percent inflation relative to the  USD [and sits at 0.99 CHF per USD](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-ab&amp;ei=_BIgXPWAOe_n5gLb7ZCwAw&amp;q=USD+to+CHF&amp;oq=USD+to+CHF&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3.0.0l10.1895188.1895509..1895781...0.0..0.143.260.0j2......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j0i20i263j0i10.XoRc7Y6MTXs) currently. 

That being said, it cannot  be forgotten that the USD itself is experiencing 2.5 percent inflation  per year, so even countries that have low inflation rates relative to  the USD have a significant inflation rate overall. 

**India Has Seen 79 Percent Inflation Relative to USD Since the Great Recession Began**

India has the sixth highest  GDP in the world at $2.6 trillion, and the second highest population at  1.34 billion. Since the Great Recession began, the Indian Rupee (INR)  has gone from 39.18 per USD [to 70.14 INR per USD](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-ab&amp;ei=ZRogXJuxHsXl5gKLh5PIAQ&amp;q=USD+to+INR&amp;oq=USD+to+INR&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3.0.35i39j0l9.566477.568653..569294...1.0..0.159.846.0j6......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j0i67j0i20i263.w-3euuE3too),  a 79 percent inflation relative to the USD in 11 years. Unfortunately,  India is slowly making Bitcoin more illegal and could fully outlaw it,  so citizens may have to break the law in the future in the event that  inflation accelerates and Bitcoin becomes a preferred way to store  money.

**Indonesia Has 76 Percent Inflation Relative to the USD in Seven Years**

Indonesia has a population  of 265 million, not far behind the United States, but its GDP is 20  times less than the United States at $1 trillion. Part of the reason  Indonesia’s economy is weaker may be that the native fiat currency, the  Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) has gone from 8,250 per USD in 2011 [to 14,550 IDR per USD currently](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-ab&amp;ei=Tx4gXIzTAubR5gLN_ZqYBA&amp;q=USD+to+IDR&amp;oq=USD+to+IDR&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i67j0i20i263j0l2j0i10j0l5.3853.5843..6033...0.0..0.192.1321.0j9......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j35i39j0i131j0i131i67j0i10i67.EB2sx66Evdg).  This is 76 percent inflation relative to the USD in 7 years, around the  same rate as India. However, Indonesia has banned Bitcoin as of 2018,  which would make it difficult for citizens to use Bitcoin in the event  inflation spirals out of control.

**Brazil Has 152 percent Inflation Relative To USD In Past Seven Years, Despite Being the Strongest Economy In South America**

Brazil has the most  powerful economy in South America with a $2 trillion GDP. However, South  America as a whole is experiencing out of control hyperinflation, and  Brazil seems to be feeling the effects. The Brazilian Real (BRL) has  gone from 1.55 per USD in 2011 [to 3.91 BRL per USD currently](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-ab&amp;ei=WiAgXJOHOaGu5wLc4KbwAQ&amp;q=usd+to+BRL&amp;oq=usd+to+BRL&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3.0.0l10.5696.7084..7377...0.0..0.153.692.0j5......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j35i39j0i67j0i10i67j0i131i67j0i20i263.StJ0S35pDUk).  This is 152 percent inflation relative to the USD in 7 years. There  does not appear to be any inflation safe haven in South America, and  this could make South America a Bitcoin adoption hotspot. 

**Venezuela Has Ridiculous Inflation Around One million  percent Per Year; Bolivar Collapsing**

The end game of fiat  currency inflation, if left unchecked, is currency collapse. A classic  example of currency collapse is the situation in Venezuela, where the [Cafe Con Leche Index](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-venezuela-cafe-con-leche-index/)  suggests 400,000 percent inflation per year, although if a shorter term  average is used it is 1 million percent per year or more. It would be  shocking if the native fiat currency of Venezuela, the Sovereign Bolivar  (VES), is still usable one year from now. Bitcoin is legal in  Venezuela, and there is plenty of news which indicates people are  abandoning the VES for Bitcoin. 

**South Korea Has Zero Inflation Relative to the USD**

South Korea is considered a  powerful economy relative to most of the world, with a GDP of $1.5  trillion despite the country’s small size. The South Korean Won (SKW) [has essentially zero inflation relative to the USD long term](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-ab&amp;ei=YyAgXK7oCMrH5gLrrar4AQ&amp;q=usd+to+SKW&amp;oq=usd+to+SKW&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0j0i22i10i30j0i22i30j0i22i10i30.1250948.1252381..1252672...1.0..0.169.723.0j5......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j35i39j0i67j0i131j0i20i263j0i10.pzTGMj2AtRs)  aside from an exchange rate shock during the 2008 Great Recession. That  being said, inflation is still a reality in South Korea since the USD  has average inflation of 2.5 percent per year.

**Australia Has 53 Percent Inflation Relative to the USD in Seven Years**

Australia essentially has a  continent to itself, but it is not isolated from the global fiat  inflation crisis. The AUD actually strengthened massively versus the USD  from 2001 to 2011. However, the trend reversed, and the exchange rate  has gone from 0.93 AUD per USD in 2011 [to 1.42 AUD per USD currently](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-ab&amp;ei=TiYgXIaTNcXI5gLwzbiYBA&amp;q=usd+to+aud&amp;oq=usd+to+aud&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3.0.0l10.300921.302754..303384...5.0..0.148.570.0j4......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j35i39j0i20i263j0i67j0i131i67.9k9xAQC65rU). This is 53 percent inflation relative to the USD in seven years. 

**Israel Has Zero Inflation Relative To USD Long Term**

Israel is in the Middle  East but does not have strong connections to the economy of the rest of  the Middle East and, apparently, a different monetary policy than most  of the rest of the world. Israel is only comparable to the United  States, South Korea, and perhaps Switzerland when it comes to fiat  currency since [the Israeli New Shekel (ILS) has practically zero inflation relative to the USD long term](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-ab&amp;ei=fycgXNibOcGs5wKQ4KvIAQ&amp;q=usd+to+ILS&amp;oq=usd+to+ILS&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0l10.266526.266916..267250...0.0..0.154.431.0j3......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j35i39j0i20i263j0i10.DZ_ZueeN1tM)  although there are shorter term oscillations. Like the other countries  listed with zero USD relative inflation, inflation still exists because  the USD itself is inflating. 

In total, there are 180  fiat currencies in the world, and here, we’re covering just 16 of them.  We could keep going, but the trend is already clear. Even in major  countries with powerful economies, inflation has become a serious issue,  with some major countries experiencing 50-200 percent inflation  relative to the USD over the past decade, and those numbers don’t even  take in the 2.5 percent per year USD inflation underlying them. 

It is possible that  worldwide fiat inflation will accelerate due to the growing global debt  crisis. That’s especially true if an economic recession occurs since  that would force a rapid increase in money printing. 

So we’re in a global  situation that needs to be actively monitored. Even if the status quo is  maintained long term, most of the world’s population cannot  realistically save money for the future because it’s going to lose value  over time. This is a major shift from our parents’ generation when  saving money was the smart thing to do. 

The good news is Bitcoin is  waiting on the sidelines. It’s ready to become the global currency if  fiat currency collapses worldwide. Even if fiat does not totally  collapse, perhaps once Bitcoin matures and becomes more stable, it will  be a good option for saving money long term since its value is  independent of fiat inflation.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Company I Work for Went Bankrupt - My Plan,"Wanted to lay out my current scenario and vet the plan with r/personalfinance to see if my plan holds any water.  I have worked at a startup for past 5 years (first job out of college), and was recently terminated as we are filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy (involuntary termination).  My health, vision, and dental benefits end 12/31/2018.  I have a Simple IRA with my current employer, and a personal Roth IRA. 

&amp;#x200B;

My Life Plan:

I currently am studying for the GRE with the plan to apply to Grad schools this spring (Deadline March 15) that begin in September 2019.  There is a prerequisite requirement to have an Accounting course so in the meantime I am also taking an introductory accounting class, studying for GRE and getting applications together. 

&amp;#x200B;

My Financial Plan (9 months until school, and taking on Financial Aid):

I have about 6 months runway of cash (all expenses) inclusive of payment for current loans.  

1. Apply for unemployment insurance (available for me as I was involuntarily terminated).  

2. Apply for Federal I plan to open a Schwab Traditional IRA, and roll over the Simple IRA into that (been 2 years since first contribution so I believe this would be penalty free).  

3. After the application period is over (March 15th), apply for jobs (or begin driving uber) to generate some amount of sustainable income (\~$1,500/month) to bridge the final 6 months of time before Grad School begins.  Begin 2 year full time grad school program, and start to pay off loans beginning in May 2022, (will likely have to take on \~$70K in loans to complete my program).   

&amp;#x200B;

General:

While this is a scary time indeed, I feel good that I can step back and revaluate my current scenario and make a career leap.  It is reassuring that I do have the runway, a retirement account, and could get myself organized enough to come up with a plan.  Maybe I'm numb, but right now the unknown is exciting and I'm eager for the next 9 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any glaring red flags in my plan?

&amp;#x200B;

Note: \~$15,000 in wages are owed to me, and planning to file petition when the bankruptcy information is received.  Is there anything else I can do to further the chances that I see this money?  Any other general advise for the company bankruptcy portion of this whole scenario?",finance

personalfinance,21 and fed up with my lack of financial knowledge regarding savings and credit,"I hope I can give everyone enough information to understand the position. I am 22 years old and despite having a very financially stable guardian growing up, I didn't pick up on any of her financial knowledge. Currently my wife and I are both students. She is finishing school this upcoming Spring Semester where she will get her teaching license. I will be finishing my Masters in 2021. My Masters is in Arts Administration so there isn't much financial payoff from either of our degrees. Luckily Grants and Scholarships have kept our combined student dept under 15k. 

Our current financial situation is poor. We have only $2000 in savings and that is quickly dropping. We are both making 10.00 an hour at our jobs (Fast Food) and we do summer acting gigs during the summer that only pay about 300/week combined. We don't have any credit cards open, I've been researching across Reddit why I should have a credit card and I'm just still confused because I was raised to avoid them. 

I am banking with Wells Fargo,  I'm trying to leave ASAP, and Mountain America, which doesn't get used ever. Our monthly charges are only about 800/month. However, that is going up soon because I am now off my mothers health insurance and will be starting to take over my car insurance in February (I lucked out with a guardian who offered to pay for it for a while). I'm worried I am in a position where when I graduate I won't have strong credit, no savings, and no financial knowledge to understand how to maneuver the ""real world"". 

Also, am I in a position based off this information to look into Ally bank savings? It seems really nice to be able to put my permanent  savings there since I won't need to touch it very often at all. 

I'm still reading as much as I can online but I found that discussions with real people are more helpful for me. I work long hours during Christmas break, so I won't be able to respond too quickly, but I will do my best. I will sit down with my wife tonight and we will look through all of this together. 

tl;dr Wife and I are making very little each month to maintain bills and savings. I don't know how to build credit or what I should be doing with my savings. Send help.",finance

Escrow is used to pay our taxes, home insurance, and PMI.    


House has supposedly increased in value $19,000 on Redfin.  If we choose to refinance, we would probably get a higher loan rate 4.625%, and we would need to pay a $300 reappraisal fee plus a fee for the loan officer.

Our PMI is $110/month and does not decrease over time  

If we want to do the ""auto-termination"" PMI option down to 78% instead of refinancing, we will need to pay $46,679.

personalfinance,Almost 30 and determined to pay off my debt but have questions about settling credit cards,"Hi PF, 

I'm determined to finally tackle my finances this year and I'm excited to improve my situation but I'm self-taught and just trying to make sure I have a good grasp on what my best options are. 

Here's a pretty quick break down:

- I have student loans (~$60,000) and credit card debt (~$20,000).
- After taxes, I make about $42,700, my annual fixed expenses around $37,700 (~$5000/year for discretionary spending)
- I have 3 credit cards, the largest balance is ~$12,000, the second largest is ~$6000, and the smallest (and highest interest rate) is ~$2000. My plan is to tackle this debt using the avalanche method. I would like to pay off the $2000 debt and work my way up. 

It will take me a number of years to pay off my credit card debt and even longer to pay off the student loans (around 4 and 9 years respectively). I would love to be able to pay down debt faster so I can actually start saving and even investing at some point as well as build back up my credit which has taken a hit due to my debt/credit ratio. 

I am current on all of my bills and have a perfect track record for making payments on time. However, I've been doing some research on settling credit card debt and I'm wondering if it might be beneficial to attempt this with my largest credit card to free up more money to pay down my other debts. 

From what I gather, this would entail not paying the balance for up to 90 days and entering into a negotiation with the original creditor on the balance owed. If the credit card company agreed to a payout of .30/$1, I could probably receive help from my parents and make a one-time payment to close out the balance and set up an interest-free repayment with them (my parents). 

- Can I settle only one of my credit cards? 
- Is this a bad idea? 
- Are there additional considerations I need to think carefully about? 
- Does anyone have any resources or additional recommendations? 

As I mentioned, this is all self-guided and I am not epsecially financially literate, I'm doing my best to make ends meet and looking to take control of my balances. Thanks in advance for any help! I really appreciate any feedback.",finance
personalfinance,Savings account tax question,"I have briefly researched this but I could use an expert explanation if possible.

We have been using a savings account for all of my son’s birthday and holiday money with the intention of using it for higher education.  I know there are better alternatives but let’s just say my nephew had a tax sheltered savings deal that he never used because he dropped out of high school.

Things are very good and we have amassed 10k for him over 13 years.  However, the financial institution recently asked for his social security number and have withheld about a dollar.  Ironically he only makes about 75 cents on average interest per month.

Is this withholding a culminated amount going back to the inception of the account or are we really looking at a higher rate of tax compared to the interest rate?

In this case should I switch it to a checking account?",finance
personalfinance,Car dealership states they have an arrangement with my bank...?,"Looking to buy a new car, placed an order.  It'll arrive in early march.  Plan is 50% down, 50% financed.  Over 800 credit score.

&amp;#x200B;

When we talked about financing I mentioned I was going to get loan quotes from my bank and from Capital One Auto Finance (have had car loans through both over the years).

&amp;#x200B;

The dealership said that they have an arrangement with many banks (mine included) and with COAF.  ""If you apply for a loan through your bank and tell them you are getting the car from us then they are supposed to tell you to apply through us instead.""

&amp;#x200B;

This sounds kinda weird - have had about 5 car loans over the last 20+ years but never heard of this before.   Is it a thing?  Or are they trying to stop me from finding out what interest rates I'm really eligible for, or do they make money for originating the loan even it it goes through COAF (versus me going through COAF on my own)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT:  I spoke to my bank today and they said that they are not OBLIGATED to send me back to the dealership, but that would ADVISE me to go through the dealership because; ""They can almost always beat our rates due to volume and number of banks they deal with.""  They told me their current best possible rate based upon 66 month new car loan is 4.64 today, will change etc, may be higher if my score is not top tier etc.

&amp;#x200B;

So I believe the dealership was being above-board and honest when they told me of this arrangement, and that they probably said something more like; ""they SHOULD"" (tell you to go through us) rather than ""They are supposed to""",finance

Financial context: We have about $200,000 left on our house with 4% interest on a 30 year fixed (we are in year 7); about $15k in college savings for our 4 and 7 year old and investing every month; about 100k in 401ks and Roth IRAs for retirement and we are in our mid-30s.

Our annual income is about 80k with one of us working, but will increase next year when the other partner goes back to work by about 50k.

We have 40 - 100k worth our home upgrades we should do to our house. 40 would make our house seismically sound, but 100 would do that plus add bathrooms and bedrooms for our growing family. Our house is worth about 200k more than when we bought it, so a home equity loan is an option for that, especially for once we are both working and can funnel the entire 2nd income into paying it off.

personalfinance,How strictly/literally should the wiki flowchart be followed?

Based on the standard guidance I should focus on the above 3 items first and then begin saving for a house.

A bit more information about my loans, which were recently refinanced:

Federal Loan: $40,300 @ 5%

Private Loan: $25,100 @ 5.53% fixed

Previous to refinancing, my weighted average interest was above 10% so I was throwing pretty much every extra dollar I had at them but now that my interest rate is much more manageable, I'm considering paying minimum amounts to save for a house.  Again, standard guidance says I should continue to pay these down as fast as possible but after 5 years of not building any kind of real savings outside of an emergency fund and short-term items, I'm getting antsy and want to at least get the ball rolling towards a house.

investing,"Can someone who knows more than me, tell me why he's wrong and why we're not heading into a new depression era?","This market is going to get a lot worse, approaching if not a full-blown depression, and its going to happen for several reasons.

[USA demographics pyramid](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Uspop.svg/800px-Uspop.svg.png)

1.  Demographics shift affecting capital markets &amp; retirement crisis.  The largest and wealthiest segment of the population is the baby boomers.  The majority of them reached retirement age 2 years ago.  After 2008 devastated their retirement accounts, many of them realized that they don't have enough to retire, so they made riskier investment than they normally should have.  Artificially raising the stock market and lowering the cost of capital.  This bear market and recession, will devastate them further, and many wont be able to retire at all.  So what do they do?  Sell the house, and move to cheaper lodgings.  Well, if everyone does that at the same time?  Home prices crash, especially since millenials don't make enough to pay the asking price.  I would not be surprised to see a 50% fall in home values.

2.  Student debt.  Young people from age 20-35 are traditionally the ones that buy homes, cars, and all the big life purchases.  This age bracket is what fuels a consumption based economy. Currently, this age bracket is loaded with too much student debt, which is not dischargable in bankruptcy, to do any of the above.  So we're not gonna be able to spend our way out of a recession.  

3.  There aren't enough gen-xers to fill out the tax paying bracket.  The majority of income tax comes from people aged 40-65.  These people are further in their careers and making more money, therefore more income tax.  There just aren't enough gen-xers to pay the same level of taxes that the government needs to operate with all of the existing entitlement programs.  This is gonna blow a huge hole in government finances.  

4.  Corporate debt.  Since 2008, interest rates have been crazy low, allowing companies to borrow ""free money"", and then they used that money to buy back their stock and artificially raise their stock price, netting their executives hefty bonuses.  Interest rates rise, they have to pay back the loans, but a recession &amp; bear market cuts 30% off their stock value right from the start.  Where is that debt payment money going to come from?

5.  Government debt.  we're at $21trillion and counting.  We've run out of people to borrow money from, and the rest of the world will be dealing with their own financial crises.

6.  Global financial depression.  Germany, China, and Japan each depend on exports for over 30% of their GDP.  If the US is in recession, who is gonna buy their goods?  

7. The EU is going to collapse.  This is why Merkel stepped down now.  Cause she doesn't want to be holding the reigns when shit hits the fan.  [European demographics](http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/images/2011/Oct/Fourplex_demographics_1600.jpg) are way worse than Americas.  They are not going to be capable of consumption-fueled growth for at least 30 years.  There are no young people to pay taxes to fund the retirement of the old people.  They just aren't there.  So those pensions that the boomers were counting on, wont be z

8. Italy and the rest of the southern European countries joined the EU for access to Germany's credit card, and then they elected a series of politicians who bought elections by guaranteeing social programs, instead of using those loans to modernize their economy and infrastructure.  So now, you've got tons of debt, empty promises, and non-competitive economies.  Italy's debt is at $2.2 trillion, 15% of which is bad standing, and that's AFTER the EU redefined the rules for rating debt.  Italy doesn't have the demographics to be able to grow its economy, so they wont be able to repay that debt.  

We could deal with any 2 or 3 of these, but all of them?  At the same time?  At the same time as a recession and stock market crash?  No way Jose....  And I didn't even mention automation and AI.....

My current position.  I pulled out of the market entirely 6 months ago.  I'm holding 5-10% in precious metals, and the rest in cash.  Cause I want to be able to pick up some sweet deals on assets when the dust starts to settle in two years +/-.  There's gonna be a lot of blood in the streets, and I'm gonna buy property.  


TLDR:  Putting this all together, we have a bear market, a recession, a fundamental and game-changing shift in demographics, a retirement crisis, too many young people in debt, and not enough gen-xers to pay the majority of income tax.  And that's just America.  The next 10 or so years, are gonna be rough.

personalfinance,"Curious on student loan refinance options, need some advice","Hey guys.  I've never posted on Personal Finance before so forgive me if there's anything I'm leaving out.  I'm trying to figure out if I can even consolidate my student loans.    

I'm a 32 year old dude who went to college from late 2004 to early 2010.  I switched majors a few times, transferred schools once, and never officially graduated.  In the little bit of research I've done that part seems to have disqualified me quite a bit right off the bat.  

I also didn't make much money from 2010-2015.  My debt to income ratio was quite high (especially after having my car stolen and having to find a new way around), so my credit score took a huge nosedive.  From 2015-2017 I got my feet under me a bit more and got some stuff paid off, although still didn't make enough to really feel like I had anything left over ever.

Late 2017 and into this year I did get a decent promotion.  It's not a ton of money, but it's actually more than I thought I would ever make (close to $75k).  I got my car paid off (bought a 2009 Honda Civic when my old car got stolen, still drive it), my only credit card will be paid off in February (only had about $3000 limit either way), and my girlfriend bought a house in her name, and I pay half the mortgage.  That's great, though, because the mortgage is pretty cheap.  All in I'm paying about $800/mo.  

I also bit the bullet and checked my credit score, which I haven't checked in quite some time because I know I would get depressed about it, and it wasn't AS bad as I thought it would be, 670.  Which I know isn't great, but for me that was actually pretty exciting.  I know that should probably only go up as well as time goes on.  I'm paying stuff off and I have no plans to borrow more money.  

For loans I have:

2 Federal loans totaling $12,000.  One is at 6% ($4,000) and the other is 6.8% ($8,000)

1 Private loan totaling $40,000, with a whopping 10.25% interest rate.  


So yeah, there it is.  Is there anything I can/should do to help my situation besides go back to 2004 and tell my 18 year old self that I'm not college material and I should start my job in tech right away?  Are there any lenders who won't cancel my application as soon as I mention I never finished?  If I lie and say I finished will they find out?  With my salary and credit score is it even worth trying to do in the first place?

personalfinance,"Is it better to put extra money into savings, or into paying off my auto loan (on top of current monthly payments)?","The minimum monthly payment on my car is around $215 per month on a 60 month loan at 3.9% interest (which I am, as of next month, 1 year into). I'm currently paying $350 per month ($175 per paycheck) with the objective of paying the car off as soon as I'm able to.

I'm currently contributing $400 per month ($200 per paycheck) into my emergency fund, which is at the time of writing this, approximately 60% funded.

So here's my question. With only 3.9% interest on the auto loan, would I be better spending my money by putting that extra amount into savings? My goal was initially to pay off my car as soon as possible, that way I'd be able to afford higher mortgage payments. But after thinking about it, I'd be able to make smaller mortgage payments if I can make a larger mortgage down payment.

With tax refund right around the corner, I'll be using that to fully top off my emergency fund, so that's not really my concern right now.

&amp;#x200B;

Is the additional $135 a month I'm spending on my auto loan worth it, when I can be putting that amount in savings? Conversely, if I pay my car off as soon as possible, I'd be able to start putting that same $350 amount into savings on top of my current $400, effectively making my savings contributions $750 a month (but that'll only happen once I've closed the auto loan).

I can afford all of my expenses relatively comfortably right now, and I should have a fully funded emergency fund by March. I'm mainly looking for opinions at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

Update: The overwhelming consensus is to continue paying off the car early, which makes sense. Unless I have a savings account with an APY that exceeds the interest rate on the loan itself, saving myself a couple hundred dollars in interest is worth more than the amount I could put into savings.

personalfinance,Here's the new Form 1040 for tax year 2018.,"[From IRS.gov](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1040)

&gt; For Tax Year 2018, you will no longer use Form 1040A or Form 1040EZ, but instead will use the redesigned Form 1040. Many people will only need to file Form 1040 and no schedules.

This is the ""postcard size"" form you may have heard of: [Form 1040](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040.pdf), and the [instructions](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040gi.pdf). The return is two half-pages, and the signature section is the bottom of the first page. Form(s) W-2 are now attached on the left margin of page two.

&gt; However, if your return is more complicated (for example you claim certain deductions or credits, or owe additional taxes) you will need to complete one or more of the new Form 1040 Schedules. Below is a general guide to what Schedule(s) you will need to file, based on your circumstances. See the instructions for the Schedules for more information.

[Schedule 1: ](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040s1.pdf)

&gt; If you have additional income, such as capital gains, unemployment compensation, prize or award money, gambling winnings.

&gt; If you Have certain deductions to claim, such as student loan interest deduction, self-employment tax, educator expenses.

[Schedule 2:](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040s2.pdf)

&gt; If you owe AMT or need to make an excess advance premium tax credit repayment (calculated on Form 8962).

[Schedule 3:](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040s3.pdf)

&gt; If you can claim a nonrefundable credit other than the child tax credit or the credit for other dependents, such as the foreign tax credit, education credits, general business credit.

[Schedule 4:](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040s4.pdf)

&gt; If you owe other taxes, such as self-employment tax, household employment taxes, additional tax on IRAs or other qualified retirement plans and tax-favored accounts.

[Schedule 5:](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040s5.pdf)

&gt; If you can claim a refundable credit other than the earned income credit, American opportunity credit, or additional child tax credit. If you have other payments, such as an amount paid with a request for an extension to file or excess social security tax withheld.

[Schedule 6:](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040s6.pdf)

&gt; If you have a foreign address, or a third party designee other than your paid preparer.

Here's an example: 

A couple files a married filing joint return with no children, where one spouse works for wages and the other spouse is self employed. They claim the standard deduction, and the self employed spouse made estimated tax payments, because it's a pay-as-you-earn system.

This couple will file the Form 1040, Schedule 1 (for the self employment income and the self employment tax deduction), Schedule 4 (for the self employment tax), and Schedule 5 (to claim the estimated tax payments). These new Schedules are **in addition to** the Schedules C and SE the spouse would need to compute the business profit and self employment tax. If the Taxpayer want's their mom to be able to contact IRS on their behalf, they could list mom as the third party designee, and add Schedule 6.

If they are filing this return by mail, they must remember to sign the return on page one and attach the W-2 on page 2 of the 1040. Then they attach Schedules 1, 4, 5, and 6, and then Schedules C and SE. Each IRS supporting form or schedule has a sequence number in the upper-right corner. These are supposed to be attached in the appropriate sequence number order.

&gt; Individuals who filed their federal tax return electronically last year may not notice any changes, as the tax return preparation software will automatically use their answers to the tax questions to complete the Form 1040 and any needed schedules.

If you are electronically filing your return, these mechanical changes should be invisible to you. Carefully review the finished product and, as always, when you are done preparing and filing your return, make digital and physical copies for your records. 

Tl;Dr: Here's the new and improved tax return, and new schedules, for 2018. Forms 1040A and 1040EZ won't be used this filing season. I just want to say good luck. We're all counting on you.",finance

My lawyer wants to proceed with filing a federal lawsuit, supposedly under theFDCPA.  This will out me another $700.  All well and good except this process could take up to 12 months.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm going to start off as I am an idiot when it comes to finances. I just pay my bills on whatever the bills say. I don't balance my checkbook and I still don't know how to file for taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

I graduated college a few months ago totaling my student loan debt around $30,000. I got a job at a small software company as a software developer for $48K.

&amp;#x200B;

As of right now I have everything I need and all of my expenses are only going on bills (food, rent, student loans) and I was wondering if you guys could help me figure out how to delete my student loan as fast as I can because I don't really understand how interests work and what subsidized and unsubsidized mean (Yes, I googled it. Part of my job is being good at googling things but as someone who was not born in the US and was recently naturalized, I don't understand some of the big words when people explain things on the internet).

&amp;#x200B;

I take home $2800 a month after taxes and other company related stuff. My rent is $450 a month including utilities, $200 on food, $25 on gym membership and $50 on internet. My first student loan payment kicked in this month and the loan website recommended I should pay $320 for my first payment. I decided to just pay $500 but I didn't realize my loans are split into 9 different loans (if someone could explain that, that would be amazing too). I am trying to save up to buy my mom a new car (to thank her for supporting me through college) but I guess that will have to wait since I have to deal with this first.

&amp;#x200B;

When I make a payment, the website gives me options to allocate my payment in different types whether if I want to pay it with the highest interest rate first or lowest balance or unsubsidized, etc. My question is, which loan, if there is any, should I pay off first? Or should I allocate my payment evenly? Do you guys have any advice on saving or should I pay off my entire check for the month on student loans to get it out of the way asap?

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, my student loans are:

 

|Name|Balance|Interest Rate (in %)|
|:-|:-|:-|

He and I have narrowed down our search to a Toyota Rav4 but he wants me to get an older car with low miles (2015 as the oldest) for at or around the $18k so I don't have to put any money in. We went to the Toyota dealership today to look at cars and I found a 2018 for $23,500 plus tax, title and registration and I got to thinking about the possible benefits of getting an new (or just newer than I can get for $18k) car.

I have really crappy credit right now. I am 30 years old and about a year and a half ago I had to abruptly leave an abusive SO whom I lived with for 6 years. My dad helped me with getting an apartment but I had to buy pretty much all new everything. Between that and about $32,000 in medical debt from a couple hospital stays (and being out of work for 4 months on FMLA) , I racked up a substantial amount of credit card debt. Enough to tank my credit score... But it wasn't that great in the first place because, well, here are some details: I have two credit cards (100% on-time payments) aged 9 years and 5 years but have never taken out a loan. So these two credit cards are all I have to show for and I'm using about 65% of my credit limit. I have the plan and ability to get this to at least below 30% by the end of 2019. I have a good paying, stable career with a promotion in my near future. I paid about $10,000 of the medical bills out of pocket and was somehow able to haggle away the rest so that doesn't need to be factored in (the medical industry in the US is such a crock of poo...but that's not what this post is about).

&amp;#x200B;

My question is this: would it make sense to put the $18k down on a car that is more expensive (I'm thinking $6,000 to $8,000 more) and take out a loan for the remainder? I will most likely be looking at a high interest rate but I am not quite sure how else I can get my credit up? Obviously pay off the credit cards but I don't think that will get me into a range that will set me up well for the future. Or do you think I should just worry about the credit cards, pay them down and then deal with getting a loan after that? Or??

financialindependence,"How a spouse going into a nursing home can wreck your plans, and some ways to keep your money","a couple of years ago my dad got sick and had to go to a nursing home and we didn't know how long he'd need to be in (we were lucky, he got out in two weeks).  after doing some research i realized that if he stayed for any length of time, it was going to soak up all the money my parents had spent their lives saving!  below is a condensed version of what i found while trying to help my mom.  
 
if a spouse ends up in a nursing home, the average cost is between 82-92K a year.  the couple is responsible for paying this, not the government.  However, Spousal impoverishment provisions come into play when one of a couple enters a nursing home expecting to stay for at least 30 days. At that time the powers that be take a ""snapshot,"" of their combined resources to determine when medicaid will start paying for this care.  The Protected Resource Amount is 109,000$ (different per state), which means you must pay for the nursing home until you have only 109,000 left, then medicaid will pick up the tab.  So if this 'snapshot shows you have 500K, then you must spend 391K on the nursing home before medicaid will kick in.  (your house, and care are exempt).   Medicaid officials have the right to recoup any funds spent on your nursing home care from your estate after your death. Thus, your heirs could stand to lose any assets you did not properly shelter before entering the nursing home.  

While hiding assets from the government is a criminal offense, you can legally shelter certain assets from this 'snapshot' and avoid using them to pay for the high cost of a nursing home stay.  here are a few suggestions: 

Give monetary gifts to your loved ones before you get sick.  In the case of Medicaid,any assets you transfer within the five years prior to entering a care facility are subject to seizure after your death. Transferring funds before you fall ill shelters your money and ensures your family members can legally keep the gifts they receive.

draft a “life estate” for your real estate, naming you as the life tenant and a loved one you trust as the remainderman, with future ownership interest in the property. 

Place liquid assets into an annuity. Some states, such as Colorado, do not count periodic payouts from annuities when determining Medicaid eligibility. 

Transfer a portion of your monthly income to your spouse. The Federal Spousal Impoverishment Act protects the spouses of nursing home patients by permitting them to exclude their own income when paying for a spouse's nursing home care. If your spouse's income is less than the amount your state exempts, you can direct a portion of your income to your spouse to bridge the gap.Shelter your money through an irrevocable trust. 

Place your assets and your spouse’s assets into a “pour-over” trust.

this was all very new to me and caught my family sideways, we got lucky, but i actually don't have a lot of hope that many people are going to be able to pass on inheritance, i think nursing homes are going to soak up most of what people were able to save in their lives.  stay smart!",finance
personalfinance,Home Loan - Offset Account Vs Investing,"Details for background: I live in Australia and I want to own my first home. I'm on mobile so forgive any formatting weirdness.

So basically I received a lump sum from a personal injury claim (160k). We have spent a little on new vehicles and what not and we are left over with 150k total

Now I'm looking at a unit for 305k, I want to put the deposit down (20%) to remove any Lenders Mortgage Insurance. So that leaves me with a 245k mortgage. 

Now I have 2 options I see. 

Option 1 - put the extra 90k into an offset account and pay interest on only 155k. This will allow me to put more money into the mortgage and pay it off quicker while the interest rates are low (3.73% currently). I estimate that this will allow me to pay the loan off in 12 years with 4 years being interest free (the offset account). With a saving if around 55k in interest. I like this option as it allows me the freedom to access my money should anything go wrong and I wont have to pay any capital gains.

Option 2: Pay the 61k deposit and invest the rest in some place (I dont know where I would do this). Obviously this way could not more money but I feel like I lose the freedom to access my money and I would obviously have to pay capital gains on anything (about 47%).

So I want to know is option 1 a good choice or would option 2 be worth the negatives. I'm still planning on saving but the increase in mortgage repayments from option 1 to 2 are about an extra $120 a week.",finance

Bitcoin,An Analysis Of Bitcoin Market Reaction When CME Futures Contracts Expire,"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/4laoebgght621.png

[https://cryptoiq.co/an-analysis-of-bitcoin-market-reaction-when-cme-futures-contracts-expire/](https://cryptoiq.co/an-analysis-of-bitcoin-market-reaction-when-cme-futures-contracts-expire/)

 

The Federal Reserve says [the Bitcoin Futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) are the reason the Bitcoin bear market began](https://cryptoiq.co/cme-bitcoin-futures-are-poisoning-crypto/).  Indeed, the Dec. 17, 2017 launch date of the CME Bitcoin futures  coincided with the beginning of Bitcoin’s crash from $20,000 to as low  as $3,100 in December 2018. 

This is perhaps due to  immense short selling pressure combined with the printing of vast  quantities of paper Bitcoins on CME. The Bitcoin futures on CME are  operated by Globex, the same organization that suppresses global gold  prices via the printing of paper gold on COMEX. 

Aside from the long term  damaging effects on the Bitcoin market, it seems possible that there are  shorter term impacts associated with the expiration of futures  contracts. The CME Bitcoin futures contracts for a particular month [expire on the last Friday of the month](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin_contract_specifications.html),  except if there is a holiday in the United Kingdom or United States. A  full list of CME Bitcoin futures contract expiration dates [can be found at this link](https://cryptocalendar.pro/events/bitcoin). 

This expiration date marks  the benchmark used to payout profits and losses, and it is possible that  futures traders manipulate the price of Bitcoin to optimize their  profits. For example, when short selling, a common practice is “banging  the close,” in which traders manipulate the underlying asset’s spot  price to drop lower to increase profits from short selling. It is also  possible for traders in long positions to manipulate the market to go  higher right as the expiration happens, which could perhaps also be  called “banging the close.” 

In this analysis, Crypto.IQ  explores the actual data to see if there is any anomalous activity  around the time CME futures contracts expire. 

First, the CME Bitcoin  futures expiration dates are overlaid on a chart from Bitcoinwisdom.com  for the entire year of 2018, and there is an additional line for the  launch date on Dec. 17, 2017, which makes it extremely clear that the  genesis of the CME Bitcoin futures market had a substantial impact on  the Bitcoin market from the very beginning.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/wwjmycelht621.png

 

Without doing any deep  analysis, it seems that many significant peaks and dips in the Bitcoin  market coincide with the CME Bitcoin futures expiration dates. This  would suggest there is plenty of banging the close occurring. 

Crypto.IQ will analyze each of these CME Bitcoin future settlement dates individually to get a clearer picture. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/af5s5vjnht621.png

The line at the left side  of the chart shows the date that CME Bitcoin futures launched, Dec. 17,  2017. The line at the right side (not to be confused with the far right  line which is the Y axis) shows the date the first Bitcoin futures  contract on CME expired, Jan. 26, 2018. 

This contract was an  extreme win for short sellers, and despite an attempted rally around the  2018 New Year, the market had declined to $11,000 by the time the  contract expired. There is no sign that there is an acute case of  banging the close, but perhaps banging the close was not even needed at  the expiration since the market fell so hard. It is possible that CME  futures traders banged the close all month long.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/78c13stpht621.png

 

The line in the above chart  shows the second CME Bitcoin Futures contracts expiration on February  23. In this case, banging the close seems pretty obvious. An attempted  bounce-back rally that peaked five days before the expiration was  stomped out, and Bitcoin hit a local minima right around the time the  contracts expired. Then the rally re-starts and continues into early  March. 

The February futures  expiration date perhaps gives an understanding of how the CME Bitcoin  futures can be very detrimental for the market long term. If traders  made short sell bets on Bitcoin, but then Bitcoin begins to have a  serious rally, they may coordinate to end the rally. In this case,  Bitcoin rallied from $6,000 to nearly $12,000, only to crash below  $10,000 when the expiration occurred. 

Bitcoin then returned  exactly to the peak of this rally near $12,000 once the futures  contracts expiration was over. The question is, how high would Bitcoin  have rallied if there were not people manipulating the spot market to  better their short positions on the futures markets?

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/dz7zokqrht621.png

 The March 29 Bitcoin futures expiration  is an excellent example of banging the close. The volume speaks a  thousand words, since selling rapidly accelerated and peaked right when  the futures contracts for March expired. This futures contracts  expiration dropped Bitcoin below $7,000, and it took at least 10 days  for the Bitcoin market to recover from this bottom that was likely  induced by CME futures-related manipulation. This March expiration is a  good example of how a major Bitcoin price crash can be related to the  monthly CME Bitcoin futures contracts expiration. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/7pnl3eitht621.png

 

After the catastrophic  Bitcoin futures contracts expiration in March, perhaps many traders  thought Bitcoin had bottomed out, and a rally soon started after a  10-day recovery period. The rally continued until the April 27 futures  contracts expiration, making it an excellent month for long traders.  There is an obvious volume peak 2-3 days before the contract expiration,  and a $1,000 price crash. It seems possible that this $1,000 price  crash was short sellers banging the close to cut losses and perhaps was  mitigated by people in long positions banging the close in the other  direction. 

The turbulence around the  futures contracts expiration perhaps significantly slowed the rally. It  re-started a few days after the expiration occurred but quickly lost  steam and reversed. This may be another example of a bounce-back rally  getting rekt by CME Bitcoin futures-related manipulation, but it is  impossible to know for sure.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/lrlox1rvht621.png

 

Between the April 27 and  May 25 CME Bitcoin futures expiration dates, the bounce-back rally was  entirely liquidated as short sellers took back the helm. There appears  to have been some obvious banging the close activity 3-5 days before the  May contracts expired, with high volumes and a $1,000 price crash. The  market stopped dropping once the May contracts expired, and was steady  until the middle of June. 

This brings up another  interesting effect of the CME Bitcoin futures. If a crash occurs around  the time of contract expiration, then the market usually has some time  to ‘relax’ after the expiration. This makes it more clear that banging  the close is a serious issue.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/z7bk2upxht621.png

 The price of Bitcoin once again crawled  lower as the June 29 CME Bitcoin futures contract expiration approached  and reached a minimum below $6,000 within about a day of the expiration.  After the expiration was complete, the market “relaxed” and rallied off  lows. The June expiration once again has the tell-tale signs of banging  the close. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/osgo1ygzht621.png

 Short selling and banging the close  lower is not the only option, and perhaps not a good option once Bitcoin  has fallen too much. Prior to the July 27 expiration, the market had  been rallying, and the rally peaked over $8,000 around the time the  expiration occurred. Then the market began declining within days after  the July contract expired. This could be a good example of CME futures  traders going long, and perhaps helping Bitcoin’s price to go higher.  Once they got their long profits, then they may have collectively  decided it was time to squeeze money out of short selling again. The  timing of the peak of this rally seems too exact to be a coincidence. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/v4hpvq71it621.png

 

After the July expiration,  the market crashed below $6,000 and then began to steadily rise,  probably from an overall consensus that the Bitcoin price was near its  support level, and it was a good time to buy. There is no sign of  banging the close to stop the slight rally when the Aug. 31 expiration  occurred. It is important to note that short sellers would have still  had nice profits since overall Bitcoin declined $1,000 during August. 

A few days after the August  contracts expired Bitcoin crashed hard, just like what happened days  after the July contracts expired. This brings up the possibility that  CME futures traders are doing far more than banging the close. They may  be preemptively banging the market right after they buy their monthly  contracts, which would cause market panic, widespread selling, and far  lower prices than they could achieve from their own manipulation.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/zgodm663it621.png

 After the hard crash right after the  August expiration, the Bitcoin market went sideways. There is signs of  banging the close around the September 28 expiration since volume  increased and price dipped right as the expiration occurred. Overall,  September was another good month for CME short sellers. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/37hkk0hbit621.png

 

The trend in October was  very flat, and when the expiration happened on Oct. 26, there wasn’t  much action. There was almost no change in price during October, and  this may have created an environment where an equal amount of longs and  shorts were present, and much fewer positions overall. Perhaps when the  market does not move much in either direction banging the close does not  happen. 

November will go down as  one of the worst months in 2018 for Bitcoin and the crypto market,  however. The Bitcoin Cash fork around Nov. 14 coincided with a crash  below Bitcoin’s $5,800 support level. The SEC issued devastating  enforcement actions against Paragon (PRG) and Airfox (AIR) and said that  would be the protocol for ICO enforcement going forward. Further, Bakkt  delayed the launch of physical Bitcoin futures, which is something many  investors were looking forward to. 

One thing ignored by most  people’s market analysis of this crash is that the CME futures traders  probably placed large short sell positions and perhaps manipulated the  market to crash harder than it should have. The market stopped crashing 4  days before futures contracts expired on Nov. 30, and there appears to  be a nice $400 price dip right before the November contracts expired.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/bsz90oqdit621.png

 

Zooming in on the Nov. 30  contracts expiration makes it obvious that the close was banged to lock  in maximum short selling profits for November. 

The December 2018 CME futures contracts expire on Dec. 28, [and in 2019, the schedule is](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin_product_calendar_futures.html)  Jan. 25, Feb. 22, March 29, and June 28. It seems these dates will be  important for Bitcoin traders, since as the above analysis shows, the  spot market often crashes right when expiration happens on down months,  and during up months the rally usually peaks right around the expiration  date. Only if the market is totally stable all month, like it was in  October 2018, the expiration date does not have much significance. 

There is plenty of  evidence, based on these charts, that CME Bitcoin futures traders are  participating in banging the close to increase their profits. There is  also a disturbing trend of the Bitcoin market crashing days after  contracts expire. This is perhaps traders who take up short positions  for the new month launching their ammunition early to cause a major  crash, which is perhaps more profitable for them than the small  movements they can cause when banging the close. Multiple bounce-back  rallies in 2018 died days after contracts expired, which is likely  simultaneous with CME futures traders taking up their short positions. 

Another worrisome factor is  that any actual bad news, like the Bitcoin Cash fork and SEC  enforcement, may be blood in the water for CME futures traders. The  November crash ended right before the contracts for November expired,  making it seem like the CME futures traders launched their ammunition to  crash the market when the market was already crashing due to bad news,  greatly amplifying the overall crash. 

Perhaps the Commodity  Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) should consider that the relatively  small size of Bitcoin, which has less than a $100 billion market cap, is  inappropriate for Globex futures since it is too easy to manipulate.",cryptocurrency

This brings up the possibility  that  CME futures traders are doing far more than banging the close.  They may  be preemptively banging the market right after they buy their  monthly  contracts, which would cause market panic, widespread selling,  and far  lower prices than they could achieve from their own  manipulation.

&amp;#x200B;

After  the hard crash right after the  August expiration, the Bitcoin market  went sideways. There is signs of  banging the close around the September  28 expiration since volume  increased and price dipped right as the  expiration occurred. Overall,  September was another good month for CME  short sellers.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/am8l381tjt621.png

The  trend in October was  very flat, and when the expiration happened on  Oct. 26, there wasn’t  much action. There was almost no change in price  during October, and  this may have created an environment where an equal  amount of longs and  shorts were present, and much fewer positions  overall. Perhaps when the  market does not move much in either direction  banging the close does not  happen.

November  will go down as  one of the worst months in 2018 for Bitcoin and the  crypto market,  however. The Bitcoin Cash fork around Nov. 14 coincided  with a crash  below Bitcoin’s $5,800 support level. The SEC issued  devastating  enforcement actions against Paragon (PRG) and Airfox (AIR)  and said that  would be the protocol for ICO enforcement going forward.  Further, Bakkt  delayed the launch of physical Bitcoin futures, which is  something many  investors were looking forward to.

One  thing ignored by most  people’s market analysis of this crash is that  the CME futures traders  probably placed large short sell positions and  perhaps manipulated the  market to crash harder than it should have. The  market stopped crashing 4  days before futures contracts expired on  Nov. 30, and there appears to  be a nice $400 price dip right before the  November contracts expired.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/z14l602ujt621.png

Zooming  in on the Nov. 30  contracts expiration makes it obvious that the close  was banged to lock  in maximum short selling profits for November.

The December 2018 CME futures contracts expire on Dec. 28, [and in 2019, the schedule is](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin_product_calendar_futures.html)   Jan. 25, Feb. 22, March 29, and June 28. It seems these dates will be   important for Bitcoin traders, since as the above analysis shows, the   spot market often crashes right when expiration happens on down months,   and during up months the rally usually peaks right around the  expiration  date. Only if the market is totally stable all month, like  it was in  October 2018, the expiration date does not have much  significance.

There is plenty of   evidence, based on these charts, that CME Bitcoin futures traders are   participating in banging the close to increase their profits. There is   also a disturbing trend of the Bitcoin market crashing days after   contracts expire. This is perhaps traders who take up short positions   for the new month launching their ammunition early to cause a major   crash, which is perhaps more profitable for them than the small   movements they can cause when banging the close. Multiple bounce-back   rallies in 2018 died days after contracts expired, which is likely   simultaneous with CME futures traders taking up their short positions.

Another  worrisome factor is  that any actual bad news, like the Bitcoin Cash  fork and SEC  enforcement, may be blood in the water for CME futures  traders. The  November crash ended right before the contracts for  November expired,  making it seem like the CME futures traders launched  their ammunition to  crash the market when the market was already  crashing due to bad news,  greatly amplifying the overall crash.

Perhaps  the Commodity  Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) should consider that  the relatively  small size of Bitcoin, which has less than a $100  billion market cap, is  inappropriate for Globex futures since it is too  easy to manipulate.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,When is it a good idea to have more than one bank account? Is it ever a good idea?,"By this, I mean both opening multiple savings accounts and opening accounts with different banks. I really like the idea of having separate savings accounts for different saving goals (like having a savings for emergency funds and a savings account for travel), but is it a good idea to have those kind of accounts, as in will it hurt credit scores or effect interest rates or something? Does it depend on the bank? I've also heard that it's a good idea to spread your money out across two or more different banks, but how true is this? 

Based on what I've read, there seems to be a lot of pros and cons, but what do you think? I have one checking, one savings and one credit card (all with WellsFargo, but I'm very neutral about them at best and am debating switching to a new bank) with no debt. I currently keep track of what in my savings accounts is meant to be for what in a paper budget sheet, but I'd like to be able to more visually see it separated in my banking if it's not going to negatively effect me in the long run.",finance

personalfinance,Pay off undergrad loan before going back to school?,"I will begin graduate school in August, and will be unable to work for at least my first year (out of 3). My husband and I will live on his income during that time.  

My undergrad loans have a 4.83% average interest rate, ranging from 3.15% to 6.55%. I currently have $8,200 left on that loan. Total payment for grad school will be approximately $30k. I can get about $20k/year through loans, but interest begins accruing immediately, so I would prefer to keep the borrowed amount as low as possible. 

I have about $27k saved currently, hoping to be closer to $32k by the time school starts. 

Should I pay off the entirety of my undergrad loan before beginning school? This will obviously cut into my savings, but it would also mean less interest paid in the long run, and would get rid of a monthly payment. (I could potentially defer, but I'd still be accruing interest on the loans, so, not ideal). Would it be better to use my savings to pay my grad school tuition instead?

personalfinance,Making a student loan payment for my sister,"My sister is working in another country and her terrible bank charges her way too much to do international transactions. She’s been saving up the cash she’s making and then sends me money to then Venmo to her. She’s tried switching to better banks because her credit score is too low for the ones that have good international options.    
  
This all lead to her defaulting on a lot of debts a couple of years back before the above transfer arrangements could be made. Over the summer she handled most of the debts by offering to pay part of them for the total being forgiven and now just has her student loans left.   
  
I am co-signed on a private student loan for her and make the payments (I know never co-sign but there was so family drama and guilt was a powerful motivator for me when she got the loan). I’m fine with making payments on that loan and when she does these big transactions to me, I keep the 6 months worth of payments I made for her.   
  
The issue though is she’s asking me this time to also make a payment on her federal loan. I don’t want to do this because I’m afraid that if I make a payment then I’m going to link myself to that debt and start getting debt collectors hounding me.

personalfinance,$84K student loans @ 4.7%; 50K windfall. WWYD?,"I have $84K in student loans at 4.7% interest rate. I have a 6 month expenses emergency fund and am getting my 401K employer match. Annual Household income is $130K. I am getting a windfall of approximately $50K and would like to hear what you would do in my situation and in the current economy.

Before refinancing student loans (previously 5.5%), I had been paying down student loans aggressively at $3500/mo over the last 15 months. After refinancing, the loans are now in an interest grey area of whether to A) continue the $3500/mo payment, B) contribute more to retirement while paying the minimum on the student loans (\~$1600/month), or C) a mix (e.g. $2500/mo to student loans and $1000/mo additional to retirement).

With this sudden 50K windfall, I'm thinking I'd like to spend 30K on student loans to get down to 50K and max our Roth IRA's for 2018+2019. Then I'd do option C for the student loans ($2500/mo to student loans + 1000/month to retirement, which will essentially max my 401K). 

Additional factor:  planning first pregnancy mid-late 2019. I'm thinking we'd just start the baby fund after the first trimester by possibly pulling back on some of these contributions. This is the only thing that makes me want to just get the student loans done with sooner rather than just paying the minimum and dumping the remainder into retirement accounts.  

Thanks for your advice and perspective!

Edit: thank you everyone for your advice! Super helpful.  I’ll be putting it all into student loan debt and hopefully will have them paid off by end of 2019. The final few months of 2019 I’ll put into retirement and/or begin the baby savings. I will also be consulting a financial advisor in a few days.

personalfinance,How to calculate 2019 withholding so as to owe $x in 2020?,"Every ""tax withholding"" calculator I can find (including the IRS withholding calculator) assumes that I want to calculate allowances for the rest of the current year (2018) based on how much in taxes have already been withheld, which is not applicable to me because I started a new job this year.

What I really want to do is figure out how many allowances I want for my job in 2019 assuming that I will have the job throughout the year, have no other income (or raises), have the same number of dependents as I do now, and that I'll take the standard deduction for 2019 taxes. My goal is to owe a particular amount in April 2020 so that I can make use of an energy tax credit to offset my bill to $0 (or close to), since my understanding is that I cannot use the energy tax credit if I'm getting a refund.

My thinking is along these lines:

1. Start with my gross income for 2019
1. Subtract pretax deductions (trad 401k, hsa, etc)
1. Subtract standard deduction
1. Subtract deductions for dependent(s)
1. Calculate tax owed based on 2018 tax tables (assuming they won't change, which is probably a bad assumption, but it's as close as I can get, right?)
1. = Total (federal) tax owed throughout the year
1. Subtract the amount that I want to ""owe"" (so as to utilize the energy tax credit)
1. = The total amount in federal tax that I want to pay
1. Divide by the number of paychecks in the year
1. = The amount I want withheld from each paycheck

At this point, use the calculator to figure out how many allowances I should put to get at this number. (Alternatively, can I put 0 allowances on my W4 and specify an exact dollar amount to be more precise?)",finance
gaming,Game Idea: Death Vader VR,"Anyone who has seen Rogue One knows that the best part of that film was the finale, specifically the hallway scene with Darth Vader. We all know how absolutely terrifying it was effectively being on the receiving end of that episode. Imagine being on the giving end.

We know that Vader’s helmet gives him real time heads up display. His suit demands that he takes its restrictions and weak points into consideration during combat and would provide an excellent challenge to any player.

The tutorial would simply have to be the immolation scene from Episode III, where a blurry and dim screen introduces us with the opening credits while a prominent sound of a heartbeat and ringing of the ears reflects the intense pain of his surgery. As the ringing dissipates, the vision becomes clearer as the helmet descends. All is black, and then you hear the breather. After the first exhale, the helmet powers on and begins running diagnostics while it connects with the suit. As the table leans forward, you hear, “Lord Vader. Can you hear me?” A text appears on the HUD; *look at Sidious to begin*. You turn your head to the left and see his shriveled, evil face. “Yes, master. Where is Padme? Is she safe? Is she alright?” “It seems in your anger you killed her.” A tutorial begins and tells you how to use force choke, grip, and finally crush. Then it tells you to move forward and out of your shackles, ending with the famous “no”. The next scene is a short tutorial on movement and controls as Vader views himself in a mirror. Once the player understands the basics of the suit, the last assignment of the tutorial is to join the Emperor and Grand Moff Tarkin on the bridge, just like in the film (crossing one’s arms is voluntary). 

Right after the scene cuts in the film, the player is given their first assignment. Enemies range from grunts, to rebels, to clone commandos, to outcast Jedi, to fallen Jedi, wild animals, Confederate holdouts, etc. Periodically the player sits down and pilots Vader’s TIE Advanced x1 (maybe allow Vader to issue commands to squadmates, Stormtroopers of the 501st, Clone Commandos, and Black Squadron wingmen). After a set of missions, there is a time gap. Player regains control of play with Vader’s memories of the assault on the Jedi Temple, where the player can fight as Vader pre-suit in the temple and fight almost-exclusively Jedi. In the final vision/dream of the assault, the player faces the remaining Jedi Knights and Masters as they guard the council chamber. After successfully defeating them in a duel, the player enters the chambers. “Master Skywalker, there are too many of them, what are we going to do?” The player activates their lightsaber, and- as it is after a particularly difficult fight in the Temple or gruesome bit- after a brief, lingering moment of suspense (transition is haunted by voices of Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, Padme, etc.) the player is brought back to real time inside Vader’s pod, like we see in Episode V. This is where Vader receives his next assignments, details, (maybe) suit upgrades, can tweak settings, replay tutorials, complete training exercises, etc. When the player is ready, the pod opens, they grab the mask, bring it to their face, the helmet is lowered down, and the assignment appears on the HUD.

The final set of missions culminates with the lead-up to the hallway scene from Rogue One, and maybe a bonus mission of seizing the Tantive IV from the Alderaanian Royal Guard.

It just all came to me at once and I had to share it. I’d buy the shit out of this kind of game, even if it isn’t VR.",technology

personalfinance,HELP - Drowning in CC/Personal Loan Debt,"Man, where to begin? 

The past month has been unbelievably dynamic, stressful, and difficult. I recently came to terms that due to horrific spending habits, hiding from taking a good look at my daily finances, and a number of other reasons (including a gambling addiction that I have since started work on curbing with the help of Gamblers Anonymous, my wife, family and friends) I have taken out two personal loans, maxed out a credit card, and opened a small line of Credit through PayPal. In addition to this, I have been making payments on a Tax balance that I owed after filing last year. A break down of these debts are as follows:

Loan #1 - Principle Owed - $7,487 - Interest Rate 35.95% - Monthly Payment - $344.46 
Loan #2 - Principle Owed - $6,231 - Interest Rate 19.99% - Monthly Payment - $297.00
Credit Card - Principle Owed - $8,396 - Interest Rate 24.74% - Monthly Payment - $275
PayPal Credit - Principle Owed - $1,821 - Interest Rate 0% - Monthly Payment - $54

Total Monthly Payments - $970.46

Addtionally, I have the following monthly payments:

Car - $156
Insurance - $80
Utilities - $50
Cable/Internet - $55
Cell Phone - $50
Tax Payment - $250
Friend Pay Back (friend helped with paying back a bookie) - $175

My wife and I live in a major city where our rent is currently $2600, which we split, but are planning to move out of the city within the next few months to help save/pay off debt. 

I currently take home $3,678 after taxes, have fair credit, keep up on all payments, and have a remainder of approximately $550/month for groceries and other expenses. Luckily I am able to walk to work and have breakfast and lunch taken care of at my office, however I have nearly zero wiggle room for extra expenses.

Basically, my wife has made it clear that we will not dip into our joint savings to help pay this debt off. The two loans, CC, and PayPal are all in my name and I have taken on handling this debt on my own. 

Are there any options here? Is there anything I should focus on first? I would like to try and pay off the CC Debt as quickly as possible as that balance has put a significant dent into my Credit Score. Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you all.",finance

personalfinance,Optimal Repayment Allocation for Multiple Loans,"Hello Everyone, I apologize in advance if this question has already been asked/answered, or if it is not quite on topic for this sub-reddit. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question concerns the optimal repayment strategy for paying back multiple (student) loans, in a general sense. More specifically, suppose I have two loans with different principal's (P1, P2) and different interest rates (r1, r2). Say I have M total dollars to allocate towards their joint repayment every month. Is there a general optimal way to allocate the M dollars between the two, so that I can minimize, say the total repayment time? 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that often people say to repay the highest interest rate first, but this doesn't seem to be wise if the lower interest rate loan has a significantly higher principle. For instance, should I always put all M dollars towards the loan which will have the largest interest payment this cycle?

I have 1 year of community college left to finish and ofcourse 2 years of (future university) to get my bachelors.   So going all in will have me finish school in 2021, by that the time my eldest son will be 6 years old, and youngest will be 3. 


The issue I have is that I do not know if essentially paying off $38,000 in student loans means I can re-borrow that amount for my bachelors.  The max limit for a bachelors degree by Navient is $50,000 as I’ve been told.  Are loans like credit cards, where if you pay it off you can re-borrow the amount?



Right now I’m living off my husband’s income of $24,000 a year gross.  I cannot get a career using my original bachelors degree and husband never graduated college.  Spacing it out would be a better move financially (debt wise) but that would mean 3-4 years more on a minimum wage job to pair with my husband’s.  I’ll be in my 40s by the time I have an actual career. 



Going all in is riskier, but means I can start off at $50,000+ a year by the time I’m 35.   Combined income then would be $75,000+.  So we would be better off. 



So can I re-borrow the loans after I pay them off?",finance
personalfinance,Starting from square one. Looking for guidance/recommendations,"**TL;DR**: Turning 30 soon and freaking out. Zero savings and zero knowledge on finance/economics. Looking for recommendations on books for dummies for a crash course on personal finance. Also any tips/advice/recommendations/guidance on my situation is totally appreciated. 

Hi all, I've been a long-time lurker, and made a throwaway account for personal reasons. Anyway, I'm turning 30 in 3 months and beginning to seriously consider my financial situation and future. I come from a poor family that has no education or experience with finance so I'm late on a lot of things. I’d like to turn my life around and gain a better understanding of all things finance/economy so that I can go into my 30s more financially responsible. My boyfriend and I would actually like to start reading books on money management/investments as well. A quick overview of my current situation:

- income: 40k (1099, before taxes)
- monthly expenses ($1,500 fixed/bills)
- no health insurance
- no rent (living with family)
- credit score: 580
- savings: $50 (very recently opened an Ally savings account)
- student debt: 25k
- auto loan: 20k
- CC: $700 (maxed out)
- never owned a home
- no kids

Also, my boyfriend and I have been living together for 5 years and split all our expenses. We moved in with my family recently to get our financial shit together (build credit, lower debt, save) but we're still disorganized and undisciplined.

We started a list of our financial goals for 2019:

- **Pay off CC**: I have only one card with a maxed out $700 limit, and he has a $200 limit card. Both are secured Capital One cards.

- **Build credit**: we do plan on buying a home together in the future but won't do it until our scores (both are under 600) improve significantly.

- **Refinance car**: I'm ashamed to say this but my interest rate is 9%. I know, I know. I'd like to refinance asap, but again I need to work on my credit. I know the first thing people will say is to sell it and buy used, but when I say I literally have had the WORST luck with cars, I mean it. I live in South Florida so I commute all over (at least 2-4 hours a day) Ever since I started driving 15 years ago, I have spent tens of thousands on at least 5 used cars. Not just the money on repairs and maintenance, but the stress and emotional drain I've endured with breaking down -- being late to everything, dealing with public transportation (and the sexual harassment that comes with being a female on a bus in a very busy city) -- is what pushed me to bite the bullet and just finally buy something new and reliable. Plus my job is 90% inspections all over the tri-county and dealing with clients so I needed something presentable and reliable. I put about 25k miles on my car a year, so I figured a new car would last and eliminate all stress and doubt. I can go on with points to justify buying a new car, but I can say that I most definitely will not consider selling or ever getting another used car again. Having this car, regardless of my outrageous monthly payment, has alone reduced my stress level significantly to the point where I don't even mind the payment and gladly pay it since it's worth it to me personally. That said, I guess my only option is to refinance asap.

- **Move out**: Yes, living with my family has helped us pay off a lot of debt since we are not paying rent (we do help with the bills and maintenance around the house), but there are 5 people living in the house and it's becoming a toxic environment not only for me, but for my relationship with my boyfriend as well. Like I said before, my family is not financially savvy whatsoever, so even with the efforts to save money, my family is slowly starting to ask/mooch for money for trivial things and guilt trip us to the point where we are starting to fall behind on our own bills. So we need to get out sooner than later. Also, when we lived in our own apartment, we actually managed our monthly budget a lot better, so we'd like to get back to that so we can have our own financial privacy/independence again. Our max budget for renting will be about $1,200 a month.

- **Investing &amp; Retirement**: I have ZERO knowledge on business/finance. I never took a finance or economics class in my life. I still don’t properly understand income tax, let alone investing, stocks/bonds, 401k, IRAs, etc. I basically need a Dummies book, or 101 class. I mean, I need to start from like elementary-level beginning. But again, I think turning 30 soon is putting me into desperation mode about when my life is headed (savings, retirement) and how I’m not prepared at all.

Another thing to consider is that I have 1 more year of apprenticeship at my job before I can take my state license exam and become certified. So by this time next year my income should jump to about 60k and I’d like to be somewhat more financially savvy and disciplined when that time comes. My ideal plan is to already have my accounts set up and rolling so when I get my raise all I have to do is just adjust the percentages going into each account.

Anyways, I apologize for the novel. Just wanted to paint the picture of my sad little life in hopes to change it around in the right direction. Pretty much what I’m looking for are recommendations for resources to educate me in the right path to financial responsibility and peace. My boyfriend and I would like to read books that teach and cover everything. And if anyone has any advice or suggestions on our situation, I would very much appreciate it. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan - Where to Place Extra Payment?,"I am in the lucky position that I received some extra money for the holidays and was hoping to put it straight towards student loans. I have not entered repayment yet as I am still in school. I have 2 loans that I am considering putting it towards.

Loan A is $50,000 at 6.21% and is about a year old (this is my highest interest rate loan). Loan B is $43,000 at 6.00%, however half ($21,500) of the loan was recently disbursed in November. 

My first thought was to apply an early extra payment to my highest interest rate loan, Loan A. The payment would first cover any interest that has accrued/fees and then attack the principal balance.

 However, I saw that if I apply a payment to a loan within 120 days of disbursement, half of Loan B, then the entire  payment would target the principal balance and any interest off that principal balance would be refunded as if I never took out that much loan in the first place.

I was wondering if mathematically, paying off the highest interest loan or paying off the principal of a newly disbursed loan and being refunded the interest would be the best option at maximizing my extra payments?",finance

personalfinance,My mom was hospitalized &amp; I discovered her finances are in trouble. Please help.,"Hi PF,

My 63 year old retired mother was hospitalized for a few weeks and I’m helping her get back on her feet. Unfortunately, I discovered her finances need very significant help. She lives in a four bedroom home in a desirable suburb in Southern CA, which I’m learning she can’t afford any longer (she initially purchased it when she was working and she has since retired and collects a pension, but not Social Security). My younger brother and his girlfriend also live in the home rent-free, and my fiance and I are staying with her for at least the next several months so I can help her recover. (We came to visit her at Thanksgiving when her health issues started and have stayed here since. We live out of state and are freelancers and don’t normally live here, and I’m not working right now because she needs constant care. My fiance is trying to get local work while we’re here. We are very open to contributing to the household, though given that I’m a full-time caregiver and helping manage her healthcare and finances, we don’t know how much would be appropriate. We don’t know how my brother and his girlfriend would feel about contributing. EDIT\*\*\*\* My fiance and I normally live out of state - not rent-free at my mom's house. We came for a visit the day before Thanksgiving and two days later I took her to the hospital, where she ended up staying for two weeks. We've been here one month exactly. 

I’m not a homeowner and am a bit naive about homeownership, so I’ve included a lot of (maybe irrelevant) information for context. She currently has no emergency fund or any money set aside for home repairs and maintenance, which are growing problems because the house needs some significant repairs (i.e. roof leak causing damage). She so far has $750 in outstanding hospital bills but I expect a great deal more (perhaps in the tens of thousands). And the breakdown below that I’m managed to put together doesn’t even include groceries or other household expenses, or any kind of funds set aside for home or auto maintenance and repairs. (Using the information below I've created a monthly budget and added the cost of groceries and spread the cost of maintenance and repair money for both her car and her home for each month based on averages I found, but it’s in the negative by $495.)

I’m pretty overwhelmed by all of this and would appreciate any guidance or suggestions on what to do. My initial thoughts are that she needs to withdraw a healthy amount of cash from her 401k to float her for at least the next few months while we try to come up with a better plan. She is so far pretty resistant to the idea of moving because she can’t live alone any longer so any living situation would require at least a two bedroom, and the local condos and apartments are only about $300 less than her current mortgage. She also believes the tax benefits of home ownership help her, though because she's single and doesn't have any dependents, she has had to pay several thousand dollars the last few years (which she has not accounted for in any budget).

I’m looking into drawing her Social Security early rather than waiting until she is 66 and 2 months, because she desperately needs the money now and her long-term prognosis isn’t particularly great. Disability also seemed like a good option initially because it would offset the early withdrawal Social Security penalty but she can’t afford an attorney right now and I'm a bit confused as to if she would qualify because of her monthly income. We also need to draft up an estate plan as soon as possible and will need to cover attorney's fees for that, too.

I don’t know anything about the tax penalties of taking money out of a 401k, if that’s even the best option, if she should take her money out of the stock market instead, if we should do either of these things immediately before the end of the year because of tax implications, or if those are horrible ideas and there are other things I'm missing. I’d appreciate any assistance or guidance at all to help figure out the next few steps - I'm trying to learn as much as I can about all of this but am very new to it all. Please let me know if there’s any other information that would be helpful. I’m so grateful for any advice you can offer me.

personalfinance,18 year old looking into investing/retirement/planning,"Tl;dr: freshman in college, pursuing med school. No money leftover from job trying to pay semester expenses with no late fees. Will not use loans most likely after freshman year. Getting $6k each November, last time getting $6k is Nov 2021, what do I do with leftover money after I pay off student loans? 

I’m currently a freshman in uni pursuing a business degree, will apply to med school post graduation (give myself 3-4 Application cycles). My freshman year is the only year I’ll have to take out student loans (took out $5500 in federal loans), one scholarship covers tuition entirely and I’ll most likely be a CA for my uni and that job will pay for my room and board entirely. I currently work on campus about 16-20 hours a week at $10/hr, most of this money goes towards my expenses such as food, gas, and my Netflix and Spotify subscriptions, and I’ve paid the remainder of fall so my other expense is $2200 for spring that I owe, and I occasionally pay off accumulated interest on my unsubsidized loans. My parents are paying my cell phone bill, car insurance, and helping with my spring costs when they can (very rarely). Health insurance is crappy from my stepdads employer, employer pays our monthly bill. 

I’m going to be getting roughly $6000 each November until 2021 from my bio dad repaying overdue child support. I plan on using this money to first repay my student loans from freshman year, but have no clue what to use with the money that’ll be leftover. My jobs are on campus so I have no benefits in terms of 401k’s and such. Should I invest the money in a Roth IRA, or any other investment or retirement fund? At the moment I have no savings due to no money leftover trying to knock out my semester expenses, my savings was spent on textbooks in the fall. I do have a secured CC with discover that I use to pay for everything and pay the balance in full each month.",finance

Initially, their financial adviser had suggested a 3% CD or treasury note for a year that would let them reevaluate where the economy is, but he recently started to pull back on that. 

**When they asked him for details, he suggested this ""[Structured Capital Strategies](https://us.axa.com/axa-products/retirement-planning/variable-annuities/structured-capital-strategies/market-trend-indicator.html)"" product, which looks to me to be just another annuity. Am I reading that correctly?** 

He already got them into at least one annuity product that I know about. 

I suggested they look at [this Andrews Federal Credit Union CD for a 2.86% 8-month term](https://www.andrewsfcu.org/whats-new/promotions/specials.html). I think they're leaning that way, but I just want to know I'm not leading them in the wrong direction if this Structured Capital Strategies thing would really be appropriate for them.

Books like The Richest Man in Babylon, Think and Grow Rich, and rereading with intent, Rich Dad Poor Dad.  I've been brainstorming over the last few days trying to think of how to grow my asset column with not a lot of savings (under 1,000) and a combined income of approx. 120k before taxes.  Our expenses in total come to around 70k a year and we can certainly clean that up once we have cleared up approx. 1200/month in consumer debt.  This includes 2 credit cards, 2 401k loans( low interest rate and unfortunately not able to pay more than monthly amount per loan restriction, but only the monthly payment or in full), as well as a two car loans that total 20k.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm aware that once this debt is cleared up we can certainly begin in earnest to work toward FI.  However, I'm of a mind that why not acquire assets that cash flow with debt if they are smart assets.   This would likely accelerate payoff of ""bad"" debt and increase my savings at the same time.  Examples of course are cheap rental properties (under 100k), dividend stocks ( not feeling that one given the recent swings), buying cash flowing businesses and I'm sure likely other ideas that escape me.  Has anyone out there come up with different, out of the box assets where they are seeing a respectable cash flow from that might not be the traditional tried and true?

I want to know if there is any way to ""loan"" out an asset using derivatives or something. Could I, for example, long stock and short futures in order to gain additional interest on the stock since the value of the future should expire equal to the value of the stock. The issue with this is that you wouldn't retain the change in asset value since you have already locked in the price.

The idea I am envisioning is something like loaning out a precious metal like gold or silver in order to get an interest rate on it and have the return be based on the metal as opposed to dollars.",finance

personalfinance,Auto Refinance - bad credit,"Hello,

I’m trying to refinance my car loan because I have an awful 28.47 APR. however, the % is so high because I have bad credit (581). I’ve had the loan for over a year, missed no payments but I can’t get anyone to refi. 

I’ve checked some places online but so far no luck.

My bank says they have options for bad credit, but that the car has too many miles (142K) and that the loan amount is too little (~$7k). Do I have any options other than to continue to slowly pay it down with this atrocious interest rate?

Bitcoin,[Reupload][Tutorial] Install Armory Wallet 0.96.4 on Fedora Workstation 29,"**note**: I had to reupload this because reddit is banning my original account for no reason. I appealed but I thought maybe someone wanted to have this content online.

----

**Armory** is a very cool open source bitcoin wallet for the power user. You can do neat things with it, read here: https://www.bitcoinarmory.com/

------

***Disclaimer***: follow these steps at your own risk. I am not responsible for any damage / loss of funds you might face for following or not following correctly my instructions here. I may have made a typo somewhere or be wrong so do your own research and learn for yourself what I am doing at each step, and what consequences may have for you, at your own risk. These instructions may be wrong somewhere. It worked for me, it doesn't mean it has to work for you.

-------

&gt; **Requirements for this tutorial**:

* [Fedora Workstation 29](https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/) installed and updated
* Internet connection
* [Bitcoin Core full node](https://bitcoincore.org/) running and synced

We are going to build the code from source.

-----

&gt; **Install dependencies**. 

I followed [these instructions](https://github.com/goatpig/BitcoinArmory/blob/master/README.md#dependencies) to find the equivalent Fedora packages:

Open the **terminal app** and run this command:

    sudo dnf install git nano qt qt-devel python-devel libtool pyqt4 pyqt4-devel lmdb swig

And more python packages that I had to install:

    sudo pip install twisted qt4reactor psutil

---
&gt; **Importing the signing key to verify the software**

Install [KGPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGPG) to easily manage keys.

    sudo dnf install kgpg

Go to

&gt; https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0x8C5211764922589A

and copy paste the code below the title from 
&gt; -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

to

&gt; -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

both included. Then open KGPG from terminal with

    kgpg -k

and click '**Import Key...**' &gt; **Clipboard** &gt; **Ok** . You should see a confirmation message. Double check the info and close the dialog. 

Repeat the process with this other key:

&gt; https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0xA4FC919E85C595BA

You can verify both keys are mentioned at the [Armory webpage](https://btcarmory.com/docs/building/).

----------
&gt; **Clone and compile the code plus some edits**

Before, we installed some dependencies that are named differently than the equivalent Ubuntu/Debian package specified at the Armory documentation. The build process fails for Fedora as the name for the dependency during checks won't match the Fedora version. There's [this pull request](https://github.com/goatpig/BitcoinArmory/pull/400) addressing that, but the code is not part of any release yet.

So the fastest workaround (maybe a bit *dirty*) was to edit the build config file and correct the name for my Fedora install. Let's begin.

Clone the Armory repository

    git clone https://github.com/goatpig/BitcoinArmory.git

Enter the BitcoinArmory dir

    cd BitcoinArmory

Switch to release code

    git checkout 'v0.96.4'

Verify commit signature

    git tag -v 'v0.96.4'

you should see the following message:

    &gt; object fee1f91a3137ef1056e15cc606a186b0e508f84c
    &gt; type commit

    &gt; Primary key fingerprint: 745D 707F BA53 968B DF63  AA8D 8C52 1176 4922 589A

if it looks the same, everything is ok.

Edit the file 'Makefile' file with

    gedit Makefile

And click the **three dot menu** &gt; **Find and Replace...**

Configure the options as follows:

https://i.imgur.com/hpS01Kd.png

Click **Replace All** and close.

Go back to the terminal and run the following commands in order from inside the BitcoinArmory dir. Wait for the previous one to finish before running the next one:

    ./autogen.sh

...

    ./configure

...

    make

if everything finishes without error you are all done! Run this to start Armory:

    python ./ArmoryQt.py

Then putting my monthly car payments on there aswell. Then using all my income to pay off my school semester on a payment plan. After school is taken care of I'd find a job and then work on paying of the CC debt before the intro 0% apr is over.

personalfinance,Thinking about paying off my car,"I owe about 11K at 5% or so on a car. was 16K 6 year, has 4ish years left. I'm paying around 300$ per month, about 75$ of which is just interest.

I have 24K in private student loans at 4% and 35K or so in federal at 4% average. Don't have the exact numbers on me at the moment. Federal loans are in graduated payment plan, meaning every 2 years they spike up in payments. I set them up that way since I was making minimum wage when I had to start paying them. They are 3 years in of 10. Plan was/is to have paid off private loans and car before the 8 yr mark, so I'll only have those large payments on federal to make.


I make 58K now, save around 800 per month after bills (and 401k contr to get employer match only). I just moved and have a roomate now so up until very recently I was just saving 300 or so a month. I have about 20K in the bank. I want to dump the 11K needed to payoff the car so I can stop with those 75$ interest payments. Use the 300 in cash flow to rebuild savings to 20K, then divert it to the private loan.

Does this make sense? It cuts my bank account to a little less than half, but would be nice to have the piece of debt gone. I think I can rebuild the savings. and 10K is a passable E-fund for me I think, so long as I build it back up to the 20K I like to hold quickly.

personalfinance,Payoff student loans or put more money for house downpayment?,"The day is come... we finally have enough money to payoff student loans.   
My wife and I have set a goal last Christmas to be done with student loans (bit bellow 100k) this year and we are there, almost.   


Here is what's troubling me. We have around 23k left and it's income based payment which is going to be around 800$ in 2019.   
We are also planning to purchase property sometimes next year and with the money we have saved up now and with the money we can save in the next few months we would have enough for 20% and be able to avoid PMI with the mortgage.   


So my doubt is, finish with paying off student loans and go with the lower downpayment for the house or leave the student loans as they are right now and have a larger downpayment?   


I feel it's kinda same because interest rate on student loans is around 115$ and PMI would probably be around that number.

Another thing to consider is how paying off student loan will affect our credit score and is it going to mess us up because right now it's super high (around 800).   


I guess only benefit of going with 20% downpayment would be lower monthly mortgage payment for the life of loan which is kinda pretty important. On the other side, not having that student loans payment would make me really happy.  


What would you do and what strategies would you try?

\- BRCLYSBANKDE (Barclaycard Ring Mastercard)

\- CHASE CARD (Chase Slate Visa)

\- SYNCB/PPXTRC (Paypal Credit)  
Updated: December 14, 2018 Open - $2,065/$3,897 - 20% APR  
All told, that's 22,351 (17,353 of which is above the loan interest rate)  


All total, I'm using 69% of my available credit and that's the only thing negatively impacting my credit score according to the report. My credit score is currently around 626, and that's after it was near 550 until I got a job September 24th. My income is 750/wk after taxes in Tarrytown NY USA (I live in Manhattan), so about 52k per year before taxes.  


Now for the question.  


I have been looking for debt consolidation, but most of what i found had been either not enough to make a dent, or high interest rates (I've seen mostly 25-30% APR, which makes no sense when my highest credit card rate is 25%) I'm not sure if it's the latest credit score talking, but my most recent search using NerdWallet sent me an offer from Lending Club for $20,000 at 13.90% APR, with 1k origination fee, 18k having to be paid directly into CC debt and 1k going to my bank account (which I'll probably put straight towards the CC debt anyway) They say the way they calculate APR combines the interest rate of 10.33%, and the 1k origination fee to make an APR of 13.90% over 36 months, with a $648.45/mo payment. The major benefit to taking this, as well as the obvious interest rate change, is that I'll have a single number that I can see myself chipping away at.  


Other expenses include:  
$314.32 a month for car insurance (I found a quote for 96, I'm going to switch when my current insurance runs out on March 11th)  
$77.20 for me and my girlfriend's phones with T-Mobile (unlimited plan shared with my parents, her mom and a friend of my family)  
$72 a month for FiOS Gigabit  
$15/mo Google Play Music/Youtube Red  
Food, Gas, EZPass and wear and tear on the car ??? (estimates run somewhere between $300 and $500)  
I live in my parent's place, and don't have to pay rent until their roommate moves out. They will charge me $1000/mo when that happens, so not too worrisome.

Credit card payments already add up to almost perfectly 650 so there won't be much change there if I do the loan.

&amp;#x200B;

EST expenses for now: around $1550 a month either way. It would be $2550 with the rent, so definitely still a little bit of wiggle room to put extra towards the loan, or to save a bit towards the 3 day vacation I take every year at the end of July.  


My plan is to take this loan, put everything into the credit card debt, and live off of cash paycheck to paycheck at the very least until the loan is paid off. Is there any reason I shouldn't take this loan? Is Lending Club trustworthy? I've trusted NerdWallet in the past, so I would hope they wouldn't send me somewhere that sucks. Please let me know if there's any information I left out, or a rule I missed, I'm fairly new here. Any other personal finance suggestions are more than welcome. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Inheritance From Family,"My wfie's and I financial life management over the past few years has been bad. We are ready to get things in order. We are going to meet in a few weeks, but are debating how to start considering we have a chunk of change that we inherited.   


Some rough numbers:

Take home pay roughly: $75,000/year, after taxes, 5% into 401k, and healthcare. 

$30,000 in savings/inherited

$38,000 in student loans - extended repayment plan

Credit Card #1 $3,000

Credit Card #2 $22,000

Credit Card #3 $12,000

Credit Card #4 $1,500

Credit Card #5 $5,000

Credit Card #6 #5,000

Car Payment Left $3,200

In 2019, I will need to spend $6,500 for a medical related expense. 

&amp;#x200B;

Rent $1,240

Power $200

I'll have more details once we actually sit down and examine all our epenses. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the credit cards have ridicious interest rates, I've called around to get them lowered, but no one will budge. We are considering buying a home, assuming we can even get a loan. We live in an area with a lot of first time home buying options (many with low or no downpayment) and are considering a home in the $150,000 range, give or take. Homes are actually cheaper than most rental options here. Medical problems caused much of this debt.   


My very short term strategy is to use the inheritance to pay off the car and the Credit Card #1. Credit Card #1 has a $5,000 limit on it, with a current balance of $3,000. The interest rate on this card is roughly 8%, double-digits better than everything on other credit cards. I don't want to apply for another low interest credit card. After Credit Card #1 gets paid off, I was planning on transferring $5,000 to Credit Card #1, focusing extra resources on it. Once that is paid off, repeat with aother $5,000 transfer. That makes the most sense to me due to the lower interest rate.   


I also, have about $90,000 in my 401k. I'm 38 years old. I know the general rule of thump is to not touch the 401k no matter what because of penalties, etc. But I'll pay way more in interest too, so while unlikely, its in the back of my mind. The one thing I want my wife and I to do is to live in a budget the next 6 months or so. If we do that successfully without amassing more debt, but maybe revisit the 401K. Otherwise, wha'ts the point of removing my life's savings only do the same stupid stuff again. 

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of budgeting, we did good with Mint in the past, but its insessant ads stress me out to be honest, so I don't mind paying for something. I've played around with YNAB, but just haven't grasped on it. I loved the desktop version, but when they went online, it has become painfully  buggy. To compliacate things, we are trying to get pregnant too. At 38 years old, we really shouldn't wait any longer.

personalfinance,Stopped ordering food delivery to save $$,"I'm in my 20s and have since university, I've formed some bad financial habits including eating out for most of my meals. Once these habits led to me spending $36 on food delivery for 2 people, I realized something needed to change.

What started off as a Whopper at BK once in a week in 2012 turned into a habit of ordering medium combos 4x a week at the drive-thru and pizza delivery. Here the amounts would be around ~$25 if I was paying to feed two of us.
 
Then in 2017, I learned about food delivery apps like Skip the Dishes and Uber Eats and how convenient they were. It became a daily ritual of ordering a big meal, paying a $4 delivery fee as well as a tip on top of a $20-30 dollar meal. I had tried deleting the apps and often found myself easily reinstalling and the apps would remember my credit card info.

Some courage led to me finally taking a look at my numbers and it was shocking to learn that I was spending upwards of $900 a month on food. Groceries were included but those would often go to waste because ordering food from my phone was such a routine, I didn't need to open the fridge door.

After being self-aware of my spending, I set limits for myself. I would keep the apps, look at them if I needed to, but I would not order. Instead I would order Dominos if I had an intense craving and remind myself of how I would feel the next morning if I did just that.

Results:

In a 50-day period including today, I have only ordered Dominos twice, spending $40 in total.

Within the past 50 days, I've spent $0 on food delivery.

Takeout: $150 
Groceries: $350

This gives me more $$ to save instead.

My SO never supported me ordering food delivery but I always fed him to be fair. Now he is very supportive of getting groceries as he knows they are not going to waste. We have made more meals together and are enjoying the time spent making them. We can improve by making salads and other healthy meals as we have been digging into ice cream at home (solving the problem of food delivery can lead to new problems when grocery shopping but that'a a different story).

If anyone can relate to this, just know that it is never too late to form better habits. I now have over $5000 in savings and there's potential for so much more if I can keep cutting food expenses.

If you're spending enormous amounts of $$ on takeout or delivery, focus on small improvements, like ordering a $20 meal instead of $30 or ordering three times a week instead of five times.

Believe that you can develop better habits, and get yourself back up again if you did slip. I'm restricting myself by not even ordering in, but it is okay if you do moderately.",finance

gaming,Has anyone tried LifeRPG?,"Firstly, I just want to say I'm not affiliated with or sponsored by whoever makes this app, I just wanted to hear about experiences with it and personally recommend it. It's a pretty good if like me you suffer from general depression and need a little motivation to do basic but dull things in your life or get going with creative projects.

It's basically an app you can get on your phone where you can set your own missions/quests in your real life and program XP per completion of that activity (a bit like a productivity app I guess).   You can set the XP earned yourself based on difficulty, urgency and fear levels. You also give yourself gems which can be used to buy yourself items which you also add yourself. 

I've just been using this for the last few days and it weirdly alters your perspective of you own life. You sort of actively think of being productive more (if that's what you put as a quest) to get that XP, the same way you'd sought after it in a game. 

You can make sub-categories too, so for example I could add 'finish a book' and put that under my intelligence quest line overall. You can view your progress in different forms of charts and graphs too to see what you can do. 

But the interface is actually fantastic, you can set each quest specific details and even this nicely designed icons from games/life in general. For example, I put a low XP mini quest of 'drink a pint of water' and put it as a little bottle of water, or cook a proper meal as a nice looking bowl of food. You can even give yourself a character name, class and description, which I intend on changing as I level up. 

But anyway, has anyone ever tried this before? I'd love to hear about what you put on there quest-wise for ideas. I do recommend having a look if it sounds up-your-street. I scoffed at it when reading about it but then once I looked, I changed my mind.

personalfinance,Help me audit my current financial strategy (retiring at 50)! Any help is appreciated,"Hi everyone, I'm new here. I was wondering if you wonderful people could help me audit my current financial standing &amp; strategy and see where I could improve or change things up, plus maybe a question or two. Thanks in advance.

###Info, Goals &amp; Strategy

I'm 27. My goal is to retire from full time work by 50 years old. I live in a nice city where cost of living is fairly cheap and I can live comfortably on only 2/3 of my take-home pay. I have excellent credit, no student loan or credit card debt, just a car and a mortgage. I use cash back credit cards for all daily expenses within my budget and pay off the full balance every month. Oh, and I also put a away ~$250 every month into a ""travel fund"". I love to travel and I purposely budget for 2 vacations and a small weekend getaway every year.

### Jobs &amp; Assets

I own a townhome (bought 2 years ago), have 2 jobs (full time and part time) plus own my own art business as a side gig, have a nest egg of 6 months' income in a regular savings account, and about the same amount in a wealthsimple investment account. I currently put away 12% of my pre-tax income into my 401k (full time job matches 4%), and I maxed out my Roth IRA contribution this year. 

###Questions

I'm on track to do the same this year after my raise (~$8700 into 401k from me and employer, $5500 into IRA). However, I do have some extra money at the end of each month. I *think* I have 3 choices with my extra cash:

1. Pay off my car at a faster rate. I recently had to buy one because my old one died beyond repair worth. Monthly payment is $190 - 4.5% interest over 72 months. I checked the terms before signing - I can pay more into the principal anytime I want.

2. Pay off my house at a faster rate. I plan on owning this home for as long as possible and keeping as an asset in retirement (it's in a very good area and it would be easily rentable), and it should be paid off by the time I'm 55 (30 year mortgage). $87k balance at 4.5%, current monthly ~$670. 

3. Add it to my wealthsimple investment account and let it work in the background over time. My partner and I are likely to buy a home for ourselves in 3 years or so (he also owns his own townhome), so having a bit of cushion for the down payment could be very useful, which is one of the reasons I'm leaning towards this option. 

Are there any other options I'm not aware of? I hate having money sitting still and not doing any work for me. 
---------------
Is there anything else I could improve? Perhaps look for a better savings account for my nest egg? It's currently sitting at the bank where I have my debit account, which has a terrible interest rate. Since I have an investment account with Wealthsimple, I was thinking of moving my nest egg savings account [there for a 1.86% rate](https://my.wealthsimple.com/app/promos/hisa).

My Roth IRA will be maxed out every year as it is, so I'm not sure what the best option for me is as far as more retirement savings are concerned.",finance
personalfinance,High yield online savings account and their interest rates.,"I'm not ashamed to admit I'm not very financially literate, so this may seem like a stupid. I discovered high yield savings accounts some time ago and I liked the interest rates I was seeing and how easy it was to open an account. I opened an account with Barclays sometime ago and I think the interest rate was 1.25% APY at the time. Now today it's 2.05% APY and I usually get a nice e-mail or card in the mail telling me when it increases. =)

&amp;#x200B;

What I want to know is, how are these rates of interest set? What determines them? Is there anyway to know when they might increase or decrease?

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, I searched around today to look at what some of the other banks have to offer. Synchrony Bank is offering 2.20% and I even found another one called the CIBC (Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce) offering a rate of 2.39%. I looked at the terms (possible fees, withdrawal limits, min. deposits, FDIC, etc.) of these and I'm OK with them. That said, is it wise to try and move your money around to get a higher rate? Or are you better off just parking it at a bank you're comfortable with?",finance

personalfinance,Is it possible to receive higher pay than average at an hourly job due to experience?,"I’ve been in the coffee industry for around ten years, management positions included. I’m planning on leaving my current position for possibly a Target Starbucks Team Member location. This would be due to benefits, primarily, but as I have gathered, it’s a poorly staffed location. 

Weirdly, I excel in the stressful work conditions that would normally drive people away from this type of job, and based on my calculations, with benefits, I’d need to ask for 15/hr for it to not impact my overall finances, but be able to add benefits. 
To my understanding the pay range starts at 12, but Glassdoor states 8-13. 
My theory is that due to my experience, and that I would need minimal training, along with the fact Target is raising their minimum wage to 15 by 2019, this seems plausible. I just don’t know if it’s a thing. To my understanding it’s more typical to hire an inexperienced person, train them, and pay them less, than it is to hire someone who will need minimal training.

From the article. 

Wells Fargo &amp; Co (WFC.N) will pay $575 million to settle claims made by U.S. states that the bank created phony accounts and other customer abuses, according to a statement by the Iowa attorney general's office.

Two years ago, Wells Fargo agreed to pay $190 million to settle federal government claims that the bank created phony customer accounts. The deal announced on Friday will settle similar claims made by attorneys general from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The settlement was reported earlier by Reuters.

personalfinance,"Pay off low interest student debt, or hold the funds in savings/invest?","I have about $22,000 in student loans with no other debts. These are fixed rate with fairly low interest. I’m currently benefiting from programs which give me a 50% interest subsidy, bringing the actual interest on most of these down to 1-2%. I’ll get that subsidy for another year. 

I can literally earn more by putting my savings in high yield CDs (2.65-3%) than paying off my loans. 

Once I’m no longer eligible for the interest subsidy, the interest rates will go up to between 3.6 and 4%. Even that I think is fairly low. I could take my savings and pay off 100% of my loans right now, but honestly I see some benefit of holding on to cash rather than dumping it in loans which I can never get back. 

I feel like earning 3% on a CD and holding on to the asset is (in some ways) better than dealing with 3.6% in interest. I probably could outpace the interest on the debt if I just invested in the stock market and got modest returns (5%). 

Is there any reason to pay more than the minimum in my case? I assume keeping the student loans open longer also adds to my length of credit history.",finance
personalfinance,Accidental overdraft fees on a closed checking account,"Throwaway account here because I prefer not to have financial information attached to my primary.

I recently decided to switch banks because I was finally fed up with Bank of America's predatory practices and fees.....taking $5 a month out of my savings account for not having enough money in my savings account?! Really?? Did my research and ended up finding a great new bank with no mandatory minimum, no service fees, etc. When I closed out, I transferred all of my money into my new account and \*thought\* I crossed my T's and dotted my I's by removing BofA from all other credit cards, bills, etc. and adding my new bank information. Turns out, I missed one and my student loan servicer attempted to take my monthly auto-pay from BofA. My account (which by then had $0 in it) overdrew, causing me to incur a $35 overdraft fee (!!!). Because the payment bounced, my student loan servicer tried one more time, leading me to a grand total of $70 in overdraft fees.

I've since gone on and paid my student loan and ensured they have all the correct account information moving forward, but my question now is what am I able to do about those remaining overdraft fees? When I called over the phone, the representative said she couldn't do anything about them, but I still really don't feel like it's fair for me to pay them, considering that the account was - for all intents and purposes - completely closed out when it overdrafted. If I just leave the fees sitting there, what could happen? Am I obligated to pay? Can I just...never log into Bank of America again and never give them a cent of those fees? Any advice here would be warmly welcome!

personalfinance,Things every young person getting their first accounts with a bank should know.,"I worked in banking for over a decade. Here are the most common banking mistakes and how to avoid them.

If you get a credit card, you can make the bank set the line if credit to the minimum amount. Make the set it to the minimum credit line. Don’t let them increase it. Don’t let them sell you on additional credit cards or credit products. Bank employees get commission for selling you on most bank products and will push you to get more credit cards. Don’t fall for their sales pitch. If they automatically increase it, call them up and have them set it to the minimum credit line.

Do not get a card with an annual fee. Most likely your first card will have a high interest rate. If you pay the card balance listed on the bill, you avoid all interest. Not the minimum payment, but the card’s statement balance.

For pro tier credit card handling, if you used it, make a payment on it for the amount you used same day. This can be done by making the payment at the bank, or utilizing bill pay on your online banking.

Now lets talk about how to avoid overdraft fees on your checking account. It is super old school, but I have a transaction register book which the bank will give you for free. I keep all my receipts, and at the end of the day, I record them in my book, than check it against my online banking to see what transactions have cleared, and which ones have not. Your book will have record of transactions that have not cleared, providing you a live accurate balance. While it is a lot of work, I prefer that over paying multiple $35 fees.

Let’s talk savings accounts. If you are lucky enough to not pay rent, get two savings accounts that don’t charge a monthly fee. Set aside a reasonable amount into each account every pay check. Have one be your slush fun for fun things that you will want to buy. Have the other be one you don’t ever touch, EVER! Use that second one for emergencies. Like medical, car repairs, or for have maxed out your low limit credit card, even though I told you to pay it off.

Now, the dark side of banking. You are 18, you should be the only signer on all of your accounts. You should be the only one with access to them. Do not keep your parents on your savings. Do not let your parents hold on to your credit card for you. Do not add that new person you are dating to your accounts. People get weird about money. I have seen a mom take her son’s credit card, max it out, destroy his credit, and he doesn’t want to take any legal action because it is his mom. Some parents start to see their kids as a way of getting an interest free loan. Set up your checking and savings account statements for email only. 

Tl;dr- If you get a credit card, get the minimum limit and always pay it off. Avoid annual/monthly fees on everything. Pay off the credit card as you use it. Don’t get more than one card. Set aside money in your savings. Track your spending in your checking. You should be the only one on all your bank products.

Edit: From my experience, a new bank account owner should not get overdraft protection. Most new bank account owners either tank their savings account and not realize it, or max out the line of credit that is linked for over draft protection. A $35 overdraft fee or two serves as a much harsher lesson to pay closer attention to spending. And unless some laws Have been changed, I believe you can only get X amount of fees in one day. Plus, you may be able to get the bank to forgive one or two of the fees. Your best bet to getting a fee waived is to politely ask and accept the first answer you are given. If it is a no, you might be able to ask at a different branch and get a different answer. If you put up an argument, the banker is more likely to note the interaction on your profile for other bankers to see until the end of time.

Also, as you mentioned, try to avoid automatic monthly charges at all costs. If you have bills, pay them through your bill pay and note them in your check register as they do not clear immediately. Checks are not so bad if you put them in your check book as you write them.",finance

personalfinance,US Tax as a Non Resident Alien Questions: I haven't been filing taxes.,"Background - I'm from a country with a tax treaty with the US. Currently I am a grad student pursuing a PhD in NY under the F-1 visa. I started in 2015, so my tax treaty ends next year, which is why I started looking into taxes. Have been receiving income in the form of stipend ranging 35K-40K pre-tax and pre-rent. I've been receiving fortnightly a paycheck equivalent to income with rent deducted, but no withholdings.

&amp;#x200B;

When I first arrived, the school and I filled out the W-8BEN form (in 2015). Since then every year I have filled/received a W-2 (empty except for employer and employee name and address, blanks for income-related things), a 1042-S (filled, has my income, but states tax rate as 0), a 1098-B from my healthcare provider, and a 8233 form every year.

Because I am from a tax exempt country, I took that to mean that I didn't have to file for tax returns. I haven't received any calls or mail from the IRS either. It's my fault for not looking into this more and naively thinking tax exempt = no tax forms to fill.

Now, my questions are:

* ~~Should I have been filing taxes?~~ Yes
* ~~What happens now? The IRS hasn't tracked me down. I haven't falsified forms but I also haven't been filing forms. I don't owe any taxes (I think). Is there a penalty for not filing forms if I don't owe tax?~~ None, because my tax owed is 0.
* **~~Should I be filing taxes?~~** ~~I know that the school submits the 8233 exemption form on my behalf every year, but again, I haven't been filing anything myself. Is the 8233 enough or should I still fill out the 1040NR?~~ Yes wow this was a dumb question
* ~~Bonus Q - is my W-2 right? My wage and federal tax withheld boxes are blank (which I assumed is because I'm tax exempt so all my income is tax exempt). Will I start getting a filled form once my treaty is over?~~ yep
* ~~Are there resources that can clarify how taxes would work for graduate students receiving stipends (bonus points if it has information for NRAs)? Would it be worth me finding an accountant for all this.~~ found it. 

Thank you so much in advance!

edit - I've found sprintax which is able to handle these complicated dealings. Verified that I should have been filing taxes, but I don't owe federal tax and I am owed state tax. So here are updated questions: 

* Since I don't owe any tax, if I want to file my older tax returns (2016, 2017) can I send them in with my 2018 tax returns? Is it better late than never for the past years?
* Same question, but for state tax? Will I still be able to collect the money I'm owed from previous years' state tax returns?

personalfinance,Student loan refinancing questions,"So I just graduated from law school and have around $180,000 in student debt. I have been offered refinancing through First Republic, for which my company has “relationship rates.” My current loans are at interest rates of 6-7%, and the First Republic is offering me a 3.55% rate.

One of the conditions of the loan is that I have to hold around 10% of my total debt in a first republic account, and get my salary paid into a first republic account. 

Right now, my bank accounts are split up and I have my husband and parents as co-owners on various accounts. However, first republic will only give me credit for a fraction of the accounts that have co-owners. The bank is making it really logistically difficult for me to take my parents off my accounts (the money is all mine, they have just been co-owners since I first opened my accounts as a kid). 

Is there anything wrong with opening a new account and just transferring the 10% into there to show that I have it? Would this affect my credit score in any way? Does this sound like a refinancing option I should take?

I don't know anything about investing and I'm actually surprised I have almost $5,000 in my savings account. 

Any help that you can provide me is greatly appreciated. Please let me know if I'm missing any information and I'll add it to the text here.

Edit-  I would also like to start a low risk investment. I don't need to invest a lot of money because I do not have a lot of money right now. I would not even know where to begin to start investing money. The other question I have is that should I pay off my debt 1st, or should I just go ahead and start putting a little bit aside each month to invest? Or maybe do a little of both? 

Edit- 2 - paid off the 1800 cc! Feels good.  Thanks for the advice!",finance

personalfinance,Student loan repayment strategy,"I wanted to get some advice on how I should go about tackling my student loans. I read that tackling the highest interest rate ones first is the best way, but I was not sure if that applies in my situation:

20,000 + 1,000 interest @ 6%

7,000 + 450 interest @ 7%

20,000 + 2,000 interest @ 5.3%

11,000 + 1,000 interest @ 5.8%

Also, interests will soon be capitalized when grace period is over. In this case, would it make sense to pay off the loan with bigger interest rate, interest balance, or principal balance first? Thanks for the help!

personalfinance,Should I co-sign on my fiance's car purchase?,"UPDATE: 
My wonderful dad was able to fix my fiancé's car. Turns out both mechanics he went to were ripping him off by quoting a 1.8k repair price for what was, essentially, just a little work on the headlight assembly and a new belt. All it took was half an hour and my dad had it up and running perfectly! Lesson learned. Always ask a trusted family member before taking it to a mechanic. No new car needed yet, but I'll remember everyone's super helpful and kind advice for next time! 

Hi all,

My fiancé and I are both recent college graduates, with a debt load of about 30k each (govt only). We make $14 and $15 an hour, 40 hrs a week. I also have a post tax side income of $1000/month from teaching music. 

I have no debt otherwise, he has a $800 debt on a credit card opened in high school in his name by his family. (It was maxed out on a purchase of a laptop with the intention of building credit...his family fell on hard times shortly after and the interest rate skyrocketed, leaving him with 2k debt. He's worked hard to pay it off but still has a little ways to go, intends to get it done by May.) 

We are getting married in July, and will be getting an apartment. Problem is, his current car has given up the ghost. He wants to get a 2013 Civic for $10k, with a down payment of 1.5k, but asked me to cosign since it will give us a better interest rate and lower monthly payment. I used the credit forecast offered through my bank and added a 9k auto loan, which told me it will drop my credit score from 722 to 689. 

My question is, should I do it? I don't want to badly hurt our chances at getting an apartment, and I'm also scared to add another debt right when I'll be having to go from $450/mo rent to probably $1300/mo rent. (I share with roommates right now, and I live in a high COL city.) My fiancé is up for a promotion in January that will get him a raise of $18-22 an hour, but he has to have a working car to get him to his job! He can still get it without me most likely, but payments and interest will be higher.

Credit score: 750

We will need to pay income tax on the $25k payment in 2020 but I don’t know how much that will be. It is my personal income which will be increased from $50k to $75k in 2019 due to the payment.

We have a 2001 Jeep Cherokee we think we need to replace. It is worth ~$4k but we needed to put $3k into it in the past few months and it is still not very reliable.

My work offers retirement account matching of 3% but I have not opened an account yet - I’m 28F.

My fiancé and I were each thinking of putting $4k into a retirement account for $8k total. We were going to increase our savings by $3k, which would leave $14k? We don’t plan to get married for 2-3 years.

He was going to sell the Jeep for (hopefully) $4k and then put $10k down on a vehicle that would cost ~13k, financing $3k for 1 year?

My concern with paying towards the student loans is that we would still need to keep making the same monthly payments regardless of how much we pay down and the money might be better spent somewhere else?

We have a son and currently pay $700/mo for child care but that should decrease to $350/mo in the summer.

All advice greatly appreciated! maybe what we were thinking makes no sense, we feel a little overwhelmed.",finance

personalfinance,Need assistance on reporting foreign bank account interest,"I need to report interest made on foreign bank accounts. My understanding is I can simply do that on my regular tax return 1040 under interest income or is there another form I need to report it on (interest is $10'in us). 

(I have no fbar or 8938 requirements)

However, according to Greenback Tax ""If there is any income (such as interest and dividends) from the bank/investment accounts, it needs to be reported on a timely filed tax return in order to avoid penalties and interest""

What does timely filed mean? For example, if for 2016 I had no tax owing and would have received a refund from the IRS, I have 3 years to file a return. Does this mean I have 3 years to report this foreign bank account interest of $10? Or was I supposed to report it sooner? 


Let's say for 2017, I owe the IRS $100 for federal income taxes only but don't file my regular tax return that reports this foreign bank account interest  until 2019, so a year late. Would I be subject to  seperatr fatca esque penalties and interest on the $10, or just the regular penalties and fees on the $100 I owe for federal income tax?

personalfinance,Advice needed on plans to repay my student loans ($220k),"I'm a 28 yr old starting my last semester of my family nurse practitioner schooling in January. I'm trying to get ahead of my debt and plan for the future. What jobs I look for and what locations I look to work in are largely influenced by income/ability to repay my loans. As of right now, I currently carry approximately $220k in student loans. The loans are all from federal sources with average interest rate of 6.4%. Since entering school, I have accrued roughly $17k in interest alone.  

Currently I have several sources of liquid cash: 2 stocks, 2 mutual funds, and my savings. All in I have approximately $98k in those accounts total. My salary upon first job will be in the neighborhood of $75k-$90k depending largely on location. (Higher pay usually means higher cost of living of a given area, though).

My current plan is to go for jobs that assists with loan repayment. The federal government has the HRSA program which gives up to $50k for 3 years of service in high need clinic. Most states have their own version of this too. Some states (Pennsylvania, Maine, etc.) will give up to $100k if you commit to 3 years of service. My question about these programs are whether you can qualify for both programs or not? I can't find the answer to my question anywhere. 

Next, my final question is how to go about planning on paying back my loans. Does it make the most sense to dump my savings (all $98k), or some portion of it, into my loans right away to get the interest rates down? Or does it make more sense to keep my money in mutual funds/stocks where it has potential to make me more money?

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin, Engineered Economic Collapse and IMF ""Crypto""","Too all the bitcoin fans out there we live in changing times.

&amp;#x200B;

The Fed has been responsible for every single boom bust cycle since the great depression (go so search up bernanke admitting the Fed was the real reason for the great depression), and it looks like they are about to start a new one in 2019-2024. These ""cycles"" are basically musical chairs that allows the banking cabal to concentrate their power as the ""weak""/noninsiders get wiped out. Before the great depression there were many small banks, nowadays top 5 banks own almost everything.

&amp;#x200B;

It works likes this : Prolonged Ultra low/0% interest rates = People/corporations addicted to cheap debt and take unnecessary risks. This also leads to hugely inflated asset bubbles in everything(been happening since 2008).

&amp;#x200B;

Current Stage (2019 onwards) - Now it's time to ""pop"" the bubble and raise interest rates/reduce fed balance sheet (reverse QE) to make debt unservicable for everyone (mainly corporations and the US govt) and reduce asset prices under the guise of ""fighting inflation"". It's no coincidence Donald Trump aka The Bankruptcy King was ""elected"", and once a ""confidence event"" occurs everyone will dump US Tbills at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

This will be an ""engineered collapse"" with the ultimate goal, to kill the dollar. Why would the fed want to kill the dollar? The Fed is just one arm of a global banking cabal (IMF/BIS/Rothchild cartel), to them killing the US economy and dollar is just one step to their ultimate goal &gt; One world currency/IMF (SDR backed) ""crypto"" (completely trackable and traceable global currency). Once the collapse happens and people see their asset prices and dollars devalue rapidly they will beg for this IMF/SDR backed crypto and will happily be pushed into the new system. It's one of their standard tactics, look up ""order out of chaos"" to understand how the plebs fall for the same damn tricks over and over.

&amp;#x200B;

They will use BTC to build out all the infrastructure for this IMF/SDR crypto but then will use the Futures markets to crash the price of BTC for a long time (maybe &lt;1K). Basically, it's a psychological game, as they want everyone to hate BTC and go for their IMF/SDR one world ""crypto"". They have been doing the same damn thing in the precious metals markets for the last 8 years, supressing the price via Futures paper. Once enough people sell their BTC and they control the market, then they will allow it to moon by removing suppression and letting the market know central banks have ""just started"" adding BTC to their reserves. For those saying but ""Bakkt"" is physically settled, I have yet to see them be approved, and even if they are my guess is the keys will still be stored on ""their warehouse"" which will allow them to fractionally reserve/use rehypothetication to bet against the price and create unlimited ""copies"". Why don't they just ban BTC and remove the competition? If you are familiar with any black market you know banning anything just explodes the price and moves the market underground. Its much more effective to try and crash the price and make people ""despise"" the asset class.

&amp;#x200B;

My guess is during the economic collapse their will be parallel markets IMF/SDR ""crypto"" (to pay taxes and use in real world), BTC (black market and online). But ultimately their goal is to collapse the price of BTC until they control the vast majority of coins.

&amp;#x200B;

Advice - Do not sell your BTC at any price (hold your keys) and hold 20-30% precious metals. Reason for metals is the Lindy effect on metals is 1000s of years, BTC is 10 years, who do you think is more likely to last? I personally hold 70% crypto/30% metals.

ALL the other universities are out of my budget). ***Im a C Average student because of the difficulty of my classes*** which makes me ineligible for scholarships.

If i enlist in the military January 2020 (this gives me 2 semesters to earn 25 more credits in college so I can enlist with a higher rank).

One of my loans is an institutional loan that is in a 10 year repayment plan at 5% interest, so for this I pay $90 quarterly.

Due to this lack of official degree but potentially 2-3 years experience once I'm a year or two out of college, I worry about my job prospects. From the outside looking in, especially for internships, it seems nearly impossible to find anything if you're wanting to get into CS and don't have a CS degree. Given the current administration I'm not going to even bother applying for any internships or jobs federally the next two years, it's just not worth it at this point if we have a furrlough every three-six months and budget constraints keep people from finding work.


I know that I want to eventually work in some kind of consulting role, that I love political science as a science and discipline, but that I don't like academia. Grad school is one thing, academia is a whole different animal. I figure that living abroad will help me not only learn a new language, live in an area that is more accessible (generally speaking), but also help me save money. If I earn $2,200/mo out of school, sure it's only 24k but it's higher than locals and I'm not one for big spending.

Ultimately, like many in my position I think, I'm looking to go abroad and work after I graduate. Teaching English is on the table if it has to be, but I'd prefer to do something more creative/lucrative... Maybe the time I spend not teaching can be used to keep my coding and music skills sharp. I currently have basic knowledge of French and Mandarin, but I really don't want to be in China given the political climate at the moment. Earning 3k a month in Shanghai sounds fucking wonderful given the CoL if it wasn't for the health risks and political climate. I'm unable to drive, and living in VHCoL or even HCoL areas of the US doesn't seem feasible right out of the gate after college given my skillset.


Given all this, would going abroad make a difference in knocking out my debt and giving me saving potential? I'm not sure if I'd want to leave permanently, for just a couple years, but I do want to go abroad and push like hell to pay down my student loans.

Just to name a few. I was advised by a few to do Fidelity Advisor Freedom 2045 and set it and forget about it.

Others said to invest in the s&amp;p 500. Is that the same as the 12952 Invesco equally weighted s&amp;p500?

Are there any others you guys personally recommend? As of now, I'm thinking of putting in 5% into the Freedom 2045, and 5% into the s&amp;p500. Does that seem good enough?

personalfinance,Please Critique My Budget and Financial Goals,"It's my first post on Reddit! :) Sorry in advance if this is long, but I am trying to be thorough. I would love your thoughts on my budget and financial goals. 

So first, I do have an unusual situation that hangs over my head and may someday affect my financial picture. I have metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Quick educational moment: when breast cancer moves beyond the breast (in my case to my lungs and liver) it is no longer considered curable. It is treatable, but the natural course of the disease is that your cancer gets smarter than the meds and takes over. Everyone is an individual though, and although I am realistic, I am hopeful--I have met survivors who are here 20 years with MBC (they are in the minority, but it does happen, and treatments are being developed every year). CT scans are currently showing that my mets are not detectable (woohoo!) and I am working full time. I was diagnosed a year ago at the age of 35 with no family history de novo--that means I was metastatic from the start. Only 10% of us are, they vast majority of people with MBC present with it years after treatment for earlier stage breast cancer. OK, that was kind of off-topic, but it is something that might be kept in mind.

Let's start with my budget...I make a gross income of $69250 annually and am paid 26 times a year. I budget based on two paychecks a month though. I'll just run through a paycheck from gross to net.

Gross: $2,562.50
Pre Tax Deductions: $246.31 (401k), $101.92 (FSA), $36.61 (medical), $13.19 (dental), $4.37 (vision), $99.44 (purchased time off)
Total taxable income: $2,060.66
Taxes: $195.63 (FIT), $143.08 (Social Security), $33.46 (Medicare), $99.48 (state tax)
Post tax deductions: $4.15 (work-provided legal plan), $6.15 (long term disability), $18.80 (short term disability), $73.89 (401k Roth)
Net pay: $1,486.02 That leaves me with $2,972 monthly.

Expenses: $1082 (rent), $30 (water and sewer average), $200 (Roth IRA), $68 (gym), $60 (massage membership), $300 (credit card payment), $300 (car), $150 (internet and cable), $120 (auto and renter's insurance), $110 (cell phone), $35 (electrical bill average).

And that is $517 left for food, entertainment, clothing, gas, etc.

Please critique and let me know where you think I need to make changes.

Also, I received an inheritance of $75,000 cash and $22,000 stock, as well as some land and mineral rights. But those will be so small, I did not want to count that, and I don't even know what those will be. 

Here is my plan for critique: $7,000 to credit card debt (that will still leave some, but this is the higher interest rate), $10,000 set aside for some expensive AF dental surgery, $10,000 to a donor-advised charitable fund, $20,000 in a money market account, $20,000 in long term investments, $2,000 to my Roth IRA in 2018, and $6,000 to my Roth IRA in 2019. I plan to take the $22,000 in stock and diversify and reinvest. Does this sound like a reasonable plan? Also, I'd love to buy a condo in a year--does that sound crazy?

Overall, I really love the service and benefits of US bank but they charge me $3 to transfer money to my high yields savings.

personalfinance,Need advice to on purchasing an apartment in NYC / Brooklyn (Williamsburg) area,"I've been toying with the idea of buying an apartment for several years now, am really torn, and would love some advice. Apologies as this turned out to be a longer post than initially intended. 

&amp;#x200B;

A few details about my wife and I:

\- We're in our early 30's, with relatively stable jobs, excellent credit (802 as of last check)

\- Together we gross roughly $310k + approx. $20k in stock from a public company, per year. Also vesting options in a private company with a reasonable chance of successfully exiting

\- Roughly $125k in savings/investments (plus another $150 in a 401k)

\- We've lived in NYC / Brooklyn for 8 years (at least one year living on UES / LES / Murray Hill / landing the past 3 years in Williamsburg)

\- We plan to live in this area for the next 5 years minimum, likely longer as it's where our industries thrive

\- Both of our jobs are in the NYC / DUMBO area

\- Have a dog and plan on having a kid in the next two years

&amp;#x200B;

Current fixed monthly expenses:

\- $3400 rent (1br)

\- $550 car payment (+$300 garage parking, $170 insurance)

\- Another $1.5k or so for food, drinks, etc

&amp;#x200B;

So, the tl;dr version is we'd love to purchase an apartment in Williamsburg (we love the area), but we want to make sure we're making a smart purchase. At minimum, we'd need a 2 bedroom since we're planning to have a kid - and the apartments we tend to like are priced in the $1.1-$1.8mm range. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most calculators indicate we could easily fit into the middle of this range, around $1.4mm. However, again, I want to be sure I'm making a sound financial decision. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my broad thoughts...

\- (I believe) Williamsburg market is still inflated, with a lot of new condo's coming available next year

\- The L train (main transpo from Williamsburg to Manhattan) is scheduled to go down in April '19, which I believe will depress prices further

\- Conversely, interest rates are going up (4%+) so waiting could have a negative financial impact or net even if the overall purchase price is decreased (fear I may have missed the boat on ""cheap"" money)

\- When we need a second bedroom, rent would likely raise to $4.2k / mo

\- (I believe) The market is unstable and due for a downward trend in the next 2yrs

\- On a macro scale, Williamsburg may be underwater by the time a 30yr jumbo is paid off (global warming and what not)

&amp;#x200B;

So, the question is: is this a clear choice to pull the trigger on an apartment as quickly as possible in early '19 given the factors above, or am I missing something?

Businesses in emerging markets, such as China, have gone on an even bigger borrowing binge, taking advantage of ultralow interest rates and, in some cases, state-driven policies designed to propel economies forward.

&gt;So far, businesses have been able to service their debt without too much difficulty. The concern is that could change if interest rates continue to rise, making debt more costly, or if the economy slows, crimping profits.

personalfinance,Is the housing market here broken?,"I've been thinking of people who buy apartments. I'm not considering doing it, just wondering about the market.

An average, 2-bedroom apartment in Tel Aviv rents for 7K₪/month. That same apartment would sell for _at least_ 3.5M₪. If someone wanted to buy it as an investment, and had a 20% down payment (700K), and got a better-than-average mortgage from the bank, he'd be paying 15K/month for the mortgage for 30 years.

The numbers for other apartments I've seen are similar enough - while some are cheaper or more expensive, the ratio is roughly the same every time. 

How does it make sense to put down 100 months' rent, then pay more than double the rent for mortgage? If you keep paying rent, and save an extra 8K (totalling the same as mortgage payments), with a modest interest rate, after 30 years you would have saved more than the cost of the house.

With an FHA loan of 4.875% interest rate and $20,000 downpayment, the loan amount is $262,937 which includes a $4522 mortgage insurance premium. (Not sure if we only qualify for FHA vs conventional)

Loan/month = $2269

* $45 Insurance
* $650 Taxes
* $171 PMI

I could put only $10,000 and pay points I believe that would cost $7888.11 to get a rate of 4.125% and save me about $50/month and breakeven would be 13.15 years. (Does not seem worth it)

Loan = $2218/month

* $45 Insurance

We can go through another lender, maybe conventional loan?, but we only get $2500 as the incentive towards the new home. We can maybe get a better rate? The loan would be $305,915

I'm about to possibly be unemployed in the short term and am worried about how to deal with possibly missing a few payments, etc. 

A good portion of the credit card debt is either refinanced and/or not accruing interest through some other promotion. The one that ends the soonest is in April 2019. I believe once that statement hits, if not paid in full, I'm gonna be hit with a pretty large interest payment as a type of catch-up. 

Is there any sort of financial tools out there that I may not be aware of to help me out, if this debt becomes unmanageable? It's already starting to feel this way, and soon I may not be able to make payments all together so that I can pay rent, utilities, etc. with my last bit of savings. 

edit: I've received a large number of bits in the mail about personal loans for credit card debt, places like Prosper, Marcus Goldman Sachs, BBVA compass, etc. 

I read all the fine print and many of them have pre-payment penalties, charges for this and that, and when you do the math it's pretty hard to tell whether or not taking one of these would help me in the long run. Especially if the loan cannot be paid off early, which would be the goal of wrapping the credit card debt in to one payment plan - to get rid of it more quickly and easily, preferably at a more reasonable interest rate.",finance

financialindependence,Picking a state.,"How much does which state you choose to FIRE in (or semi-FIRE) in matter?

Offhand, these are some factors that are in my mind on this issue as we consider moving this summer from Massachusetts:

- State income tax (which applies to capital gains!)
- Property taxes
- Home prices
- Distance to friends and family and where you currently are (difficulty of move, etc.)
- Quality of life (safety, quiet, proximity to what you love, airports, etc.)
- Local work opportunities if you have to go back to work and can't find remote work.
- Long term trends for that state/area (growth, shoreline concerns, what else?)
- *Anything else I'm forgetting?*

So, just to give one example, let's look at capital gains taxes. In our case, we have most of our money in a brokerage account, so could withdraw $40k/yr to live on if we were lean-FIRE'd at $1mil or somewhat more. 

If *all* of that were just capital gains and none of it were basis, we'd pay $0 federal tax on it but $1,591 in MA state income tax. However, right now our brokerage account is all basis (we're sitting at a loss), so we'd actually pay $0 in MA state tax. As our investments grow, we will ramp up toward that $1,591, though it will probably be a long time before we even get to half that amount.

However, we also have 457b money we were thinking of taking early. 457b accounts can be taken out with no penalty at any age as long as you are separated from the employer. The advantage of taking them early for us are: 1) Can take in FIRE years only enough to stay in $0 tax bracket ($24k currently), so pay no federal taxes, and 2) if we someday move abroad (quite possible in our case, as wife is from Spain), we'd have converted this to our own money and so will not be taxed on it there--and it would be taxed at 19-25% there! But, in MA, this $24k in 457b money would generate $775 in taxes, whereas in RI it would be only $19. 

**Anyway, don't want to bog us down in details too much. Has picking a state been part of your FIRE planning? If so, how'd you go about it?**",finance

personalfinance,Planning 2019 with my fiance. What do you think of our budget and goals?,"We're both recent graduates in STEM fields (Bachelor's level). I have a full-time job and plan to start a PhD program next fall. SO just graduated a few weeks ago and is looking for jobs, no immediate plans for grad school. We're currently living in different states due to my job.

&amp;#x200B;

**Current Stats**

Me: $16k in savings. No debts. I earn around $2300 a month after taxes (varies a bit with my side hustle income) and I save 30% of my income on average. I currently live frugally but in a HCOL area. In grad school I will earn a modest but liveable stipend.

SO: $5.5k in savings. $35k student loans (federal unsubsidized, interest rate 4.2%), has to start making payments in August. He lives with his parents so his expenses are essentially zero. He's an engineer so his entry-level pay will likely be medium/low but will increase quickly as he gains experience.

&amp;#x200B;

**Our 2019 Plans and Expenses**

*Job/School/Moving:* I'm planning to start a PhD program in August, but I won't know until March or April which program I'm going to join. At the moment the plan is for my SO to find a part-time job where he lives for the next few months (probably FedEx, he's work there before). He'll spend his extra time applying for full-time engineering jobs in all the cities where I applied to a PhD program (I specifically only applied to areas where his field has a strong job market). Once I pick a school, he'll focus all his applications on that city. If he finds a job before August, he'll move there ahead of me. If not, we'll both move in August and we'll use our savings/my PhD stipend to support us until he finds a job. If needed I can take out some student loans during this time.

*Wedding/Honeymoon:* We're getting married in the summer before our big move. The wedding will be very small and inexpensive. We've agreed to contribute $1000 and our parents will cover the rest. Our honeymoon budget is $4500.

*Retirement:* I would like to start a Roth IRA this year. I have $1000 set aside for this purpose.

So here's a summary of what we're budgeting for our upcoming expenses:

* Wedding: $1000
* Honeymoon: $4500
* Moving for school/job (probably cross-country): $2500
* Roth IRA: $1000
* TOTAL: $9000

Most of that is going to come from me since I have the most savings/income right now. My SO will contribute between $1k-$2k from his savings. Assuming I maintain my current saving rate, I should be able to cover the rest and still have a solid $10k in savings by the time we need to move in August. We'll probably also get some money as wedding gifts, but I'm not including that in the budget.

&amp;#x200B;

**Student Debt Payoff Plan**

The elephant in the room here is my SO's student loans. We don't have to start payments until August, but we'd like to start sooner since they're already accruing interest. We've set goals to achieve in the next 6 months and 12 months.

*6 month plan:* SO maintains at least $3k in savings, anything extra after paying for our major expenses goes toward his loans. Since he is currently living with his parents, anything he earns from his part-time job can go toward the loans as well. The goal is for him to pay at least $600 a month during this time.

*12 month plan:* Since we'll be getting married and moving after 6 months, we'll make the payoff a bit less aggressive. We plan to combine our accounts and maintain at least $10k in savings while paying $300 a month toward the loans. If we start running low on cash, we will back off his payments to the minimum required ($200). Hopefully my SO find a job during this time and we can reevaluate our budget when that happens. If not, I'll take out some student loans that we can pay off when he gets a job.

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to hear what you all think of our 2019 financial plans (particularly for the student loans). We're both torn as to whether my SO should put more money toward his loans vs. building our savings for some of the big expenses that we'll have in 2019.

I never got any letters from the electric company (owned by my city) and so I just thought it was settled with the total sum I paid in the portal.

We are already over the discussion if an MBA is worth or not in her case, so the discussion is more on how to pay for it. Here's some of the reasons I didn't find answers by myself:

## Financial situation
* Earning little over 200k USD per year, no debt besides less than 3k on a car and big savings
* Credit Karma says I have a 706 credit score on TransUnion and 699 on Equifax but only 668 on Experian. 
* We are in US for only 6 months, so credit history is very small.
* I have two unsecured credit cards with 30k USD limit in total. Use less than 10% of that and always pay in full. 
* I have a small car loan at 3.5% APR. Could pay in full anytime, but decided to have it to diversity credit.
* Expecting to have a Green Card (me and wife) over next 3 years or so


## MBA Costs
* Total cost estimated in 190k USD
* Having the university as a co-signer, foreign students can finance up to 80% of costs at about 9% APR
* We could probably pay her MBA with savings, but considering we expect to refinance at lower rates soon, we are probably putting up with a high interest rate for now. Does this makes sense? 

## Questions
1. I understand I have OK'ish credit but with very little history. What are the chances of getting a better deal than 9% APR if I co-sign the loan?
2. Assuming we are only looking for a loan closer to her start date, is it worth applying for additional credit cards today? Do you think this would be positive or negative when applying for a loan? 
3. I'm checking my credit reports and it's not showing things in some bureaus. See table below. Is this something I have any chance of fixing? See details:

Card/Loan|TransUnion (706 score)|Equifax (699 score)|Experian (668 score)
:--|:--|:--|:--
HSBC Credit Card|-|Reported|-
Credit Union Credit Card|Reported|Reported|-
Credit Union Car Loan|Reported|-|Reported

Considering the credit union do report the car loan on Experian, would it be reasonable to expect they do the same with the card? I've seem online HSBC doesn't report to TransUnion, but Experian not seeing any Credit Cards seems bad. What are my options?

* Complain to my Credit Union?
* Apply for one more credit card and hope my score bounces back when it's time to get the loans? 
* Anything else?",finance

Is it better growth predictors, tying into interest rates published by reliable sources, a CRM for clients built in, better live updates, live tracking, what?

economy,interest payment to cash flow balance sheet models,"So... I'm reading ""Money Culture"" for the first time (I know... old book) and I ran across an interesting reference to [a paper written by Ben Bernanke and John Campbell back in 1988 titled ""Is There a Corporate Debt Crisis?""](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/1988/01/1988a_bpea_bernanke_campbell_friedman_summers.pdf) [PDF link]
 
The only reason the paper caught my eye was due to their references to ""equities repurchases"" (financed by debt, dividend reduced/eliminated and redirected CAPEX), in particular the observation of its overuse, 1984-1986, leading up to the crash of 1987.

The entire justification seems to revolve around the idea that buy-backs reducing float while dividend issuance does not.   Additionally, there are contributing factors of the time, namely high interest rates and debt tax advantage, that contribute to the assumption of debt for repurchases.  However, because debt-asset ratios are calculated at book value, there's seems to be an equity valuation blind-side. 

Fundamentally, the conclusion of the paper seems to imply that significant changes in equity price can effectively mark to market mis-valued debt assumed for repurchases during an increasing interest rate environment. 

Accordingly, I'm curious if there is anyone doing any kind of publicly available analysis with regard to debt-asset ratios vs cash flow vs equity valuation.

I'll just close with the reason I want to get a handle on debt service as a percentage of cash flow using a ""word byte"" from Money Culture:

&gt; debt servicing today comprises 26 percent of corporate America’s cash flow, compared with 22 percent in 1982 and 19 percent in 1974. As Professor Bernanke concluded, “The last time we had debt in this range was in the 1920s.”",finance
investing,CDs and US Treasuries,"Since Certificates of Deposit in the US are FDIC insured, they're about as risk-free as you can get.

Plus, Treasuries bought through your broker can be re-sold easily, whereas you can't cash out a CD early without incurring a penalty.

Looking at CD rates in the area, it's hard to find a reputable bank offering them at rates greater than equivalent Treasuries.

financialindependence,New jobs for higher income --&gt; less time to FIRE or remote work/entrepreneurship on lower income --&gt; location independence/more time to FIRE?,"Hello, my fiance and I are working toward FIRE as part of our goal to be location independent (which I know don't have to go together, but it's our current plan). I work for a tech startup at the moment wearing a ton of hats and a lot of tech skill but making $23/hour with no prospect of a raise (we don't even get yearly reviews). My fiance just got out of the Navy, he gets a small pension which is a nice source of passive income but with that and my job we are just barely getting by in Washington State, USA.

We're 25/26, no kids, rent a small 2bd apt with 1 car (used 2008 Prius we paid for in cash a few years ago). We're doing everything we can to save part of our combined yearly income of roughly $60,000 (after taxes/deductions) but we only save around 15% each month for investments.

I have a Roth 401k with my company and a taxable investment account via Schwab invested mostly in stock index funds/bond indices. I only contribute about 1-2% to the 401k (again into Vanguard index funds) because we have no company match and the company finances make me nervous. He doesn't have any retirement accounts but I'm guessing that's our next step... We have an initial meeting with a registered fiduciary advisor this week.

We have a lot of debt -- I have federal student loan debt of about 30k with roughly 6% interest. I don't make enough to refi for a lower rate but will revisit once we are married. He has credit card debt (we paid off 2 of his but he has 1 left) totalling roughly $12k. He also has a loan from the Naval Academy that is 0 interest. Total monthly payments for these debts is roughly (minimum) $1200.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY MAIN QUESTION:**

I'm in the job market for something that pays more, BUT it's possible I may be able to negotiate working 100% remotely for my current company. If that's the case, I think I'd be ok with my pay rate since I could also focus on my own side hustle(s) in development AND be location independent. However, I'm not sure that with our current debts + low income the money I make plus the pension payment would be enough to pay those down. The other big issue is the job market is terrible for young professionals in this area. I've gotten interviewed, even headhunted, but they always want more experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Fiance is looking for a job too but like my own search this poses the issue of location independence as it's not likely we'd both land jobs that we can do remotely. **The goal for us getting new jobs would be to get a higher income to fund eventual FIRE vs. living off what we currently have with my theoretical remote work negotiation. The remote work thing might be more realistic once the debts are paid off.**

What would you do? I think finding higher paying jobs is safer, but would delay location independence (which might be cheaper than living here). Plus we are 2 months into a 14 month lease at an apartment complex.

personalfinance,What to do to improve credit score?,"Hey all,
I have been trying to improve my credit score to lead up to hopefully buying a home.

I've paid all my debt off with the exception of my student loans, and I've been using credit karma to track my score. Some weeks I'll be up to the mid 700s, and then for some reason credit karma will update and I will drop to the low-to-mid 600s. Right now I'm at 670. Nothing between these periods has changed. I continue to pay down my student loans. I have a single $10 charge on two credit cards which is less than 1% of my available credit which is paid immediately once it's reported.

I have four hard inquiries. I tried to open a Charles Schwab brokerage account last year, and for some reason, they executed two hard inquiries. I also opened two credit cards about a year and a half ago to try to keep my account age and limit high enough for the impending fulfillment of my student loan debt.

What else can I do? I have all green on credit karma except a yellow for the hard inquiries, and a yellow for average credit age which was significantly reduced after I opened the two cards. It's currently at 6yr 8mo.

I have been rather lucky this year and managed to bank about 100k in savings and kind of become pretty financially stable. As someone from a dirt poor background, I'd like to try and utilize some lines of credit to fund some investments, but it seems no matter what I do here, I cannot get out of this hole, and only have secured cards available to me, or loans with awful interest rates.

personalfinance,[PA] UTMA Custodial Account -- custodians refusing to sign over money after beneficiary has reached age of majority,"I posted to legaladvice, and they suggested this post would be better served, here.

A few years ago I learned my parents had set up a custodial account, which would be held for me until I became an adult. However, they were always cagey on what age that'd be -- when I was young, I was told I'd have control over the account after I turned 18. At 18, the age became 21. Now, at 26, they've informed me that it wasn't a custodial account at all, but a trust fund. They further informed me that it's entirely up to them when they release the funds to me. They then indicated they'd only do so to purchase a house for me in their hometown. (I've moved across the country, and have no intention of moving back to their home.)

My attempts to learn more have been thoroughly rebuffed, and I've been denied access to bank statements from that account, the original document, and any other paper documentation. All claims relating to the account (""you will get it when you're 21,"" etc.) were made verbally, in person. I'm not sure if they took care not to make any claims in writing, but they've certainly managed to dodge me, there. The bank manager is a personal friend of my mother, and has also been stonewalling me. I'm pretty sure this is illegal.

Recently, when visiting back home, I took it upon myself to search through their financial documents while they were out. What I found was both confusing and potentially life-changing. There is an account with a substantial sum, labeled ""[MOTHER'S NAME] CUST FOR [ME] UTMA."" Now, before my mother informed me that the custodial account was ""actually a trust fund all along,"" I'd looked up custodial accounts, and run across the term ""UTMA."" UTMA stands for ""Uniform Transfer to Minors Act,"" and the Pennsylvania UTMA says (afaict) that the accounts are typically handed over between ages 18 and 21, though a custodian can indicate on the original document that the funds be turned over at age 25, instead. Now, this certainly would explain why my mother was so eager to convince me that the account is a trust fund.

But here's the trouble -- the internet suggests the existence of something called an ""UTMA trust,"" of which the rules may not apply. I'm very uncertain if a UTMA account could also be a trust, as I've found few and confusing references to this online. I'm also hesitant to request more information from the bank or brokerage firm. The bank is a local branch of a small-town bank, and the last time I requested information, they told her about it. My suspicion is that she's lied and informed them that I'm 'irresponsible' or 'greedy,' or something like that. She has a long history of making up things about me. Since the account is still under their name, they'd likely invest the money in a bond/CD, or otherwise make gaining access to this account a Pyrrhic victory, should they learn I'm seriously investigating this.

I'd like to know what would happen if my parents invested that money now, essentially rendering me unable to use any of it for 5-20 years, given that I'm 26, and the account should've been handed over already. I'm also unsure on how to get information on money they've previously invested in my name (mutual funds) without my knowledge or consent (if my consent was needed, they forged my signature.) I've been told and have seen documents indicating that I have or had bonds, but never signed anything, and never saw the interest. It may have been deposited in the custodial account, but I'm not sure.

I'm also raising this now because I'm being taxed on the investments (the mutual fund's interest) and have never seen a cent of the interest -- so I'm being taxed on money I don't practically have access to, and this is going to be problematic come tax season. Previously they paid my taxes while I was in school. (I was always curious how my taxes were in the thousands of dollars when I was a student and making &lt;$1k per year. I was told the ""government puts you in the highest tax bracket because you're young and single."" I've since looked this up, and it's nonsense.)

Further, if it really is a trust fund, then I'd like to know what to expect -- is it possible that the relinquishment of this account is entirely at their discretion? I'd like to know how to get a copy of the original document, specifically without alerting my parents or their associates, since the whole point of this is to not be overburdened during tax season...

btc,Why Bitcoin Core May Survive Indefinitely (or at least decades),"I realize this may not be a popular opinion here, but I believe BTC may survive much longer than we expect. First of all, before dismissing my opinion, please check my past, you will see that I am a strong supporter of BCH (peer-to-peer currency). I also think LN will never be practical for the average person that uses cryptocurrency.

So why do I think BTC will survive? Simple answer: The Pareto Principle. Over 80% of the value in transactions are supported by less than 20% of the available 1 MB block space. As a general rule, this can also be extended to that 64% (80% \* 80%) of the value in transactions is supported by 4% (20% \* 20%) of the transactions.

Right now the median transaction value on the BTC network has dropped down to about $75 at an average tx fee of less than a nickel. While the median transaction value may be $75, the average transaction value is still around $10,000 and has been as high as $30,000 recently. At the end of last year, on many days, the average transaction value was over $100k.

I paid around a $100 to make a transaction on the BTC network last December. While I feel it was expensive, for the average user around that time making a $100k transfer, it would be only 0.1%. BTW, my bank has a minimum fee of $50 for a wire transfer.

Now, I had to live with the disgust of seeing fees constantly rise in 2016 and especially 2017, but so did a lot of other users. They (like me) moved on to an alternative cryptocurrency. The rich don't really care though, they are just looking for a store of value. Paying a $100 (or even a $1000) to move a $100k or even $1M or more, is no big deal for them. Most of them will even leave their coins on an exchange. And to be honest, I consider a lot of these exchanges to be very safe now for most people (Coinbase for example).

I was around in 2013 reading the forums at Bitcointalk and it was very obvious that Mt. Gox was going to fail. Yet, a surprising amount of people left their coins or a cash balance there. And from what I read on the forums, I felt a lot of these people didn't even know how to make a private wallet and move their coins to it. They were trying to sell and do a cash withdrawal (which was failing long before they went  belly up). 

I honestly believe the Core shills are right about one thing. Bitcoin will be a store of value. It won't be peer-to-peer currency and the LN will never have any significant value, but it won't make any difference. Just like moving gold from one vault to another, they won't care if the cost is $100 or even $1000 to make a transaction. Only the rich will use it. They are use to spending thousands of dollars to set up offshore accounts or store gold bullion. A $k here or there won't phase them a bit. 157,680,000 (365\*24\*6\*3000/block) transactions a year will probably be enough for the richest 1% of the world population, who will probably never make a single transaction (BTC left on their exchange) in any given year.

I can see a future where BTC is used for savings, buying/selling houses, moving large sums of money. Transactions below a $1000 or even $10k will disappear. Fees of a $100 or more won't make any difference. And since they will be keeping their BTC on an exchange anyway, exchanging some of it for an easy to use peer-to-peer currency like BCH will be easy.

And imagine if the government (or even just banks) start to strongly back BTC. They could easily set up a hybrid system like the XAPO card. Your BTC could be used as collateral for a credit card or some other loan. The Federal Reserve could easily give BTC a huge advantage by buying up a large quantity every year with their unlimited money printing capabilities. It would be a win-win situation for them. Unlike a lot of the junk securing bank debt, they would have an asset that actually increases in value when they buy more of it. The perfect collateral.

Now I do believe that BCH (or possibly some other peer-to-peer currency) will survive. And I think it is important for the majority of the world that it does. But I don't think it will ever be the best store of value. The rich (upper 1%) will store their wealth in BTC, while the poor use BCH as a peer-to-peer currency. Which brings me to one last important point.

There is a formula pertaining to the velocity of money. Basically, it says that GDP=Velocity\*Value. Translating for a cryptocurrency, value would be the market value of a coin, velocity would be proportional to how fast it is spent, and GDP would be the value of that particular crypto-economy. BTW, we can also express that formula as Value=GDP/Velocity, which shows that increasing the velocity of money in a given economy can actually decrease it's value (this is one of the forces that can turn inflation to hyperinflation as people start to spend their money as soon as they get it).

Now I don't have the data to plug any numbers into this poorly redefined velocity of money equation, but I can make a guess about the future. I am guessing that the BCH network will be used by people that live day by day and rapidly move money to survive. And if the money is moved a dozen times as fast on the BCH network as on the BTC network (even if GDP of each sub-economy remains the same), then using the velocity formula, the BCH network will only be worth 1/12 of the BTC network. Add to this that the rich will keep their value on the BTC network mainly using it to buy/sell property possibly in a Pareto distribution of wealth (say 80% on the BTC network), and you could have a situation where the BCH network is worth slightly less than 2% (1/5 \* 1/12) of the BTC network. Note that I could have a bad assumption here. Maybe Value will become the static variable with GDP being proportional to velocity. Then the BCH network might be closer to 20% of the value of the BTC network. Either way, BTC would strongly predominate.

I lucked out in the fork. Most of my bitcoins were and are in cold storage in a safe deposit box with a time-locked address with a long time to go. I can't mess up (nor can I do anything useful or important if necessary). If not, I probably would have converted half of them to BCH at the worst possible time. Personally, I think everyone should keep at least half their crypto-wealth in BTC regardless of what they think of the Core team or the Loony Network.

Which brings me to my conclusion. We need to concentrate on making BCH the best peer-to-peer crypto-currency possible. Price and value aren't important. Only that poor people around the world will have a useful currency. This is our true value, not the capitalization fiat number assigned by coinmarketcap. It also brings up one final issue: Security.

We will never have a majority of the hash power like BTC, which will make us appear vulnerable. Which means some minor compromises like rolling checkpoints and even renting hash when attacked. It also means that we must be willing to fork if necessary to remove toxic people like Craig Wright and Calvin Ayre. 

The important thing is to survive while we grow to become a world peer-to-peer currency.

If you are still here, thanks for reading my rambling post.

personalfinance,"Buy a flat in London, UK?","Moving back to London early march (just in time for Brexit hurrah) working abroad for a while. Housing is obviously an important consideration.

I have an idea to buy a £400k freehold 2 bed flat (sheperd's bush/Brixton/idk...)

Financing structure
* I can provide £100k in equity.
* I can get a fixed rate mortgage for £140k for 10 years at 2.5%.
* I can get a £160k (40% of property value) loan from the government at 0% interest for 5 years and then 1.75% increasing to 2.1% over the other 5 years.

Repayment
* I can cover monthly payments of mortgage plus taxes/utilities/maintenance contribution to the housing block which is £1900-£2000 per month for any year. No interest rate change exposure.
* The repayment of the loan in 10 years is 40% of property value at that time. If the value dives, I repay less, if it increases I repay more. Worst comes to worst, I sell the property then. Almost no interest exposure.
* I can get some extra money by getting a flat mate.

Financial position/personal
* I have £250k in investments (mainly stocks) mostly denominated in euro I can liquidate.
* I have a stable income, bankable of currently £46k plus decent bonuses.
* 25 yo EU national

Scenarios/issues
* I don't plan to live in London for 10 years, more like 3. If I move away: rent out to cover ~70% of the total monthly payments I reckon.
* Is it too much stress/risk and not an adequate investment for my age?
* if I don't want to repay the loan in the end, I could sell the property which would definitely cover the loan.


Questions
* Should I rent, should I rent for 6/12m then decide/buy after Brexit or should I just buy now?
* Am I better in paying rent and invest monthly savings in stocks and buy in some years?

Honestly, this whole thing makes me nervous. What's your advice?

personalfinance,24 year old-Can’t seem to make ground/Don’t know where to start,"Hey guys, reason for me being here and asking for advice is as the title says I’m not making any ground financially and I’m not too sure where to turn. I’ll try to keep it as short as possible, I’m not even entirely sure what I’m looking for. Just any general advice or direction I suppose.

24 year old male. I’m currently a sales rep for a Fortune 500 company. My base salary is $43,000. I also get paid monthly commission and quarterly bonus. A big issue right now is that I took a 10k salary cut to be in my current position, with the potential to earn much more. Right now I’m still technically in “training” for my sales rep job. The normal rep in my office would average somewhere about $65-$90k depending on performance. With presidents club reps well over 6 figures.

I also get reimbursed for my mileage once a month which has been somewhere around $700-$1000 the past few months. The other catch is that when I’m out of training which should be semi soon, the company will then give me an allowance for my car and cell phone which will total $405 every month, untaxed.  I also will no longer have to pay my own car insurance or pay for my own gas. That is pretty much all about my income.

I will get into expenses now, these are monthly payments.

I also currently contribute 3% to my 401k which currently sits around $3.5k. The company uses a weird formula based on fiscal performance to match employee contributions.

So that’s pretty much my life financially. I understand the easy answer is to make more money which I’m working on, but I also want to set myself up for success in the future. Any advice would be much appreciated.

personalfinance,Last day of the year tax tips,"Not that any of us like to procrastinate, but there could be people asking: what can we still do on December 31st to save money on  2018 federal income taxes?   That depends on your specific situation; for most people, probably including you the reader,  not so much.   But, if you do see yourself in any of these scenarios, you may still have options today.   (Many people also have options in effect until the tax filing deadline of April 15, but those are not today's topic.)  

This is not intended to be a complete description of everything possible, and in particular, it doesn't list all of the hoops one must jump through to be eligible to take these, so do your research before making the decision to buy a shiny new electric car based on something you read on reddit.  

-  Losses in taxable investment accounts.  If you own any stocks or bonds (or funds of same) in a taxable account (i.e. not an IRA) that declined in value since you bought them, then you can deduct up to $3000 in losses against other income, whether or not you can itemize; you only need to sell enough to claim the loss.  (If you exceed $3000, you can carry that loss forward to future years.)   You can't replace the shares until 30 days pass if you want to own the same thing.  (Look up ""wash sale"" rule for more about this.)  Your losses have to exceed any realized gains to take advantage of this.  

https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/111315/deducting-stock-losses-guide.asp

-  Adjustments to income.  These reduce your taxable income whether or not you itemize.   The ones that are calendar-year based include: alimony payments, student loan interest, interest penalties for early withdrawal, armed forces moving expenses, and expenses incurred by educators and performing artists.    If you have the option to pay these today, then that will help your 2018 taxes.

https://www.thebalance.com/adjustments-to-income-3192985

- Itemized deductions.   These only apply if you have enough of these to exceed your standard deduction of $12,000 ($24,000 for joint filers).   If you can itemize, then increasing your 2018 expenses for things like charitable contributions, state and local taxes (up to $10,000 annually), and mortgage interest will reduce your 2018 taxes.  

https://www.thebalance.com/new-tax-bill-itemized-deductions-4160594

-  Schedule C/E expenses.  If you have self-employment or rental property income, any expenses incurred as of today can still be taken to reduce taxable income for 2018.  This also reduces your self-employment taxes.  You can also take an adjustment for health insurance premium payments.  

https://smallbusiness.chron.com/list-deductible-business-expenses-schedule-c-21156.html

-  Tax credits.   You can take a tax credit for at least part of certain types of expenses.  These are mostly calendar-year based, and include dependent care, college tuition and fees, and electric vehicles.  Also, adoption expenses.  Clearly, most of these involve some significant advance planning, but to the extent you can time your payments favorably, today would be the day to do so. 

https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/taxes/what-tax-credits-can-i-qualify-for/

You may also have state tax options; those are outside the scope of this discussion, but 529 contributions might be one place to look at deductible expenses with a calendar-year deadline.",finance

personalfinance,Debt Consolidation vs. Snowball/Avalanche.,"I finally got a budget that I'm sticking to and recently added in all my credit card and loan debts into [Unbury.me](https://Unbury.me). I arrived at around 20,000 at an average interest rate of 19% with a payoff in five years doing doing about $500 a month. (Snowball vs. Avalanche only give a difference of two months and $500 in interest.) My lowest interest rate is \~15% for a personal loan from my credit union. The rest range from 22% to 19%. My absolute minimum payment is around $425 with it paid off in seven years.

Would there be any advantage/disadvantage in doing a 60 month, $20,000 debt consolidation loan from my Credit Union if I can get an interest rate below 19%?

personalfinance,"First time applying for a car loan, my credit unions APR seems high and looking for advice.","I make gross $41k a year, have about $2k in student loans, and no other debts. In my early 20's. I'm looking at a used car that's almost exactly $12k, and have been saving for a down payment of about $3,500 - $4,000.

I was dumb and didn't consider my down payment when I asked for a pre-approval loan of $13k.  My local credit union offered me a 63 month loan with a 6.5% interest, which seemed high to me.

My credit score is 759 according to TransUnion, but the credit report on the loan brought it to 730. This essentially makes me drop a tier in credit, and I'm worried it will effect my interest rate when I ask the dealership.

I'm just general anxious and worried I'm making poor financial decisions. Will the dealer be happy or irritated with a large down payment, and is my judgement of the credit union APR accurate? Is it dumb for me to expect a good interest rate with a credit history only 2 years old when I'm so young?

All said and done my loan should end up paid off and I should be getting a check for about $1,200. However currently my loan still shows that I owe over $20,000 on the totaled vehicle. I have a FICO score 620 as of 10/17 according to my Ally account. I make about 3k a month &amp; have some credit card debt as well.

I would like to purchase a brand new 2019 vehicle, and seeing as how it's the last day of the year this is probably the best day for me to do it.

So my question is should I apply for a loan and go try and purchase a car today, or wait for everything to hit my loan &amp; to be paid off before I go car shopping?

I am afraid of a high interest rate because I currently have another car loan out for over 20k, even though it will be paid sometime in January.",finance
personalfinance,"27y, 25k debt, seeking tips for digging out of this in 2019!","I'm an untethered, healthy 27y/o seeking advice from your collective brain! After 3 years of volunteering domestically and abroad, I have finally scored a job in a booming field (Health IT) where I am valued, supported, and paid pretty well for my time! (Amazing!) Now, I feel it is time to confront the elephant in my closet: student loans. I've been deferring them or paying $0 monthly payments for years because I haven't made much money until several months ago. My cost of living is pretty low, but I hope to relocate to a better area after I gain more professional experience and am free of debt.

I also am an avid traveler, and beginning to churn credit cards for travel rewards. I would like to continue to take at least 1-2 international trips this year, while also paying off my loans.  I don't have a technique for saving specifically for trips, but I'm very open to any suggestions. I want to feel in control of my finances and work on bettering myself.

Here's my current financial standing:

Take-home pay: about $3000/month

Savings: $3000 in checking account (I was at about $5000, but I invested in a fantastic new computer and went a little over the top for my first Christmas back in america after 3 years away)

Below is roughly what I spend a month, and my loan details. I have kept all my receipts from the last 6 months since I started working, I haven't done anything with them, but I want to keep track in 2019. Especially for food and drinks!

personalfinance,Help with student loan repayment plan,"Hi all, I was hoping for some advice on Student loan repayment.  I am going to be starting a new job in a couple weeks after graduating from school.  I have come out of school with a loans totaling $62,000 dollars and will be making $90,000 annually at my new job.  My plan is to repay the loans with in 24 months.  Currently with my spouse’s salary we are able to cover all living expenses.  The plan is to have my salary to pay off any unexpected expenses as they come up and to pay off the loans as quickly as possible.  My loans details are below.

Total loans $62,120.90

Group A: $14,766.17 @3.860%
Group B:  $22,195.53 @ 4.660%
Group C:  $14,159.74 @ 4.290%
Group D:  $3706.09 @3.760%
Group E:   $7,293.37 @ 4.450%

My question here is should I look into consolidating the loans under one interest rate.  If Not and I choose to pay them off as fast as possible what makes the most sense.  Spreading the monthly payments over all five groups or pay the minimum for 4 and pay everything else into the others?  

Thanks in advance for any one’s help",finance
personalfinance,Would it be smart to open a new card to pay for the old one?,"Hey guys, thanks in advance for the information. I am a 24 yrs old, this is my second year out of school with a 'real' and 'big girl' job so I am still figuring out some things as I go along. 

&amp;#x200B;

My total debt right now is around $15,000 for my car (4.1% interest), $6,000 for student loans (4.6% interest), and $1,800 for credit card. My main question is about my credit card but I included the other information in case anyone has extra advice on debt for me! My $1,800 balance credit card has an interest rate of about 14% . I got an offer to open up a new credit card through my bank (I only have one Visa credit card through my bank and one store credit card and that's it) and it is 0% APR for the first 12 months plus 3x point earning bonus. I don't even know if that's a good deal or what kind of card I should open to get a better deal!

My question is, would it be wise to open up this new card and get a cash advance or balance transfer (I am honestly not too educated on the pros and cons of either) to pay off my old card? And then keep my old one open and keep building credit? I can pay off the $1,800 before the year is up, most definitely. Probably within 6 months. My credit score is a few points away from 'excellent', I am not sure if that affects anything.

personalfinance,Paying down mortgage vs building savings,"I am at a impasse on what to do. Current mortgage is 1080 (esgrow included) and I'm paying 1300 a month to pay it down faster. Wife and I plan on buying a new home mid 2020. Am i better off paying the extra towards the mortgage or fluffing our savings account before looking for a house?

Currently have about 10k in savings.
Interest rate is 4%.
Current plan is to rent our current home once we move. Similar homes rent for 1300 to 1500 a month in our area.

personalfinance,Pay Down Auto Loan or Deploy Capital Elsewhere,"So I just paid off the last of my student loans.  I was going to roll that money into paying off my auto loan but I am no longer certain I want to do that.  I also have a mortgage at \~4% but I'm not factoring that into this equation.  I have no other debt to tackle.    

I am an avid YNAB'er and have a couple grand socked away in different categories (auto maintenance, medical, etc) but I do not have a bonafide ""emergency"" fund and retirement contributions are lacking.  I do not currently have an employer match to contend with.   

The auto loan has an interest rate of 3.1%.  Throwing an extra $120/month at it will see me pay off my car 10-11 months ahead of schedule and will save me $200 in interest payments.  A Marcus online savings account is currently sitting at 2.05% APY and should improve further in 2019 if the Fed continues to bump rates.   

With the auto loan being at such an attractive rate I am currently torn between paying it down, creating an emergency fund set aside in Marcus or contributing to a Roth with Wisebanyan.  

Creating the emergency fund will shrink the gap in unrealized interest savings vs paying off the loan.  It also provides me with extra capital in the event that I actually need some emergency funding.  Contributing to a Roth is a gamble as it could lose value but it still provides me with accessible capital if needed as I can withdraw my contributions penalty free.

personalfinance,Best Banks for Emergency Fund Acct?,"I've held an account with the same bank (Citibank) since I was 2 years old. (Dad worked for the company.) I did open a second account at a different bank for my student loan money so I could keep them separate but I closed that account after I graduated. 

Long story short I ended up in a soul-crushing amount of debt after I lost my job, gained a serious illness, fucked myself over hardcore because I was so depressed I stopped keeping on top of my substantial student loans, etc. Now I am finally working again at a job that allows me to put a little away from each check. I'm of course putting as much as I can into paying off my loans, but I want to have a cushion in case I lose my job, get sick again, etc. 

Part of me wants to open a Citi savings acct so I can link it with my checking for convenience and overdraft protection, but I also think there are probably better places/banks to keep my money in in terms of fees, interest rates, etc. Any specific tips, banks that offer good savings account terms, etc? Aside from a couple of emergency $20s in my glovebox I haven't had saveable income in over a decade and I have come to the conclusion I have no idea what I'm doing.",finance
