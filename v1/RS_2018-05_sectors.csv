personalfinance,My budgeting attempt. Can someone take a look at it?,"Hello. made a throwaway for this. But I am trying to better budget for my life.

Here is my budget i did https://imgur.com/a/kAGbOoF

some info about me

I am a 24 y.o. male. I live with my mom (single mom). I have a younger brother who moved out and lives with his gf.

my mom lived paycheck to paycheck. So we dont have much money monthly.

and notes regarding my budget i made

1. doesnt include a phone bill as my brother pays for the family phone plan

2. used conservative values regarding budgeting overall because as I mentioned, my mom lived paycheck to paycheck all her life. So I am mostly in this to help her out. I can't afford to move out or anything because I would still have to help her on some bills.

3. I am basically treating this as a ""roommate"" situation for budgeting purpose. my moms mortgage is ~~$1600. So I pay half.

4. I am not sure, but I chose an overestimate value (a value that I think is a good overestimate) for car/transport, groceries/food, and entertainment. My monthly car insurance is ~~~ $92. I made an estimate of $160 monthly on gas for car. and another 102.5 is what i pay for parking monthly. Reasons being is that I am pretty introverted, which keeps my entertainment and car/transport expense to a very minimum.

5. the 401k is from me deducting for 100% match.

6. i dont pay health insurance. my company pays it.

So i was wondering, am i missing out any essentials here that should be included in a budget? this leaves me with ~~$582 left over monthly. which is NOT good enough because I have student loans coming very soon. (they are currently in deferral, as they are federal student loans. I have ~~ $30k in student loans ranging from ~~4.5-5% interest rate)

is there some areas where I can probably make room in budgeting? and what is a realistic average monthly expense on food/groceries, entertainment, and transport for 1 person?",finance
personalfinance,Should I Hold Off On New Credit Applications Before Buying Home Within 12 Months?,"I just started a grant program in my state, so I'll be buying a house within 20 months (but probably closer to 12).

I make a pretty decent amount of money ""churning"" credit cards (signing up for credit cards just for the bonus). I've made almost $500 this month alone and I'll make the same or more next month doing this. Only started it this quarter.

I'm wondering whether I should stop applying for all new credit until I get my mortgage rate. I have good credit to start with (about 750 before the credit card churning down to 730s now).

I only plan to own the house for 5 years which is a big factor. Otherwise it would certainly be imperative to make sure the interest rate was perfect. 

So I guess my question is, is the interest rate difference enough to offset the money I'd make churning cards in the meantime? Would cutting off all new credit applications for 10 months make a significant difference even?",finance

personalfinance,What are good ways to generate passive income in my twenties?,"Situation:
I am currently still studying for my bachelor's. The debt of studying and living is manageable here in the Netherlands compared to England and the US (€2K tuition yearly, ~ €800 fieldwork, cost of living about €1300 p.m.). I have a government student loan of €1065 p.m. against an interest rate of 0.002% per month starting 2 years after graduation. 

Working experience:
I have had many sales jobs, but I have to invest more of my time into education nowadays. So I am wondering what are good ways to create passive income over time. Right now I invested half of my savingsfund into crypto because I am quite a technology geek. 

Organisation experience:
Did two boards for a student entrepreneurial organization and another one on sustainability at my university.

Hobbies (in case this helps):

I am talented into painting, drawing. I am also working on publishing a thriller before I'm 25.

So the reason I wrote all this is because I want to create many ways of passive income (even if it is relatively peanuts) so I can focus more on my study and art carreer instead of putting the hours into working for paychecks.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Dear Mr. Buffet,"Dear Mr. Buffet,

I hope this message finds you well.

If there’s one thing corporate america is unsure of, it’s what to do with millennials, the largest generation in the US labor force. Perhaps, the world labor force?

While your date of birth was in 1930, Millennials are turning 30 and rising up as the next generation of leaders for the next 30 years. 

Cryptocurrency is speculative, but for how long? And is it less speculative now than it was in 2014? Speculation is defined as theory without firm evidence. Knowing this, I’m left to assume a lot of investments are speculative. A consumer or business loan at a bank might be speculative. The bank determines one’s ability to repay monthly debt based on current circumstances. What happens if one loses their job? Goes out of business? The market crashes? A loan might then be a speculative investment to the person receiving the money. Perhaps, a bank has strong strategies in place to cover themselves in the event of default. Perhaps, they even budget each year for losses. But I wonder more about the person who applied for the loan? Was this a speculative investment on their end? And if so, should they not apply for a loan?

To some, Bitcoin is a get rich fast. I’ve seen this mentality crash and burn.

For others, including major institutions, Bitcoin is the future. And there is still plenty of room to grow while a lot of information is yet to be learned. 
Some have lost money, yet Bitcoin is still here. We have new investors and existing investors adding to their portfolio. We have people who have even taken losses, back. And we have the ones who have held through the volatility. If these ones held longer than 9 months to date on one of the top 100 crypto currencies, they should be in profit.

One basic piece of consideration while speculating on this digital currency is that it’s not backed by the federal government. My understanding is the US dollar is backed by a federal note. So, then comes trust or “good faith.”

Why should Millennials trust the government acting in good faith? Snowden shared infamously and famously with the public that our data is not private. The SEC has been breached with our information, a credit reporting agency was hacked with our information we provided to the banks. Wells Fargo and more like them generated revenue at the expense of the consumer’s best interest. The banks put us in a recession in 2008. Bitcoin was created shortly after this crash. Trust is defined as the firm belief of the strength or reliability in something or someone.

My generation is tired of deceit from the corporate world and we do not want to put our financial freedom in the hands of this ‘speculation’ any longer.

A lot of money is made through transferring money in a banks system, yet we now have the technology to minimize multiple hands at play, to control our own money. To be able to accept multiple payments as a business owner without paying the payment card industry 3% each time for the processing, Sure, this might hurt merchant companies, payroll companies, western union, bank fees, treasury management, but Millennials are less concerned about keeping these businesses in business. They are concerned about transparency, keeping data secure, and efficiency. 

The economy is going to have to adapt to the next generation of innovation and find a way to work with it not against it. If Bitcoin doesn’t work better than our current way of doing things, something else will. At any rate, the consensus of Millennials, the next leaders of Millennials will have this say. 

My observation is that Millennials, above all, want their freedom. They are less concerned about hoarding money and more concerned about making a life. They are a defiant generation that’s not afraid of breaking rules. Not afraid of expressing opinions. They are tired of politics and tired of making money for corporations at the expense of ones personal well being. They are determined to live a life of authenticity. They are determined to not work harder than required. 

Bitcoin can’t be stopped. We know this. Whether it’s a good investment or not depends on the Millennials, the next generation.

Your legacy will live on as one of the most brilliant and well respected. Much of your investment strategy seems timeless; namely to know as much as possible about what you are investing in. Bitcoin aside, you’ve taught me a lot and I’m sincerely grateful.",cryptocurrency

Company Stock $1.8k

Brokerage Account $1.1k (45% equities / 55% mutual funds)

Emergency Fund: $1k

personalfinance,Very stressed about retirement (40M). I think I am way behind.,"I am very stressed about where I am in my retirement savings and finances in general. Reading a whole alot about where I should be at this age, I get very discouraged. My wife does not help as she thinks everything is fine, but I am really going crazy sometimes with anxiety. Can you help me figure out where I stand? A summary of my case:

\- 40M. Married, 2 kids. I plan to retire around the age of 65\-70.

\- Goal: Bring in \~140K / year at retirement from 401. \(i.e., excluding social security and rental property\).

\- Annual salary \~$150\-160K. Wife does not work at this time. 

\- 401k: Current value of $290K. 70&amp;#37; 2045 target retirement funds, 20&amp;#37; bonds, 10&amp;#37; international stocks. I am of course taking all the employer contributions, plus maxing out my own contributions \(18K / year\).

\- Roth IRA: 11K. I just started this a month ago. So contributed for '17 and '18. 

\- Investment:  $85K in investments. 

\- Emergency funds: $35K in emergency funds.

\- Kids funds: $10K in liquid money. I contribute $100 each month to it. I will likely invest it somewhere, but have not decided yet.

\- Mortgage: We are 2.5 years into a 30 year, $300K mortgage. The interest rate is 3.625&amp;#37;. So the balance is close to $290K.

\- Second mortgage: We owe about $100K for a second property, which we are renting out. The rent covers the monthly mortgage payments plus brings in a little bit more. The mortgage will be paid off by 2027. 

\- No other debt. 

I can't get a good sense on where my 401K stands given my age and my annual salary. I feel like I am way way behind. The rental property I think is a good investment \(once it's paid off, it will turn into a steady income\), but I am not sure.

Can you let me know how my situation looks and what strategies you recommend for the future? I am not sure if we can save more other than contributing steadily to the investment accounts. 

Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,FSA medical account harassment,"I am getting emails threatening to cut me off from my own pre tax dollars if I fail to comply. The issue isn't that the FSA managers are questioning whether these are valid expenses - they just don't like the bills. The weird thing is, my wife uses the same doctors, clinics, rehabs, and her FSA folks NEVER have questioned a bill, never asked for more itemized bills, never refused to pay, and the format is exactly the same. She has never even been asked to upload a copy of a bill. I'm asked all the time. Often after uploading 3 or 4 different versions provided by doctors and insurance they leave me alone. Sometimes we have had to come up with a different expense that is roughly the same amount in order to get them off our backs and get access to our funds back.

Now, there are two bills from 2017 that they don't like, and they don't like the paper copies I scanned in and uploaded either.  When we get a bill in the mail, we go online and pay it using the FSA card.  In this case, the paper bills had one amount, but when we went online, the amount had changed, we paid what we owed.

 They asked for a copy, and we don't have a screen print , we only have the original paper bills. I have reached out to my insurance company a few days ago, but have not yet heard back. The FSA team has complained they have already ""reimbursed us"" - but we personally receive no money - they reimbursed my doctors. They make it sound as if they have put money in my pocket - and mind you, this is MY pre tax money I saved up. 

What I don't understand is it is obvious that the bills are for physical rehab or doctor visits , it's not that they are questioning why I bought groceries, or had cosmetic surgery, so why the harrassment?   Why is it the FSA team where my wife works NEVER questions the same bills from the same doctors?  When I hear people say the FSA card is a great convenience, it must be they work for a place with a sane FSA staff. But this is a federal program isn't it? - why the difference? 

I am tempted to just send them a check in order to get access to the rest of my funds - but I can't be the only one dealing with this bs. From now on, we will just pay using our personal credit card and then submit for reimbursement, because I have medical bills and my company is holding almost $1000 of my money hostage. 

Thank you to anyone who can explain what is going on.

EDIT - 
First, I want to clear up that I was not asking for reimbursement - we pay directly using the card, and then the FSA folks demand a receipt several months later. 

I called back the billing company - it seems in this one case, there were two bills, but when we paid online, they went on one single transaction. This upset the FSA folks who were not able to do the math.    The billing  company will be sending me a hard copy with two separate transactions  that add up to the one the FSA received which I will scan and upload to the FSA site.

I took the advice of several of you, and called HR - I actually reached a person -( HR has been outsourced as well, and it once took me, my manager, my manager's manager, and numerous empathetic employees weeks to find out who my HR rep is)   who listened in on the call with the FSA team while I asked for time to upload a new receipt and for them to clear the hold on my funds. 

This was granted,  so I will have funds to pay for my next doctor visits. The FSA team informed me I only have 5 more  transactions that require receipts. Sigh - mind you these are not sketchy pharmacy purchases - these are doctor bills.  I just don't have the energy to pursue them today.

Thanks for your advice and stories - I knew I wasn't alone in this. A whole industry has sprung up to bring misery into our lives.",finance

personalfinance,(INT'L) Looking into living off of high interest bank accounts in foreign currency. Any other similar options?,"It's somewhat difficult to describe what I'm looking for, but I'll do my best.  I have very little knowledge about finance, so please bear with me.

I have 210,000 USD in savings, with no debt.  Let's say that my goal is to be able to live for as long as possible without any additional income, solely with these savings.  Any additional income would go to increase these savings.

To achieve this, I'm looking at countries like Georgia (10% annual interest rate with an account in Georgian lari) or Mongolia (15+% annual interest rate with an account in Mongolian tugrik, with 5-6% if in USD).  Calculating based on exchange rate staying the same, this would give me 21 - 31.5K USD annual income, which is easily enough to live on reasonably comfortably in a lower cost country like Georgia or Mongolia.  I have a lot of experience living in lesser developed countries, and it's not a big problem for me.

There are of course many other countries with high interest rates, but I've been to both Georgia and Mongolia, so I'm more familiar with them.  I don't really know the situation regarding exchange rates, inflation, and so on in other countries with higher interest rates.

Anyway, the banks in these countries pay the interest into another account each month, so theoretically I'd just pull it out like a monthly paycheck, and live off of it.

My question is, is there some reason that this is a horrible idea that I'm just not realizing, apart from exchange rates and inflation?  Also, are there other options?  Something along the lines of putting a large amount of money somewhere in exchange for monthly payments, apart from a normal interest-bearing account?

The goal here is to relieve the stress of needing to work to stay alive.  I want to be able to work when I feel like I have the right opportunities, but knowing that I can live a normal enough life even if I'm out of work.

Thanks for any advice.  Sorry if this is a bit of an odd question!  Any ideas are much appreciated.

EDIT: Since a lot of the responses are US centric, I should add that I don't live in the US.  I do have US citizenship as a birthright, but I don't plan to return to the US.  I haven't ever needed to pay US taxes.  I currently live in a country with an abysmal interest rate and a middle-to-high cost of living, but would likely be moving to whatever country I keep my savings in.",finance

personalfinance,How to Increase MY Credit Score? (I feel like I have done everything I'm suppose to and I'm still in the low 700s). Please help!,"My current credit score is in the low low 700s and my report says that's a ""C"". I don't understand why though. I'm 28, and I've had credit cards for 10 years. I originally had one credit card that gave me no cash back for like 6 years and I only didn't pay it off in full once in 6 years (simply forgot, I was in college and probably drunk), and by ""not paying it off in full"" I mean I missed the payment date by like two days and then paid it off in full. 

About 4 years ago I got a cash back card and have never not paid it off in full. After getting the cash back one, I never used my original one, so I never really checked its balance because it was presumably $0. However, I checked one day, and I accidentally forgot that it was linked to my Xbox Live account and there was about a two month period where the Xbox live charge was just collecting interest. So I paid it off and cancel the card out of fear of it being linked to other accounts that I forgot about (maybe not the best idea).

About a year ago I got one of the Amazon credit cards and again have never not paid it off in full. Then about two months ago got another cash back card so I can have options when making purchases and can capitalize on the cash back. Again, I have never not paid it off in full.

I recently refinanced about 55k in student loan debt, and have another 25k that I choose not to refinance because the interest rates were better than what the refinancing company was offering. So I have about 80k in student loan debt and in the first couple months I have knocked out one of the smaller loans that I didn't refinance (about $3,500) and have paid about $2,000 towards the rest of it (I got my PhD so I just now have a job where I can start paying them back, and I'm doing it as aggressively as possible).

So all in all, I feel like I have been very good about paying my credit cards off on time, and not opening too many. The only reasons I can think that my score is lower than I liked is...

1. I cancel a credit card... four years ago!
2. Missed one payment!?!
3. Recently open a couple of new cards, but based on the flow chart my credit actually improved after that (used to be in the high 600s)
4. The student loan debt? Does that affect it? I was in school the entire time, so I didn't think not paying the loans back would hurt my credit.
5. Using too much of my available credit? For a long time I only had my first cash back card and it only had a $3,500 limit, and I would frequently use $1,000-$2,000 of it, BUT I'd always pay it off in full. Is that it though? Using too much of my available credit? Between my three cards now, I have approximately $17,000 available so maybe that will help as long as I keep the utilization low, which I expect I will.

Any other reasons I missing? I'm just confused by the whole thing, and I'm looking to buy a new car in the near future. Hopefully, I'll have enough saved to pay in cash, but just in case, I want my credit score to be as high as possible for financing purposes. Any input is much appreciated!

personalfinance,My parents completely screwed up and they have a tough decision to make regarding their mortgage and retirement account. Please let us know your thoughts and advice! Thanks,"Just a quick intro, my mom is 61 and my dad is 63.  Dad recently got laid off and is not able to work anymore because of medical reasons.  He will be receiving disability income starting this November ($2,500 a month income).  My mom still has her job with benefits and makes about $3,500 net a month. 

**Assets**: 
30k in checking account
318k in IRA


**The big problem**:  They have a massive mortgage (they fell victim to cashing out at the worst time and consolidating CC debt into home loan).  The first mortgage is 30 year fixed with a 600k balance at a good interest rate.  The second loan was a 10 year interest only and now they are in the 11th year so the payment is a balloon payment (Good chunk of principal and some interest), but they monthly payment is $1700 a month on a 150k balance!

**Mortgage Liability**
First mortgage payment: $3,100 fixed
Second mortgage payment: $1,700 adjustable (But it is a balloon payment since the 10 year interest only period is over now)

So the current mortgage payment is $4,800, however, it is important to note that they own a backhouse which they receive $1,750 of rental income, which essentially makes their mortgage payment $3,050.  


*Important Disclaimer* - They can't and do not want to sell the house and move somewhere else.  I know that might be the first thought, but please assume that this is not a possibility. 


**The big question** - Should they refinance into a horrible loan which has a manageable monthly payment or pay off the second loan overtime or maybe with one lump sum payment from IRA account.


* Here are the details of the refinance option - Consolidate the first and second loan into one loan at 5.7% 40 year INTEREST ONLY - Monthly payment would be $3,600.  Now here is another problem with this loan, the closing costs are 20k which are just ORIGINATION FEES and they would also have to pay 20k off the principal balance of the loan in order to hit 80% loan to value ratio.  

OR


* Pay off the second loan over time or all at once (because it is an adjustable loan and who knows how high the payment can go).  This option would leave them only with their first mortgage payment MINUS the rental income which effectively leaves them with a net mortgage payment of $1,400 a month.  Obviously, the downside is that they would burn almost half of their IRA funds to pay off the second loan, but then they would have a very manageable mortgage payment after that. 

So, what would you do in this situation.  I know it is easy to say they were very irresponsible and they just have to deal with their mistakes, but we are really looking for the best course of action given the circumstances.  Thank you for your time.",finance

I save $975 a month of my take home pay at a minimum (usually more as I don't end up spending the rest of my money). 

Given this, I'm not sure whether I should finance a car or pay in cash. I'm looking to buy a car around the $10-15k range so I know if I needed to, I can pay for the whole thing in cash. 

However, I'm young and don't have much credit. I graduated college debt-free so the only thing on my credit history are two credit cards. My score is decent (mid-to-high 600s), though. Given this,

- should I get an auto loan to help build credit? I was thinking perhaps I can put in $9k as a down payment and get a loan for an additional $5-6k if needed. I figure I can dip into my savings to aggressively pay back to the loan every month to limit the term to 12-24 months so that I'm not paying a ton of interest.

- if I should get a loan, where can I get the best interest rate?

personalfinance,Credit card debt advice,"Hey everyone,

I have a bit of a situation related to credit card debt and I need some advice on how to best deal with it. In the 5 years I've had credit cards I've always paid the bill on time and in full until recently. I've been unemployed for about 6 months and have racked up about $1700 on my main card, which is about 60% utilization. This has dropped my score from a 755 to a 723 and I'm worried it'll drop more. I start a new job  next week and will be able to pay off the bill in 2-3 months. I've thought of a couple ways to do this but am unsure which would be best. 

1. Pay off the main credit card as I can and take the credit score hit until it's paid off, which wouldn't be more than 3 months 
2. Do a zero-interest balance transfer, however Creditwise told me this would lower my score an additional 30 points
3. Take out a cash advance to pay off my main card with my secondary card I never use that has a $6000 limit, however this card has a 31% interest rate

I need to keep my credit relatively stable and as high as possible because I'll be signing a new apartment lease in the next month or two and don't have an available cosigner. 

What option would be the best way to pay off the debt?

personalfinance,I think it’s better to save and invest money than it is to pay down debt. Seems to be a contrary opinion on this sub but it’s worked out well for me.,"Back in 2013, my net worth was $62,000, my annual salary was around $50,000/year, and I had student loan debt of $130,000.

Now, my net worth is $190,000 (stocks + IRA), my annual salary is $200,000/year, and my student loans are at $100,000.

I paid off some debt along the way, a few extra payments here and there, but for the most part I tried to invest as much as I could and I only paid the minimum on my student loans which was still about $800/month. 

I think this is a better situation than paying all of that debt because now I have a much larger net worth that will continue to grow and make more money, and I have enough money saved for a down payment on a house. Or, if I lose my job, I have a safety net that could last about 4 years (if I couldn’t find a job for a long time). Eventually I may start to pay off bigger chunks of the loan but for now I think my strategy has worked well and I don’t see a reason to worry about paying it off.

I received a $14k merit scholarship for the first year, and my parents are willing to pay $40k of my tuition (what I had left over for savings that I did not spend in undergrad bc I went to community college). This makes the total loan amount after the scholarship and gift $ about $76k. I also have about $10k in personal savings, and will also not be paying rent (my fiance owns our house). 

I can get about $10k in unsubsidized federal direct loans per semester (totaling $50k) at 6% interest, and then will have to get Grad Plus loans (7%). 

Some ideas I have for using the $40k:

1) Use it to pay off interest while I'm in school, but I would have to take out more Grad Plus loans, and use the rest for tuition.

2) Use all of it to pay tuition in the first year, also avoiding taking out Grad Plus loans in the first year, so there is less time that interest is accruing.

3) Divide the $ up between all semesters.

After a couple months of phone calls I finally got it corrected, and the bill I received in November showed all the charges removed except one and a late fee. I didn't get anymore bills after that so I thought the last one was removed. Apparently, because I wasn't making payments during the time I was calling to get the issue corrected, after the last bill it had been 3 months since I made a payment. According to the payment center, it is regular practice for the VA to stop sending you bills if they don't receive a payment for 3 months. This doesn't mean they stop adding late fees or interest charges and this doesn't mean they won't eventually add a 30% collection fee to it and send it to collections, where it will sit until they deduct it from your tax refund. 

Really just looking for some opinions on this billing practice. I'm already disputing the charges and hopefully getting them removed.

personalfinance,Need help understanding pretax expenses and the actual benefit to your paycheck.,"I'm in a position where I can lease a vehicle through my employer/company and pay for as a pretax deduction/expense. I was just trying to do the numbers and I want to make sure I really understand the total benefit of this option. For simplicity sake, let's assume Federal taxes of 30%, state taxes of 10%, social security of 5% and Medicare of 2.5%. 

If this is the case, would I effectively be getting a discount of 47.5% on the lease price? To illustrate my point, let's assume I take home $10,000/mo and my vehicle costs $500/mo to lease.

If I paid with pretax dollars, my taxable monthly income would be $9500. So I'd pay $2850 to Fed,  $950 to state, $475 to social, and $237 to Medicare. With a total take home of $4987.

If I paid the same lease with post tax dollars, I'd be taxed on all $10,000, and pay $3,000 to Fed, $1000 to state, $500 to social, and $250 to Medicare, for a total take home of $4750 after the lease expense.

The difference, $4987-$4750=$237, which is exactly 47.5% of the lease price.  Am I missing anything? Is there any benefit to not taking this benefit and paying with post tax dollars? All the scenarios I think of seem to come to the conclusion that this is a good deal and I should take advantage, as I am effectively paying half price for my lease.

Granted, it is a lease and that's a whole other topic on if it's a good investment. If someone knows more details around this or if I'm totally missing the picture here please let me know.

I have a three\-month review approaching next week and thought that would be a good time to ask about a relocation bonus. Something along the lines of ""Now that i am settled and working for  \(random company name here\) is a good fit would there be any way you could help me with some of my relocation expenses i shouldered when i moved?"" or would this reflect poorly on me as a new hire? They did mention during the interview process that they might be able to find some relocation money in the budget, but i had so many other things to juggle i did not follow up as i should have. 

I also have some interest in opening up an account with TD Ameritrade; i wasn't thinking anything serious, maybe a few hundred dollars to start will 5\-6 hundred just to get my feet wet and better familiarize myself with the financial world. i have always had an interest in day trading. i am acutely aware of how difficult it is and how it only works for the 1&amp;#37;, so I was planning on starting out with paper trading, would opening such an account be harmful to my credit score or with me seeking loan consolidation soon?

personalfinance,Job searching and choosing a place to live for soon-to-be newlyweds [Advice Needed],"Hi everyone, I was wondering if I could get your advice for my fiance and I's future plans. We are trying to decide between staying in our home state NJ or moving to NC. We are also both graduating from school programs, me School Counseling MA, and him, Nursing RN, in the next 2 weeks. We loooove NC and our dream is to move there but we also want to pay off his loans within 2-3 years (~$130k, mostly private) and work on mine ($45k, federal). 

My FH was just offered a job in NC for $44k/year + very good benefits and $25k tuition reimbursement. If I were to find a job in NC (haven't heard anything back but market seems great), I would make ~$39k. We would be able to rent a 2 bedroom apartment for $900-1000. Obvious lower COL there.

We also have both had good interviews in NJ but no offers. If he works in NJ, he'd probably make ~$60k. He could also commute to NY and make $82k. I could make ~$60k. Rent would be $1600-1900 (need a two-bedroom [we'll be newlyweds and living together for the first time, we're trying to be happy here lol] and cat-friendly space. NJ is a little to hard to come by with apartments). Higher COL here.

I also have a ~$30k inheritance that I am saving for a house down payment. We've *thought* about buying a ~$180k condo if monthly mortgage is lower than rent.

Another note: we will both needs job by August because we have a free place to live for the summer so we do have time to job hunt.

Ok, hopefully this is enough info... Please let me know what you think. Should we move to NC or stay in NJ? We're having a hard time making an objective decision.",finance

Bitcoin,Common misconceptions and other random thoughts and observations from an investment professional,"Hey community, wanted to share some random thoughts on this exciting time we live in. Unprecedented tear in XBTUSD finally dialing down which is usually a good time for more reflective thought and discussion (vs when things are moving vertically either direction and everyone is freaking out).

--disclaimer and background--

I am not really a frequent Reddit user so bear with me if I'm getting some things wrong here. Not too keen on giving away much personal detail for obvious reasons, so I do not have a compelling way to convince you to believe that I'm not an imposter (and this is healthy - it is generally a good idea to be extremely skeptical of anything anyone says to you when it relates to investing). Anyway, I work at a large size investment firm directly in the capacity of investment strategy and analysis, and I wanted to share some views from the other side. Note that the street is generally a very diverse community with countless differing perspectives, so I should clarify that this is only one perspective from an industry that is literally hinged on trying to make money by having a unique perspective.

Going to go ahead and say that I am not licensed in any way shape or form to actually provide direct financial or wealth management advice to individuals (ironic isn't it?) so please only use anything in this thread as a reference point and nothing more. You can roll your eyes, but the main reason I'm here is because I personally have a serious issue when people provide financial advice/analysis (no matter how good, thoughtful, or experienced they may be) that others then take directly to drive personal decisions without fully understanding how much they could get hurt. For all intents and purposes please just consider everything I say to just be purely an opinion.

----

Anyway somber bullshit aside, let's jump into it. No particular order - just random thoughts as they come up.

**Status quo investment community views on Bitcoin**? Generally Bitcoin is disregarded and not taken seriously. It's just too small. The entire market cap of this asset class is maybe a few hundred billion, and the largest shops literally have trillions in assets to deploy, so any one of them could literally just buy into all of it and it would barely even take up much of their overall portfolio of holdings - and if you think about it, buying up an entire crypto is kinda nonsensical... imagine someone just bought all the gold in the world so that nobody could ever use or trade it and just left it in a vault...

Honestly, very few people pay extensive attention to Bitcoin and even fewer are intimidated that it will structurally overhaul society. If anything, there's probably lots of hope for Bitcoin to get bigger so that institutional money can actually get into it. Smaller shops are more nimble and have smaller capital bases that they can deploy into less competitive markets (e.g. small caps, niche, etc.) where you can beat out retail investors that invest part time a lot easier than the trillions floating around managed by overcompetitive professionals.

Note: To clarify, not taken seriously for institutional investment. Lots of guys buy/bet on random stuff with their personal accounts - sports, cryptos, and there's always some numpty that likes to buy scratch cards just because.

**Fed and Wall St collusion?** Seems to be a lot of sentiment that financial regulators, central banks, etc. exist to serve and collude the financial industry. Couldn't be further from the truth - the regulators are mainly what stands between highly sophisticated professionals from preying on literally everyone else. Literally the exact same way as FDA watching our backs from chemists/pharmaceutical companies and any other field where the average person simply cannot hope to fully understand the inner workings of that industry (If there was no FDA, I as a plebian non-doctor non-chemist non-pharmacist would be terrified). As retail investors, you want to as much power in the hands of regulators as possible, and I can say the disassembly of regulation would be a dream come true for Wall St. - I won't get into why. And look there's always going to be cases of conflict of interest/corruption/misaligned interests, but broadly speaking these govt institutions are in place to represent interests of the common folk, and not the real life Bobby Axelrods of the world (yes Billions is a guilty pleasure of mine, and no it is not a great depiction of how it actually works)**

**Recession/TARP/corruption?** General consensus across the board is that TARP needed to happen, because a complete confidence collapse causes irreversible structural damage that would devastate a lot of people, but especially the average Joe. Sure, Mr. Hedge Fund had the most (objectively) to lose, but he is still going to have his Ferrari no matter how bad the system collapses, but the regular guy working his 9-5 doesn't have a cash stack to fall onto. Govt still has some loans that have not been paid off, but net net they came ahead something like $50B profit just a few years after they deployed capital. Again let me reiterate there was actually a lot of opposition on this side of the circus at the time as well - a lot of institutions were forced to take capital injections for a herd-immunity-like mechanic because if only select institutions took funding it would be identified as the next Lehman ready to die and the market would devour it. Imagine being the guy running a perfectly healthy business and never taking the reckless positions that your peers did and having to take a billion dollars in debt (and significant interest expenses) just because your colleagues were doing stupid things and you are literally obligated to take it.

**Bitcoin/cryptos to replace fiat? Down with the old corrupt system?** Maybe potentially in some other shape or form (so many technical flaws with Bitcoin - even lightning and other incremental mods feel like bandaid workarounds and if a crypto were to become primary means of exchange I would be surprised if it is just good old Bitcoin), but you will never escape govt regulation. Silk road was a good example - if the govt has any reason to believe there is unregulated/criminal transactions they will assemble full force teams and RICO everything you have ever touched so fast that your head will spin. Remember that CIA/FBI/police/etc. are all agencies that generally are put into place and designed by the public. We elect sheriffs the same way we self-patrol fraudulent behavior on Reddit and ultimately the need to monitor and regulate currency is driven by something the people want. Again there's always going to be controversies and scandals like NSA revelations and whatnot, but the reason these enforcement agencies exist is because the idea of living in a world where someone could threaten to hurt your family and demand a Bitcoin ransom or pay some hitman to pick off your loved ones until you wire them your life savings is horrifying. Ultimately it is we, us, whether on Wall St. or Main St. that want regulation and protection, and as individuals I think that we will demand that X oversight or regulation infrastructure is put in place to ensure that. There is ALWAYS analogue gap, and it can be as simple as making it hugely illegal to not provide crypto transaction data voluntarily to the govt in the same way being caught literally just possessing a gun with a shaved-off serial number will get you in serious trouble. It comes down to what kind of world we collectively want to live in, and I think that regulation is inevitable because it is something we all align.**

**Bitcoin is a good long-term investment?** I have no idea. I have been following BTC since ~2013 and it still doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Maybe because even gold doesn't make sense to me. But generally as a non-value-producing asset class (i.e. it literally doesn't grow itself as an entity the way a share of a company does), it can't be that much more different than gold, which I generally perceive as more of a store of value that mainly gets interest during a panic where money is looking for a flight to safety. At this point BTC is driven far more by market sentiment and random govt decisions, which makes it barely discernible from a coin toss.**

**Bitcoin/crypto more fair? No corrupt hedgies preying on people?** No I think it's actually a lot worse. Look at the spreads that exchanges charge on it - they are horrifyingly large. There's probably a handful of people that collect spreads on this entire industry and they are making a stupid amount of money. I have also anecdotal evidence that there is very sophisticated capital that is arbing the market because it is simultaneously so liquid and held widely by retail investors, although the lack of market size means they are, say, tripling a few million every day rather than making 50% returns on billions every week. And sorry, but technical analysis is absolute garbage and empirically worse than just blind guessing - lots of university papers written here. Advanced machines and algos trade literally every market and they can do infinitely more rigorous and intense calculations on technical factors than any human being could even hope to achieve. False prophets at every turn with technicals, and truth is you will always lose against the team of MIT/Caltech flash boys that are writing equations on glass walls to outmaneuver you in these markets.

Most importantly my bet is that whoever who runs these exchanges is probably frontrunning the market on top of their massive fees. Revelations like government officials trading cryptos ahead of announcing policy that they literally made can cost certain individuals their jobs, but the reality is that the market is so totally unregulated and it's unclear who has access to what data and since it is not illegal to manipulate XBTUSD in all the ways that it is illegal for real markets, I would go ahead and say that even if I tried my hand to crack the Bitcoin market, I am going to lose (BADLY) to a dedicated team running strategies professionally, and any other players that have a fix on the market.

Asymmetry and unregulated markets disadvantage the retail investor far more than they disadvantage most sophisticated capital. This only gets masked if you have something that increased 9000000% because everyone is ""making"" money.

**How to get better at investing?**

Read everything. Learn everything. Criticize and be skeptical of everything. This industry is a winner-take-all environment, and everyone is fighting to get that incremental edge. Assume that anyone that volunteers information has an ulterior motive, because they do. If someone is in the middle of panic-selling their holdings, do you think they'll say ""you should sell too"" to strangers so that they can be crowded out of their liquidation? Be wary of advice or analysis from ANYONE because they have nothing to gain from helping you, but lots to gain by misleading you. Beyond that, some people are just idiots and their intentions aren't malevolent, but they're useless and will feed you irrelevant information.

If you're doing this right you should be actively scanning this text and trying to figure out why I am writing what I am - what kind of trick could I be trying to pull to manipulate strangers into something that garners me personal gain? There's so many layers, you need to discern and always be watching for people that are obviously trying to manipulate you. You shouldn't trust me one bit. I have absolutely nothing to gain from sharing my ""advice."" Apply this to everything you hear and read (including your ""friends""), then go read literally everything that has been written. Then you will start to see the matrix and truly understand how the market looks.

**Do you believe in Bitcoin?**

Blockchain tech will revolutionize the world. 100%. Already seeing it manifest in certain ways in other industries. I don't know about cryptos. I definitely don't like XBTUSD as a trade. There's a very snotty saying on the street but it rings true time and time again: the moment you hear janitors, truck drivers and your grandma talking about an investment, it's time to get the fuck out of it. Or, alternatively, the moment you see an investment idea on TV or on the news or on any major public platform (cough), this is your time to sell. And it's true - unsophisticated investors are your ride to lock in gains while selling out, and the moment the masses realize there are no more gains left to be had the bottom drops out and it collapses. I know this community hates references to BTC as a bubble, but it has had so much similarity to other similar cases as well as media attention/mainstream coverage profile as other instances. It feels like a pennystock to me, and while there's riches to be made, it's not where I would want to really try and bet on seriously.

However, you cannot deny that BTC is somewhat sticky. There's something cool there that makes it more than just an ""idea"" from a random pennystock pump, and it's definitely something cool to hold a bit on if you want to support the general idea. For real, actually attractive risk-adjusted returns, I would look elsewhere (honestly with the investment sizes most people would be better off trading things around on Craigslist or something)

**BING. Could this whole thread be written by someone from Craigslist trying to boost traffic?** The moment I wrote that your alarm bells should be ringing. Again, read everything but trust no one. Why the fuck did this guy say ""you could probably make more money on _ than BTC?"" Stay vigilant. The world isn't evil and out to get you, but everyone does something for a reason. (In my case I just vomited on the page and noticed it sounded funny/odd. I have no idea of Craigslist is a profitable side-hobby... personally I would be afraid of getting stabbed.)

Those are all my random thoughts for now. If you have any questions feel free to ask. Please post on the thread as I have a strong belief in open dialogue and discussions and would like to share any responses broadly. It's an exciting time we live in, so have fun, but please make sure you design your playbook responsibly and invest with discipline.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Looking for some perspective between two paths - home buying,"Hi all!  I don't know if I will get this opportunity again in life - so I know my answer already on which path to take...but figured I bounce this off a few more brains besides family and friends for some additional perspective.


Also, this may turn out to be a dumb post just rambling - so I apologize for wasting your time in advance.  :)


I'm selling my current home (due to the need to be closer to elderly parents for care) and am looking to move and purchase a new one.  I have two homes that I like with two different thought processes...one is around 540k (probably will spend the rest of my life here) and the other is 290k (townhome - not really the home of dreams...but good enough).


I will get just enough out of my current home to put a 20% down for a 540k home.  The monthly payments including tax/insurance will be about $3100/month.  I have the ability of increasing my down payment to 30% and reduce that monthly payment to $2800/month.


On the other hand, I can choose to live in this townhome (290k one) for $1900/month (including tax/insurance/hoa).  Plan here is to live for 5 years (save up if we can) and then get another home (like 540k one) and put this one (290k) up for rent converting it into some side income.  I'm not sure if this plan will work out honestly.


Regarding finances, I will be breaking even on my net income (after 15% into 401k and 10% into savings) along with all the household expenses.  


With 290k home, I will net a savings of an additional $1075/month.  This leads me to think maybe get a 15-yr mortgage and pay off the home in next 15 years instead.


I'm newly married (single income) and we are thinking of having a baby in the next year or so.   That's another expense I haven't budgeted for here - but our friendly sidebar has given me some good info.


My concern is that I'm not sure if the interest rates will be in my favor in the next 5 years to afford a nice home like 540k one.  Or maybe these things won't matter and we will just make do with a 290k one until kids are in college.

My detailed monthly expenses below (this is in NJ by the way)...

Net Income (after 15% 401k, 10% of gross savings) - 5400

Mortgage - 0 (deciding)

Car Loan - 0 (paid off car)

Gas/Electric - 350

Water - 75

Cable/Internet - 110

Wireless - 200

Tolls - 60

Gas - 100

Car Insurance - 150

Netflix / Home Entertainment - $50

Phone - 110

Gym - 25

Food/Grocery/Misc - 800

Clothing - 0 (haven't budgeted it out yet - but thinking $200)

Restaurants/Gifts - 0 (haven't budgeted it out yet - but thinking $200)

Entertainment - 0 (haven't budgeted it out yet - but thinking $100)


Also, I already have 6 months emergency fund saved up separately for both scenarios above along with all the expenses.  That will not be touched with this move.


So going with a 540k home, I will have a really nice residence - but will be living a little tight on budget.  Might have to scrounge into the 10% savings pool to get an additional $550/month out to be more comfortable here.

personalfinance,Am I crazy to max out my retirement contribution at my age and salary?,"23/F/$54k-ish a year gross.

Expenses: I live at home and have health insurance through my dad for another 3 years. $221 a month minimum for student loans ($3,100 private, $14,000 federal). Likely soon to be car payments of no more than $220 a month, but still on the fence. Car insurance at $104 a month, broken into 3 payments (no monthly payments in my state). I'll be helping out wherever I can in terms of groceries and bills, as my mom is divorced and could use the help. I also plan on doubling or even tripling my student loan payments to pay them off faster and lower the total interest payments. 

I also make some money babysitting but I don't factor it into my basic budget because it's not as steady. I see that money as ""treat"" money or spending money, not money I should depend on to pay bills. With all this in mind:

My company is a nonprofit and uses the 401a and 403b retirement plans, and I plan on supplementing with the 403b. Both plans are sent to one or more Vanguard funds of my choosing. The company contributes 5% into the 401a without contributions from me. So no matter what, at least as I understand it, they will give me a 5% match of my salary toward my 401a, without my contributing at all. This enrollment is mandatory. 

I start next week so I'm filling out all the paperwork now. $18,500 for the 403b is about a third of my gross salary, which is a huge chunk. However, I don't have many expenses, and after being unemployed for a year am keen to to really plan for the long term as best I can, even if I won't see that money for another 40-50 years. Obviously I'd love the larger paycheck now, but if I had it I have a feeling I'd only put half of it towards my loans rather than all of it, which in my mind is irresponsible. I also think that I should get used to seeing this money disappear from my paycheck while I'm young, so that I don't miss it as much once I start moving up in my career and get higher salaries (hopefully). 

Or am I just absolutely crazy? 

Edit to add: I live in Boston, renting here is pretty much throwing money away. I have a medium-term goal of saving up for a down payment, obviously I'd like to do it sooner rather than later so I can move out without spending money on rent. I'm 99% sure I want to stay in Boston, even if I don't property values here rise like crazy so as long as I have renters to pay the mortgage, I'll have equity.
As for the car, I'm selling mine for ~$6.5k and using every penny of that to put down on a newer one. I'm hoping to keep the loan on that under $12K, and my credit score fluctuates between 745-760 depending on the day so I qualify for a low if not no APR!",finance

The other day I had an epiphany. I haven’t actually looked into my credit cards… ever. I’ve still got the same credit cards I’ve had since college – which give a couple of hundred bucks in cash back every year, but nothing more. I looked on some sites like Credit Karma and Nerd Wallet, and have been tuned into this sub… but I haven’t seen any recommendations that have jumped out at me.

I’m wondering if anyone can recommend a credit card to me that I should look into.

So far, I’m considering the Delta card, the Amazon card, and Discover Cashback Match.

I travel for work 1-2 times a month (my employer’s system pays for the air fare) – but I can put the hotel, rental car, and everything else on my personal card if I want. My employer’s preferred airline is Delta.

I don’t really like traveling for fun, but my wife and I do end up traveling somewhere domestically (US) 1-2 times a year for vacation.

My wife and I are foodies – and of the money we put on a credit card each month, around $2k-$3k of that is food, and about $1k on Amazon. The rest is on mall trips, gas, home improvement/tools, and groceries.

Does anyone have any recommendations for cards, or feedback on the cards I’m interested in?",finance
personalfinance,Navy Federal Personal Loan: Credit freeze lift causing delays?,"I'm reaching out to reddit personal finance due to a concern about a pending approval of a personal loan my significant other had applied for with Navy Federal earlier yesterday. To catch you all up to speed, he applied for a personal loan of $4000 at our local Navy Federal Branch. After the application for the loan was submitted, he was instructed to await a text confirmation of approval regarding the loan within a few hours. Sadly, as time went on, he hadn't received the text confirmation approving or even denying the loan. I'm worried there may have been a snag in the process.

The only thing that comes to mind regarding this circumstance delaying his chances for approval was that we had previously placed a credit freeze on his credit after getting word of the Equifax breach last year. With that in mind, he took the initiative to submit a temporary credit freeze lift with all three major credit bureaus long in advance as to avoid any hiccups down the line before heading out to Navy Federal.

Sadly, Equifax has been the only one giving him issues for attempting to *temporarily* lift the freeze. While on the phone, they proceeded to put him through numerous transfers for ""further verification"" just so he could confirm if the freeze had been lifted for the dates he specified. My significant other got increasingly frustrated and then decided to **permanently** lift the freeze instead since Equifax isn't currently charging a fee at this time. The representative told him to wait 15min for the permanent freeze lift to be applied to his credit, then to call back later to confirm. He contacted Equifax promptly to confirm if the permanent freeze lift had been applied accordingly. To our relief, Equifax stated that there is no longer a freeze on his credit.

Once that was taken care of, he applied for the same loan amount with Navy Federal again over the phone and is currently awaiting the approval. The representative stated it would be roughly 24hrs until they approve or deny the loan request. I'm still worried that he may be denied the loan and we'll be left baffled as to why. We've taken extra measures going as far as checking his credit report while thoroughly scanning for any suspicious activity. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary assuring his credit hadn't been affected overall.

So what could be the issue? Did he apply for the loan too soon,still not giving Equifax enough time to process the freeze lift on their end the second time around? Does he truly have bad credit and we're simply unaware of it?

I apologize sincerely for the long frantically impatient sounding post. This is really beginning to stress us out as we're anxiously hoping to get approved for this loan as soon as possible to help with our current financial situation and to prepare for any inevitable hurdles we may face in the near future.

I'm really excited, but a little nervous about starting what's going a pretty grueling experience on top of settling into a very new city. Moving with my boyfriend, who has been out of school for a couple of years.

So for a general idea of the numbers part: 

* I'm about to graduate with ~$30,000 of federal loans. This is my only debt. About $8,000 are unsubsidized. 

* My stipend is $32,000 before tax, my healthcare is provided, and I'll get a $5,000 fellowship when I move out there. 

 * Super awesome, but also a very high CoL area (planning for $2,000-2,500 for rent). 

* Fortunately, living with my boyfriend will make costs manageable. He could make somewhere close to $100,000 potentially, but a conservative guess would be $60,000. We've agreed not to split costs 50/50 and let him pick up slightly more, but we're waiting to decide exactly how to go about it until further in the job/apartment/etc search when we'll have a better idea of those numbers. Probably somewhere in between 50/50 and splitting by % income though.

* My program will take ~5 years, after which I will take a 2 year position at ~$50,000, and then be more or less guaranteed a stable $150,000-200,000+ salaried job. The ~7 year investment period could potentially be dragged out another year or two depending on the exact path I take.

So basically, I know that I'll survive whatever happens, but how do I thrive? What should I prioritize?

* As far as I can tell, there's no point in worrying about retirement savings while I have student loan debt-- right? I'm pretty sure there's no 401k matching or anything. 

* Of course, emergency fund is important. This is something that I want to establish, but doesn't feel overly pressing as I know that my parents and my boyfriend would both be willing and able to help me in an emergency. I will have probably 1 month saved, and build the rest without being too aggressive. (Feel free to convince me that I'm stupid?)

Now for the important part! The loans... I feel like it makes sense to not stress over the subsidized loans until I graduate. I will be struggling enough on &lt;$30,000 take-home pay, and when I have to start paying them with my $50,000 salary I will likely be in a lower CoL area as well. But how seriously should I take the unsubsidized ones? There is one from each year of undergrad of a bit over $2,000 with interest rates of 4.45, 3.76, 4.29, and 4.66. Same rates on the heftier subsidized loans as well, if it matters. How aggressively should I try to pay these off? How do I decide how much to put toward them (besides a vague ""as much as possible"")? This will (obviously) factor into our budget convo, but as we'll likely be living pretty close to my means, to some degree I feel like what I put towards loans is coming from his retirement savings... Yes, I know this is why it's tricky mixing finances before marriage, and that's definitely in the picture, but we don't want to rush into anything.

Does the fact that I have a decent earning potential factor in here? I know I'll be stressed enough in grad school, so I'd like to keep the financial stress to minimum. The ""enjoy life!"" part of me is feeling like if I'm stuck in a low paying, high CoL situation for the next five years, and I know I'll have way more disposable income after, what's the point of worrying now? But the rest of me knows that debt accruing interest shouldn't be ignored...

I know this is a bit long and rambly, it's late and I've been thinking about moving related things all night... Hopefully it makes sense. Thank you for any help/ advice!",finance

personalfinance,"Renting, buying, or none of the above? (NL)","Hey /r/personalfinance,

First things first, I'm not American, so I'll try to add in some relevant information concerning the differences in my country. If you have any further questions regarding things you think are relevant (or if my english is unclear anywhere), please let me know.

I'm 28 years old and currently still living with my parents. I didn't have the financial means to move out during my studies (I did work a lot, but the money went to paying for my studies + paying rent to my parents), but am now employed and looking to move out in the near future. I'm having a bit of trouble deciding what would be the best choice for me, though.

&gt;Here's my current financial situation:
&gt;
&gt; Income:
&gt;
&gt;* Monthly income: €2,850 monthly before taxes, ~€2,050 after taxes and lease car payment
&gt;* Yearly income before taxes: €37,100
&gt;
&gt;Debt:
&gt;
&gt;* Student loans: ~€18,000 at a 0% interest rate that's reevaluated every 5 years. Not currently making payments yet, and will not have to start for another 6 years.
&gt;
&gt;Monthly expenses:
&gt;
&gt;* No rent (parents found out how much I'd been paying during my studies and decided to suspend this for now) 
&gt;* Health insurance: ~€110
&gt;* Phone subscription: ~€10
&gt;* Various other expenses (clothing, food, software packages I need, fun): ~€300
&gt;
&gt;Savings:
&gt;
&gt;* ~€1,300 small emergency / spending account
&gt;* ~€17,000 in savings across various accounts that I can access within about a day
&gt;* Saving ~1600 monthly
&gt;* Retirement funds and such are arranged through my employer

I'm in a field that's currently in high demand, so I'm expecting my income to grow significantly over the next few years. I'll get a fixed contract within the next 10 months and have this on paper - banks highly value this piece of paper when deciding the max mortgage.

Either way, I'm looking for a place to live. In the Netherlands you basically have the following options:

* Social renting. At least 80% of available places must go to people with a yearly income under €37k, which means it's nearly impossible to get one above 37k. This unfortunately means it's not an option for me.
* Private renting. Average rent for a reasonably sized place in my area is ~€900 - €1,200 monthly.
* Buying. Prices vary between ~140k - ~220k depending on neighborhood and state of the property. Monthly mortgage payments for a mortgage of €150k would be around €580. The bank has currently approved me for a max mortgage of €168,500. The market is quite high-strung right now, and prices are expected to keep rising explosively this year.

Some context with regards to buying: You can get a mortgage for the full amount of the property, and this is not unusual for first time buyers. You do however have to pay taxes / transaction fees out of pocket, which usually amounts to between 6 and 12% of the full amount of the property.

Given the fact that buying is financially the more attractive option, even if you calculate in costs for repairs and such, I've been looking at property. I came across one I find really attractive (not the best neighborhood, but close to a central highway (so even if I switch jobs commute will most likely still be acceptable for most places), close to the train station, by the edge of a forest and plenty of facilities nearby) for the price of €124,500. 

Yes, this is a stupidly low price for this part of the country and the size and state of the place, but it has a reason - the apartment is on privately owned land, which means that there's a monthly ""ground rent"" of €155 a month. In addition, there's a home owners association fee of €180 monthly, but this includes heating costs, a number of insurances and municipal taxes.

If I were to buy this apartment, that would mean my monthly costs are about 800 for mortgage payments and heating, leaving me around 1,200 for all my other expenses. With my current budget, I could do that and still save a bit, but it won't be much taking into account other various expenses that come along with home ownership.

My question to you is - what would you do in my situation? Would you rent first despite the higher monthly cost? Would you keep living at your parents to save up / until you get a higher salary? Would you buy, and if so, do you think the apartment above would lead to an acceptable financial situation?

I'd really appreciate any and all feedback!",finance

investing,Corporate debt,"https://www.economist.com/news/business-and-finance/21741377-corporate-debt-could-be-culprit-where-will-next-crisis-occur

&gt; One sign that the credit quality of the market has been deteriorating is that, globally, the median bond’s rating has dropped steadily since 1980, from A- to BBB-. The corporate-bond market is divided into investment grade (debt with a high credit rating) and speculative, or “junk”, bonds below that level. The dividing line is the BBB rating. So the median bond is now junk.

&gt; At the same time, a prolonged period of low rates has made it very tempting to take on more debt. S&amp;P, a credit-rating agency, says that as of 2017, 37% of global companies were highly indebted. That is five percentage points higher than the share in 2007, just before the financial crisis hit. By the same token, more private-equity deals are loading up on lots of debt than at any time since the crisis.

&gt; Even within investment-grade debt, quality has gone down. According to PIMCO, a fund-management group, in America 48% of such bonds are now rated BBB, up from 25% in the 1990s. The companies that issue them are also more heavily indebted than they used to be. In 2000 the net leverage ratio for BBB issuers was 1.7. It is now 2.9.

&gt; Investors are not demanding higher yields to compensate for the deteriorating quality of corporate debt; quite the reverse.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-02/lippmann-of-big-short-fame-says-corporates-will-cause-next-pain

&gt; The former Deutsche Bank AG trader who now oversees about $3 billion at his LibreMax Capital LLC said in a Bloomberg Television interview that corporate debt and equities will face the biggest pain when the next downturn comes. Investments linked to consumer debt, unlike the last crisis, will be relatively safe because companies have been the ones gorging the most on the ultra cheap interest rates during the past decade.

&gt; “If the first quarter’s volatility is a harbinger of something bigger, I think that you’re going to see a lot more trouble in the corporate market and the equity market than the structured products market,” Lippmann said on the sidelines of the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California. “The consumer is in much better shape than corporates. Consumers are less levered than they were pre-crisis. Corporates are more levered than they were pre-crisis, and I think structured products are not going to be the epicenter.”",finance
personalfinance,"Best ways to establish general purpose savings account for a minor, without affecting future Financial Aid at college time?","Hi all, could use some help.  A friend is looking to set up a general purpose savings account for his son who is a minor.  I had initially suggested a high yield savings account, or a brokerage account using index funds, as I learned the time horizon for this money would be longer term.

After some research, we've learned that if a custodial brokerage account is set up for a minor, it can count against him unfavorably when it comes time to apply for financial aid for college, and not just that, but bank accounts too.  Specifically, *""Custodial bank and brokerage accounts, such as UTMA and UGMA accounts, are treated as a student asset on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). This has a more severe impact on eligibility for need-based financial aid than parent assets.""*

The recommendation I am seeing is to use a 529 plan instead, but the purpose behind this savings account is more than just college &amp; higher education qualifying expenses.

Do you have any suggestions for how to best go about this?  I'm thinking that the thing to do would be to maximize the 529 savings to the point that it is shielded from being considered as assets of the parents/student, and then set up a high yield savings account separately but if the savings account is not shielded....that's where I'm stuck.",finance

Text:

The U.S. Treasury Department will boost the amount of long-term debt it sells to $73 billion this quarter as President Donald Trump’s administration seeks to finance budget deficits set to widen further because of tax cuts and higher spending.

In its quarterly refunding announcement on Wednesday, the department again lifted the auction sizes of coupon-bearing and floating-rate debt after doing so last quarter for the first time since 2009. It again left inflation-linked security sizes unchanged. Treasury also announced plans to issue a new two-month bill later in 2018.

After keeping borrowing relatively stable in recent years, the Treasury announcement highlights the Trump administration’s need to sell debt to help pay the government’s bills as the deficit swells and the Federal Reserve allows maturing securities on its $4.4 trillion balance sheet to roll off gradually. The possible new bill maturity comes after a deluge of sales over the first quarter was partly to blame for money-market rates rising sharply.

The Treasury will sell $31 billion in three-year notes on May 8, versus $30 billion it sold last month and $26 billion in February, according to a statement released in Washington. The government increased to $25 billion the sale of 10-year notes, from $24 billion last quarter, and the 30-year bonds to $17 billion from $16 billion, also to be auctioned next week. The sales will raise new cash of $33.9 billion.

In the statement, the Treasury said it plans over the coming quarter to boost auction-sizes of other maturities.

$27 Billion
The department will notch higher sales of two- and three-year note auctions by $1 billion per month over the quarter, compared with monthly rises over the past quarter of $2 billion. It will also boost five-, seven-, 10-, and 30-year note sales by $1 billion starting in May and lift floating rate notes by $1 billion in May. The changes will result in an additional $27 billion of new issuance.

Treasury plans to conduct small-value buyback this month, it said, adding details will come later. The department said the buyback shouldn’t be seen as a change in policy.

The U.S. budget deficit widened to $600 billion halfway through the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, as spending increased at three times the pace of revenue growth in the October-to-March period, according to Treasury figures released last month.

Tax reductions and higher spending approved by Congress and Trump are expected to push the budget shortfall to $804 billion in the current fiscal year, from $665 billion in fiscal 2017, and then surpass $1 trillion by 2020, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

The U.S. set a first-quarter record, by borrowing a net $488 billion, or $47 billion more than previously estimated, the Treasury said Monday in a quarterly announcement on its borrowing needs. Still, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has indicated he’s unconcerned about the bond market’s ability to absorb rising government debt.

Earlier this week, bond dealers meeting with Treasury officials indicated that foreign demand for Treasuries “remained robust,” according to minutes from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee released Wednesday. That assessment echoed comments Mnuchin made on Monday.

“It’s a very large, robust market -- it’s the most liquid market in the world, and there is a lot of supply,” he said in the interview. “But I think the market can easily handle it.”

A recent report from the International Monetary Fund showed that the U.S.’s debt load by 2023 will be worse that the fiscal position of Italy, the perennial poor man of the Group of Seven industrial nations.",finance
personalfinance,(CAN) Extra money to invest,"Greetings!

So, I've just started a job that pays much more than I spend. I currently have 10K sitting in the account and not invested anywhere.
Here are a few key elements :


- I'm on the Federal Gov. retirement plan.
- Got a baby coming in a few weeks.
- I may go back to school for a MBA once my two year contract is over.
- Got no house or car payment. Rent is about 1/8th of my monthly salary. Planning to buy in two or five years depening on going back for a Masters degree or not. 


So, considering that there are a lot of things happening and future expenses (School, kid, house eventually), I'm wondering what would be the best balance between emergency funding available and investing somewhere so I just do not just sit and watch my bank account grow passively. It will be hard for me to put the money to far from reach in case I want to buy a house or need it for school stuff.

Any tips?

personalfinance,Increasing my credit score to buy a house,"Hi /personalFinance

I need some advice on increasing my credit score so I can buy a house in the next year or two as I'm 26. This is my situation:

I used to have 15k in credit card debt (16k total credit line). Yesterday I dropped a bunch of my savings onto it and reduced it down to 6.8k, and I plan on throwing about 2.5k/month at it. Hoping to have all of my cards paid off by the end of July.

I got a car back in January with an 8% rate (I had bad credit ~600). Current payment is just under $600/month. I plan on refinancing this the second half of the year since my credit score will (hopefully) be improved.

Student Loans: 

* 17.8k private ($172/month)

* 33.2k federal (deferred until October —then ~$300/month)

Credit Score:

* Mint/Credit Karma (5/1/2018): 613 [Vantage 3.0]

* Discover FICO (4/3/2018): 638 [TransUnion]

* AMEX/Chase FICO (4/4/2018 &amp; 4/7/2018): 626 [Experian]

* Citi FICO (3/27/18): 609 [Equifax]

My current monthly income (after taxes) is ~$5300 and rent is ~$1200/month (with utilities and such)

The problem that I have is that I have 6 missed payments on my cards (on 2 Chase cards), from back in 2015 and 2016. 

My question is, what is the best thing that I can do to increase my credit score over the next 1-2 years so I can buy a house? On top of this, should I aggressively pay off my car and private student loans (after finishing paying off my credit cards and refinancing my car) or pay the minimums and save up for the downpayment?

I take home around $38k per year, and work extra jobs on the side for some extra income. 

I have about 15k in credit card debt from when I was young and uniformed, which I’ve been aggressively paying off. I’m not longer using credit cards. If I were to continue paying at my current rate, it would be gone in about 2.5 years. 

I have student loans in the amount of $10,000 from two years of college after high school. 

I’m planning on doing an accelerated bachelor’s/ masters program, and taking my prerequisites at the community college part time while continuing to work over the next three years. During the accelerated program I’d be in school full time, but would ideally be able to hold part time work. 

I’ve applied for federal aid and plan to take advantage of any government loans. 

By my calculations, from start to finish my education could cost $100k-$120k. I’m set on going back to school, but I have no idea how I can afford this based on my current situation. 
 
If anyone has been in an similar situation, or has any suggestions I’d love to hear them. Additionally, I am planning on meeting with a friend who is a financial adviser, and it would be helpful to know what information I should have prepared for him, as well as any questions I may not think to ask.

personalfinance,"I'm not convinced to save $1,000 in an EF before paying off high-interest cc debt. Prove me wrong.","I've read a lot of threads and a lot of articles that talk about keeping a $1k emergency fund if you're paying off high-interest/credit card debt, and bumping it up to 3-6 months once your cc debt is paid off.  

Here's the thing: I get the value of having a 3-6 month EF...if you don't have cc debt. If you are paying off cc debt at high interest rates, I just can't figure out how to justify a $1k EF. It's such a small amount, how could it really save you in an emergency?  

If you have a major, life altering emergency, it's probably going to cost you way more than $1k. That little EF is barely going to make a dent. If you have a small emergency that you can cover with a $1k emergency fund...well, you could also cover it with your credit card (assuming your accounts are still open).  

So you double down on your debt and forget about the EF because you want to save the most money possible on interest fee charges. You're doing great, and a year later you've cut your debt in half. An $800 emergency comes up and you have no EF. You put it on your cc and your interest charges increase slightly. Depending on the exact numbers, you may have still saved money in the end by putting that $1k toward your cc debt rather than an EF. At worst, you're back where you started.  

So, since my inclination seems to go against all conventional wisdom I've found, I'm looking for someone to convince me otherwise.",finance

personalfinance,Is it a bad idea to pay off a high-interest mortgage using a loan from my self-funded 457b deferred compensation account? [Financial details are included],"My mortgage has a very high interest rate (4.85%). My monthly payment is ~$1500 (including $300 escrow), but I’ve been paying an extra $800 towards the principal every month, so my monthly payment to the mortgage company is $2300. There is just over $50,000 left on the mortgage. And if I maintain the current payment rate, it will be done in ~2.5 years. The effective rate I’d have paid over the life of the mortgage will probably be a shade under 3%.

This weekend I had an idea. I have a 457b deferred compensation account to which I have been contributing ~$1200 a month. The current value of the account is ~$320,000 (and it is not my sole retirement account). I can loan myself up to $50,000 from this account for a one-time fee of $50, and pay it back within 59 months at 6.25% interest. **But this interest is paid back into my account**. The annual maintenance fee on the loan is $25 ($6.25 paid every quarter). So the total cost of the loan would be $175. Monthly payments would be ~$985 for 59 months, and the total interest I would pay back into my account would be ~$8200. My annual return for the last 10 years on this account averages to 8-9%, so as my payments go back into my account each month, they will presumably average a return in that range.

If I take this loan, it frees up $2300 of my current monthly post-tax expenses. Of this $300 would go into my savings account to pay property taxes and flood insurance. Of the remaining $2000, I could have $800/month withdrawn pre-tax to put into my 457b account, $200/month to put pre-tax into my traditional IRA account, and $1000/month post-tax to pay off the loan.

Doing this:

* increases my pre-tax monthly 457b contribution to $2000 (I am over 50, so I can put $24.5K in there each year).
* Allows me to add pre-tax $200/month to my IRA (currently I put about $4000/year, so it will now become close to the max of $6500/year).
* Reduces my Federal and State taxes because my taxable income is reduced by $12,000/year (tax reduction of ~$2000 per year).
* Saves me paying the mortgage company any more interest (~$3200 saved).

The negatives that I can see are:

* Using post-tax money to replace $50,000 (with 6.25% interest), that I'll pay taxes on again when I retire. I'm not sure how to calculate how bad this hit will be - because I'm still 15-16 years from retirement, and can roughly guesstimate my income - but who knows what the tax rates will be then.
* Loss of mortgage interest deduction. However, the new standard deduction for a taxpayer whose status is single is $12,000; starting this year, I probably won’t be itemizing taxes anyway - so I don’t the loss of mortgage interest deduction is going make a difference.

But I think I’m viewing this through honey-colored glasses. So, what is wrong with this idea?

personalfinance,Thoroughly confused by Vanguard. Please help.,"I opened a two Roth IRAs  \(for myself and my wife\) about two weeks ago. Started out putting $2K in each account. I can't even figure out what is going on now. The website says the money is in a  ""Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund \(Settlement Fund\)"". I don't know what that means, but it seems like it's just a holding area, and I have to somehow allocate those funds myself? I can't figure out how to do that though. I have \(multiple times\) gone through their questionnaires to ""determine a target asset mix"", but nothing seems to change with the account at all when I am done. Can anyone walk me through what I am supposed to do here? I am very inexperienced at investing, but usually very good at navigating websites and I can't figure this site out for the life of me.

stocks,Why does US dollar &amp; Bond dip and soar up while US stock market soar up and then dip after the news Fed kept the current interest rate?,"If US dollar is going to soar up after the interest rate has been decided to stay, why would it dip right after the news? Why does it just not soar up without the dip?

Same for the stock market. Why does it soar up right after the news then dip? Why does it not just dip after the news? 

I know, in general, if interest rate goes up, companies revenue growth gets hindered which causes the stock market to have a slower growth thus causing people to sell their stocks, on top of the bond going up due to higher interest rate which also causes people to get their money out of stocks and put in the bonds.

Therefore, the immediate response to the news, US dollar and bond dipping while stock market going up, makes sense to me.

What I dont get is the next phase where the inverse, dollar and bond going up while stock market is dipping, is happening.

1. I want to know why staying interest rate is causing stock market to go down and US dollar and bond to go up.

2. I also want to know why US dollar and bond dipped before going up and why stock market went up before dipping. Like, the reason why the stock market is dipping is because people are selling more since they think the market is gonna go down. If they thought the market is gonna go down, why in the first place they bought stocks causing the market to rise first?",finance

personalfinance,Spouse Student Loan Payoff In Full - Good or Bad Idea?,"Wife has been aggressively paying off her student loans (30K/year) and has about 50K remaining. Loan rate is 6.8%

I've been maxing my roth contributions (18.5K/Year) and throwing additional money into a savings account each month which is at 60K and earning very little interest.

Would it be a good idea for me to pay off that loan in full? We would start contributing the money that would've gone to loan payments into a higher interest online bank savings account.

The way I see it, the loan interest rate is much higher than I'm earning with the money sitting in a savings account. From the wiki flowchart, it seems like paying off the debt should be the priority. We would certainly save on interest by paying it off early, but am I missing something?",finance
personalfinance,Looking into buying a car. Its my first time. Need help and opinions on what to do.,"Im 26 years old. I work at Target and bring home about $1100 - $1300 a month depending on hours. However, i am currently looking into getting a new job that will pay nearly double. I still live with my parents and virtually have no payments. Inb4 spoiled and lucky. I do help my parents as much as i can though. I also dont have credit. I do have a Khols credit card that i dont plan to use.

The car im currently looking at is a Nissan 370z priced at $16,998 at a local CarMax which i plan to finance. According to KBB, a fair range for the car is $13,733 - $15,960. However, looking at Cargurus payment calculator, if i put $4000 down with a 4% interest rate and 60 month loan term, ill be roughly paying $240 a month at its listed price. I know this is subject to change. I checked the average insurance payment for the car in California and its around $150, again i know this can change too. 

Ill still have several grand saved if i put $4000 down and plan on putting that into my saving to go towards payments. I do plan on putting half of each paycheck, i get paid twice a week, into my savings as well. I have a few things of mine i can sell for some extra cash if i need

So my questions are, am i able to negotiate with carmax for a lower price? If so or not, do you think ill be financially ok with the purchase? Should I finance through my credit union or through carmax? Any additional information would be great. If you guys have questions for me, please feel free to ask.",finance
financialindependence,Do a lot of you feel like your life hasn't started yet?,"I know it's considered a bad way to think.

Being a kid was fun, school was fun, university was fun, but work life is just wasteful. I can't function if 8 hours every day + time for commuting + time for other preparation are taken away from me. I can keep my evenings more productive if I drink coffee, but then I don't get enough sleep and lose some evenings entirely to catch up on sleep.

I find it hard to do anything I really want to and when I do it feels rushed because I know there's a deadline. I do a good job of staying focused on the right things mentally, but it still has an impact. For example if I go out drinking with friends, at the end of the might people say ""better get home bevause I have to work tomorrow"", they don't say ""I'm satisfied with my time here"".

So much time is taken away for work and for tasks surrounding work that there's just a margin left at the end. A big chunkbof that gets taken by errands. A chunk of what's left is taken away by occasional social obligations. And the rest is at a time when you're fed up with the rest, you're either tired or your body fights you in some other way.

The mentality of ""life hasn't started yet"" can stick with you your whole life and then you can die having wasted it, but I still feel that way as long as I am working a day job.

The alternative is to just quit and find a way to live near-homeless. I probably should do that but I don't like the strong social stigma against it, and breaking that to family would betray them and make life difficult.

That's a heavy motivation for FIRE for me, that life hasn't started yet, or at least it's on hold until.",finance
personalfinance,Advice on End Of Vehicle Lease,"Hey guys, I frequently browse this subreddit and was looking for a little advice.

Back in 2015 I was in the market for my first car. I bought a used Acura but that had a transmission error within 30 miles and I was refunded. While we sorted out that money and financing of a different vehicle, the vehicle I was looking to finance (2009 Mazda) also had a check engine light turn on and would have been a 1200 fix. Because of those experiences, I've been super skeptical about going used. I dont want those issues to pop up out of warranty.

I went ahead and signed on to a 2015 LE Eco Corolla Lease for 3 years. It was very affordable, but I'm looking for some advice on how to proceed.

I live at home currently but am actively looking to move out. I have roommates picked out and am budgeting for about $750/mo in rent+utilities. My current lease payment is $206.80 and insurance $223 a month. I have checks averaging $1000 coming in bi-weekly.

Currently I have no debt other than my car (In August when the lease is up, I will owe just under $12,000.) I have $20,000 saved up and until I move out, I'm putting $550 per paycheck into savings. I do have a tentative lasik surgery scheduled for June and am expecting worse case $4000 out of pocket for that.

With that in mind, I don't know the best way to move forward. I like the security of a new/newer vehicle with warranties and being less likely to fail on me. I'm mentally prepared to pay the $12k out of pocket to eliminate my car payment, but my hesitance comes from my lack of knowledge. I'm not a car guy, so I dont know if $12k is a worthwhile investment. I mostly like having bluetooth and a car I know has been serviced properly. It gets great mileage (30 city/42 HWY) and in the 26000 miles I've had it I'm averaging 35 mpg. I dont have any accidents or tickets under my belt however I'm 22 and know insurance will bone me.

I have a 780 credit score, so I feel confident I'll secure a solid interest rate if I continued to finance, but lowering my monthly obligations is super attractive.

With all of that in mind, how do I proceed? Do I walk away from the car at the end of my lease and look for an slightly older model with 50-70k miles, decent mpg and a lower price point? Is the Corolla a solid deal and I could benefit from purchasing it? (KBB says 14-16k however another site said a dealer would pay 9k max which seems abysmal.)

This all is pretty new to me. I DO like that the car is newer, looks pretty good and is clean. The only bells and whistle that it offers is bluetooth which isn't anything special. What do you recommend? Any advice on how you would proceed would be great. I have until early August to decide.",finance
personalfinance,Is it worth it to take out $30k in student loans to get a second bachelors?,"Little bit of backstory:

I graduated in Business Administration, wanted Computer Science from the beginning, wasn't able to to that specific program due to the scholarships that I got being solely available if I did Business.

Having graduated for almost a year, now I'm picking back up and thinking about correcting my mistakes while I'm still young (22). Been looking at the OSU Post Bacc CS degree, which costs about $28k.

I currently have a full time job getting $40k a year, I have savings, but nowhere near enough to pay for a second education. I also have about $5k in private student loans. Have never used any type of federal aid or loans.

Go back and get this second major seems like a no brainer, specially considering I am able to keep my full time job and I am able to finish that in 2 years, however, with no money available now, I would have to finance 100% of that tuition cost, and one thing people always made sure to tell me was how lucky I was for only having about $5k in student loan debts, and only a $160 dollar a month payment.

personalfinance,Morgage formula/math,"After being pre-qualified for a home loan of up to $250k (could get up to 340 but I'm staying conservative), I was discussing with my parents about conducting a loan through them instead of a bank.



My goal was to keep interest in the family, hopefully get a better interest rate, and provide them some more positive cash flow going into retirement. They seem on board with the situation as they have the free funds and it will be a relatively safe investment getting a higher return than the money in the bank.



I was looking around at amortization tables and calculators but I've been having trouble finding fomulea I can use to figure out how my monthly payment changes and how much I'll owe in interest and principle if I make extra payments. Any help pointing me in the right direction would be great.



Or would it make more sense in a situation like this to be simple and do something like ""You loan me $250k and I pay you a fixed sum of $340k over X years"" (numbers depending on the agreement).



I had been doing my calculations with calculators to have a lower monthly payment and having the free cash to make extra payments after we furnish the home and get settled. I realize most people don't follow through, but I'm already budgeting for it.



My last question is, what would be the way to get the loan income to my parents in the most tax advantaged way?

personalfinance,I need a car and some advice,"I have a tricky situation right now that I can't figure out. My girlfriend and I need a new car but I don't know if I'll be approved for an auto loan. I am currently paying $300/month for a used car that I stupidly bought 2 years ago when I didn't know any better and still have about a year and a half left on the loan. I would love to just keep it and pay it off but the only problem is I don't think that it will survive that long. It already has several problems, the miles are adding up, and I can't afford any more major maintenance to it. I basically already maxed my credit card fixing a major issue with it already. However I figure that if I can just replace that $300 payment for a similar one and a new car ( something cheap around $15,000), then that would be the best option as reliability wouldn't be an issue and we'd be saving in gas too. We absolutely need the car too because public transportation in our area is horrible and we need it to get to work. Now, here's the tricky part. Both of us have bad credit, I'm upside down in my loan by about $3000, and we have now down payment at the moment. The good thing we have going for us is we bring in about $4,000 a month together after taxes and our monthly living expenses are about $2,000 a month not including my car payments and auto insurance which together is about $500 a month. So we have a relatively large amount of disposal income after rent and bills etc. I feel that our credit scores don't really reflect our current financial situation at the moment, and even though we are working to fix it the problem is we need a car as soon as possible. My current auto loan is through a credit union and is in good standing, and my girlfriend banks through Navy Federal Credit Union. I've hear that credit unions are also more likely to give out loans too so we would try to go through them I'm guessing. I just want to be as prepared and knowledgeable as I can be going into this process so that I know what I need to do to get a car as soon as I can because I'm scared my car could break down anytime and I'll be left paying $500 for a dud and no way to get to work.",finance
stocks,Opinions on why AMZN is stagnant,"Just curious on your opinions on AMZN after the quarter and where it's heading. A brief summary of my research is below.

TLDR: Slowing GDP, increasing bond yield, concerns of decreasing consumer spending, and May selling led to stagnant stock price. There is good news but higher than usual amazon stock volitility makes me think that the market doesn't know how to react. Overall trend will be upwards after S&amp;P 500 stocks contacting.

I'm trying to figure out why Amazon is rather stagnant after a great quarter. So from my understanding thus far, revenues were up tremendously, leading to a ~7% hike in stock price, however, half of that was lost by the end of the day. I'm assuming this was mainly due to slowing GDP, and concerns of decreasing consumer spending. Others investors pretty much think that amazon is overvalued. More factors put into play are: increasing bond yield, increasing FED interest rates, increasing unemployment rate. (There's definitely more that I'm missing, but I think these are the major factors)

But if we take a look on the other spectrum, we see Amazon raising the price of Prime and Prime retention, rapid growth in their AWS business, and a majority of analyst mark it as a buy.

I personally think it's currently a battle between US market correction vs stock performance pricing. So relative to the market (tracking by S&amp;P 500), AMZN is doing well but stock price is decreasing because the whole market is contracting. So once the market contractions end, AMZN price should increase, but the question now becomes how long will the contraction last, and will there be a recession? A thing of interest I've noticed are larger fluctuations in AMZN stock price sometimes from roughly -1.5% to +1.5% and vice versa. I think for a stock at this price, it's highly unusual that the stock price is this volatile so the market is uncertain of how to react.

This is my personal opinion and feel free to leave your opinions.

I am a long\-term gamer I am self\-taught Software engineer mainly in Windows OS I am not a young gamer I am 43 years old &amp; I don't do drama in games.

I had played role\-play a few other time nothing clicked until I was in PLF in Altis [life.UK](https://life.UK) We were the biggest role players on the server We would do weekly bank raids.

So I decided to join [georgiaroleplay.com](https://georgiaroleplay.com) Please don't confuse this with any other communities. I mainly join because I had a few friends in there.

I start my time in Georgia role\-play as a fcso \(Falcon County State officer\) on Monday 23rd April I did my in\-game training with S.Nord &amp; my out of game training with K.Wheatley.

**Times I was on server**

* 23rd April out of game training &amp; in\-game training
* 24th April Petrol training with C. Portus
* I was off on 25th April.
* 26th April Petrol training J. Duggan, A. Bianchi, Rick Griffin.
* 27th April C. Portus

These were all the patrols with the exception of being a civilian  on 24th April.

Rick Griffin Offered me Early training on the server a few hours before petrol.

So I came onto the server about 21:00 my time and let him know that I was going to setup my G29 steering wheel so I could use it on that shift later.

on the night of the 27th April. I was in the channel with R. Griffin he said to me that he was going to get something to eat I said OK,

So I was still trying to get my steering wheel to work with FiveM but was unable to I lost all track of time so I put my steering wheel away.

So I put my hands up and say yes I missed that training and I were gutted that I lost track of time. I went on patrol that night and did not get off the until gone 4 am.

**28th April**

before patrol was about to began I said that I was going to have a night off due to lack of sleep. I was pulled down into a channel by R. Griffin that I had failed training.

He has tried his best by setting up multiple training sessions for me I only ever had 3 patrol's in total,

At one point I had enough said I'll leave because I was Fedup &amp; I was R. Griffin trying to make me look bad.

I was thinking that it was down to my Timezone because I am 6 hours behind there server.

I tried to explain this to them that it was impossible for me to have missed 3 training sessions,

as I only had R. Griffin for about 30 minutes before the end of shift on 26th,

I was being bumped out of channel then I got bumped back into the channel and me heard he says I am going to rip sh#@. All I said when I hear that was out of who?

Then he got really pissy with me then they all left the channel they were in.

**29th April**

I was moved to another channel for me to explain things as they happen. So I told them everything above.

**The outcome** I was removed from the fcso because they didn't, believe me, they said that they had gotten several complaints about me Although I had 3 members of there community Vouch for me 2 of those members are community owners.

**30th April**

I moved into K.Wheatley's channel after messaging him see if ok to join.

I asked him if he had made a complaint about me he no said I've not made a complaint against you.

I let slip that I was making a complaint about R. Griffin due to him lying about training.

No sooner I had left channel K.Wheatley moved into R. Griffin's channel then C.Portus was moved. See images below.

[All in channel talking about what to do. I know make a complaint then he get banned his complaint  goes puff.](https://i.redd.it/pnywcnh5yjv01.jpg)

[Them making it official now there recording RE RE RE.](https://i.redd.it/fau7n3lmyjv01.jpg)

In a nutshell, I have now been banned from the community for harassment because R. Griffin made a complaint against me when the contact I had with him was a very minimal amount of time

the reason it was marked as harassment was that I said I'll leave

They really need to look at what harassment means 3 of the people on that panel who decided to ban me are pals with R. Griffin.

My Complaint is swept under the carpet &amp; R. Griffin don't get punished for his lying.

My representative payee and I budgeted out my payments as well as possible, keeping my combined bank accounts at under $2,000 at all times.

A couple years ago, I received notice that for a few years, my total funds had been over $2,000. There was a bank account under my name and using my social security number being held by family from when I was a young child, with only somewhere in the neighborhood of $300 in it.

Because of this, the Social Security Administration determined that it needed to take back all of the payments for the months that I was over the limit. The full payments. This left me roughly $11,700 or so in debt, and they have been taking 10% of my monthly checks ever since. It's been almost two years, and with my notice that my payments were rising with inflation, they also sent me a notice stating what was still owed. The amount owed is still over $11,400, despite the combined amount taken out of my checks being well beyond the difference.

BlockChain,Berkeley City Council Moves Ahead With Pilot Program For Issuing City Bonds On Blockchain,"The city of Berkeley, California has moved forward with an initiative to apply blockchain technology to public financing to raise funds for community projects, Bloomberg reports May 2. Last night the Berkeley city council unanimously voted to ask the city manager to consider a pilot program that proposes selling municipal bonds using blockchain technology.

The project, initiated by Vice Mayor Ben Barlett, aims to introduce another funding method to the city financial infrastructure that would ostensibly increase community investment by reducing the minimum bond price.

Barlett said that the pilot venture intends to launch “micro-bonds” which would allow the issuance of bonds in denominations in the range of $10 to $25. The typical minimum denomination for a municipal bond is $5,000. According to Barlett, people can more easily afford $10 than $5,000 for a bond, which would make investing in city projects a more viable option for average citizens.

Using blockchain would provide a ledger platform, upon which micro-bonds would be recorded as soon as they are issued. Barlett says that coupling micro-bonds with the blockchain is, “meant to get around Wall Street.”

Barlett added that, should the political process allow it, they could go one step further and support funding municipal projects via a tokenized currency. The idea was met by some skepticism from Councilwoman Susan Wengraf, who said:

“I don’t know much about it, but I know it’s very unstable. The examples used by other communities successfully [issuing mini-bonds] was based on dollars - cash, not cryptocurrency. I would be very happy to support the first part of the proposal and more skeptical about cryptocurrency.”

Berkeley started considering a municipal token in February, after a tweet from US President Donald Trump raised concern that the local university would lose its federal funding. Berkeley is also a sanctuary city, meaning that it doesn’t cooperate with the federal government to enforce immigration law. The Trump administration has recently been threatening to pull funding to sanctuary cities as part of their immigration reform.

According to city officials, issuing a Berkeley municipal token would be one way for the city to avoid budget shortfalls that are the result of resisting the current presidential administration.",cryptocurrency

First card: 10k total debt at 14.49% interest

Second card: 15k total debt at 16.24%

I was thinking of tackling the larger debt with the higher interest rate first but I don’t know if that will hurt me in the long run with interest. Thank you for your time :)

Have a great day everyone!",finance
personalfinance,2 years left on car loan,"Hey guys, need help!

I have a balance of $10,000 left on my car.
Interest rate is approx 9.22%.
Weekly repayments are $109.45.

In the coming months, I will be capable of paying the remaining balance outright however I've been meaning to save for a house deposit.

Should I let the loan ride itself out and continue paying my weekly repayments? Or should I take it on the chin, pay out the $10,000 and start saving from scratch.

Cheers

personalfinance,should i be renting or buying?,"I [24] recently got my first job out of college and am trying to understand what my best option for housing is. I have spoken to a mortgage advisor to learn about what expenses go into owning a home. I am making $5k/month and have atleast $20k in savings. I am in Austin where housing prices are high and only growing. I have friends who would be interested in renting a room if my purchase allows it. After running through some simulations it seems I would likely need to take on a $1800 (before any rent income) mortgage payment to buy a property in the neighborhood of $225k. My hesitation is that only around 1/3 of that payment would actually be going towards building equity in the home. And that at the ~$225k price point the properties are very limited. The upsides to owning a home is the tax incentives, knowing that I am atleast investing some money safely and locking in a ~5% interest rate. If I were to rent I think I could probably spend around $700-$1200 a month for a good place. I want my money to go as far as possible I just don't know which is more financially beneficial.",finance
personalfinance,"Dad passed away, dealing with two small IRAs at a credit union. Mom wants to cash them out but worried about penalty and taxes.","My dad passed away and I'm helping my mom with the finances.  She's in her 80s and they had their IRAs in a credit union that far away from where they live, and the credit union (or her) doesn't do anything online.   She would like to take all the money out of the IRA's instead of trying to set them up as inheritances, mainly b/c the credit union is very hard to work with. One IRA is 11k the other is 3k.  With pensions and SS income she'll probably make about 29k this year. I assume she'll be able to file as a qualifying widow this year and get the 24k federal deduction.  The state is NJ and she will likely owe taxes on the income over $40k.

I'm trying to put together the positives/negatives of having her cash out both IRAs, but I'm having a hard time trying to figure out 1) is there a penalty for closing the IRAs?  and 2) What's the tax liability for the 14k hitting her income (estimate $44k for the year if the IRAs count as income).

personalfinance,"(JP) Moving from US with debt, now in Japan but accumulated even more debt. Not sure what's next.","We're family of 3 (me, wife, 1.5 y/o son). I was let go of my job in US (which sponsored my H-1B) after 5 years. Since there was only 1 year left, we thought it made sense to move outside US to find a job and refresh my visa (I need to be outside US for a year).

I got a job offer in Tokyo, Japan as a software engineer. They are paying me 9 million yen annually (My old job was in Boston, $100k annually). 20% pay cut, but I was told that already was a ""high rate"".

And so we moved. We sold all our furnitures in US. We had to use credit card to pay for those appliances and furniture since we used those cash for security deposit. We're roughly doubling our debt.

Now, I'm looking at my cash flow, and I noticed that I made a huge, huge mistake.

* Take home pay: ¥650k after all deductions
* Rent: ¥245k (still in contract for 2.5 years)
* Cash needing to send to US for _minimum payment_: ¥290k

So, roughly, we are left with about ¥100k which some of them need to go to electricity/gas/water too.

Before we moved to Japan, we were in $20k credit card debt. Now, we're in $60k debt.

And with that, here are my question:

* Is it worth trying to look for a new job that'd pay me more than ¥9m annually? Is this really a high rate in Japan?
  * Would working remotely for US company actually be better for me in this case?
* My wife is a full-time mom on dependent visa. Is there something that she could work on without breaking her visa?
* I'm going back to read Money Makeover again ... and since we need to build new emergency fund, would ¥100k make sense?
* Given we are planning to go back to US, does it worth to try to negotiate with CC companies about interest rate (average around 20%) or should I leave them be?
* Crazy idea, but does it worth to try reaching out to banks in Japan to see if I can borrow some money to pay off debt in US (hopefully with lower interest rate)?

I know this is a long shot as my situation is in Japan, and I appreciate you reading my thread. I screwed this up very badly, and I really hope that it's not too late for me to fix it. Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,Is it a waste to use first time home buyer benefits on a cheap property?,"a little about my situation:
Currently living in an apartment, renting for flexibility reasons (I haven't lived in the same spot for more than a year). I maxed my IRA, am on pace to max my 401k around October, and am looking for investment opportunities.

I recently found a cheap manufactured home on a small plot of land for sale. It's in pretty bad shape, but with some work and a little bit of love it could make a really nice place to rent out or airbnb. it's in an amazing location.

I'm pretty sure I want to try to buy this. However, I'm not sure what implications it has for a future home purchase. I want to settle down and buy a house to live in sometime in the next 5 years. Is it unwise to use my first time home buyer benefits on this Manufactured home? A low down payment/low interest rate would be much more beneficial to me on a house that is greater than 400k instead of a manufactured home that is less than 50k. That being said, the return on the manufactured home investment could potentially be high.

Is it worth it? I appreciate any and all advice.",finance

Here's my current situation: 

**Assets** 

* $13,000 cash savings

* $6,000 401k (evenly split between traditional and Roth contributions) 

* $2,600 Roth IRA

* $500 Traditional IRA 

**Debts** 

* $6,800 Auto Loan ($250/month @ 2.75%, 2013 Honda Accord, good condition, probably worth about $10,000)

Scholarships will cover the vast majority of my tuition. I'll need to pay for the rest of tuition/fees and my living expenses on my own. In the first year, I anticipate I'll need to pay for ~$35,000 from savings/federal student loans. This will be the case in my second and third years as well, but I anticipate some amount of income to offset it. (Income could range from a few thousand bucks to basically the full amount, depending on what kind of summer gigs I find and where.) 

While great jobs could allow me to come out with ~$70,000 in debt, for the sake of being conservative, we'll say **I'll graduate with $100,000 in federal student loans at ~6.8% interest**. 

With all that out of the way, I basically have a few questions: 

* Should I consider liquidating any of my retirement accounts to help pay for school? 

* If I roll my 401k into my IRAs, will I be able to withdraw my Roth contributions penalty-free (in the same way that you can with draw Roth IRA contributions penalty-free)? 

* How much cash savings should I keep on hand? Should I spend the rest immediately to avoid loans in my first year? 

* Should I consider selling my car for something cheaper? (In my city, not having a car is simply not an option.) 

* Anything else I should consider?

personalfinance,"Is it possible to refinance a secondary mortgage, or should I consolidate everything to one loan?","Sorry if my title isn't articulating things properly. Here is my situation:

I bought a home in 2013 with a 30 year fixed mortgage at 4.0%, and a secondary loan (because we did not have enough cash to cover a 20% deposit) at 4.25% with a maturity date of July 2023. With the secondary loan, we are paying 100% on the interest and zero of the principle. I believe we will start making principal payments in 2020.

I got some quotes on a refinance because I know interest rates are rising, and I can easily consolidate both loans at a rate of 4.65% on a 30-year fixed. The rate is higher than what I am paying on both of my current loans but it will free me up on that secondary loan and I wont have to worry about my payments skyrocketing in 2020. My overall monthly payments (combined) will go up by about $100 vs what I am paying now.

My question is, does it make sense for me to go down this road...since my primary mortgage is only 4%? Is it possible to refinance only my secondary mortgage?

personalfinance,"Gift Tax, Estate Tax, and Stepped-up Basis for Dummies","Hello everyone,

There are some very common misconceptions about Gift Tax, Estate Tax, and Stepped-up Basis that I see all of the time on this subreddit and I just wanted to clarify a few things. I have been meaning to write this post for a while. 

Background: I am a law student (kind of?) who finished classes last week, graduates May 12, and will be taking the bar this summer. Post bar, I will be practicing the personal finance areas of the law, which for me mean Bankruptcy, Tax, Estate Planning, Elder Law, Probate, and SSI/SSDI. I have found that my passion is using my legal knowledge to help others with their personal finance issues. 

Disclaimer: Everything I say in the following post is not legal advice (I am not an attorney (yet) and I dang sure ain't your attorney). Some things in this post may also vary from my state to your state. This should be seen as broad overview and a starting point in your head for questions to ask YOUR attorney when you go see them. 

Alright, let's get into it. 

1) What is a ""Gift Tax""? 

There is a very common misconception that when you give or receive a gift, you owe tax on it. This is not true for the vast majority of the population and even when it is true, it doesn't work like most people think it does. 

Every person can give away up to $15,000 every year to any other person (or 15k to a lot of different people) without having to worry about gift tax at all. That means a married couple could give another married couple $60,000 each year. 

If you make a gift over the $15,000 limit, you have to file a gift tax return. That does not mean you owe gift tax. It takes away from the total amount you can give away during your life, your ""Federal Estate Tax Exemption,"" which currently stands at around 11 million dollars per person. What does this mean? Most people will never have to worry about the gift tax unless it gets drastically lowered or they have to worry about their state gift tax (which for some states is significantly lower). 

2) If my Estate is taxed, how much tax will I pay? 

For state, it varies, and I won't get into that. For federal: 

TAXABLE ESTATE	(Amount over the exemption amount of 11M per person)

For the amount over the first $11,180,000 of the Estate Tax exemption, 

$0 – $10,000	18%

$10,001 – $20,000	20%

$20,001 – $40,000	22%

$40,001 – $60,000	24%

$60,001 – $80,000	26%

$80,001 – $100,000	28%

$100,001 – $150,000	30%

$150,001 – $250,000	32%

$250,001 – $500,000	34%

$500,001 – $750,000	37%

$750,001 – $1,000,000	39%

$1,000,001 +	40%

https://www.chernoffdiamond.com/services/private-client-executive-life-insurance/private-client-resources/federal-estate-and-gift-tax-tables/

3) What is ""Stepped-Up Basis""? 

Stepped up basis is a wonderful thing. I can best explain it with an example. 

Your dad buys a share of Facebook for $1 a share. $1 is his basis in the stock. 40 years later, he sells that stock for $11. You dad owes taxes on $10 of gain. If you dad instead decided to gift you that stock, and then you sold it, your basis would still be $1, so you still owe taxes on $10 of gain. In the last example, your dad decides to leave you this stock upon his death. When he dies and you inherit, you receive stepped up basis, which means your basis isn't $1, but is the value of the stock at death, or $11. Therefore, if you sell the stock at $11, you have no gain to be taxed. 

This works for all kinds of property. 

Here are some common mistakes people make that screw them out of stepped-up basis: 

- They give their property to their kids before they die instead of just using a Will, Living Trust, or other Estate Planning Document. 

- They put their kids names on the house while they are still alive (same issue as above). 

- They sell all of their property before death and make cash gifts to their children instead of letting the property pass to the kids upon their death and their kids selling the property. 

I am sure that I messed some things up in the above via a typo or something else. If I did, please let me know and I will correct. I hope you all have a fantastic Thursday.",finance
personalfinance,Drowning in Debt,"I'm sure there has been a lot of posts like this but it's more to vent then anything else. I'm at my whits end with my student loans and have lost hope as to what to do.

I have been faithfully paying my student loan debt for two years now and have had to go into a income driven repayment plan for the bulk of it. Over these two years I've paid Navient over $8k and have so far managed to have my loan debt increase by $27k, meaning bigger payments that I can't afford all while I just keep getting more and more debt. What the hell do they expect me to do??

Just in case you were wondering I currently work a full time job at $19/hr and have even been using spare time to try and make some money with handcrafts in Etsy and find a better paying job. I live in Helena MT in a trailer park with a soon to be $305 lot rent, $125 utility bill, $65 internet bill, $341 car payment an unemployed wife and they expect me to pay just shy of $600 a month all while increasing my dept forever....

I just have no idea what to do...

To answer questions in comments:

Let me preface this information with the fact that I know that to get to this point mistakes were made and some of it was bad advice and direction and other parts were my own bad decisions. I don't need to be told that I shouldn't have done A or B, I already understand that completely. I'm just looking for a way out.

I currently owe $130,279.10 in Student Loans:

$62,625.48 \- Federal Unsubsidized 6&amp;#37; interest

$8,656.32 \- Federal Subsidized 6&amp;#37; interest

$13,546.46 \- Signature Student 7.875&amp;#37; interest

My wife is looking for work and has been unsuccessful in finding any, is why she is unemployed.

The degree I got was a BA in History and yes I know, I don't need to be told the uselessness of that degree nor did I TRY to get that degree. I fell into that degree because at one point I was so in debt I decided to get out of college the fastest I could and that happened to be the degree I was the closest to achieving. Again I know what a bad decision is and I don't need to be reminded.

I'm 30 by the way and am not looking to waste the decades of good health i get working 3 jobs, and I get that this may seem unreasonable but working 40 hours a week full time plus the 20 or so hours I try to make money on the side is plenty.

I'm sorry if I sound angry or unreasonable but I do appreciate the advice and help it's just a frustrating situation I wish I never got myself into.

Sorry if this doesn't flow well I never post on reddit but here's another edit:

Thank you everyone for your advice. I'm going to keep at it, hopefully some good things start to happen. I recently had an interview for a better paying job in Bozeman which will give my wife some better opportunities.

I will start looking into some non profit work for the loan forgiveness option and see what that all takes and into maybe some more lucrative side work.

This may seem silly but the side work I just recently started is actually woodcarving which I then try to sell on Etsy. I know that it's not the best option for money making but I chose it because I really enjoy it and I've been trying to reduce stress.

It's difficult because at the same time I want to pay this debt off quickly before it becomes too much I also don't want to make my life miserable because life is too short and for all I know I don't have long left. Might sound dramatic but it's all too true.

Thanks again for the advice!",finance
Bitcoin,Island of Mauritius Bank Governor against Bitcoin- speech transcript,"Extract below is from this link:

https://www.bom.mu/media/speeches/inaugural-ceremony-opening-bank-mauritius-museum-address-mr-rameswurlall-basant-roi-gcsk-governor

It is from a speech the Governor of the Bank of Mauritius (Mauritius Central Bank)

......

“In the online Wild West where the sheriffs are mostly absent, there has been a wild rush of noise in respect of cryptocurrencies, a form of virtual currencies that goes unregulated. And, lately, a few curveballs have been thrown at the Bank of Mauritius in respect of cryptocurrencies. There is a tendency to over-react to illusory attractions and under-react to realities. It’s an equal opportunity disease. Following the release of Panama Papers through wikileaks, bitcoins evangelists have mushroomed. Cryptocurrencies are found to be attractive to those seeking anonymity. It means what it means. This is rightly an occasion for me to clear the cloud surrounding the Bank of Mauritius stand with regard to cryptocurrencies. But before I proceed any further, let me stress that the Bank does endorse and has already envisaged to go for blockchain technology in some specific areas of its operations. But with regard to bitcoins and altcoins in the manner they are being currently issued, there is a very big question mark in the central banking community.
Those of us who are conversant with the evolution of capitalism as an economic system and with the monetary history of the world must be aware that there always have been anarchists aggressively seeking to undermine the sovereignty of the state. Why governments should impose taxes? Why should we pay taxes? Why governments, through central banks, should be the sole issuer of banknotes and coins? And why not the private sector be allowed to issue them? These are examples of questions that are often asked by anarchists even today. The politics of bitcoin reflects this attitude, to some extent.
Much of the economic and political thought on which bitcoin is based stems from ideas that travel all the way from the Chicago School economics of Milton Friedman to the Federal Reserve System conspiracy theorists. Bitcoin enthusiasts may not be subscribing to these theories. It just happens that the assumptions and concepts stem from the very far right. In bitcoin literature as much as in central bank conspiracy writings, the Fed is said to hide “its real purpose; that it steals money from some private citizens and put it in the hands of the ‘elites’ that control the Fed; that the Fed itself is covertly run by a shadowy group of elites, often made up of Jews and members of the English banking families such as the Rothschilds”. They also put forward more subtle arguments ‘that inflation and deflation are caused by monetary policy rather than by more conventional aspects of economies like commodity and assets prices, productivity and other aspects of labour and so on.’
Whilst the argument that cryptocurrencies eliminate fees, charges and other cost of intermediation is no doubt valid, the argument that they are a very convenient means of laundering money is equally valid. Some observers say bitcoins and altcoins are not currencies but commodities that are being traded like any other commodity on the exchanges. They are currently serving as speculative investment instruments playing almost no role as a means of payment. In terms of economic significance, they are said to have minor importance. Some others say it’s just a scam. It does not physically exist. It is invisible. But a golden coin on posters is used for purposes of advertisement. It is also said that the word ‘mining’ in the digital creation of the bitcoin and altcoins is used to give the impression that it’s gold that is being mined. Still some others argue that it’s a convenient means to avoid income tax and VAT payments.
Central bankers have been seeing this game differently from afar since 2009. What is money? What’s the definition of money? How broad is the definition of money? If cryptocurrencies are money, anything else can, of course, be construed as money. Take for example the banknotes and coins in your wallet. They are an asset owned and held by you. The same banknotes and coins appear on the liabilities side of the balance sheet of the legally constituted issuing authority which is the Bank of Mauritius. It necessarily means that the Bank has an obligation of the stated amount vis-à-vis you, and is accountable to you. At any point in time, anyone of you can examine the balance sheet of the Bank of Mauritius to see the quality and the value of assets held against the currency in your wallets. In the case of cryptocurrencies, the question of liabilities does not arise at all. They are your assets if you acquire them but they are liabilities of nobody in this world. Nobody has an obligation to the holders of cryptocurrencies in the manner a central bank does have for the currency it has issued. I do not wish to burden the audience this afternoon with technicalities and arguments that might sound academic to disbelievers but which are indeed of fundamental importance to central bankers having financial stability as one of its mandates.
Reportedly, there are more than 1,300 cryptocurrencies registered on different exchanges worldwide. It necessarily goes to say that there are more cryptocurrencies than national currencies. How do we recognize them and who is who in this vast jungle? And how do we effectively regulate them? Since 2011, there have been at least three dozen heists of cryptocurrency exchanges. Nearly one million bitcoins equivalent to over US$4 billion at current prices have been found missing between October, 2011 and April, 2017. Legions of investors and speculators have been left holding their bags empty; they are at the mercy of the exchanges for any possible compensation. Would you as a money-lender accept cryptocurrencies as collaterals? Does it augur well for financial stability? Anyone of us sufficiently conversant with digital technology, must be aware that clever algorithms churn through a massive history of everyone’s behaviour in the internet to predict your own behaviour. And those who have a compulsive gambling behaviour needs to bear in mind that cryptocurrency exchanges are not manned by professors of ethics and morality.
May I however seize this opportunity to state that in discussions about cryptocurrencies one crucial aspect in the digital evolution of the means of payments and settlements is often overlooked: a vast majority of money in a modern economy is already electronic money. In Mauritius, nearly Rs3 trillion of transactions are settled electronically on an annual basis. This figure represents 6 times the GDP of Mauritius implying that our payments and settlements by electronic means are quite intensive and are ever growing. We expect the value of transactions settled electronically to shoot up with the introduction our National Payment Switch.
Honourable Prime Minister, Ladies and gentlemen, I have to reassure you that the Bank is very digital minded. The Bank was one of the first, along with South Africa, in sub-Saharan Africa to go for real time electronic payments and settlements in 2000. The Mauritius Credit Information Bureau established in 2005, the first electronic platform for sharing borrowers’ information established in sub-Saharan Africa has been ranked first by the World Bank doing business indicator for several years in succession. All returns from our regulatees are electronically submitted and automatically processed as from this year. The National Payment Switch which will be launched next year will become a pillar of the Mauritian digital economy. This will bring about a kind of revolutionary change in the Mauritian economy that many of us still fail to take cognizance of. It will be a giant leap forward for the Mauritian economy. This is a Bank that performs noiselessly and without chest-beating – in the quietness of an insulated and well-guarded building. The Bank does realize that at the centre of every significant change taking place in our lives today, there is indeed some technology of some sort involved. Every kind of thing that is made is becoming something else. We do realize that nothing is done yet. Nothing is finished for good. And all is flux – constant flux, meaning that this never-ending change is the pivotal axis around which the modern world rotates.
Central bankers in general have thoughtfully taken a few steps back from the cryptocurrencies debates in the past several years. Increasingly more and more researched and in-depth studies conducted by responsible organisations are being published on the subject. Digital currencies like bitcoins and altcoins are being viewed by central bankers as having the potential to make future financial crises even more devastating. There is now a slowly emerging acceptance that if digital currencies have to be issued, central banks should necessarily be the issuer. But it’s also being recognized that the risks associated with digital currencies are far from minimal. In a world characterised by a dense traffic of post-truths and fake news, policy makers need to consult research studies produced by responsible organisations. Truths are turning out to be underpowered antibiotics. “

The first company is Chase Auto. Their interest rate could be as low as 5.39% at 60 mos, saving me as much as $226 total. 

The second is Clearlane, Powered by Ally. Their interest rate could be as low as 3.47% at 60 mos, saving me as much as $703 total.

The third is Innovative Funding Services. Their interest rate could be as low as 3.24%, saving me as much as $759 total.

personalfinance,Rent versus buy,"I know that renting versus buying has been covered ad nauseum here and other places (yes, I know about the NYT calculator). I’m hoping for advice in our specific situation, which is that we are currently renting a house that we love, that is in a great location with reliable landlords and low rent--but I also feel like we should be buying a house.

We live in Columbus, Ohio, where the real estate market is going nuts (as it seems to be everywhere with a functioning economy). From what I’ve read and heard, you pretty much have to bid on a house within days or even hours of it going on the market to stand a chance of getting it. This doesn’t seem like a real estate bubble but the beginning of a long-term trend. I also know that interest rates are expected to rise later this year. 

So here we are in this wonderful house. My husband and I have lived here since 2010 and the landlord has only raised the rent once, from $1000 a month to $1050 a month. We should probably be paying $1500 a month on it given its location and general awesomeness. It is well-maintained, has central air and all the other amenities, has an awesome view and is right by a park. The neighbors are quiet, neighborhood is super-safe, the landlord is friendly, it is situated between our jobs so that we both have a very short commute, etc. etc. Seriously, I would not mind living in this house for the rest of my life. 

I also only currently pay less than 15 percent of my net salary towards housing, which is amazing for socking away money.

However, lately I’ve found myself wanting to do things like a more extensive garden, adding a fence, making other changes that you really need to own your own home to do. When I started reading up on home buying in Columbus I was shocked at how nuts it’s gotten in the last few years. People I know who have bought places have paid well over market value, written letters to the sellers, placed bids within moments of walking through a place. In general, I am NOT good at spur of the moment decisions, especially something as enormous as buying a house. 

Also, my guess is that wherever we move would be a definite step down in some element of our housing, be it location, yard size or the condition of the house. Neither of us are fixer upper types at all. 

I am worried, however, at what happens 15 years down the road when our landlords don’t want to landlord anymore, or decide they want this house for their kids, or whatever. I’m guessing that if current trends continue we will be totally priced out of anything in central Columbus or desirable suburbs. As an extreme outdoorsy introvert it’s especially important to me to have some sort of private yard, however, small, and I don’t particularly want to move back into an apartment at that point. (Also, after decades of living in noisy, crummy apartment buildings I am now totally spoiled by living in a single-family home.)

Possibly relevant details: we are both 42. I have a credit score of 809 and no debt but a small car payment. Husband has significant credit card debt. I make about $55K, husband makes about $60K, not much chance of drastic salary increases. We plan to stay in Columbus for the rest of our lives. He has ZERO interest in moving. And the thought of packing up all our crap and hastily moving to a place is also unappealing to me. I’m worried about what the future holds, though.


What say you, Reddit? Should we pull out all the stops to buy a house while it’s still affordable? Am I being overly fatalistic that it will NOT be affordable in the future?",finance

personalfinance,Looking for advice on maintaining a good credit score,"I'm a young person with new credit. I opened my first credit card last year. I've had student loans for three, but I'm still in school so I haven't begun paying on those yet. I've been doing good with my credit cards, but I've had two payments that I forgot about. Right now I'm in the mid 600s, but my goal for the end of the year is to be in the 700s. I have two active credit cards right now that I use consistently. I needed a new computer so I financed it with the Best Buy visa card. I have a year to pay it back with no interest, and I've already calculated how much I'll need to pay it off by September so that I won't have to pay the back interest. My other card is the student Discover card, and the interest rate is decent. I use it occasionally, and try and pay on it in smaller amounts two to three times a month so I can have multiple payments on my score. I always pay more than the minimum if I am able to afford it. 

The dip in my credit score came from a card that I totally forgot I opened. Rookie mistake that I hope I won't fucking make again. I missed one month so it wasn't too bad on my score. I was convinced to open the card for a promo with a store that I frequently shopped. I thought that I would use the card more frequently with this store, but I don't. This is my third credit card that I've opened, and I don't want to open any more. It's completely paid off and I've been given conflicting advice. Some tell me to go ahead and cancel it since I am not planning on using it anymore. I don't even keep the card in my wallet; it just stays at home. Should I cancel it? I know having long term credit is good, but I don't really want to keep a card that won't have any transactions on it. The interest rate is too high, and I have two other credit cards that I prefer to use if I need to. What would be the best thing to do to help my credit score?  Should I just go ahead an close it while it's only a few months old? I don't want to take a bigger hit to my credit score right now because I may be moving soon and I don't want to be set back even further if it hits my credit score enough that it will take longer to recover. I'm also concerned with my score taking a bigger hit the older the card gets.

No one ever really taught me how credit works. From what I've learned myself, having different types of credit is good. Once I get my shit paid off, I'm thinking of getting a small 1\-1.5K loan through my credit union. I have a decent bit in assets that my credit union would probably approve me immediately. I just am wanting to buy a new car in the next 3\-5 years, and there's the possibility of buying a house. I just don't want to fuck myself later down the line because I was stupid and fucked around with my credit. 

What are some of your suggestions to keep my score up and improving? Right now I have $150/500 limit used on my discover card. The minimum payment is $27, but I've been paying $25.00 twice a month \(before the due date\). I have about $600ish/$1k limit on my best buy, so i'll need to pay about $130 a month to have it paid off in time. I prefer splitting up the payments \(I get paid biweekly anyway so it helps me stay on track\) in half. I feel like this is a good track to stay on, but any advice would be appreciated and helpful!",finance

personalfinance,Boyfriend has a huge loan payment and can't save any money for our future,"My boyfriend and I have recently started talking about marriage and I can't help but be a little concerned about his (soon to be our, I suppose) student debt. He unfortunately made a few bad decisions and has over $100k in private student loans...I'm not sure how much exactly, nor what his interest rates are, because talking about it makes him feel ashamed and he keeps insisting that he doesn't want me to worry about it. But I am worried. I'm worried that he'll never be able to save for our future i.e. a house and kids. He makes more than I do (about $40k) but has such a large loan payment that he isn't able to save any money and lives, more or less, paycheck to paycheck. I know that it's around $500/mo but he recently got a letter from his bank saying it would go up to around $600/mo, which is more than what we each pay in rent.

Does anyone have any suggestions for what we could do to reduce his payments? Would this be something we could refinance? What is the likelihood he'll be approved with such a significant difference between his income and debt?

Additionally...how might I go about making him feel more comfortable talking about money? I love him and I hate to see him uncomfortable/embarrassed but this is important.

personalfinance,Father deceased mother wants me to take over vehicle/loan,"So starting off I've been through some rough financial trouble but I've started to get out from under debt and have started an emergency fund.  Admittedly this has only been started in the past few months and is a modest/slow start but a start. 

My father recently passed away and didn't have a will estate and any property or assets and very little money in a bank account. 

My mother and he had purchased a vehicle and have been paying on it just over two years now. 

I still have to get particulars on remaining term interest rate and monthly payment but I believe they have 3 years left at like 250 or so a month.  It's a 2011 or 2012 Toyota pickup and mileage and condition are good. 

Right now my fiance and I own one vehicle outright and it's in good shape no issues or concerns there.  The beater I had been driving died about 6 months ago and cost of repairs versus how much I'd use it didn't make sense. I live close to work and she works from home so she drives me or I walk. 

My mother and father were both co-signers on the loan. 

My concerns are the cost of the vehicle and fact it builds no credit for me if I'm not mistaken. It would still be her loan I'd be paying and then at end of term I assume she'd be able to transfer it to me. Not sure on how all that works. 

I have been on a policy with my fiance because occasionally I drive the family vehicle. My mother has never driven and I believe at this point is only on the policy she and my father had as non-driver because she is on the loan. 

She and I don't reside in the same residence. From what I have been told/understand from a friend who is an insurance agent and insurance policy would be needed under myself and my wife to be as drivers with her still as a non-driver and collision liability etc have to be on the vehicle

In terms of the insurance cost and monthly cost of the vehicle the cost is definitely within our budget.

Anyone have any suggestions or thoughts or gone through similar and seen or sees a potential pitfall in doing this?  My biggest concern would be if my mother were to pass before the loan was fully paid off and vehicle in my name already since as I understand it at that point there'd be possible issues with who gets ownership etc. 

Never dealt with a lot of this stuff and I'm quite unsure how the situation with one party being deceased and the possibility another could be deceased prior to it being paid off play in.",finance

Hi Reddit!

I'm no politician, just a concerned single mom and small business owner with  a decade of experience improving federal programs and saving the government money.

Our current congressman, Andy Harris (R), prioritizes the wants of his wealthy donors over the needs of his constituents. In addition, he has done morally reprehensible things like [take NRA money](https://www.delmarvanow.com/story/news/2018/03/02/nra-money-only-andy-harris-gets-maryland-congressional-delegation/388357002/), [support conversion therapy](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/readersrespond/bs-ed-rr-conversion-therapy-letter-20180403-story.html), endorsed/fundraised for Roy Moore, and most recently was one of the 11 Republicans who [called for the prosecution of Trump's political enemies.](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/4/18/17252290/desantis-letter-prosecute-clinton-comey)

A few years ago, my mother had several debilitating strokes and I was laid off. So, I started a business – assisting Veteran-Owned Small Businesses with bidding on federal contracts and advising DoD on streamlining development programs – to have flexibility to balance working, raising a family and being a caregiver. When I got separated from my son's dad, protections under the ACA allowed me to purchase private health insurance – and keep my business. Years before, I was priced out or denied altogether due to gender rate hikes and pregnancy complications. I was concerned about my ability to purchase health insurance after the election, and went to see my Congressman. I asked if he'd vote against legislation allowing gender rate hikes. 

He said, ""I don't think most people would mind if women paid a little more for health insurance."" 

I'm a businesswoman and federal acquisition expert with a background in federal program management and public policy, but I'm also middle-class working single parent to a public-school student, woman, millennial, prior caregiver, and former spouse of an enlisted combat veteran/stepmother to a special needs child. I understand what good government looks like AND why we need it. 

Congress lacks diversity - in race, age, gender, religion, ethnicity, disability status, and more - but especially socio-economic diversity. I'm sick of Representatives who are so privileged that they are completely insulated from the impacts of their own policies. Those who live our problems are the most motivated and the best equipped to FIX our problems - it's much different to experience an issue than to study one. It's time our government start looking a lot more like those of us it represents.

Looking forward to your questions!

personalfinance,Need to break lease,"Okay, so I was trying to move to Denver with my significant other from a great distance away (east coastish; not wholly important).  Anyway, I signed a lease as the primary leaser (leasee, lease-holder? Idk wtf), and now things between her and I aren’t exactly working out.  This isn’t /r/relationships, so I’ll keep thing sweet, simple, and economical.  

Basically, I’m trying not to get all parties involved effed in the AY should things permanently go sour between my girl and I.  The lease agreement states that a lease break is twice the rent, which frankly is more than her and I can stand to pay given our individual financial predicaments (I know; “why the fuck are you moving cross-country then?” Just give us some credit).  She seems like the person who’d split things in half, so we’d be good overall if we could both pay one month’s rent each, but in any case I was wondering about possibly negotiating with the company to lower the lease break fee seeing as how we haven’t even moved in yet and there’s a month to spare.

personalfinance,Refinancing federal student loan to private w/ 2.4% lower interest?,"So first republic's student loan refinance program looks very appealing right now. My current consolidated federal student loan with Navient has about 10 years left ($67k @5.75% w/ auto pay). This works to a $758/mo payment... but with first republic they quoted me a 10 year loan @ 3.35% fixed... which would basically save me $100/mo. 

There's some small hoops to jump through. Mostly involving opening up a checking account with them, setting up autopay, and direct deposit... which actually would work out well for me. I currently have a schwab checking account as my primary and a chase account for brick and mortar banking services. I just realized that there's a first republic location about 3 blocks away from my apartment, so this could help simplify my checking accounts since I only really use Schwab for the free ATM withdrawals and it seems like first republic has the same benefit. 

My income is at a level where I no longer qualify for any forgiviness programs... and if i ever find my self in a desperate financial situation (shouldn't with a fully funded emergency fund) i have easy access to tons of decent paying freelance opportunities.

personalfinance,Just got my first line of credit. Was told to keep around 30% of the max as a balance.,"Yeah so I got my first secured credit card today. $250 at 24% interest. I was told by the man at the bank to pay it off every month. Some co-workers say the opposite that I need to have around 30% or $75 balance on the card for the time being that I use it. I disagreed and said why would I do that if I'm going to incure interest ($18)

They said that since the credit bureau is only looking for a balance less than 30% that if I pay it all off every month that they won't see it. That it would just have a zero balance and that doesn't show them that I can balance the money ect. 

Is this true? Seems like a rigged system if so lol. Does this also apply to major credit cards and loans? Should I search around for a lower interest rate and cancel this card? I have never financed anything and my end goal ATM is to buy a car roughly $20,000 in about a year or so.",finance

personalfinance,Raiding retirement funds to pay off student loans?,"Me: 32, single. I rent, live under my means, and do pretty well for myself financially. Quick snapshot:

**Income:** $160k, likely to see substantial bumps over the next few years (I wouldn't be surprised if I turn 35 making $200k based on current trajectory).

**Student loans:** $92k, from a graduation balance of $145k. Weighted average interest rate of 6.75%. I still have 15 years of payments left on these, and the payment sizes are graduated and will approximately double over the next 10 years.

**Retirement savings:** $170k, about evenly split between a 401k and IRA.

**Credit score:** 710

**Other debt:** none, other than a credit card that I pay off the full balance of each month.

I've always planned on taking the slow road to paying off my student loans, but I just realized that if I raided my retirement accounts, I'd end up with just enough after taxes and penalties to fully pay off my student loans. In a straight dollars-and-cents calculation, this is not a good idea, I know this. I'd pay about $60k in interest over the life of my loans, and a bit over $80k in taxes and penalties here, plus any lost income on gains from the retirement savings. But:

1. My parents are cosigners on these loans, and they are having financial burdens that are complicated by the outstanding student debt.
2. My interest rates are very high.
3. These are mostly private loans, because I made some terrible decisions as an 18 year old with poor financial literacy.
4. This would actually increase my ability to contribute to retirement funds. It'd also help me build up a bigger nest egg/emergency fund than I've allowed myself to do currently, since I'm allocating extra funds to payments.
5. I have two strong personal incentives to get them paid off quickly, even if there is some cost to it:
    - There's a good chance I join an existing family (with kids) in the next year or two, where the burden of the loans would be factored into all the joint financial decisions. I don't want that to happen.
    - My current career in tech is good and I'm doing well for myself, but I would like to some day move to a field that I personally find more meaningful. I feel tethered to my current career path by these loans, and it would be a massive personal burden lifted if I had more options and wasn't always a slave to money.
6. I don't think it's likely that I ever retire. I'd be miserable. Of course it's likely that I take lower-paying jobs and retirement income would help with that, but I'm not feeling pressure to fund a 5-year sailing trip around the world.
7. I am currently largely allocated in stocks, as is prudent for someone my age, but plan to slowly move to more stable and lower-yield investments in my retirement accounts
8. I have a hereditary disease that will shorten my life expectancy, possibly by as much as 10-15 years. 

I...actually think that the logic here is pointing me toward paying off my loans. Am I on the right track? Are there better frameworks for evaluating this potential decision?

($500k for jointly) For simplicity, let's say I purchased the apartment for $150k and by year 3, it will sell for 350k (Based on this year's closing prices) and let's say my fiance also has an apartment that's paid off with the same terms.

**First Question**

So in three years, we will have roughly $700k coming in from the sale minus any sale transaction fees. Is this money better spent paying back the $500k mortgage on our house at 4% or would it better to invest this into the stock market or real estate investment property? We have no other debt.

**Second Question**

If it would be better to pay back the $500k mortgage at 4%, would it be better to get a 7/1 ARM at 3.5% or the 10/1 ARM at 3.75% instead of the 30 year fixed at 4% for the $500k mortgage?

I itemize each year on my tax return as I'm paying NYC tax so the interest payments will help each year.

The rental income for each apartment is around $1,650-$1,750 per month and maintenance/expense/utilities run about $700 per month. Net around $950-$1050 per month. (less other misc expenses)

I'd appreciate any advice you could give me. Thank you!

personalfinance,W4 allowances..Help!,"I am a 32 year old single male (getting married in December)..since I started my career I have never claimed anyone or any allowances on my w4. 

I get roughly $6,000 back every year in federal tax returns when I was making about $90,000 

This year I got a real nice raise and I will be making approx. $120,000 before taxes. 

My totals this year up until this last pay period (April 28) are as follows:

$42,947 - Total gross ytd
$7,692 - Total fed tax withheld ytd

By the end of the year I will be paying approx. $23,000 in federal taxes

For he next few pay periods (bi weekly), I'd like to keep as much as possible back on my paycheck.

Example : this last pay period I grossed $5,400 and paid $1,600 in taxes (depressing lol) with only $966 of that being federal.

What allowance should I deduct on my works adp w4 to get back as much as possible on the next couple of checks? I tried the irs calculator and it told me 36 allowances which doesn't seem right.

I changed it to 4 a little while ago and if my calculations are right, I'll be receiving an additional $350 approximately..can I do more allowances safely for the next couple checks without having to owe at the EOY?",finance
personalfinance,Things that keep me up at night: when to put my two weeks in?,"This might be overly long winded so I apologize in advance. And also I hope this is the right subreddit for my questions!

I work in a restaurant/bar and will be moving an hour south (to Denver) here within the next week or so. I’ve been going to job interviews but haven’t quite found the job I want. I have a pretty promising job interview tomorrow that I’m very excited for. 

I feel as if I’m somewhat important in my role at this bar, as one of four bartenders, and by far the strongest server. We’re already struggling by being short staffed (I’ve commented on this to my boss pretty much daily for the past two-ish months) and am worried about the state in which I will be leaving them. It’s really not worth it to me to drive the hour, or more in traffic, so I feel as if I should put in my two weeks here very soon, since my move is coming up. 

So.. I have a few questions.
1. Tomorrow (Friday) I am the closing server but that doesn’t necessarily mean I will be there after all of the  customers are gone. Should I give my notice (verbally as well as written) when I start my shift or should I wait until my shift is over and try to make sure we’re slow enough if I don’t stay until patrons are gone?

2. I’m going on a vacation that has been planned for two months on Friday the 18th. Meaning I won’t be working my shift. Which also means my two week notice will actually be a 13 day notice. It will be Friday May 4th, 2018 to my last working day Thursday May 17th, 2018. Is this okay?

3. If it is, how do I word this in my letter? Just simply say “this is my notice of resignation. My last day will be Thursday May 17th?” But you know.. a little more fancy. If it isn’t, do I need to wait until I come back from my vacation to put in my two weeks and just suck it up that I’ll be driving longer than I’d like for a couple weeks?

4. Lastly, am I thinking too much into this? I know it’s just a bar job but I don’t want to leave on bad terms. My boss always says he hopes I never leave and how much he appreciates me and that I’m a valuable employee to him but when I first started almost two years ago I told him this was our plan, to move to Denver and eventually a small mountain town (polar opposites I know but my boyfriend owns a house in Denver as of right now).

If you made it this far, thank you and any help/advice will be well received! Thank you!!",finance

As borrowings have grown, so has the risk. For high-grade companies in 2017, debt outstanding relative to an earnings measure was at its highest level since at least 2010, according to a report from Morgan Stanley.

Global Ratings estimated in February that there were more companies globally carrying debt loads in excess of five times a measure of earnings than in 2007, on the eve of the financial crisis.

Now the Federal Reserve is raising rates and scaling back its balance sheet, which lifts companies’ borrowing costs and makes it harder for highly levered companies to access markets.

I haven’t charged anything in YEARS and I'm still paying **$550\+ a month** and I'm tired of it. I would like to either withdraw from my 401k or take out a personal loan.

***\(I am currently trying to refinance my students loan, by July. I’m not sure if getting a personal loan will hurt or help me.\)***

**401K ROUTE:** I know that withdrawing from my 401k is a bad idea and that I need to save for retirement. However, I need to get rid of my CC debt. To lessen the tax load, I would like to withdraw about $2k\-$5k a year, and pay off one card each year.

**PERSONAL LOAN ROUTE:** I am open to getting a personal loan to pay off my CC debt, if the interest rate is low, and payments are lower than what I pay now.

**Here’s my financial picture:**

28 yrs, no kids, not married but have a boyfriend, who I do not live with. Credit Score is maybe 650? \(No missed payments or negative remark, just high CC balance &amp;#37;\)

**Income/Assets:**

* $44,880/year
* Income after tax, insurance, and 401k: **$631.80 a week.**
* **Savings:** $350 \(had a lot more but just paid income taxes and car taxes\)

**401k:**

$2,344.93 \(increases every week\). \(Only giving $17.18 a week, and company matches. At this time, I cannot afford to give more and take full advantage of my company match. Hope to do so in the future.\)

**Cash Spending:**

* **Rent &amp; Utilities:** every single thing housing related is **under $700/month**. This includes rent, water, internet, gas and power. Sometimes it's only $680/ month. This amount will decrease when I move in with my boyfriend, in June
* **Budget:** $10/day for eating out, $18/week for gas, and $30/week for Groceries \(I usually don’t spend all of this.\) Misc. expenses come from what is rolled over from the week, after bills. I usually have about $50\-$100 extra each week. Some goes into savings or additional CC payments

**Debt:**

* **Car:** $217/month, Balance $11,171.50, 6.95&amp;#37; \(I know, horrible rate. Will be paid off in 5 years.\)
* **Sallie Mae Student Loans:** $1,000/month for 2 loans:  $70,509.15 &amp; $21,623.94 @8.875&amp;#37;. Loan term is only 12 years and they are currently deferred until July. I need to refinance! I cannot afford these payments. Need it cut in half at least and/or loan term doubled!\)
* **Navient Student Loans:** $48/month, Balance $3,664.22, 9.35&amp;#37;

personalfinance,Avalanche VS Snowball VS Another Repayment,"Hey everyone! 

I have been paying off my student loans since I graduated last year. I started with $62,000 of debt, and I am proud to say that I just made my last private loan payment. I only have federal loans left to the tune of ~$31,000. I have been attacking these with a great deal of my income (working 2 full-time jobs). With my federal loans, these are the following loans:

fed h
$3,424.01 at 4.29%

fed d
$2,300.05 at 3.86%

fed g
$563.24 at 4.29%

fed i
$7,770.00 at 3.76%

fed loan a
$3,514.73 at 3.40%

fed e
$3,552.91 at 4.66%

fed c
$4,532.09 at 3.86%

fed b
$2,346.77 at 6.80%

fed f
$3,311.69 at 4.66%

I have read about the avalanche and snowball methods, and obviously I want to save the most money, so I am paying off fed b with the 6.8% interest rate first. My confusion begins after that is paid off. Although there are higher interest rates than fed i ($7,770 at 3.76%), am I not paying more in interest for that particular loan? When I see the accrued interest on the site, that loan always has the highest interest, obviously. Although it is not the highest interest rate, should I pay SOME of that principal balance down to a lower level (~2,000-3,000) before I pay off the higher interest loans with a lower balance? I hope that makes sense! I could not find an answer to my question on the internet, but that is probably because I was having a hard time figuring the wording to ask the question.

personalfinance,"$75,000 combined income with $65,000 in student loan debt please help","I think we have a pretty common story but thanks in advance for reading. My wife and I are 26. I am finishing up graduate school. I just got a full time job that pays $32,000 and she has a job paying $43,000. I will be able to apply to better paying jobs (45,000 to 60,000) after I finish my thesis. We have 5 student loans (3 private and 2 Federal) they range from 3% to 7.74% we have been paying the minimum on all of them except the highest interest rate one we put an extra $200 a month. I read a book by Dave Ramsey on debt and he said to get the momentum going start tackling the lowest amount loan first. We have about $16,000 saved which I know is a higher emergency fund than needed. But we are about to buy a used car for around $7,000 so that we don’t have to make monthly payments on our car lease. I am wondering how much money should we be dedicating to our student loans and how much should we start putting into savings/retirement account. We currently pay about $700 a month in student loans. We budget about $1,250 in rent, $130 in utilities, $400 in groceries, $300 for everything else. We also have an Acorns account that puts about $50 a month into the stock market.. The rest has been going into savings. This was when we were making far less (around $55,000) Now that we are making more what makes the best financial sense in terms of student loan repayment and saving for future expenses like a house and retirement?


Edit: sorry new to reddit. My wife is eligible for employer match retirement account in about a month or two. We do spend a lot on groceries but we are usually under budget because we meal prep and plan out for each week and use the extra for eating out. Also I agree Dave doesn’t seem to understand science. We are uncomfortable with a low emergency fund and would like to save for at least 3 months of expenses. I am finishing up my thesis and then will be applying to new jobs and my area is social science with an emphasis on research design and statistics. Also we got out of our lease without having to pay anything it was a full buyback which was awesome (went on the last day of the month).

Edit: Just so happens that the highest loan rate is also the lowest loan amount around $5,600 left",finance

Just started looking into a home equity *loan* and realized the market for *loans* not *HELOCs* has somewhat evaporated.  So I guess I need advice on where to look since it's almost impossible to search for.  A lot of these companies conceal that they're HELOCs until you are halfway into their application process or they pretend as if they don't know the difference on the phone.  It's all very shady honestly.

So I got more blunt and direct and honestly most lenders don't even offer them anymore.  And you can't really specify your desire for a medium term interest rate lock.

Fico 740+
120K in home equity + ~50K liquid

* Looking to access ~55K (I think the general LTV limit is 49.5K, which is fine)
* Medium term fixed (balloon) or long term fixed rate

NOT interested in a HELOC unless they can lock for between 4-5 years.  Longer is preferred (8-10 years).

I have no idea how to search for this at this point outside of shotgunning apps at this point.  So I guess I'm looking for a referral!",finance

Unfortunately, I'm not in a position that makes this seem even remotely possible. Once you are in, there is no easy way of getting out.

Currently my housing and living expenses are being paid for with student loans. I have no idea what I would do for a job. Moreover, any job with a reasonable pay would not be enough to make monthly payments, even if I had zero living expenses; making it through and becoming a doctor would making paying back those loans doable. Barring some miracle, I don't know that I can remove myself from medical school, even though I feel that it is necessary for my well being.

personalfinance,Reasonable budget for tracking towards fiRE?,"31 y/o female, veteran before this, I grew up suuuuuper poor and now that I have a decent job and enough money to enjoy life, I'd like to start tracking towards fire. I don't want to be a nurse for the rest of my days or be a relic in the hospital 30 years later, I'd like to retire around the age of 45-50 years old. I know that starting early is key, but my land buying is sort of making me hiccup on that. 

There are some nuances here that I will explain and I am always willing to add more info, but in general I own my car, have zero debts from school or otherwise, and here is my current budget: 

I make 2 paychecks a month. Each paycheck is ~$1,200 a month. 

I let taxes take out the maximum they can and get tax returns at the end of the year because I hate being surprised by owing any taxes, I'd rather file for refunds. Anyways, I also take out 15% of each paycheck into our hospital's Vanguard retirement 403B. This will soon be potentially changing (as we are going from non-profit to for-profit) but for now this is what it is. This is my only current contributions towards retirement.  

- I Save 1 paycheck for the full amount every month. ~13k saved a year. 

- I live off of the other paycheck. Rent is cheap where I live, I live a frugal lifestyle and have really great resources nearby that allow me to save money while living a fairly comfortable lifestyle, including the VA for my healthcare. There aren't too many corners that can be cut here, though I am always striving to do so. I finance a kid my parents care for, but even with him and his needs I live off of $1,200 a month. If my paycheck is slightly less here or there (maybe I worked less weekend days or something, or called in sick and didn't get my differentials), I pick up a shift to make up the difference vs dipping into my savings. 

- If any emergencies come up or if I have a vacation or major thing I want to pay for, I have an emergency fund (3 months worth of income) and replenish it (or just save up in advance) with extra shifts I will pick up. This is really easy for me to do, as in the 3 years I've been working here it has never NOT been short-staffed somewhere. 

Currently, I have about $37k in savings. I haven't pulled the ""invest all the things!"" trigger yet because I'm in the process of buying land in Texas and I might end up needing every bit of that savings for the downpayment. I do need a small plot of land, and it isn't an option for me to not buy it, as my disabled parents need a place to live as well and this is the best option for us. I haven't quite begun all of the process of it all, but since I work in another state and just go down to Texas frequently, I cannot buy it as my 'primary residence' and thus get it for 0% down, so I need the whole 20%, and thus, everything is hanging in limbo until I have exact numbers for money. 

Eventually, we'll be renting one part of the property to help pay it off faster, and this will replenish my savings, but this is not a guaranteed thing nor has it started, so I really cannot factor it in. 

So, while I have a decent savings, I may soon potentially have near none for a short while. It will only take me a couple more years to rebuild what I have now again.

personalfinance,Using 401k for housing loan(please read first),"So as I understand it for our 401k program we can take up to half the account as a loan to cover part or all of a down payment. The loan has an interest rate which varies, but my understanding is (and this may be typical I dont know) that the interest owed on the load is applied back into the loan balance essentially paying myself the interest. In this case  would it be worth it to use my 401k for up to half my down payment to cross the PMI requirement?

Here's a few extra details that might be prudent.

Between my wife and I we have 4 pensions. 2 major, 2 minor and the only reason I even have the 401k is that my temporary workplace for the next half a year more or so puts 9$ an hour into it that I lose if I don't have one, so the 401k isn't really a major retirement source for us.",finance
personalfinance,Partial loan forgiveness in 5 years - best payment strategy?,"Hi all. I'm trying to wrap my brain around how I should be paying my student loans down considering I will hopefully get them partially forgiven a few years from now. 

I have about $22,000 in unsubsidized federal loans between 5.3-6.8%. I will hopefully eligible to have up to $17,500 forgiven after five years if I can succesfully apply for [Teacher Loan Forgiveness](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/teacher#eligibility). 

My loan servicer (Great Lakes) has a default 10 year calculation of 120 payments of $235. If my math is right, that means that around my 60th payment I will become eligible for the program with a loan balance of around $13,000, which suggests to me I won't be taking full advantage of the opportunity. One alternative is the ""graduated"" plan: 24 payments at $158, the next 24 payments at $193, then $236, $288, $352. My math adds that up to being around $15,000 around the 60th payment. My servicer's website suggests I cannot take advantage of an extended repayment plan with under $30,000 in debt. 

A potential downside of this may be paying taxes on the forgiven amount - but I presume that would still be more financially wise than paying not taking advantage of it, right? 

Edit/PS: I will likely pay additional tuition for an advanced degree down the line, but was hoping to avoid debt and pay out-of-pocket when the time comes. But if there is some strategy that will help me take better advantage of ""free"" money (perhaps by taking a small loan to move my loans back into an enrolled grace period then I would consider it.

Is the ""graduated"" plan my best option? Are their other options to maximize my savings? Thanks.",finance
personalfinance,Forced to get a second mortgage on my first home due to my Mom's 140k in credit card debt. What options do I have for combining the two mortgages?,"So I need some serious financial advice on pretty short notice.

To start:
My Income: $69000
Moms Income: $53000 

Bought a house in November 2015 with my mother as co-signer. The house was purchased for 525,000$ @ 2.49% interest with a 5% down payment of 25,000$ and a monthly payment of $2600 + $400 for the bills . We had an initial agreement that she would pay 1000$ towards the mortgage each month as I was starting at a new job and just getting my footing, I couldn't afford to pay the full mortgage at the time so we agreed that by the end of the first term I would take over the entire mortgage and all of the bills in November 2020. Unfortunately this didn't go as planned. Last year around April she begins to tell me that she can't afford her end of the mortgage anymore for whatever reason and she wouldn't tell me why....it took me a week of constant prying for her to finally tell me that she had around 7-8 credit cards totaling a whopping 140,000$ in debt and that she couldn't afford to pay her minimum payments anymore on top of the 1000$ she was supposed to pay on the mortgage. This left us with two options.... debt consolidation or bankruptcy. We opted for debt consolidation as bankruptcy would mean losing the house so we ended up with a nice fat 156,000$ interest-only second mortgage with a 12.99% interest rate, $1688 monthly payment, and an annual renewal fee of 9800$. She agreed to take care of this so I thought we were fine. At this time the house was appraised at 780,000$ 

For whatever reason my mom failed to tell me about this renewal fee that the mortgage company had informed her of months earlier and now we are pretty much 1 month away from the renewal date and i've only just been shown the paper last weekend. 

Now i'm trying to fix this situation by avoiding the renewal fee all together and combining the two mortgages into one at a higher interest rate. The problem is the house has now been appraised at 705,000$ and we will need a mortgage of 637,000$ to be able to combine the two existing mortgages into one.

Essentially this means we are above the maximum LTV ratio when trying to refinance the mortgage (MAX is 85%)

In numbers:

$705,000 x 85% = $599250

$156,000 (2nd mortgage) + $481,000 = $637,000

$637,000 divided by $705,000 = 90%

$637,000 - $599,250 = $37,750

So basically I need to find a way to obtain $37,750 in the next month or i'm forced to pay an insane renewal fee along with interest-only payments for at least another year. I guess it's worth mentioning that i'm having little to no luck with trying to find somewhere to give me this loan even at insane interest rates, seems to be impossible but i'd hate for that to be the case.

How do I get out of this? I dont want to sell whatsoever but I am open to any advice.

Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks",finance

personalfinance,Need advice on consolidating debt/garnishment,"Edit::I am open to lifehacks for reducing expenses, could always use more knowledge in that area. BUT I am really wondering what I should focus on as far as recovering my credit as quickly as possible WHILE I pay off the amount being garnished and my other debts.  I really don’t know much at all beyond the basics of how credit works. I am open to book advice as well as that really is how I learn best. Cheers. 

So I posted earlier about considering bankruptcy and it was partially a cop out, not to mention I actually am over the income threshold. 

I make 50k base and with yearly bonuses probably between 55-60. This is an extremely recent development as I was making 8.00 an hour five years ago and have been able to get a few dollars raise every 8 months to where I am at now. 

About 8 months ago my car went out completely and I have made the poor decision to not do something about it since then and have been using Uber. 

I am hopefully getting a free car from a family member that will work for the next year or two and hope to get by on liability insurance. 

I have also been eating out too much as not having a vehicle I often need food when I can get it. Also a cop out. 

Right now I have two garnishments going for a total of about 20k. 

I also have about 8k of collections. And credit score of about 560.  Various derogatory marks and will be a long road to recovering this. 

My check every two weeks is about 1100 after medical and garnishment etc. no savings

What I really am trying to figure out is how best to get out of debt as soon as possible. 

From reading a ton of posts on here it seems like a lot of people flex their money to a lower interest cc or a personal loan to make repayment easier. 

I don’t think the companies that have the garnishments in place will let me get the amount reduced or set up a payment plan to stop the garnishment. But I don’t know. 

What options do I have? I am going to reduce my expenses as much as possible and will not be using Uber or eating out. What if anything can I do to reduce the garnishment amount or improve my credit in the meantime just to even lower interest rates or be more financially flexible while going through this?",finance

personalfinance,Random payment from insurance company for $869. What do I do?,"Ok so a bit of backstory.

I’m a student currently on exchange in Australia. In September I broke my collarbone pretty badly and needed surgery. Thankfully I was covered under an insurance company through my university. 

So two weeks after the break I get the surgery and insurance covers it. It was a nightmare coordinating between the hospital and insurance company, but I did it. 

So after the surgery I go to the insurance company with a $550 bill for the emergency room visit. They say they will reimburse me but two weeks later I get an email saying that it’s not the right receipt. I gave them the ‘interim’ receipt and not the official one. So I go back to the hospital to get the ‘official’ receipt and after another two weeks they give it to me. So finally I go back to the insurance company and give them the ‘official’ receipt. About another 2 weeks after that I receive the payment. 

Then I got a bill in the mail from the hospital for the x-rays they took on the initial visit for $150. I pay it, and two weeks later I receive the receipt in the mail.

Meanwhile, it’s been about two months since my surgery so I have a follow-up appointment. Sure enough, I have to pay $300 out of pocket just to be seen by a specialist for 30 seconds.

So i take the receipt for the x-rays and the follow up appointment to the insurance company. Sure enough, two weeks later they email me sayin I need the “official” receipts. 

So at this point I was pretty fed up with running back and forth from the hospital and insurance company. I had landed a pretty good job that was paying $700 a week, and my shoulder was completely healed to the point where I good bench press as much as I could before the injury. So I decided ‘fuck it’. Skipped the rest of my follow up appointments and just took the $450 as a loss.

So fast forward to May. Out of nowhere I receive a payment of $869.00 from the insurance company. My initial thought was “oh they finally paid me”. But this is almost double what I ever made a claim for. 

So now I’m kind of unsure about what to do. Obviously I’m not going to spend it, but I’m leaving the country in a month. So what should I do?",finance

personalfinance,$780 late filing penalty for my LLC,"Posted this in r/tax, but figured I'd post here too.

-------

In September, my wife and I did some contract consulting work for a former employer. To protect ourselves, we set up an LLC. On September 26, we were paid with a check made out to us personally (not to the LLC) for $20,000.    

I met with my accountant in January and paid all of my estimated taxes (with a huge overpayment because it was unclear if some of my income would be w2 or 1099; ended up being w2). The money was cleared from my account on January 10th.    

In March, my former employer said I needed to provide them an EIN number so they could send the appropriate tax forms for my LLC payment. I went online, created an EIN and sent it to them.    

In April, my accountant completed my taxes and I signed and they were submitted on 4/14. I received my refunds from both state and federal taxes. Since I don't plan on doing additional consulting work, and the cost of maintaining an LLC in MA is the same as creating a new one, I had my accountant file the paperwork to close my LLC at the same time.

Yesterday, I received a notice saying my LLC didn't file on time and I would be charged a penalty of $780. ~~There is no breakdown of the penalty~~ (there is a breakdown: $195 per person per month late, but that's all it says). I called, but the IRS is closed until Monday. I also emailed my accountant, but they're closed until Monday as well

What did I do wrong here? Is it because I only paid my estimated quarterly taxes but didn't actually file the forms before 1/15? Did my accountant not file on time? Did my employer do something wrong? Or did my accountant not actually submit it on time?

Or is it just a mistake? Either way what is my recourse here? I made sure to pay all of my taxes, and then some, on time to avoid this. Does the IRS waive penalities in these cases if I can prove that I paid all of my taxes on time, even if I didn't file the correct paperwork?

Any help or advice is appreciated! It was our first time using this accountant, so I would like to have as much info as possible before I meet with them on Monday.

Thanks in advance!

Edit: the back of one page says ""The penalty is $195 for each person who was a partner at any time during the year for each month of the tax year, for each month or part of the month that the return was late"".

So I guess I was supposed to file a return in January and not just pay? Or does the IRS not realize that I paid the taxes for the income received on the LLC?",finance

personalfinance,Bi-Annual Diagnosis of My Financial Health - any advice?,"Hi PF! 


Every 6 months or so, I do an in-depth evaluation of my financial status (e.g spending, investments, etc.) and try to set goals for the future. I really love this group and resulting insight, and and I would appreciate any helpful advice, comments, and/or follow-up questions about my financial status (e.g. what am I doing right/what am I doing wrong?).


My status:

Employment - currently getting PhD in Quantitative Biology field (~ halfway through). I make 30,000 a year with health insurance fully covered. My goal is not to stay in academia, but to focus on federal research science positions or a data science-related field (all my work is currently for, with, and by the federal government - and it has a lot of the tenets of the data science field). I'm happy to discuss my career goals more in depth if more info is requested.


Retirement - This will be the first year I will ever max out my Roth IRA (was one of my previous goals, I'm really excited!). Going into this year, the balance was ~ 6,000. It's currently invested in Vanguard's Total Stock Market Index Fund. Once I reach the 10,000 limit and those are converted to Admiral Shares, I'm hoping to start contributing funds to a Small Cap Growth fund and/or and International Fund (not sure which one yet). Any advice on funds (are these the right ones? are there better ones?) would be greatly appreciated.


Personal Status - I'm 27, married, and live comfortably in a LCOL area. My spouse makes ~60,000 a year (with benefits), has ~5,000 in car debt


Savings -

Emergency Savings Fund (~5,000 - 3 months of normal spending, 5ish months of lean spending).

Car Fund: ~1,000

House fund (co-owned with my wife): ~30,000. We saved diligently and paid for most of our wedding ourselves (and did it on a budget), and are using the money we got from generous family members and friends to save for down payment for a house.

*I'm not currently diverting any money from my salary to these accounts, but I'll touch on this in my goals section below.


Debts -

None. I had a full ride to undergrad for tuition (worked part-time and had help from family to cover living expenses). My tuition/fees have been covered for both of my graduates degrees. I currently own my vehicle, but it's pretty old (2000 model) but not too many miles (&lt;150000). I just need it to make it through graduate school (I put ~ 5,000 miles on it a year), but it is a likely future debt near or shortly after the end of my PhD.


Expenses-

Monthly. We do our finances mostly separate (but we record it all in a shared spreadsheet maintained by my spouse). Joint expenses are put on a credit card and paid 60/40 (I pay 40). Rent is split 50/50, and personal expenses are personal expenses.


Joint - This is total for both of us, to clarify, I pay 40% of everything except rent. 
Rent: $850 (I pay $425)

Bills: ~$250 per month (gas, electric, water/sewage, trash, wifi, netflix)

Car insurance: $175

Groceries/Home Improvement: ~$400-500

Entertainment: ~$400-500


Personal-

Retirement Contributions: ~450 per month

Gas: ~$30-40 

Haircut: $30

New Clothing: This varies, but usually somewhere around $50-100
.
Hanging out with friends w/o SO: My friends outside the shared friends I have without my spouse are grad students, so pretty cheap! Maybe $50 per month? 

*Usually my expenses are a bit under my salary. I typically let that money just sit in my checking account for months I spend a bit more (unexpected and expected spending, e.g. holiday travels, car maintenance/registration). It all ends up evening out in the end.


Goals for the next year -

1) I'm happy with my current Emergency Savings Fund, but I'd like to get it higher by the time I graduate (2-3 years from now) as I might be out of work for a bit (but could get supplemental income a variety of ways, never too proud to work any job - trust me, I've done it all before, e.g. washing dishes, sweeping shit, waiting tables, carrying luggage, will gladly do it all again) but would have a lot of potential moving expenses. I don't see this as a realistic goal though, I stopped contributing to this fund once it got to 5,000 to maximize my IRA contributions. I really want to make sure my IRA is maxed out, it's a tough balance. Is 5,000 enough or am I right to be nervous?

2) My SO wants to travel more (and not crashing at relatives/friends houses which is mostly what we do now, use credit card points to buy airfare to cities we want to visit folks). I think it's realistic I could put 50-100 away per month for this. But not more. ALL of my/our expenses are put on travel credit cards (which get fully paid each month), this usually affords few free plane tickets each year.

3) I don't think I can contribute monthly to our House fund, but I would like to develop and implement an investment strategy for the 30,000 we do have. It's currently just sitting in a high-interest savings account (1.5%). My goal would be to set 5,000 away in this cash account. 15,000 to be invested conservatively, and 10,000 to be invested aggressively. I've also considered all 30,000, but depositing the dividends/interest into a money market fund as cash (so some if it is liquidated over time). My target growth rate would be around 5%. Beyond that, I haven't done enough work/research into the actual details of how I would invest this money (e.g. specific funds). I'm nervous with how high the market currently is. I'm hoping to have a full plan fleshed out soon, so that when there is a downturn, I'm ready to invest. We will not be buying a house for at least 5 years. Any thoughts, suggestions, or comments would be greatly appreciated for this goal! I could really use the help in developing a sound investment strategy.

4) I think we spend way too much money on Entertainment/Bars/Restaurants. We have a very vibrant social life, but a shared expense of 400-500 each month for me just seems ridiculously high. A lot of our shared friends make similar incomes to my SO, and they like to go out a lot. My goal is to say No more often to invites out to restaurants/bars, and Yes more to invites to activities at people's house (and hosting more things at our house, e.g. instead of going to happy hour at a bar, making margaritas on my back porch). I think it's a tough balance to enjoying life and friends to also cutting costs. I'd like to get this in the 200-300 range per month if possible. 

5) My SO's car debt. She makes regular payments on this and it should be paid off in 1-2 years I think (interest rate is about 3.5% I think). But it seems the better return in the long run is to help her pay it off quicker (50-100 per month), so she can be putting more money into her retirement and non-retirement investments. What do you all think? 


I really do appreciate your willingness to read this long post and to provide your insight. Anything you would like to provide (whether it answers a specific questions I have or is a broader comment, etc.) would be great.


If I've left anything out, or if I wrote anything in a way which is unclear, please let me know and I'll try to fix it.

Ripple,"Why XRP is Legally NOT a Security (Long Post, TL;DR at bottom)","Hey all

Just got back from a camping trip and I'm hearing all this noise and worry over XRP being labeled a security. Frankly, I can't believe anyone would even think up of some nonsense like this so let me clarify why XRP cannot be branded as a security for any reason:

**THE HOWEY TEST** https://consumer.findlaw.com/securities-law/what-is-the-howey-test.html

I see a lot of BS arguments linking back to this. The above link provides you proper context

""The ""Howey Test"" is a test created by the Supreme Court for determining whether certain transactions qualify as ""investment contracts."" If so, then under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, those transactions are considered securities and therefore subject to certain disclosure and registration requirements.""

And it breaks down like this:

**1) It is an investment of money/assets**

**2) There is an expectation of profits from the investment**

**3) The investment of money/assets is in a common enterprise**

**4) Any profit comes from the efforts of a promoter or third party**

Let's start by breaking this down point by point.

1) **Ripple specifically states that XRP is not meant to be used as an investment vehicle**. The courts do not care if YOU feel it's an investment or if that's what YOU think you're doing, they care if it is being sold, branded, and understood by institutional players as such. And as we know from Ripple.com as well as the news we've seen this year, XRP is currently IN USE by institutions for its intended purpose(s) and not as a form of investment in Ripple.

2) **Not a single soul has promised that XRP will go up in value while you hold it or even at all.** Yes, we all understand that to do what it wants to at the end of the day it should, but that by no means guarantees a profit to anyone for anything in any way. If you buy a videogame and hold onto it for a couple decades, its value is almost BOUND to go up, especially if it's from a 1st party developer, that by no means defines those games as securities because they have uses and are not tied in value to their parent company.

3) There is no common enterprise. **""Most federal courts define a common enterprise as one that is horizontal, meaning that investors pool their money or assets together to invest in a project.""** &lt;-- I would LOVE to see someone argue that buying XRP off of an exchange is somehow funding Ripple. This is not an ICO, Ripple makes money by selling off their own software to other companies just like Apple, Microsoft, etc. They do not make money from people buying XRP as a concept and more people holding XRP does not somehow amount to Ripple gaining more money. EDIT - They sell it on exchanges as well, and but not all of the xrp on exchanges belong to them by any means and so buying XRP on exchanges would STILL not automatically affect Ripple's balance sheet like it would if buying XRP was truly meant to serve a common enterprise.

4) **""The final factor of the Howey Test concerns whether any profit that comes from the investment is largely or wholly outside of the investor's control. If so, then the investment might be a security. If, however, the investor's own actions largely dictate whether an investment will be profitable, then that investment is probably not a security.""** &lt;- As it so happens to be, the price of XRP is entirely determined by the people buying and selling it. Ripple does not determine the price of XRP and is in fact under myriad self-imposed contracts so that they have a maximum point of sales SO AS NOT TO AFFECT THE PRICE. We also know that this market is ENTIRELY manipulated by the ""investors"" much to the chagrin of most institutions, this is such a prominent problem that the words ""...but what about the volatility..."" make all of us collectively bite our lips so as not to smack the nearest CNBC pundit.

And beyond the above points the following is also true:

A) **XRP's ledger was invented before Ripple Labs/Ripple came into existence. Ripple cannot be the issuing party.**

B) **Ripple's stash of XRP was legally gifted to them by the inventors of its ledger**, and so any sales of XRP are not only perfectly legal, but because of its original gift status, it can't be considered as an intrinsic part of the company itself and its wellbeing is completely up to adopters and people who use it.

C) It can be USED. It is a TOOL. The fact of the matter is, securities only have value in that they can be spent as value. **The whole reason securities are regulated differently is because they rely on a promise of value attachment. You can't do anything with stocks except hold them, trade them, and sell them. XRP has proven use cases from MULTIPLE institutions leading all the way up to Central Banks around the world.**

D) **XRP functions completely and totally independent of Ripple.** Yes, Ripple has chosen to up its adoption and build enterprise software around it, but that doesn't mean that the XRP Ledger wouldn't work on its own. In fact it has been just fine for almost 6 years and is the most liquid decentralized exchange on the planet. No joke.

and 

**E) You receive no special rights from buying XRP. You do not own a part of Ripple. Period.**

And even after all of this. Let's not forget, they have **Benjamin Lawsky** on their board of directors and they have an entire wing of their own company dedicated to compliance. I sincerely doubt the originator of the US's first real crypto legislation is going to let the SEC stay uninformed enough to brand it a security. **Also considering they have members of their team advising the Fed for the Faster Payments Task Force, Ryan Zagone confronting Parliaments/Governments/Institutions globally as Director of Regulatory Relations as well as Chris Larsen being on the board with IMF,** I SINCERELY doubt that anyone in government responsible for these calls is still in the dark. Ripple has also made a sincere effort in making sure people understand that XRP is not a security and they TEND to get their agenda across.

https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/12/ripple-says-its-cryptocurrency-xrp-is-not-a-security.html

***TL;DR:***

When you buy XRP, you're buying software. No one promised you profits, Ripple even says it isn't for investing purposes, you have no shares in any company, Ripple cannot do anything to affect the price directly, and you have many ways to use it that are currently functional and demonstrated by institutions. They also have the best guy possible for legal and regulatory clout, so I SINCERELY doubt that anyone responsible and objective should think that XRP is a security.

personalfinance,Student loans / Retirement Account / New Car,"Hello everyone,

I'm in my mid twenties and I've been struggling with what I should do now that I have a decent paying job. I don't want to disclose my income but it's right around where you'd expect an entry level engineer to be. 

1. I have about $20k in student debt running at about a 4% interest rate. 

2. I just started working and have saved nothing for retirement and I do not have a 401k match.

3. My vehicle is old and getting to the point that I need a new one. In other words, the total cost of ownership is greater than that of a newer car/different car (depreciation/maintenance/insurance/fuel). If I buy a newer car, I should save between $500-$1,000 a year. Assuming no accidents that cause a major drop in its value.


I had a few plans drawn out for what to do.

1. Dump $5,500 into a Roth IRA and make monthly payments on a car and my student loans. Paying the minimum on what has the lowest interest rate and the max I can afford for whatever has the highest interest rate.

2. Tackle my loans as fast as I can. Whatever is left goes to retirement. Hope my car can last another year, and doesn't blow up on me. Forget about retirement accounts until my student loans are gone.

In all these scenarios I keep about 6 months of living expenses saved up. So I'm covered in that regard. 

What do you think I should do?",finance

personalfinance,"Finally done with medical training, now budgeting for my first job","Hello folks. I've been doing a lot of reading lately, but this is my first time posting.

Brief life story: I graduated medical school with an average amount of debt, have now finished training, and will soon be starting my first job with good pay. I'm 31 and single.

Loans: I qualify for the PSLF program and have made 4 of 10 years worth of payments. Since my new employer also qualifies for this program, I'm planning to ride it out for the next 6 years making the minimal eligible payments ($900/month now, about $1900 when I recertify next year) until I hit the forgiveness threshold.

Retirement: I'll be taking the full pre-tax retirement matching offered by my employer, as I've been doing. I was planning to supplement this with an IRA. I don't qualify for a Roth, and traditional IRA doesn't give me any tax benefit, so I was planning to do a one-time annual deposit of $5500 into a traditional IRA, then convert it to a Roth 30 days later. Does this make sense? Would I be better served to just dump this into my 403(b) instead? Or is the recommendation to contribute the maximum amount through the backdoor Roth, and only afterwards throw more into the 403(b)?

Investments: I plan to use Betterment for my investment savings. I'll have an emergency fund (40/60 stocks/bonds split, with any gains moved to other investment accounts), and a long term wealth-building portfolio (~80/20 stocks/bonds split), in addition to the previously mentioned IRA. Short-term savings for more immediate purchases will be stored in a Discover savings account (which has a better interest rate than my bank).

Does this seem like a sensible plan? I've not really been a position to plan for my retirement apart from automatic employer matching until now, so this is new territory for me.",finance

Affording the car is not an issue, I only want to be debt free quicker. I am looking at trading in for a 2013-14 Honda Accord, but am having difficulty deciding on what the more financially responsible move is.

Edmunds 5 year TCO for the Audi is 58K
Edmunds 5 year TCO for the Honda is 32K

I owe 23k on the Audi, and I have been offered 21k for it from a dealer which I believe I can negotiate up to 22k

My monthly payment is 450$, but I have been paying off 800$ a month. My interest rate is 5%

After putting 450$/mo into retirement, I have 3600$/mo left
I have 38k in retirement and 5k in a day trading account
I have no other debts

I know why it is terrible to trade in a car upside down.
In this scenario, is it better for me to trade it in now, wait a few months until I'm even, or not worth trading in at all and keeping? I would not get a Honda for more than 15k, putting me at 16k owed on a 13k car after leaving the dealer if I were to do the trade now (I don't intend on bringing a downpayment).
Thanks for your input in advance!

personalfinance,What to do about my PMI,"I’m relatively new to PF and Reddit in general and I am in the process of reviewing my spending from the last couple years. So far I’ve found some spending habits that I need to improve (mainly my restaurant and booze habit). I’m working on optimizing my debt payments which brings me to my current situation. 

Car—I owe 12.5K @ 2.79%, currently making payments @ $372.62 + $200 principal payment. 

Mortgage—I owe 352K @ 3.99%, principle and interest is $1,698.74, total payment is $2,018.25 with taxes and PMI plus $266 that I pay for HOA. On top of this I make a $200 principle only payment. My LTV is about 84.8%, I am just under $20K from being under 80% and being able to cancel PMI payment of $148.00/month. 

I’ve settled on a monthly $500 principle payment to my mortgage and removing the principle payment from my car loan. I have been building my emergency fund and I am at roughly 6 months of expenses. I contribute a variable amount per month to my emergency fund (generally $1000-$1200). My employment seems relatively secure but I am in a commission-based sales role and my income is variable, I would say it can fluctuate about 20% (or more) year to year. 

I need help calculating the “effective” interest rate of my mortgage with PMI included OR the ROI of paying it off early. I can reallocate the money I am contributing to my emergency fund to pay down my mortgage and remove PMI if it makes sense. Here are a few scenarios (probably deciding between 2 and 3).

1)	Make minimum monthly payments and cancel PMI after 39 months = $5,772 in PMI payments 
2)	Make $500 additional payments (current plan) and cancel PMI after 20 months = $2,960 in PMI payments
3)	Make $1500 in additional payments and cancel PMI in 10 months = $1,480 in PMI payments 
4)	Dump 20K from my emergency fund into my principle and cancel PMI immediately 

If I am making a 20K “investment” that will return $5,772 over 39 months it is a risk-free 8.8% annual return plus I don’t pay the 3.99% on the loan brining the return to 12.79%. On the other hand, I pay about $1200 a month in interest on my mortgage, if I add $148 to that number it comes out to roughly a 4.5% interest rate. 

I do not have a finance/investment background so I have a few questions:

How do I think about my PMI? Is my analysis rife with math and logical errors? What do you think the best strategy is?",finance

The issue is it's through the MN Dept of Revenue now and they won't give anything I pay them to the college until it's all. The college won't take payments and says it has to go through the Dept now.

personalfinance,Time to introduce myself and get your advice (27/HCOL/debt),"Hi everyone, I've been stalking for a while but I figured it was time to say hello *waves* and see what everyone's thoughts are on my situation.

I've broken down the basics below! **My short term goal is to pay off debt fast and efficiently, and long term goal is FIRE.**

So, here are my questions:

**1**: I should be avalanching on the CC, however my loan is on automated payment and it feels scarier to fuck with that. I assume I should call both the CC and the loan and see if I can achieve a lower interest rate on both. Any other suggestions? Should I snowball the loan instead and free up nearly $500/mo?

**2**: I've been eyeballing the Chase Slate balance transfer card - given I have just under $13,000 in total debt, is it worth it? Will my private student loan qualify for transfer as well (it's not technically a student loan)? The internet had no answers on that one.

**3**: I'm finding it overwhelming to build an emergency savings fund in addition to paying off CC aggressively - keeping the savings at $1,000 seems like nothing, but building it right now to 3 months of expenses with all of the debt is giving me the heebie jeebies. Thoughts?

**4**: What are your suggestions for getting started now on FIRE besides paying down all debt? I've talked to a financial advisor, but they were not a fiduciary and are trying to get me to sign an additional long term disability, whole life, and brokerage deal. I'm planning on not doing that until I've made a bigger dent/paid off in full, but I want to start thinking now. I've also read the wiki, but there's so much.

**5**: Any other suggestions you feel comfortable sharing.


**STATS**

* CC score: 658
* CC Debt: $7,400 (down from $11,000 at the beginning of the year)
    * minimum payments $150/mo, but I've been putting in nearly $1,000/mo to get it down
    * interest rate: 11%
    * my limit is $8k, they readjusted it from $12k once I paid off enough
* ""Student Loan"" (read: loan for dev bootcamp, worth it): $5,400
    * minimum payments $480/mo, expected to be paid off in full by 06/03/2019
    * interest rate: 8.5%
    * was $15k, I'll have paid closer to $19k including interest by the end of it *sadface*
    * fun fact: the dev bootcamp was $15k, but resulted in my dream career and a salary bump of $40k
* existing cash (incl. checking + savings): $1,700 (as of today after all regular bills)
* 401K contribution: 5%, $6,000 currently
* Salary: $85,000
* Take-Home/month: $4,800
* Rent: $1,800 (HCOL area) -&gt; locked in till Sept. 2019
* Misc. basic monthly expenses total: $600/mo (estimated groceries, electricity, gas, cable, internet, cat, hulu/spotify, gym, transit pass)
* Other facts: 27 years old, no car, no other debt, kicking bad spending habits as part of new years resolution so I'm better now than I was at the beginning of the year. I've never missed a bill payment, so the shitty score is mostly attributable to CC and Loan debt.

My entire paycheck paycheck I get on the 30th goes towards expenses at the beginning of the month + some from previous paycheck:

personalfinance,I recently graduated college and have gotten a decent amount of money from gifts given to me by family members and friends. Should I put it all to paying the principal on my student loans?,"Here's the situation -

I have credit cards I could use but obviously the interest rate from that is extremely high.  

I've heard about doing things like repeatedly signing up for different credit cards with no interest for 6 months, etc. Is that a good idea and where should I look for that?

Ideally I would like to do something where I can get cash up front, and pay down the 2k I already have on my credit cards, but this is optional.

CryptoCurrency,An incredible comment about bitcoin from a zerohedge reader from May/2017,"http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-05-31/ethereum-forecast-surpass-bitcoin-2018#comment-9633923

""The deflationary aspects of a free market avalanche of investment capital into cryptocurrencies is terrifying, especially for a world that is drowning in debt represented by existing national currencies. 

Here's the frightening scenario : you owe several hundred thousand dollars or yen or euro on your mortgage and other debt. Your employer is pretty hip and they start paying you in this new cryptocurrency because they see the currency rising so they have transferred all the company's cash assets including payroll into a cryptocurrency. They hope the transfer will lead to increased bottom line earnings for the company, since the cryptocurrency keeps rising and that means the company may enjoy a currency arbitrage profit as their former currency not in crypto keeps rising and providing profits. 

For you, the new payments in crypto are great, because by the time you finish paying your bills each month your paycheck has risen in value...so its like getting a bonus with every paycheck ! What's even better, you easily transfer enough cryptocurrency each month into dollars because the mortgage servicer who you sends your mortgage to specified in the mortgage agreement that your payments will be in dollars. So too did the credit card companies. So you translate some of your crypto paycheck into dollars and pay your debt bills. 

Here's where it gets interesting...

The mortgage servicer and the credit card banks receive your dollars as planned. But like you, they are having to start transacting more business in cryptocurrency as the world marches toward the brave new world, and so the dollars they are being paid by you to settle your debts with them are becoming less and less powerful in terms of how much cryptocurrency those dollars can buy. In real buying power terms, the banks you owe money to start losing buying power when they have to translate dollars they are paid into cryptocurrency, and that is causing the banks to suffer loses to its overall earnings. 

When banks start losing money, they become more cautious and lend less money. There will be the constant losses doe to currency translation from dollars to crypto, along with risk managers in the banks cautioning not to make new loans in crypto because the more the crypto rises in value against existing currencies, the more likely will there be a correction in crypto value that means the crypto collected on the new loans will be worth less than the crypto lent. 

When banks reduce their appetites for making loans, economies slow down and suffer. The gain that indebted consumers made from the cryptocurrency translation resulted in offsetting losses for banks. Since there are a lot fewer banks than borrowers, the gains for each individual borrower are a lot smaller than the huge losses that the banks will take in receiving loan payments in a currency that is in free fall because of the supply-demand equation for the more favored crypto. What you then have is a mortgage crisis like in 2007, magnified several times over. In the mortgage crisis, individuals received small benefits by living in homes without paying mortgages, while banks and holders of mortgage backed security liabilities died a death of a million slashes as they absorbed all of the defaults. This time it will be far far far worse. 

What makes this scenario even more catastrophic is that in order to stay in business, the banks will need massive capital infusions from governments, just like last time. But since governments cannot mine cryptocurrency like they could print currency, whatever infusions of liquidity they make to the banks to save them will simply serve to push the value of cryptocurrencies higher, causing this entire process to multiply to the point of runaway reaction. Cryptocurrency mining procedures are just too small and difficult and time consuming to be useful in a liquidity starved world.

The solution, of course, is to pull the cryptocurrency plug once the problem appears. But as we see time and again in financial crises, by the time the problem appears its way too late to take corrective action that would avert a catastrophe. 

So that's where the world unwittingly is going, and because governments have lost so much trust in their constituencies, and also because they have shown an incredible set of blind eyes to work on fixing problems, this deflationary firestorm will occur and destroy the world's financial system. There is a huge amount of money to be made on all of this, just think about who gets hurt if the major banks really fail and the governments are unable to save them. Bank stocks, industrial stocks, home builders, home furnishers...basically everyone. This is the one scenario in which the stock market could not even be saved by the government printing press...what an interesting idea !

So from an investment standpoint, the growing wave into cryptocurrency will provide the investment opportunity of a lifetime. Its the perfect storm...it combines the seemingly universal dislike of government intervention to prop up highly overvalued stock markets so the rich get richer while the working person cannot get a decent raise, with the also seemingly universal desire to keep the internet free and beyond the clutches of government regulation. It gets rid of these dastardly Central Banks that have done nothing to help anyone but that same wealthy one percent that benefits from zero percent interest rates, and individuals love the perceived strength that a currency freed from government entanglement means to a free world. Everyone sees the nirvana, but hardly anyone understands the devastation that deflation has on a world so over-leveraged on debt. 

Interestingly, the winnings from this deflation have nothing to do with whether you decide to put a few thousand dollars into Bitcoin so you can look cool to your kids and co-workers. No, the profits in this one will be in the old school avenues, assets denominated in the old currencies that crypto is looking to replace. Imagine shorting Goldman's stock and actually seeing it drop and stay down. Or seeing Berkshire Hathaway put that old man who has been a beneficiary of his time sink into oblivion and turn the old wizard into an old fool. 

The most interesting times in the financial world occur when the world moves from one age to another. Think of agrarian to industrial, industrial to government/military, and now government/military to information age. At all of these interfaces, the seams were sharp enough to cause a terrible rip in the fabric of the world economy, and winter came in the form of global depressions to wipe away the old leaves and dead wood. Cryptocurrency will be the death knell of the government/military age, because it takes government out of controlling the money. There will be a new money with millions of new overseers and a free market that replaces the dominance of small cabals of government bureaucrats who dictate the terms of commerce in the world. 

That seam is going to be greater than most in the past, because of the magnitude of what is being replaced and the terribly ripe condition that exists to be replaced. The interface will be epic, the transition states along the way will be horrific. Remember what Brad Pitt cautioned in The Big Short :""...for every one point rise in the unemployment rate, 40,000 people die"". That relationship will rise when this nightmare takes hold.

It’s so interesting how a development led by young people - the advent and expansionary use of cryptocurrency - still will be subject to the old rules of society. The axiom ""may you live in interesting times"" - originally intended to be a cautionary advisory - along with the caution to ""be careful what you wish for as it might come true"" both ring in my ears as I contemplate how cryptocurrency will be the bleach that washes away the excesses of a dying age in favor of the birth of a new one. 

Economic depressions are magnificent social colonics, as they wash away all of the filth that accumulated in the prior age. Every bad thing that you saw on display in the lead  up and psot script of the financial crisis is about to be gutted and burned. Yet the world will enter its new economic age hamstrung by the pains of paying a severe penance for its foolishness of the age it is putting to rest. The best thing about economic depressions is that the greatest transfers of wealth - usually from the haves to the have nots - occur in these times. 

So if you really believe that cryptocurrency is here to stay and the next big thing of the future, then take precautions now and get yourself in position to be one of these beneficiaries of the transferring wealth. Have your plan ready, you will know when its time to execute. Fortunately for the foolishness of the Gods of the old world, they have put up the prices of assets so high that you will have plenty of time to get onboard when the train starts heading down the mountainside.

personalfinance,Married Grad Students: Rent or buy in SW Virginia? Take out student loans or pay for school with savings?,"My husband and I are both 30 and are beginning graduate school in the fall in southwest Virginia. I am beginning a PhD with full funding for the duration (about $25,000/year stipend). He is beginning an MSW program that will cost about $11,000/year for two years and is eligible for subsidized federal student loans to pay for that. He has about $12,000 in federal student loans from undergrad, we have no other debt and excellent credit.

My parents are willing to help us with a down payment on a home and also co-sign on a mortgage since we won't be making enough in the next two years to qualify. Additionally, we have about $28,000 in savings, $12,000 in my IRA account, and my husband has a lucrative summer job lined up where he'll make about $10,000 after taxes.

A livable fixer upper is about $70,000. If we buy we're thinking we'd just live and do minimal and essential repairs in the first two years, and then once my husband has a real job, we'll begin really fixing up the home (we're both into home repair, as is my super-helpful dad). If we rent, we'll try to find something in the $700 range to keep it cheap.

We've lived in this area before, we like it and would be willing to stay long-term if I got a job there, but after the PhD, it's more likely we'll move somewhere else so we'll probably be in this area about four years.

Both calculators NYT and Trulia said buying is better, but it's hard to get it all to factor in.

Our income will be super low for the next two years, but with my parents covering most or all of the down payment, we'd still have our savings. We can and do live really cheaply so living on $25,000 feels austere but doable, and barring emergencies, we hope to not dip into our savings.

Another, related question is whether to use some (or all) of our savings to pay for my husband's school, rather than take out loans. And if we do that, what impact should that have on our decision to rent or buy?

Any advice will be greatly appreciated! What other factors should we be considering?",finance

&amp;nbsp;

I only discovered the official concept of FIRE a couple of months ago, and since then I've done some work on my budget and retirement accounts.  For a variety of reasons I would like to retire in 5-7 years.

&amp;nbsp;

**Here's some information on my net worth at the moment.**

&amp;nbsp;

* 220,000 in JP Morgan 2030 IRA (Currently at a 60/40 mix of stocks/bonds)
* 120,000 TD Ameritrade IRA, mix of Large Cap, Mid Cap, Income mutual funds (just started investing in SPTM)
* 50,000 TD Ameritrade Brokerage Account, mix of Dividend Aristocrats and 5-10% in bond fund
* 5,000 401K (contributing employer match of 4%)
* 120,000 online bank savings account (earning 1.5%)
* 75,000 credit union Money Market + Checking
* 125,000 rental property completely paid off (generates about 6,500 per year before taxes)

&amp;nbsp;

**Total:  $710,000**

The only **debt** I have is a small note on my truck, at a 1% interest rate and it will be paid off in 2 years.  I will drive it until it falls apart.

&amp;nbsp;

My **budget** has me spending **$35,000 per year.**  However, I am renting in what I would consider to be a MCOL area.  I don't see myself staying here after I manage to exit the rat race.  I would prefer to buy a modest home in another MCOL or LCOL and use that as a home base for some light travel and other pursuits.  For example, I still enjoy writing code and building systems, I am just burnt out on corporate nonsense.  Most of the time I feel like I'm just digging a hole and then filling it back in like Cool Hand Luke.

&amp;nbsp;

Given this information, what advice or feedback would you give?  Am I too heavy in my cash accounts?  Should I boost my 401K contribution?  Should I consolidate my IRA accounts?  I realize Vanguard investment products are popular (I've been looking at the FIRE blogs) but are higher cost than other products at TD Ameritrade.  I am open to moving IRAs to Vanguard and have started investigating this process.

personalfinance,First Year Engineer - Wanting to buy a new car,"Hi all,

So I've been at my first engineering job out of college for about a year now, however, my spending has been close to non-existent due to me being incredibly frugal. Also, I literally have no friends or family in the Chicago area, so I don't ever go out to bars, buy new clothes, go on vacations, or go to fancy restaurants (I know, a pretty sad and pathetic life).  

With that being said, I'm completely bored out of my mind since I literally don't do anything on the weekends or after work and quite recently, I've been wanting to buy a used 2017 Nissan Maxima (less than 20k miles, average cost ~$25000) to replace my existing 2010 Nissan Sentra (I plan to give the car back to my parents). 

I was hoping that I could get some tips/finance feedback before I make such a large purchase. 

Below are some details regarding my current financial state:
-Salary: $61,000/Year
-Current amount in savings account: $20,000
-Current 401k amount: $5,000 (Recently increased the paycheck deduction amount from 7% to 10%) 
-Monthly deductions (Rent, gas, phone, internet, etc..): $1380
-Student Debt: $9500 (Not to worried about this, I'm making the minimum payments so it'll be paid off in 10 years. Interest rate should be fixed. So, ~$103/mo). 

I'm only 23 years old (male), so I don't think buying a car would be that detrimental to my future finances. I could be horribly wrong though, so that's why I'm seeking some advice on this subreddit. Thanks for reading my post and any comments/opinions are greatly appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,Refinance after paying off 30k on student loans?,"Hello everyone,

I never know how to begin, so I'll just start. I have 59k in student loan debt which was originally 89k at the time of refinancing. My original loans were ridiculous with interest, so I refinanced in 2015 and have been making 1k payments every month at an interest rate of 5.75%. My dad is also paying 200 a month which helps with interest - so I currently have 59k in debt and paying 1200 a month on it. According to calcxml, it will take another 57 payments or 4.8 years to pay off the balance which is very attractive to me. I'll be 27 on May 17.

I have close to 6k in savings and I keep around 500 in my checking account. Credit card currently has 800. I make 43,775 a year.

Expenses include rent which I split, so it's 520. The 1k loan payment I mentioned before. Insurance and internet are 120 and 80 a month, respectively. Remaining expenses include things like gas, food and other miscellaneous things.

Over the past three years my savings have gone from 10k to 6k. My question is whether or not I should refinance my loan to pay less over a longer period of time in an effort to build my savings back up. I figure I can always pay extra on the loan if I have extra money. This will just make it so that I don't have to pay so much every month.",finance

personalfinance,"Help; will be receiving $180,000 - questions on how to allocate it.","Hey everyone, so I would like some advice with what I should do with some money I will be receiving in the upcoming months. Some background:

**Me**: 29 years old. IT Specialist making approx $100, 000 a year. Live in the suburbs. Recently purchased a house for $355,000 and put $255,000 cash down, took a home equity loan for the last $100,000 at an incredibly small interest rate of 2.9&amp;#37;. Typical monthly expenses are $300 in utilities and property taxes are about $9,000 a year. Jobs in the IT industry are not reknown for being stable, if I am ever laid off I am guaranteed 6 months severance as well as buying out all unvested stocks that the company has granted me \(would be approx $50,000\). I have about $20,000 in stocks/ mutual funds and my IRA has been maxed since I was 18 so it sits about $115,000. Currently have about $15,000 in savings. Both cars paid off. No outstanding debt outside of the home equity loan.

**Girlfriend \(soon to be fiancee\):** ER nurse of 10 years, makes approx $70,000. Debating going back to school to get her CNRA. She will be receiving a check for approx $200,000 for a settlement that happened a long time ago. She has over $150,000 in the bank already. In the process of listing her house for sale. Owes about $75,000 on it, worth about $150,000.

**Summary**: So I have been dating my fiancee for a while and the topic of marriage has come up a few times and I finally believe I'm ready to bite the bullet and propose. However, the situation is weird because we both own houses \- mine being the newer/ larger one we've decided that she will list her house in the coming months and she will move into my house. However, the issue is the house currently: we have talked about how we should deal with my house becoming hers and what we have decided is that once she gets her settlement check and sells her house, we will go to the City Hall and put her name on the house mutually and she will write me a check for half of what I paid for the house \(half would be approx $180k after taxes and everything\). We both feel this is the fair thing to do and we both agreed on this. However, what my question is: How should I allocate this money? I belive the most obvious first step is to pay off the house entirely, which will leave me with the extra $80,000. I have maxed my IRA every year and continue to do so. Once I have this money I will do the max of my 401k with work \(currently doing 6&amp;#37; of my paycheck\). I would just hate to leave this sitting in a bank account not making any type of interest. One sidenote: My job/ company has been infamous for layoffs and I'm nervous I could be on the chopping block next year as there are large layoffs every Q1 of the year. I have been with my company for 5 years now and love working here so I hope that does not happen to me. Should this affect what I do? The house is in great/ almost new condition \- the only capital improvement I could see myself doing would be putting a deck on \(approx $15,000\) however, my fiancee already said we would split that cost if we got there.

Also, bear in mind I do plan on spending $15,000 on an engagement ring this summer as well.

Now the question arose differently: Will the unemployment rate decrease so much that the regulator will have to accelerate the rate of tightening to prevent overheating of the economy?

According to the latest data, in April the unemployment rate fell to 3.9% after earlier holding half a year at the level of 4.1%. The last time the indicator reached such minimums in April 2000. The broader unemployment rate, taking into account citizens who have not recently been actively seeking work, or who have been part-time workers, but have been looking for full-time jobs, also fell to the lowest since 7.8%.

On Friday, San Francisco Fed president John Williams said in an interview with CNBC that lowering the unemployment rate is not a cause for concern about the increase in price pressure, as wages show only a very modest increase. ""All this is very similar to the economy of the golden mean,"" he concluded.

Averaged hourly earnings in the private sector increased by 2.6% y/y, and a separate index of wages in the private sector, published a week earlier, reflected March's growth of 2.9% y / y, which was the best result in almost a decade.

However, Williams, who on June 18 will assume the post of president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, believes that the indicators of earnings and prices do not promise any noticeable acceleration of inflation. Meanwhile, his colleague, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas Robert Kaplan, is confident that the absence of any significant acceleration in the growth rate of wages is only a distortion within one month, as other indicators suggest an increase in price pressure. Demand for labor is increasing, and the labor market is becoming more dense, Kaplan believes.

Last year, the representatives of the Central Bank were less concerned about the prospects that unemployment could fall below the level they consider to be supportive in the long term (currently this level is 4.5%), as inflation unexpectedly weakened, remaining below the CBA target of 2%.

Now inflation has become much closer to this desired mark, which can more actively focus the Fed on the growth of wages and lower unemployment. In March, consumer prices excluding food and energy increased by 1.9% y/y against a 1.6% increase in February.

Most representatives of the Fed continue to adhere to the basic belief embodied in the Phillips curve and postulates that a labor market with high demand for labor can provide more active growth of wages and inflation. Some fear that such dependence may be non-linear, because of which inflationary pressures may increase even more after the supply-demand ratio in the labor market oversteps a certain point.

However, there are skeptics who believe that the natural level of unemployment may be lower than the values ​​predicted by the authorities, and therefore, the acceleration of inflation may take more time. Add here and the tax reform, recently adopted by Washington and capable, according to economists, in the next couple of years to significantly accelerate the growth of the economy.

According to Wall Street experts, by the end of this year, the unemployment rate may drop to 3.5%. The Fed's forecast is 3.8%.

Representatives of the Central Bank hope that the growth in demand for labor will help to disperse inflation to the level of 2%, which they consider a healthy level for economic expansion, but they do not want to lose control over price dynamics. Some are worried by the prospect that if the economy gets too high, the Fed will have to raise rates much more aggressively, which can disrupt the economic recovery.

The next meeting of the Central Bank will be held on June 12-13, and before that, the monetary authorities will have time to get acquainted with another report on the labor market, which will be published on June 1. As expected, the Fed will raise rates and update its forecasts for the economy and rates. Most of the markets are interested in how much the regulator will put into the forecasts for this year - three or four.

In March, the Federal Reserve raised the range at rates to 1.5% - 1.75%, and at the last meeting preferred to maintain the status quo.

According to the CME Group, the futures market believes now that the probability of four rate increases this year is almost 40%. Christina Hooper, chief strategist at Invesco, believes that Friday's employment report, along with other incoming data, will prompt the Fed to reflect on the four increases.

Undoubtedly, monetary authorities should be encouraged by the situation in the labor market. In April, the share of working citizens in the age segment from 25 to 54 years was 79.2%, keeping close to the maximum since July 2008 values. For comparison, in November 2010 this indicator was at a minimum of 74.8%. However, it still does not reach the maximum of 80.1% achieved at the peak of the expansion of the 2000s.

Another issue facing the Fed concerns the scope of further rate hikes in the next few years.

Williams on Friday said that in the long term 2.5% mark will correspond to the neutral level of rates, which does not stimulate and does not restrain the growth of the economy. However, he also hinted that at some stage the Fed would need to move to more restrictive policies and raise rates ""just above this long-term neutral level.""

However, Kaplan, in turn, called for being ""very, very cautious"" when reaching neutral rates.",finance

Ripple,Silicon Valley on HBO just talked about the SEC and crypto.,"The exchange that stood out to me was:

SPOILERS BELOW!!!


FYI, in this episode, Richard's company is preparing to do an ICO.

""*Richard*: Who do I hire? Someone that understands securities, right?

*Monica*: Not necessarily, your coin doesn't have to be a security, you could do a utility token instead since you provide an actual unit of compute.  Although you have to convince the SEC....You might not even need to bother with a moving outer-facing strategy when you launch, but you will need to keep a close eye on statements from the federal government, South Korea and China.  So whoever you do hire, should definitely know how to do all that.""

It seems general knowledge of crypto regulations is creeping into mainstream culture.  Also, the show's writers seem confident that securities and utility coins will be deemed two separate entities. Thoughts?

personalfinance,"Those with federal student loans in default, are you aware of federal loan rehabilitation options?","I have three Stafford loans that were in default for over a decade and I buried my head in the sand. After an informative conversation with an agent at one of the collection agencies handling one of my loans, I learned about the federal loan rehabilitation program. 

Basically, the lender submits forms detailing their income and expenses and a reasonable (and in my case, very) monthly payment is proposed. After nine consecutive on-time payments, the loan is ""rehabilitated."" Most penalties, collection fees and accrued interest from the default period are forgiven. 

I went through this with all of my loans and my debt went down by nearly $10k. I couldn't believe it. The only downside is, if you are late or miss a payment, you're disqualified from the program and can't reapply for that particular loan so it behooves you to wait until you know you can commit and follow through.

I lost a lot of sleep over my bad student debts and now it's one less thing I have to worry about!

My other error was leaving out the State Tax information for one job since I never got my W-2 and only had my federal transcript to go by.

personalfinance,Trying to apply for student loans without a cosigner as I have no family or family friends that can be mine. Help!,"Hi guys! I looked through the student loans subreddit and this one but didn't see a post that particularly matched my situation. 

I am 20 years old and about to go back to school as a junior after taking a gap year, so I'm trying to get all of my ducks in a row early. The reason for said gap year was because I couldn't get a loan for school then and I'm afraid I might be hitting the same roadblock this time around. I applied for a loan through Discover a year ago but couldn't get approved without a cosigner due to lack of credit history. So, I said that I would take a gap year and applied for a credit card and have built my credit over the last year and have a relatively good one. 

Fast forward to tonight - I tried going through a different bank, Citizen's Bank (that's who my sister went through for school), but they said that I didn't have enough credit history. I am unsure what step to take next because I do not have anyone close to me that can be my cosigner (parents don't have enough extendable credit, family friends are in the same position) and I do believe that my school is one where you must have the funding upfront for the year rather than pay by semester. I will be calling tomorrow to verify. I also have 5,500 dollars for the year in federal subsidized loans too, so the figure down below is just the remaining amount.

I am nervous to apply for any other loans because I don't want to hurt my credit by applying for a bunch of different ones as I know that's not smart. I'm also confused as to why they aren't approving me even though they can see that I have a credit history and due to my loan amount being less than 16k for the year. Please help! I really want to go back to finish my education. 

If it makes a difference, I will be entering college as a junior and went to community college for two years before that so I paid in full by the semester while I did my A.A.. Thank you in advance!",finance

So for the last two years, I went to college and had most of my tuition and expenses covered by Federal Pell Grant and Federal DL Subsidized.

In return, she claimed me as a dependent. No problem with that.

Is it really unnecessary to not itemized that on her tax return because I'm just a dependent?

personalfinance,"Maxed out on aid, need ~ $12K more from loans for fall","Apologies for the longer post, I've been lurking in this subreddit and similar ones for a few weeks now trying to sort out my options. I am still quite new to loans and a lot of the terminology but am trying to learn, please correct me if anything I say seems off or wrong! 


Background: I am a university student at a 4 year UC in CA who has been financially independent for 3+ years now, and so far my schools offered financial aid package has been able to cover most expenses. My parents have an expected contribution of 0 towards my college expenses, and that will not change, but on the FAFSA due to my age (20) I am still considered a dependent. So far literally everything not covered by financial aid and loans I have paid for myself, from income saved from nonstop part time jobs since 2015, and I have not lived with them since 2016. 


Unfortunately this upcoming fall quarter (sept-dec 2018) my financial need has increased to be about 12k more than in past years, and my financial aid office has informed me that I am currently maxing out all possible aid they offer. Since this $12k increase will only be for the one quarter, I will provide my current *estimated* aid I will be receiving for that same quarter (based off of my current aid, which should not change).


Cal Grant A Fee Award:	$4,210.00					
Federal Pell Grant Program:	$1,974.00			
University Campus Fee Grant:	$190.00			
University Grant:	$912.00	
Federal Direct Subsidized Loan:	$1,167.00		
University Student Loan:	$667.00		
Total:	$9,120.00


**My total cost for the quarter is about $21k.** This makes the current difference in aid $11,880, or $12K. I am currently not offered the Perkins loan since my financial aid package covers costs without it, but I am trying to look into it and hope to be offered it for fall if eligible.. I have also tried looking into the parentPLUS loan, but am certain my parents will be denied - they have no income and live off of social security, they'd never be able to pay it off, and their credit is shot having needing to file for bankruptcy themselves from student loans after becoming disabled. I read somewhere that if they are denied I might be offered more in loans, and they have said that they are willing to give it a shot and apply if it might help me out. if for some reason they ARE approved and I can't get that alternative loan from being denied, I would have to pay off the bill in their name.


I am not sure if the amount of financial aid I am offered would change much once the fall quarter financial aid packages are processed, since I have been told several times I currently max out the aid they offer. I have to assume they won't change so that I have time to get money in order before the Sept 15 billing date. I plan on working as much as I can these next few months to save up what I can, but there is absolutely no way I can save up $12K, after helping my parents pay for some health issues I only have 2K in savings now (previously nearly 5K just a week ago). 


Another option I have been told is that I can frontload my loans for the entire year, to be given to me during fall quarter. This would make my aid from loans currently offered $5.5k, but the other 2 quarters tight for money. Understandably, I would rather not do this if it can be avoided.


I have been trying to do research on loan options for someone in my situation. This loan of $12K would be put towards tuition mostly, but also housing, food, and classroom materials. I have a checking, savings, and credit card with Bank of America but from my research it seems they do not offer personal loans. I have had the credit card for nearly a year now, and my FICO score is 692. For requesting loans of larger amounts with a minimum wage AND part time income I worry it is not high enough to be trusted. Also due to my parent's credit history if I understand correctly they cannot cosign for me, and so I need a loan that will let me borrow without a cosigner. I am not sure where to start looking with other companies, since I do not have a history with any others at the moment. I admit I know very little about this area though, which is why I am here today. I hope you all can help me sort out what my options are with such limited background and history.

If you need more information, please ask, I would be happy to tell especially since this is a throwaway account and it is hard to convey all information needed.

personalfinance,College kid- federal subsidized loan questions,"Hey guys! Thanks for your advice in advanced.
So I'm a college student (in state) at a pretty well known university.
I was lucky enough to be awarded the federal pell grant, and my school supplemented the rest. 
Four years of 15 credit hours a semester, tuition completely covered.
I have to pay for my own textbooks and living expenses obviously, but a part time job usually does the job. I make enough money to get by. Fortunate to have a dad and boyfriend who will pay for all the big/small things that I can't make ends meet for. 

However, I am also looking to 'grow up' pretty fast, and stop relying on daddies money. I plan on getting a new car this year,  possibly moving houses with boyfriend (my name wouldn't be on the lease/mortgage yet, but I would be expected to make a contribution obviously), and living a healthier life style.
I also have trouble keeping jobs. It's not that I get fired, it's that I quit because I usually end up having trouble with a coworker (last manager was personally attacking me), so work is *usually* stable with a job change and week of unemployment every 4-6 months (sad, I know). 

My goal is to have extra money around, not worry about whether I have money to buy that healthy food over the cheap shit, and to be able to put a down payment on a car when the time comes (I feel like that'll be another post lol)

So this leads me to my question: I have already been offered and accepted a federally subsidized loan for 4000 dollars for the fall/spring semester (dad just bought a new house, made it clear he wouldn't be able to help with finances for a while. I'm acting preemptively). I am debating accepting a 2000 fed subsidized loan for the summer, just so I can live comfortably (plan to work a full time job along with 9 credit hours in school), maybe get that new car earlier, etc.

Based on my previous college loans (0) 2018-2019 loans (4000) possible summer loans (2000) what does my future look like? Would it be better for me to say fuck it, and don't take the loans, and live life maybe uncomfortably for a few years, borrowing off from people I care about? (I feel like it'd be better to owe the government than my family and boyfriend). But at least I'd be debt free. 
Or would it be better to suck it up, take the debt, and be smart about paying it off? 

And, how does one be smart about paying off? I believe it's at a rate of 4.45% interest, which only starts collecting after I graduate in 2020 (and I believe I can defer interest collection if I don't have a job that makes enough money after graduation, but not sure?)

Edit: if I take out a loan, and dont use it, can I pay it back immediately, before I even graduate? Would they still somehow collect interest on it? 

Tldr; being a college student currently free of debt and not expecting any at all due to federal grants, what is the smartest way to go about utilizing federally subsidized direct loans in order to make ends meet/live comfortably?",finance
personalfinance,My Wife and I [25+29] are moving to South Korea and beyond,"As the title states, my wife and I are (US citizens) are moving to South Korea to teach English as a foreign language. We presently have a 1 year contract, but if all goes well we will continue to travel and teach around the world, with no concrete plans to return to the United States. The reason I am posting is I am aware our present financial arrangements will not be effective for our upcoming plans and I have no idea what the prudent course of action is moving forward.


For a bit of background: I hold a checking, savings, and credit card account with an interstate bank in our US region, my wife holds a checking and savings account with the same bank, as well as checking savings and credit accounts with a credit union from our hometown. In addition, I hold several RSUs with my employer that will vest before my last day with them, and I have close to 6 figures saved in my retirement plan with the same employer. We had also saved up around 10,000 dollars in expectation of moving expenses that will not be required given the circumstances of our future employment. We hold significant student loans of various interest rates, I have about 20k in federal loans and 7k of private, my wife holds about 30k private and ~50k public, so a large part of our plan involves quickly paying down this balance during our travels. 

So I guess my questions are two-fold. Firstly, what sort of banking services should we seek for international employment? I know my bank charges fees as soon as I stop receiving periodic direct deposits, and this fact (combined with the sheer difficulty of procuring services from an organization whose nearest branch is on another continent) has me thinking there are banks better suited to my needs. Secondly, now that we have a large sum of cash 
and no likely immediate need, should we be thinking about investing that, combined with the proceeds of my stock and my retirement fund, into some sort of long term investment product to start accumulating for our future? We will be keeping some 4-5k in a relatively liquid account as an emergency fund, but barring that we could be looking at ~15k with various types of restrictions on some portions. Is it best to pay off privately held student loans first? Should I slap it in a Vanguard Index fund and forget about it? Something I'm missing entirely? We don't hold significant credit card debt, nor do we have significant assets that we will be liquidating (2 beater cars and some of my surplus collectibles won't likely amount to much more 2.5k).

personalfinance,"To refinance or to not refinance an auto loan, that is the question...","Hi all, I am trying to decide whether or not to refinance my auto loan. I want to pay it off as early as possible while saving as much as possible. I have been looking at various calculators online to determine whether refinancing is a wise decision, but apparently I am not good with calculators :/  I have about $100/month extra that I can put towards the original loan or towards the refinanced monthly payment (plus the difference between current payment and new payment if applicable).

Option 1:
Current auto loan payoff is $26,908.22, monthly payment is $689.56 with 3.99% interest, and I have 42 payments remaining on the 76 month original loan. As noted before, I can pay an additional ~$100/month towards this payment.

Option 2:
Because my vehicle is a 2015 model vehicle my bank can go as low as 4.59% interest (which I think I can get because my income is ~$85k and credit score is over 800). If that is the case, from what I can tell my payment on a 60 month refinance would be ~$510. Would it be wise to refinance and pay an additional ~$275/month?

Option 3:
If I refinance for 36 months I can potentially get an interest rate as low as 4.29%. This would make my payment ~$810. I can probably afford the ~$120 extra since I am already planning on making a $100/month extra payment anyways.

personalfinance,I am a high school senior. Which credit union and/or online bank would you recommend if you were in my situation? What should I look for?,"Warning: wall of text ahead. New-ish lurker, first post on this sub, apologies because I probably don't know the customs yet, you know the drill.

I'm graduating high school in a few weeks, and I'm trying to figure out where I should be opening my first bank account. I do not want to be like my parents, who have accounts with a certain bank that has been roiled by scandals recently. I read somewhere that a popular choice is to open a checking account with a credit union with shared branching for convenience/lack of withdrawal fees and an online bank for the higher interest rates, so that's likely what I'll stick with.

I already have a credit union (~~PenFed~~ Alliance) and an online bank (possibly Ally but mostly Synchrony or Charles Schwab) in mind, since the loophole closed for joining Navy Federal and I have no military family to qualify for USAA. But, since I'm going to college and not looking for an auto loan/mortgage/etc., I don't really know what to look for other than a high APY and minimal/nonexistent required monthly balances. I've come up with a list to try and figure out what I do/don't want, but I'm not sure if I'm missing something important or if PenFed/Ally are the ideal options when it comes to matching my priorities. **The numbering is not a ranking of how much I prioritize them, just making it easier to organize**. I'm hesitant to just open an account right now because I'm a lazy person and will absolutely procrastinate if I know I'll have to set up a new account and call or fill out paperwork. I would rather get it right the first time around and not bother with the hassle. Also, if anyone has experience interacting with any of the institutions I mentioned above or one they'd like to recommend, particularly customer service or the online interface (either desktop or mobile app), I would love to hear from you!

**Primary Concerns**

1. Online/mobile access and FDIC/NCUA insurance - I initially thought both of these were something that every bank had at this point in time, but it looks like that may not be the case? This is a dealbreaker, although I'm not sure any reasonable financial institution could be considered good without them.
2. Highest interest rates possible - I know PenFed (and possibly Ally?) doesn't have the highest APY, and while a difference of .05% or so isn't all that significant for a college student, I probably care about having the highest possible interest rate more than I should. It's not a dealbreaker, though, and I'll sacrifice it if I find something that checks off everything else on this list.
3. No monthly fee and low/no minimum balance - I care more about the former than the latter. PenFed requires a $500 balance or more on checking accounts or else you pay a $10 monthly fee, which seems a little high for a college student. That's my main worry with them, although everything else seems to get glowing reviews online. Ally either has no minimum balance or one low enough I doubt I'd have trouble maintaining in their savings account. 
4. ~~Low transaction/other fees - I know about this the least. PenFed and Ally appear to be on the lower end, but I also place a lot of importance on minimizing this as much as possible.~~ I think the fees I was thinking of only refer to canceling cards/closing accounts/etc., not for everyday transactions and the like.
5. Good customer service - I hate talking on the phone. Physically going to a bank is better, and doing everything through email/online is ideal but human interaction is inevitable. I'm an incredibly awkward person, and having a friendly person helping me is a huge relief. I don't mind long wait times as much, but they do get annoying.

**Secondary Concerns**

6. Cash back rewards for groceries and other purchases - although this is about the Platinum Rewards Visa Signature Card and not PenFed itself, I often see it touted as a benefit of joining. At least at first, I'd prefer to have a better deal on other purchases over groceries since my college requires a full meal plan if you live in the dorms. 
7. Minimal overdraft fees - from what I've read overdraft protection is kind of scammy, and I'm terrified of becoming drunk on freedom and doing stupid things with a credit card because I'm interested in a lot of expensive hobbies that my parents don't allow me to participate in (looking at you, /r/MechanicalKeyboards and /r/fountainpens). However, I think my fear means I'm more aware of the money I spend, and I am the kind of person who will obsessively strive for a goal, so it's probably not all that important.
8. Retirement planning help/discounts - I'm not sure if software that helps with this (or filing taxes, for example) would be helpful or not. I would probably be able to do the latter without much help, but retirement is something I'm not sure if I can navigate. All the hullabaloo about half of all millennials having nothing in their retirement accounts makes me want to start as early as possible, even if it's a tiny amount. I plan on working over the summer and working spring semester of the upcoming school year.

**Not Important**

9. Loan rates and debt management - anything related to mortgage, auto, etc., including student refinancing and the like, since the ones in my financial aid package are small and more than reasonable.
10. Cash back rewards for gas - again, not directly linked to PenFed's checking account, but because of the location and layout of the campus I will not have access to a car in college and will almost certainly not need one. I would strongly prefer to maximize the points I get from groceries/other than gas. I would prefer to not ever buy gas/drive if at all possible, so having a minimal/no incentive to do so may even be a positive for me.
11. Budgeting software/non-personalized help - although a one-on-one with a financial planner would likely be helpful for longer-term goals, I already have a spreadsheet that includes an expenses breakdown by percentage and projected income/expenses. The required Econ/Personal Finance class at our school was useless, but I feel like this sub and Google is more than enough for me to keep me informed. I am interested in apps like Acorn, but I doubt I'll get discounts through membership.

Is there anything I've missed? Anything I might be misunderstanding or too (un)concerned with? Thanks in advance!",finance

Credit score before all this mess was less than 500, now I'm almost at 600. Here's the current breakdown of my debt \(dont have interest rates available on hand\)

\*\*LIQUID CASH ON HAND:\*\* $900

\*\*DEBT:\*\*

\*\*Secured Credit Card 1:\*\* 100&amp;#37; credit utilization \- $300/300

\*\*Unsecured Credit Card 2:\*\* 96&amp;#37; credit utilization \- $720/750

\*\*Title Max Loan:\*\* $700 remaining, paying $150/mo 

\*\*Amount to pay back friend:\*\* $500

\*\*MONTHLY BILLS/EXPENSES:\*\*

\*\*Cell Phone:\*\* $60

\*\*MLGW \(Utilities\):\*\* $70

\*\*Minimum payment made to the two credit cards combined:\*\* $55

\*\*Car Insurance:\*\* $50

\*\*Rent:\*\* $880

\*\*Gas:\*\* $30/40

\*\*INCOME:\*\*

600\-700$ weekly, depending on overtime \(after taxes\) \*\*OR\*\* 2400\-2800$/mo

\*\*MY PLAN:\*\*

1\) Week 1 check gone \(From Friday\) to pay rent.

2\) Check #2 \(May 11\) \- Pay off Credit Card 1 \(300\) and Pay back half of what I owe friend \(250\)

3\) Check #3 \(May 18\) \- Put down $300 on Credit Card 2 \(\-\&gt; 420/750\) and pay back rest of friend \(250\)

4\) Check #4 \(May 25\) \- Pay off $150 for Title Loan from TitleMax, save rest for Rent for June

5\) Check #5 \(June 1\) \- Remainder of Check #4 and all of this check to pay for June Rent

6\) Check #6 \(June 8\) \- Put 450$ down to clean up Secured Credit Card \(0/750$\)

7\) Check #7 \(June 15\) \- Put all of this check towards TitleMax Loan and get my title back.

During this time, I will live extremely frugal. I've already purchased water, ramen noodles, and potatoes that I can eat for the next 6\-7 weeks, only spending my savings on what my checks don't cover until I can rebuild again outside of my re\-occurring bills.

Please let me know if I'm missing anything and if this is a good idea. While I dont mind paying minimums, I finally looked at how much MORE that costs me to pay everything back vs just paying it back now and saving  money on the front end.

I'm sick of lingering debt.. just want to clear them up, pay people/businesses what I owe, and get back on with my life. The reason my credit cards were/are maxxed out is b/c I needed to take care of basic things while I was unemployed last year.

Thanks.",finance
personalfinance,Inheriting 401K from Sibling,"Hi PersonalFinance,

My brother recently passed away following a short battle with cancer.  He setup a trust and left the proceeds from his 401K accounts to his siblings.  One of the accounts lists each of us as equal beneficiaries; the other one either lists us as equal beneficiaries OR lists the trust as the beneficiary.  We (his siblings) are equal beneficiaries of the trust.  We are all US citizens and reside in different States.

I understand in the situation where we are listed as direct beneficiaries of the 401K we have the option to move the proceeds into our own retirement accounts (subject to minimum annual distributions).  I don’t know what options we have in the situation where the 401K’s beneficiary is the Trust.

Here are my questions:

1-If we are direct beneficiaries of an inherited 401k and we DO NOT move the proceeds to a retirement account and instead use the money for something else, what are the associated federal and state tax liabilities?

2-If the trust is the beneficiary, what are the options for disbursement and associated federal and state tax implications?

Thanks very much.",finance

personalfinance,[planning] Have a 529 I can use for tuition- can I take out federal loans just for living expenses not covered in the 529?,"I am wrapping up my first year of medical school. Here's my current financial situation:

-Scholarship to college, so no debt there

-Car's paid off, no CC debt

-$5k in emergency fund, would rather not spend that

-Paid for first year with earnings from my gap year

-I have about $60k left in a 529 plan from my parents that was supposed to be used for college. My tuition and fees are about $20k a year. 3 years left of school.

-I am currently using the 529 funds to pay for tuition/fees, rent ($600/mo), and groceries (~$300/mo).

The problem is, I'm running out of money I saved up during college which I use to pay for non-529 eligible expenses like gas, car repairs, dates, clothes, phone bill, etc.

Is is possible to take out a small Stafford loan each year to help cover these expenses? Is it possible to do that and still use the 529 money to pay my tuition first until that money runs out, and then have the loan disbursed?",finance

personalfinance,"Small windfall - 20k, low income, No retirement, Student loans","Lurker here, made a throwaway for privacy. Looking for advice on where to plop 20k bonus, approx 14k \(after 25&amp;#37; mandatory fed tax withholding \+ state taxes\) in work related bonus. Main concerns are retirement and keeping tax bracket and income low to apply for student aid. Side question, can I bypass that tax withholding altogether if I put the full 20 straight into a traditional retirement account?

**Situation**: 28F, recent grad with part time work, annual income between 8\-12.500k a year.  Just finished BS \(STEM\) and looking for full\-time job for this year then would like to go back to school in a year for MS, more job opportunities and use education benefits for income. Living with roommates but in an expensive city; rent/utilities/car etc = about 1300 a month. I have an emergency fund to cover 6 months of this job search, not sure where that will be by the time the bonus hits \(in approx 10 months\)

Possible Targets:

**Retirement:** I know I'm massively behind on this but I've decided to take charge of it this year. I'd like to throw this full amount 14k \(or 20k?\) straight into retirement to try and catch up. It's mostly a matter of where, for least possible tax and federal student aid impact \(need my income to show low to qualify\).

Roth IRA \- Started this year 1k with Vanguard

Roth TSP \(no match\) \- also started this year with a measly couple hundred bucks or so

Traditional TSP \(no match\) \- Not opened, but is an option to drop the bonus in here to stay in lowest possible tax bracket.

Traditional IRA \- same as above

**Student Loans:**

36k, all federal debt, at an average interest of about 4.5&amp;#37;. Placed on IDR plans so technically 0 dollar payments for now. I'd like to use the IDR to snowball the debt once I actually have income.

Estimated between 10\-14k of this will be paid by a work loan repayment program over the next several years. \(This is also going to be considered taxable income\)

**Auto loan:** 4.5k left at 1.99&amp;#37; interest

This will be paid off with regular payments in the next 18 months or so, not really considering using the money here.

No CC debt.

Advice? Retirement, if so which? Or kill the student loans faster? Mixture of both?

Edit: updated retirement accounts for accuracy, didn't realize 401k and TSP were viewed that differently.",finance

personalfinance,I owe 1k for a cellphone plan I had 10+ years ago.,"I had a cellphone plan with some friends on it back in 2008. I stupidly opened it up for them and they just stopped paying their share and I let it close and go into collections. While growing up I had heard that things will just fall off your credit after 5-7 years and I wouldn't have to worry about it affecting my credit score. This has seemed to not be the case...

I've never been contacted about the debt but it shows up on credit reports. The company that owns the debt refreshes it every few months so the debt appears to look new. 

I looked at the debt section in the sidebar and was not sure if this is still considered ""Very old debts."" I also looked online and saw that Cellphone's have a federal statute of limitations of 2 year. 

I am worried that if I contact the company that owns the debt then it opens the door for them to sue or start harassing me.

personalfinance,"I have 300k in debt and no real job. I am seriously considering leaving the country, but did I exhaust all other domestic options?","I went to a 4 year private undergrad school and majored in English Literature (to then go to law school after). Undergrad debt amounted to 160k (this includes capitalized interest that I should have paid but did not and I also needed money for housing). Law school amounted to 130k in debt. I went to a top law school but did not perform well. Because of this, my recommendations and connections are limited since there isn’t much positive about my academic performance. My successful friends are great to grab a beer with but don’t feel comfortable vouching for me. I’m 28 and no longer want to practice law anyway.

150k of my debt is private with 8-12% interest. 140 is federal. I’m currently a barback  making ok money if I had no debt but I cannot keep up with payments let alone living expenses. I can train to be a bartender in 6 months. 

Take home: 2k net and another 400-500 in tips. I pick up random gigs, including post mates and TaskRabbit to make another 6-700 a month on my days off but that’s unpredictable. All in all, I make less than my expenses but pick up odd jobs to break even. I have no savings or retirement. 

Here is a budget: 
Federal loan payments: 300 (reduced amount)
Private: 1,500 (they won’t reduce it and I’m denied for refinancing. I’ve made endless calls) 
Rent: 800
Electric/phone/WiFi: 150
Food &amp; household items: 200 (I get 6 or 7 free meals a week at work). 
Transportation: 120/month.

I live in NYC and cannot decrease rent more- I’m already in a bad area and have 4 roommates. 

That alone is 3,100 a month, not including any other unexpected expenses, healthcare, fun, etc. my job is fun enough so I luckily don’t feel the need to go or and spend money. 

I considered leaving nyc but my living expenses aren’t the problem it’s the loan payments. I cannot live with family rent free. My only option (I believe) is leaving the country? I’m thinking of applying for a masters program there and then hoping to find a job after to get a work visa.

personalfinance,Purchase of second property: bigger or smaller down payment?,"So my family is house hunting for a small cottage (second property). We can certainly afford this property. I was hoping the community could help me understand how to approach this purchase in the best possible way. Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.

Here's our situation:

- Home we're looking at is $160,000 (small cottage)
- We currently have the ability to put a little over 60% down on a mortgage for it. (not all of our savings btw)
- Interest rates are at a ten-year high. :(
- The property has the potential to generate $1,500 - $3,000 per year in short-term rental income (VRBO or AirBNB).

Should we be putting this much down to purchase this property (around $100k)? Would we be better off with a smaller down payment, mortgaging a larger portion, and investing elsewhere? I'm not exactly sure how to look at this situation. On the one hand, we have the financial ability to purchase the home, but on the other hand I'd like to approach this in the best possible way. What would you do?

**Update:** To clarify, the main purpose of this property is for family enjoyment, not as an investment property. However, there is an opportunity to offset cost with a small amount of rental income.",finance

Acct 2 savings with the same bank as #1-low interest rate, but I can transfer over to #1 quickly for emergencies...going to set up to auto transfer from checking regularly

Acct 3 savings with another bank (ally or something)-hard to get to, but high interest rate...this one is the rainy day/new car/whatever fund...just stuff that might come up that doesn't require money immediately

I have a girlfriend of 8 years, and we both graduated with Bachelor's,  making a little below 70k each. 

We both paid off our student loans recently, and only loan we have on our names are auto loans ($10k left for me, $20k for her).


When we were in univ, we lived together for 3 years but because of timing of graduation, relocation, and family, we currently don't live together but live with our own parents.  


Now that we are 27 and 25, we are thinking of living together again by getting a house/townhome/condo together. Credit union at my company currently offers 2.75 APR for first 5 years of 30 years plan (and we are  planning on paying aggressively for that 5 years to shave down principle by applying one person's entire paycheck to the loan payment.)


I am asking for an advice.  

1. How much cash should we have aside from down payment, closing cost, and furnatures? We are planning on paying 3% down on maximum of 300k house in Dallas TX.

2.  Should I get the house by myself first, then have my gf move in with me? What are some traditional way ppl do this? I should be able to be approved for $280k loan by myself.     

3. Because of rising house prices and interest rates, I would like to buy a house by end of this year. Will that be do-able?

4. Living with family comes with a lot of expenses unaccrualed for. Especially for my gf. Gf doesn't want to buy a house until we have 20 k each in cash, but that would take another year and house prices will be up that much... What are your thoughts on this?",finance

personalfinance,[debt] Student loan income based repayment questions,"Thankfully, this question isn't for myself, but for two of my close friends. They have both been debating about how is bet to tackle their student loan debt. As I understand, once you have made payments for 10 years on your loans through income based repayment, the rest will be forgiven, but supposedly you will be required to pay income tax on the amount that was forgiven? That seems impossible if their income based repayment isn't paying down much principle. 

Both of my friends have seemingly insurmountable debt at the moment (75k-100k) in federal student loans and are using income based repayment now for their moderate income. One is in a career with potential to earn a 6 figure salary in a few years, the other one is not. 

They are not sure what the best course of action is. Should they buckle down and pay as much as they can in the hopes that they might be able to pay all of it off? Should they only pay the minimum and risk having to pay the tax? I'm not sure if the fact that one might not qualify for IBR in the future might affect this.

personalfinance,Pay off last student loan or do something else?,"Hi PF! Long-time lurker here. I'll try to be as specific as possible.

I've been working to pay off my student loans and credit card debt for years and am now at a cross-roads. I just paid off my last student loan in my name. (It had a 6.5% interest rate.) I've had all my credit cards paid off for over a year now and have been enjoying the free money each month from my Amazon Prime Visa. The only student loan I have left is in my mother's name. 

I'm 33 years-old. In a large city in the eastern US. Mandatory car city.

**Debt**

* Car Loan: $18,084 at 2.180% - $428/month
* Mortgage: $233,975 at 3.625% - $2,113/month (15-year fixed) (Includes taxes and insurance)
* Parent-Plus Student Loan: $14,250 at 3.875% - $240/month

**Income/Investments**

* Salary: $132,000/year
* Simple IRA through Employer: $41,475 (I'm currently contributing 5% and they match up-to 3%)
* Roth IRA: $4,900 (I make too much to contribute to this now and don't know how Backdoor Roths work...)

I just refinanced into a 15-year fixed mortgage to drop the PMI from my previous FHA loan. I bought the house in 2012. It's currently appraised at $380k.

I got the car new a year ago after my 16 year-old car finally died. After the ordeal of trying to keep an old car running with no automotive knowledge at all, I never plan on keeping a car past warranty again. 

**Monthly Bills**

* Electric/Water/Gas: $425/month
* House (Lawn care, pest control, alarm ,etc): $390/month
* Cable/Internet/Netflix/etc: $149/month
* Car Expenses (AAA, Insurance, Tag): $53/month
* Cellular service: $110/month
* Health/Dental/Disablity Insurance: $150/month

*(See above for mortgage and car payment)*

My SO gives me $850/month to help cover their percentage of the shared bills. Since my SO makes about 30% of what I make, we add up our take-home income, figure out what percentage of our total income our shared monthly bills eats up and my SO pays me that percentage. 

I work from home and also get $50/month home office reimbursement.

I'd like to pay off the Parent-Plus loan just to be able to say I'm finally done paying for the degree I got 10 years ago... but with it only being a 3.875% interest rate and knowing that it's not in my name, it's not helping or hurting my credit in any way.

HSBC’s global head of e\-channels strategy and innovation, Andrew Davis, says his bank is gearing up under the assumption that virtual currencies would soon become a normal way of buying goods and services.

The rise of virtual currencies would signal a leap forward in the way people conduct transactions, while further blurring the line between online and real world retail shopping.

Where traditional currencies such as the Australian dollar are guaranteed by governments, virtual currencies such as BitCoin often have no central organising groups or value.

But despite the risks, usage is rising.

“We have a planning assumption that virtual currencies will become mainstream in three to five years,"" Mr Davis said. “One of the reasons why we need to reach a view two to four years out is to influence our decisions around enterprise architecture, because it doesn’t change very often.

“How people place value on things won’t just be with hard currency in the future and we’re already seeing micro\-currencies emerge around the world.""

Mr Davis made the comments during the PushStart FinTech Forum in Sydney, which brought large corporate banks and technology start\-up companies together.

Macquarie Bank’s head of wealth management technology, Stephen Dunn, agreed that virtual currencies would become mainstream as cash and credit cards became less important, but said the key for banks was to make sure customers could use whatever form of payments they wanted.

“I don’t think cash or credit cards will disappear in less than five years but I think it won’t be as dominant,"" he said. “But we shouldn’t be ruling it out today.""

Mr Davis said one example of virtual currency’s rising importance was American Express’s May launch of a card that rewards customers with “FarmVille"" cash that can only be spent inside the popular computer game played by more than 80 million Facebook users. The virtual currency is spent by gamers who want to upgrade their virtual farms with items like fences, hay bales and buildings.

The RBA has considered virtual currencies as part of its report on innovation, due for release in the next two weeks. In its February 2012 summary of submissions, the RBA said organisations had “highlighted the emergence of ‘virtual currencies’, such as Facebook credits, and urged consideration of how these might interact with traditional payment systems"".

The Commonwealth Bank, Microsoft and PayPal all provided submissions discussing the challenges and opportunities raised by virtual currencies. And in February, CBA used an official blog posting to discuss whether or not virtual currency would mean the end of cash.

“The virtual cash revolution has ­fostered a means of exchange that is independent of both the banks and the state,"" it said.

“But just like video didn’t kill radio, virtual currencies and online trading won’t herald the end of real\-world currency and ­trading.""

City Index FX strategist Kara Ordway said virtual money could easily be a tradeable commodity not unlike the Australian or US dollar, once market demand and supply was established.

“Everything is becoming electronic – people are talking about a paperless foreign exchange market,"" she said. “If you haven’t got physical Australian dollars \[trading\], what’s to stop there being some kind of internet or technology\-related currency?""

University of NSW economist Tim Harcourt said HSBC was a good leading indicator of financial trends and virtual currencies would become more important as Australians used less cash.

“The more retail becomes international because of online retail  . . . the more demand there will be for \[virtual currencies\],"" he said. “I think virtual currency won’t become universal within three to five years, but it will certainly be common.""

Mr Harcourt said loyalty point alliances between companies such as airlines and retailers could lead to reward points being worth value in a range of stores as they formed alliances. But the Australian dollar would still be the backbone of the economy for now, he said.

“We still earn Australian dollars and it’s our main means of exchange, but this will be another means of exchange that people will use to ­exercise choice,"" he said.

CSC general manager of financial services Stephen Kowal said companies and institutions were battling to become the hubs for new virtual ­currencies.

“You want to be the payments provider for this \[phenomenon\]. Virtual currency will just be another exchange rate, next to your, say, ­Aussie dollars,"" he said. “People don’t trust virtual currency yet  . . . but it’s not a matter of if but when. Maybe not in the next three to five years but ­definitely in the  . . . next 10.""

He said regulators such as the RBA and the US Federal Reserve had to think of new ways to tax and manage virtual currencies as it became a valuable global commodity.

“You want to be the payments provider for this \[phenomenon\]. But I think the real institutions that could really control this are the \[technology\] companies themselves,"" he said.

“If you use a company like Facebook as an example, it has 900 million users. If you give each of them a virtual $10 token for instance, you instantly get a tradeable currency. It’s like a country of its own. It instantly becomes a hub of this trade.""

investing,Bond term premiums according to Kim and Wright model,"Mentioned in the bond section in 'Expected Asset Returns on Major Asset Classes' by Ilmanen were two models from 2005 that try to predict term premiums for bonds - that's the expected additional return you get for investing in treasury bonds over cash/tbills. We could further split this up into an inflation term premium plus a real term premium by looking at TIPS. Currently bond yields are higher than cash yields but that's because the Fed is expected to continue hikes. So how much is cash expected to rise, and how much are medium term yields expected to rise and what's left over for long bonds?  

I don't have a real-time chart for the Cochrane and Piazzesi model based on a tent shaped weighting of the first several maturities (please link if you do), though I did find and skim a thesis paper challenging the model, so I'll focus on the Kim and Wright model. That model uses features of the yield curve (level, slope, and curvature) and also incorporates analyst targets and is published on Fred. Both models show similar trends.  
[1/2/5/10yr term premiums plot](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=jFql)  
[Paper](https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2005/200533/200533abs.html)  
[Category menu](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/33825)  

I still don't have a firm grasp on how to think about the results, and I invite discussion. Right now my view is to see this as similar to [CAPE](http://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe/) for bonds instead of stocks. Movements in the term premium will usually be a short term reflection of bond prices and medium term movements in cash rate expectations and will itself have medium predictive strength for future returns. Actual returns on bonds (absolute or with respect to cash) will not necessarily be predicted by the term premium because cash yields can move by large amounts unexpectedly when the economy changes. But it'll work well when cash follows an expected path. Yields are what will forecast actual nominal returns (of course). The term premium is almost more of a forecast of cash rates than it is of bond returns.  

But we can pick out some trading information and general valuation. For instance, if you see a large downward swing in yields accompanied by a fall in term premium, you might bet on a short term reversion. If the swing in yields isn't accompanied by a fall in term premium, then there's probably a lowered expectation for cash, and you won't be able to profit from then selling bonds.  

When we look at the chart and see falling term premiums for bonds over cash, it means that bonds are becoming less and less valuable as a diversifier. Following CAPM, and assuming a negative beta to stocks (bonds are expected to hedge against some stock losses), treasury bonds really have no theoretical reason to have a positive term premium. The premium they did have in the 90s and naughts was probably because of lingering fear of huge losses from the stagflation era and a positive beta. I think returns in the early tens were higher than predicted because the Fed kept [holding off on hikes](https://mk0valuewalkgcar7lmc.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Velocity-Of-Money-2.jpg). But returns starting in the teens have been close to zero as predicted.  

One thing I'm unsure about is whether the model includes a measure of mean reversion to the average levels in the sample data, like stock return returns regressed against CAPE do, or whether they're more passive, like a Gordon Growth-style model (which could also be based on CAPE). Research Affiliates [expected returns tool](https://interactive.researchaffiliates.com/asset-allocation#!/?currency=USD&amp;model=ER&amp;scale=LOG&amp;terms=REAL) allows you to choose between both types of models and even mix them together. I'm also not sure what kinds of events are averaged or priced into the expectations, like periodic tightening and loosening cycles.  

Taken at face value, these term premiums are saying that *we can no longer expect treasury bonds to outperform cash on average*.  Is that an accurate interpretation? If so, does it mean diversifying a stock portfolio with levered bonds won't significantly improve it any more - smoother in times of crisis but rougher in times of inflation and calmly falling discount rates, no added return long term?",finance

btc,Bitcoin Cash and Deflation,"do not get me wrong. I am a big supporter of! Bitcoin Cash! but what is not 100% clear to me is the following:


Financial experts cite Bitcoin as a deflationary currency as it controls the total amount of bitcoins in the market due to its limited quantity and cryptographic system.

""As a result, companies profit expectations are falling, they are investing less and instead trying to cut costs by, for example, reducing product production (short-time work, site closures, etc.), layoffs and wage cuts Unemployment is rising, incomes are falling, there can be less consumption, demand for consumer goods is shrinking, and state tax revenues are falling, and overall economic output is shrinking. The result is an economic crisis.

While prices, profits and wages fall in deflation, the face value of loans and other debt remains unchanged, penalizing debtors as their credit-financed assets lose value in monetary terms, but they remain the same initially set monetary On the other hand, owners of financial assets benefit from deflation, as their capital - adjusted for interest rates - now has a higher value than at the beginning of the period, leading to more insolvency of indebted companies, with negative consequences for their employees and creditors The further consequence may be debt deflation, that is, a financial crisis and ever-worsening deflation through economic austerity, resulting in the deepening of the economic crisis.

Consumers purchasing power will increase if wages do not fall more than prices, and if wages remain stable, even though companies can no longer afford to pay wages (wage rigidity), it will lead to corporate bankruptcies.""

- Are there any comparable experiments with a deflationary currency?

My S/O graduated in 2015 with a nice handful of federal loans (about a dozen) equal to roughly 60k. Each of these loans ranges between the 1k and 8k. I'm lucky enough that I graduated debt free but have been helping her with the payments. We've also been lucky in that we both have very well paying jobs. That being said, my plan for paying off these loans has been to pay off the minimum for all of the individual loans except for the one that is accumulating interest the fastest, where we dump a few extra hundred into it each month.

We continue to save our money and we have enough to pay off the loan in full (plus a nice safety net as to not completely drain our funds) we pay it off and then just roll over the extra amount and the required minimum into the next loan with the highest accumulating interest.
This seems to be working fairly well (we've paid off about 20k of it already) and I like the option of being able to just pay off an entire loan when our savings allow. 

In other words loan 1 requires a minimum payment of 30 dollars payment, loan 2 requires a minimum of 50 dollars payment. I completely pay off loan 1 and just roll the 30 I was paying a month towards it into the monthly payment of loan 2 so I'm paying 80 dollars towards it now. 

That being said I've had a few friends and family members recommend consolidating the loans into one larger loan for what would most likely be a lower interest rate overall. Which sounds good in theory except I'd lose the ability to just pay off smaller chunks completely, or at least that's how it plays out in my head.

Anyone care to share some thoughts or advice on the situation?",finance

- We are original owners.  Built in 2012, paid $205,000.  
- 3 bedrooms, 2.5 bathrooms, loft, open floor plan, crown mouldings, kitchen island, granite counters, 2 car garage, fenced in yard
-Currently owe $123,000 on it.  Interest rate is 3.5%
- Mortgage &amp; escrow is $1,000 per month.  I can probably get $1600 in rent per month.

Forex,Thinking about starting with a carry trade,"Hi traders. I have a couple of questions around carry trading but first I want to introduce myself.

I took a run at forex a few years ago. I learned a little, did some analysis, found a really cool pattern, and jumped in with a modest amount of real money. I quickly lost about 25% of it and suspended my system. Eventually I discovered a basic error in my approach and quit.

I am coming at it again now, and this time I am taking it slowly. I am reading various sources -- including this amazing sub, it's an absolute gold mine. I intend to follow the course that has been suggested here: learn, study charts, play in a demo account for a long time, and/or open a real account with a small amount of money. And keep learning.

Lately I have been reading about carry trading. It seems there are several currency pairs with net interest rates in the 1.5% to 2% range. With 50:1 leverage that means an ROI of 75% to 100% per year. Right?

I am thinking of trying a carry trade or two earlier in my learning process. My questions:

With returns this high, why aren't you all doing it? Are there risks I am not aware of? I realize the currency pair can turn against me so it's also important to pick the right pair at the right time, and set up a SL.

Or are you consistently making *more* money following your trading strategies? Seriously? -- more than 100% per year??",finance
personalfinance,I'm new graduate and I'll be starting a job that pays 200k per year. I have massive expenses and need help with budgeting,"A few numbers have been changed to preserve anonymity, but the basic information is the same. 

**Current situation**

I'm 27 and I've been in university for the last 8 years, primarily focusing on my degree, research, and internships. I've financially supported myself through student loans, scholarships, and assistance from family. 


I'm in a medium cost of living area and I have a budget of $2,500 per month.  I live with roommates and my rent is $600. I'm spending approximately $1,900 on other basic expenses such as car, food, entertainment, etc. Other than an emergency fund of 6k, I have no savings. 


My budget allows me to have a decent lifestyle. I'm not struggling to buy food or pay rent, but I cannot spend money on luxuries. My brother is one of my roommates and I pay for some of his expenses such as food, internet, and utilities. I'm able to eat out 1-2 times a week at medium priced restaurants (such as Dennys), go to the pub once a week, and one vacation a year (Christmas). I have an 18 year old car worth roughly $3,000 and a few tech gadgets worth $3,000. 


**Expected earnings and expenditure** 

I'm about to graduate and I have a job that pays around 200k (see below) for my 1st year. My compensation goes down because these are guaranteed earnings and my bonuses for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th year will not be decided until I finish my 1st year. These amounts assume that I contribute 18k to my 401k because they will add additional 9k . It's very likely that my compensation will increase by roughly 10-30k every 2 years until I reach 350k to 400k. 


Year | Amount | Notes | After tax income
----|------|-----|----------------
1 | 198k  | Includes 50k signing bonus with first pay check | 127k
2 | 172k | Partial bonus guaranteed | 112k
3 | 157k | No guaranteed bonuses | 102k
4 | 157k | No guaranteed bonuses | 102k




Expense | Amount | Notes
-------|------|-----
Student loans | 162k | Currently at 6.2% interest. When I pay off 25% of my loan, my company will pay any interest over 1% for 5 years. This is assuming that I'm still working at the company.
Family loans | 67k | From my dad and uncle. Both are 2.5% interest to keep up with inflation. There's no rush to pay them off, but I want to be fair and return it as soon as reasonably possible. Over time, I want to give them an additional 100% of my entire loan amount for believing in me and helping me out. They took a big risk and they deserve to share in my success. 
Medical Loans | 25k | I want a surgery which will not be entirely covered by insurance. I've been waiting for 4 years and I'm adamant about undergoing the procedure before starting my job. It will drastically improve my quality of life and Unsure of interest rate. I cannot state the name of the surgery because it will almost uniquely identify me, but you can think of it like a surgery to fix a major body part required for daily function. For example, imagine that I'm unable to lift my left hand above my chest. I could live with it, but it would be a major annoyance and something I want fixed. I wasn't born with it, but acquired it a few years ago and prevents me from doing some activities I enjoy.  
Moving costs | 10k | Moving across the country. Covers air ticket, car transport, 1 week in hotel, shipping my possessions, etc. 
Car | 20k | After working for 2-3 years, I'll want to buy a good used car. I prefer to save money and make a one-time payment
 |  | 
Total | 284k | 

**Financial plan**

I'll be living in high cost of living area similar to New York or Washington DC. I'll have a good healthcare plan with no deductible and maximum out of pocket expenses is 2k. 



Expense | Cost | Notes
-------|----|-----
Rent | 2,000 | If required, I can cut this down to 1,500
Base expenses | 3,000 | Covers food, car, entertainment, etc. If required, I can cut it down to 2,500, but I would have to sacrifice things like vacations or entertainment. Based on my current spending of 1,900 in medium cost of living area
Business expenses | 500 | I'll be working in an industry where public perception is quite important. I'll be expected to wear a thousand dollar suit, eat at fancy restaurants with colleges, etc. I can avoid this, but my career would take a big hit. 500 is on the low side, my friend works at similar company and routine spends over 1k a month
 |  | 
Total | 5500 | 66k per year

I'm putting 27k into 401k every year. I know that this amount is supposed to be pre-tax, but I'll make it post tax to make things a bit simpler (and have some additional savings). Furthermore, it's 27k instead of 18k because I factored my company's contribution into my compensation package. 

After my basic expenses, I'll be left with 34k per year for non-routine expenses. How should I spend this money? What should I pay off first? Should I plan for anticipated compensation increase over the years? Any advice is greatly appreciated! 

** Edit: Why the downvotes? **

Edit: I've changed the wording for my surgery. It was implying that I had the ability to decide based on personal preferences, but the reality is that my quality of life will significantly improve.",finance
btc,"Core and Blockstream work with Chaincode labs, whose co-founder was probed by the SEC for manipulative stocks high-frequency trading. He worked closely with the SEC for a while, before leaving his previous post and co-finding Chaincode Labs.","I recall a long while back, I joined Core’s slack and I asked few questions acting as if I’m new to the scene, in order to get the latest propaganda answers from them.

I asked about Blockstream’s patents, scaling, UASF, segwit and schnorr; all answers of course fit their narrative.

The one thing that struck me was the answer I got when I asked: “will Blockstream consider other scaling plans?”

It was either logical or nullc himself who replied back with the usual “Blockstream is one of many contributors”, but then casually added, “actually, Chaincode Labs are now the biggest contributors to Bitcoin Core.”

Who are Chaincode labs?

He headed HRT who was probed for manipulative trading, and was made to bow to the SEC. Suhas must have had many asses to kiss during that phase. 

He then leaves to start a “stealth startup” (that’s how they described themselves), with absolutely no indication on how this high-frequency magnate who manipulated many out of their money is going to either profit from (or contribute to) Bitcoin. 

What was his early, and possibly only contribution to the core narrative? This article, titled: “How the Bitcoin Experiment Might Fail” : 

https://medium.com/@sdaftuar/how-the-bitcoin-experiment-might-fail-7f6c24f99ecf

Of course the article is the usual nonsensical bullshit about why we can’t scale on-chain.

Here you go, a wall street stock manipulator who was breast-fed SEC bureaucracy for over 16 years, and whose first opinion about Bitcoin is that it might fail, is more prominent in developing for Bitcoin Core than Blockstream themselves.

personalfinance,I have a question about my sallie mae student loan,"Hello, long time lurker here, I need your help with exactly how to handle my student loan from college. So a long time ago and a galaxy far far away. I took out a couple of loans from Sallie Mae for college (7,000 and 20,000 at variable interest rates of 11% and 8% respectively). I desperately needed this to finish my final years of college as being an international student didn't give me many options as far as work or federal loans. Anyways one good (or bad) thing about the loan is while I'm in school, I just have to pay $25 on each loan and they will be happy. Unfortunately, the remainder builds into the principal sum increasing the interest. I could not afford the base amount at the time so this felt like a good deal. After college, I went on to grad school and I'm about to graduate with a PhD. Due to a combination of still not being able to afford the loan (grad school thankfully didn't cost anything and did get me a monthly stipend but that was barely enough to live on) and just sheer forgetfulness, I didn't change anything about the loan letting it get to about $40,000 combined. Well now I'm about to graduate and be ""out of school"" and Sallie Mae wants me to immediately start paying over $500 a month. I don't even have my work visa in hand yet much less a job. I'm about to call them and ask for a forbearance period so I can start working before paying off the loan. I understand that it will keep stacking while this is happening so I wanted to ask if this is the best thing to do? I will not be able to afford those payments for at least 4 more months. Also, is there anything that can be done about the interest or is that a lost cause? I'm not an American and so can't get federal help. thanks. Should I consolidate the loans now? Any info or help is greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,Considering Personal Loan for $17k Credit Card Debt,"I'm going to start by saying this - I am horrible with my money, absolutely horrible with it. 

My mom was the first person to actually push me to apply for a credit card when I turned 18. Got an American Eagle store card and was really good about paying off the balance in full each statement. Fast forward to when I moved out the first time right after college (age 20), I discovered more credit cards. Anyways, living on my own and living pay check to pay check I was always left with the decision to either pay rent or buy food. Obviously I chose to pay rent which led me to rely heavily on my Capital One card. 

Before I knew it, my spending had gotten out of control. Holiday's rolled around, maxed out my American Eagle card and PayPal Credit buying gifts and my Capital One Card essentially stayed maxed out. My parents were generous enough to pay off my AE and CO cards as a late birthday gift that next year. Me being an idiot, saw the $0 balance and went crazy with the spending. 

Jump forward to last fall (2017) and I finally decided to get serious about my spending. I went into my credit union and applied for a balance transfer card. I got approved for $6k, which paid off my maxed out Amazon, American Eagle and Capital One Cards, with a little left to throw at my PayPal Credit account. 

Once again, the $0 balance got to me and here I am once again with maxed out cards. I really need to get serious about paying these off because on top of all of these cards, I have a car loan and some student loans I am paying off. I'm really trying to save and plan for my future and my (hopefully one day) family, but having this debt over my head is scaring me. 

Here are the balances I am working with:
Capital One: $2525 - maxed out 
Amazon Store Card: $1350 - $450 open 
PayPal Credit: $7000 - maxed out
Patelco Pure Card (Balance Transfer Card): $5965 - maxed out 

I make around $1600 every two weeks, rent is $1189 a month ($2300 split with partner), internet is $40 a month, water is usually around $38 a month, PGE is around $35 a month. And my minimum payments to my car loan is $274 &amp; for my student loans it's $120. 

I know I have room to put more money towards my credit card bills but I honestly have a problem when it comes to spending and I need to get help with it. I'm considering taking out a personal loan to pay off the card balances and just cut the cards up and have the card companies put a hold on them so I do not get tempted to use them anymore (should've done that last year.) My credit score is 634 according to Credit Karma, so I may have some what of a chance on getting a personal loan to pay this all of but then again, probably not. 

My biggest issue with my debt is the interest rates are astronomically high - PayPal is around 27%, Amazon around 23%, CO about 19%. My Patelco Card is the lowest interest rate since it's a balance transfer card at about 7%. 

Any advice would be great honestly, because I am at a loss for what to do. I try to make a budget each month and stick to it but I honestly cannot help my spending, I have zero self control. 

TLDR; I want to take out a personal loan to pay off around $17k in CC debt because my idiot self keeps digging me further into the hole. My credit score is so so but I'm at a loss for what I should do at this point. 

EDIT: I do drive for Lyft as a secondary income - it averages out to be around $600-$900 extra  month depending on how much a I work/if it's busy when I work.",finance

Family Debt Management (https://www.familycredit.org/) appears to be a legitimate company that works with creditors to lower interest rates on your behalf. They also freeze your accounts and take a (for me) $50/month fee. Essentially, they negotiate for lower interest rates, I pay them, they pay the credit companies.
Now, about my situation: through some poor management, tough times, and a wedding I have accrued ~$40,000 in credit card debt. FCM is quoting a monthly payment of $791 for ~5 years. No penalties for paying early or leaving the program. One possible negative is that she mentioned a lot of times the creditor will close the account after the repayment period. Won't that negatively impact my credit score if it lowers the age of my credit?

Should I even consider this? Are there questions I need to/should ask? Should I make it so that only a subset of my accounts fall into this program (if possible)?

I understand the desire to have others either confirm your existing bias, or to just be told what to aim for.  I really do.  That said, these are completely ridiculous questions to me.  Put simply, the right number / age combination is driven by various factors unique to an individual’s situation: their current age, savings rate, income, risk tolerance, etc.  However, most importantly, it is determined by your own needs and the soul-searching required to confirm these needs (which are likely ever changing).  

So, instead of going off on a tangent about how this sub-reddit is not for online therapy, that we aren’t mind readers and in fact wouldn’t know you from a hole in the wall, I will suggest: create your own (probably excel based) calculator to more specifically plan your retirement trajectory.  There are a host of benefits to this, not least that excel skills will improve.  A few other benefits (not a fill list):  

1)	Force you to define what is important to you as you must model in major life events, purchases, etc.

2)	Force you to define in whatever detail you want the interest rates you expect, which will cause you to pay more attention to the market in general

3)	Force you to think more about your career as income is a major aspect of any solid model

4)	Force you to think about work after retirement, withdrawal rates, and the relationships these and other aspects of FI have to each other. 

The point is, use a home-baked model to learn about FI.  Refine it as you learn more.  Define your own path, don’t expect others to define it for you.  A self-created model is one of the best ways to do this.  While leveraging someone else’s model isn’t a bad approach, it will never impart the lessons a self-made model will.

Clear your schedule.  Put the time in.  It’s worth it.",finance

personalfinance,"Changing checking and savings accounts, need some advice.","So I have had the same checking account for almost ten years, Woodforest National. Chose this bank because they are open every day of the year except for Christmas and I used to get paid by check on Saturday and I couldn't usually afford to wait until Monday. They are also pretty quick at processing direct deposit so now I get paid a day before everyone else at my company. The problem is that the interest rate on the savings account is abysmal and the closest branch is an hour and a half away.

Chase has a promo going where you yet a free 150$ if you open a checking account and have 3 months of direct deposit set up and Ally Bank savings interest is currently 1.5%. I'm thinking of finally making the change but was curious about how easy it is to transfer money between the two and if going with a 'big bank' is a good idea or not. I'm not opposed to going with a local credit union and I live in Chicago so I'm sure there are plenty of reputable ones nearby.

Whats the general consensus on Ally/Chase? Does anyone recommend another bank or credit union that is local to Chicago?

Thanks!",finance

solar,Considering Solar For My Home - Seems To Good To Be True,"Greetings,

This is my first time posting in this sub so I apologize if I'm breaking any rule. I checked the guidelines and this seemed appropriate but if I missed anything then I'm sorry.

My wife and I are looking at adding solar to our home in central NC, in a rural part of the county halfway between the Triangle and the Triad. Our home is around 2200 square feet, we are entirely electric with two heatpumps, one for upstairs and one for down. Our electric bills average around $130 a month with variations between $210+ in the winter months to $70 in the spring and fall.

We met with a rep from NcSolarNow, a local solar integrator. We were quoted a system with 26 CanadianSolar 300W panels on the roof. Not sure how detailed to get into the financials but after the federal tax credit and a Duke Energy rebate the system cost was cut in half and with 20 year financing, it would seem that the system would be essentially cash flow neutral from day one. The expected solar produced would net enough to equal the monthly payments for the system. Is this a fairly normal setup or is it too good to be true? I'm asking because the dealer said we have a perfect roof for solar (house is aligned nearly North/South with the rear roof pointing West/Southwest with no shade trees in the direction). I'm hesitate to believe a salesmen (being one in a former career) but from my research he may be correct? 

Is there anything we may be missing? Are there major differences in panels or integrators or are the all similar. The research I've done on the company makes me believe they are upstanding. I don't know anyone personally who's used them but they have done a local University and more than a few local businesses.

Any feedback would be appreciated. Thanks!",energy

personalfinance,Roth conversion: How do I retract paying taxes with distribution upfront.,I recently (MAY 2018) converted an IRA to a Roth and erroneously/stupidly selected to have 10% taxes federal and state payed up front with a distribution. I am under 59 so I will also get tagged with a 10% early withdrawal fee along with missing out on the future growth of the money removed.   Is there anyway to retract this tax mistake and pay my taxes when I file next year?,finance

personalfinance,"Take out loan to consolidate medical debt, or pay from savings?","When I typed that, it already started to sound like a stupid question, but hear me out. 

I'm 29, gainfully employed, and my wife just started a new job, so we have a total household income of about $117k. I have some old medical debt that's been in collections for a few years (I know. Stupid decisions earlier in life, and I had a very devil- may- care attitude towards credit). It's only about $3000. I have the means to pay it all right now without coming anywhere near draining our savings, but I'm wondering about effects on my credit. I'm at 660 right now, and definitely want to get that number up. I realize that not having collections accounts will not magically fix it, but it certainly helps. So, would I be better off just dipping into savings and paying the whole thing? I can take a short term personal loan for the total, which comes with a stupidly high interest rate, but because the amount is so low, it'd be a very manageable payment. I suppose I'm wondering if having another installment loan on my report, that i know I can keep in good standing, would have enough positive effect on my admittedly less than ideal credit score to make it worth the interest.",finance
personalfinance,Unsure what to do with roughly 100k for a short term investment,"Hi all,

Im a 25 YO who is about to sell my house and im planning to pay off all my debts that I have immediately after.  After that, Im expecting to have roughly 100k left over.  I would like to buy another place in the near future, but im not certain when that will happen (I anticipate it will be in the next 2 years).  My question for you /r/personalfinance is what I should be doing with that money for a short term investment.

personalfinance,Is it a good idea to finance used car for 24 months???,"Hi all,
I’m in the market for a used car. Thinking about picking up a 2014 Acura TSX with 50k miles for $13500. I’d be putting $3500 down and financing the rest. I’m thinking of financing for only 24months. Not sure what interest rate is because I haven’t applied for loan yet. Is financing for a shorter term a good idea? I’d like to pay it off ASAP. 

Stats: 50k salary, and bills that equal about $700 a month. 

Wife makes 40k. 
She wants to refinance her 60 month loan at 12% interest to 24 months as well. 

We figure, since we don’t have have many bills, we can “hunker down” and just commit to paying off our cars in 2 years. The payments will be around 450-500 each per month. But I know we can afford it. 

Your thoughts on my plan?",finance
investing,An update on Argentina by a fund manager (not me),"I'm interested in some of the Argentinian banks listed on the NYSE, so I thought I would share. 
--------
Over the past two months, the Argentinian peso had become overvalued in real terms following large inflows from foreign investors in 2017. These capital flows caused the nominal exchange rate to depreciate by much less than inflation. Those investing in Argentinian assets cited the carry trade theme, relatively low volatility, and the entering of Argentinian local currency sovereign bonds into the JP Morgan Government Bond Indices as investment rationales. However, the tide started to turn late last year when the Central Bank of Argentina (BCRA) made a policy mistake by raising the 2018 inflation target from 10 to 15%. The adjustment of the inflation target subsequently allowed the BCRA to cut interest rates in early January this year.

The cut in interest rates dented the BCRA’s credibility, and concerns grew about whether monetary policy was free of interference from the government. Another policy mistake was the announcement of a 5% tax on Argentinian peso Treasury bill investments, which impacted both locals and foreigners and led to a reduction in holdings of Argentinian peso Treasury bills by investors. Higher than expected inflation readings, and a strengthening of the US dollar finally generated large pressures on the Argentinian peso. After attempting to support the local currency by buying over USD 5 billion worth of pesos in the currency market, the BCRA finally realised that its monetary stance had to be tightened. We have now witnessed three emergency hikes (a combined 12%), bringing the policy rate to an eye-watering 40%. I believe the monetary authorities will now be successful in slowing the depreciation of the currency going forward.

The overvalued peso also contributed to Argentina’s current account deficit widening 5%. I expect the current account deficit to begin to start narrowing again as the currency moves into equilibrium (say, to 24-26 against the US dollar by year-end) and the economy slows as a result of the monetary and fiscal tightening (a 0.5% tightening of the fiscal deficit was also announced). The implications of this will be higher inflation this year and possibly next, lower growth and a further decline in Macri’s popularity.

If this a default situation? Not yet. I see this as a re-pricing of Argentinean risk which had started earlier in the year, coupled with an already ongoing emerging market sell-off in the local and hard currency space.

On the positive side, I believe that there are two silver linings for the time being.

Firstly, the next election is not until late 2019, so there is some time for the authorities to take its bitter medicine this year – including more utility tariff hikes, a depreciation of the peso, and attempt to control the next public wage negotiations in September. Accepting these tough measures will allow the economy to readjust over the course of 2018. The opposition and Peronists are still divided, so while Macri’s re-election chances and policy continuity look much more complicated now, it is still not a given that Argentineans will choose another populist government.

Secondly, the IMF may be prompted to get involved. Unlike other countries which would ideologically be opposed to an IMF program (Venezuela for sure, potentially Turkey, while Ecuador is uncertain as always), the authorities may end up under a program if they lose access to the markets and/or Argentina experiences a balance of payment crisis fuelled by capital flight. Argentina and the IMF have had a tumultuous relationship in the past, but under different administrations (Menem, Nestor and Cristina). The goal in this case, for both sides, would be to ensure stability so that Argentina does not return to its failed populist policies under a new administration. The current government is full of technocrats that understand this and, if push comes to shove, would convince Macri that this is his least worst option. Such an event would provide sufficient funding sources until at least the end of next year.",finance
personalfinance,Best options when refinancing a home?,"Due to divorce, I am needing to refinance my home. My ex has unreliable about child support \(which is significant at $2685/month\), so the name of my budgeting game has been to reduce my monthly payments as much as possible in order to get by every month without needing his support. So far I have been mostly successful, but I want to make sure I do the refinancing correct and not based on short term things, since it is a long term payment.

So the basic info:

\- Financed amount: $236,000

\- Interest rate w/out paying any points: 4.75&amp;#37; 

\- Monthly payment \(before taxes/ins\): $1231

That would leave me with $800 credit at closing time, which would be nice to cover some extra bills and get the kids signed up for some summer activities.

However, if I pay to reduce the interest rate, I would obviously saving on interest over the life of the loan and reducing my monthly payment \(not more than about $60/month even at the highest level of paying down\). This would leave me ""short"" for this month unless the ex pays child support. After this month I would be caught back up though.

For long term debts like this, what makes the most sense? Pay more up front, or just let it be and make extra payments as I am able, and let that do the work of saving money?",finance

personalfinance,Trade in equity grants to pay down loans?,"Hey guys,

I'm a long\-time follower of this sub and have learned a lot during the time here \(and hopefully been able to help others in the process!\) – was hoping to learn from some of the experiences others may have had in the past.

I receive an equity stock grant from my company in early October. In October, I'll have about $19,000 left in loans and will \(hopefully\) have the ability to pay \~$1,700/month towards them – projecting a payoff date of \~Nov. 2019.

When I receive the equity, I could theoretically trade all/most of it in and move the payoff date of the loans forward from Nov. 2019 to \~Jan. 2019. Logically, it might make sense to pay off the loans slower since they have a lower interest rate than what I could get in the market \(4.875&amp;#37; APR vs. investment returns\), but I hate the feeling of being tied down with loans and want to pay them off ASAP, even if that's more of an emotional decision than anything. 

With loans that have an interest rate of 4.875&amp;#37;, would it be smarter to \(a\) trade in stock to free up the cash, \(b\) trade in some of the stock to move the date forward, or \(c\) maintain the minimum payments as long as possible – about 15 years – and just invest the remainder? Any experience here?

personalfinance,How can I pay for college without any federal aid or scholarships?,"Disclaimer: this is for my girlfriend, not me, so I may be lacking some details.

My girlfriend dealt with PTSD, severe anxiety, and depression through high school (she was raised in an unbelievably terrible home) and early college. She had a hard time being outside, around people, or being in the academic environment. In both high school and college, she had difficulty attending classes, doing homework, and things of that nature. She had to get a HED because her grades weren't very good. She leaned the msyerial, but never turned in homework or took exams. This made her transcript unattractive.

Come college, it was the same story. Only now, it had gotten to the point where she is uneligable for any federal aid until she completes 51 more credits (finishes her associate's). Her highschool credentials also make scholarships difficult. She has no family that can held financially.

Our community college is $300 per class per semester. We can afford one per semester for her, but it'll take far too long to finish an associates degree.

Is there anything that can be done? How bad would a private loan be? I refuse to believe her only option to take 5 years on her associates.

I am currently at $18k in student loan debt down from $35k 3 years ago and I have looked into consolidating my debt in the past but it never seems worth it. I have about $8k at 6.8% and the rest between 3.8 - 4.5 %. Wherever I try to consolidate my student loan debt they offer me 5.5ish% which doesn't make sense when I can actively pay down my 6.8% debt selectively. I thought it might be my credit score but it just broke 800 (MINT) and still I'm getting the same offers.

I revisited consolidation because a friend of my just took out a $10k loan to fix his house at &lt;3% APR. I have great credit, I'm actively paying down my loans, why can't I get a better interest rate? Can I take out a loan at low interest under the guise of home improvement and just put it towards my student loans? Is there something I am missing or is that just the way things work?",finance

personalfinance,Combining Loan Repayment Programs,"Hi PF!

After a lot of digging and reaching out to numerous state's directly, I have some questions and some knowledge to share.

Context:  My wife recently graduated as a Nurse Practitioner and we are exploring loan repayment programs.  

As it stands, there are federal and state programs \(and others\).  What was really hard to track down is whether these programs could be combined.  For example, IHS \(Indian Health Service\) is a federal program that will pay 40k over 2 years towards qualifying debt.  However, the state you practice in might also have a loan repayment program and if that clinic you work at also meets their eligibility you are allowed to apply for both.

At first I had dollar signs in my eyes but after reviewing further, only 1 state so far \(New Mexico\) allows you to be accepted by more than one plan.  Further, they told me other candidates who apply who have no other funding will be prioritized first \(makes sense\).

Questions:

\- Has anyone successfully combined multiple loan repayment programs?  If so, can you share the details \(programs, state, time commitment\)

\- Are there other states that do this?  So far, I have a firm no from MA, VT, NH, CO, NC and AZ

Would this be a feasible solution to a country's Unholy trinity (Free capital flow, Soverign monetary policy, and fixed exchange rates)? Since if the national currency is decentralized a government could institute expansionary/contractionary fiscal policies without having a negative effect on monetary ones ex. if a country wants to raise taxes to cut spending normally their currency will depreciate since there will be less outside investments, and this could result in a decrease of buying power, but with a decentralized currency the government could have freedom in altering tax rates without worrying about buying power of their currency?

I have a propensity to make poor financial decisions, and my car is a glaring testament to that reality. (I am learning to make wiser financial decisions).

It's possible that I owe twice what it is worth. I got it thinking I only owed 10-20% above its worth, and I fear it's much worse than that. 

Kelly blue book estimates its private party worth to be around $15,000; however, that implies that I can find someone to buy it for that amount.

I owe $22,008.93. I pay $441.26 on it because it's at a 14.49% interest rate (Yes, I know this was dumb). 

Worth noting, is I have a warranty on it that I can cancel. That can go towards paying down that amount some.

If it matters, I make $45,000 a year, my share of rent is $255. (I can write out a full budget if that would be helpful.)

I basically would like to know what my options are in terms of getting out of this car debt so I can get out of my total debt as quickly as possible.

* Discover utilization: 82.35%

~~~~~

* AMEX balance: $500
* AMEX utilization: 2.99%
* After-transfer total utilization (holding all other CC balances the same as before): 13.38%


So is a 4.5% drop anything to worry about?  Does it not have memory or whatever it is? (I'm still confused about the details of that concept.)  Should I just go ahead and transfer the full $7,500 balance, which would put me at a total 13.71% utilization?  Does it not really matter as long as the total average utilization is under 30%?

litecoin,The Historical Importance of Litecoin Implementing SegWit on 5/10,"I thought I'd write up a brief post on why 5/10 is a big day for Litecoin as a way to reflect and in case you're new.  A lot of this is going to briefly cover Bitcoin's history \(hopefully somewhat objectively\), but there's a reason for that as it will show you the role Litecoin played and the continued role it could continue to play in the future.

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

Today marks the day when Litecoin successfully activated SegWit.  This was an important moment for both the Bitcoin and Litecoin communities.  In the beginning of 2017, there were 3 main topics of contention in the bitcoin community:

1. There were rumblings of covert ASIC BOOST mining on the Bitcoin network.
2. There was also talk about the need for a[ transaction malleability](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-bug-guide-transaction-malleability/) fix for transaction id's, particularly because this would be needed if 2nd layer solutions like the Lightning Network ever were to transpire.  As a side note, transaction malleability is just  fancy way of saying that there was more than 1 way to create a tx id.  Even though, LTC would be sent to the correct address, accounting was difficult because there could be multiple tx id's for the same transaction which created conflicting pieces of information.
3. Bitcoin's blocks were getting full and so there were talks of increasing the blocksize to process more transactions.

# Segwit: The Possible Solution

Segwit was first proposed by  Pieter Wiulle in 2015 in order to address the problem of malleability. Later on, a positive side\-effect to SegWit that was discovered was that it could naturally increase the blocksize to just under 4 mb.

However, there was much resistance in the Bitcoin community to hardfork in order to implement this protocol.  That's when Luke\-jr proposed a soft fork i.e. some nodes are SegWit and others are not.  This is why you can currently broadcast to both legacy and segwit transactions from the same wallet.  However in order to achieve this, no true segwit addresses were utilized \(hence the current need for Bech32 SegWit addresses\).  Instead, SegWit transactions are nested into a script \(a.k.a a smart contract\) called a ""Pay 2 Script Hash"".  *If you want to learn more, I highly recommend Mastering Bitcoin Chapter 7 by Andreas.*

By soft forking, the hope was that SegWit could:

1. Make covert ASIC BOOST mining negligible if not useless.
2. Fix Transaction Malleability to set the path towards the Lightning Network.
3. Increase the blocksize to a hypothetical 4 mb block \(2mb average\) ""weight"" as a temporary stop\-gap.

However, the method of implementing a SegWit soft\-fork through P2SH had never been done before and FUD started circulating around this topic.  Some claimed that there was a problem of ""anyone could spend"" the script that was used to lock up the SegWit transactions.  Since there was so much in\-fighting between implementing a SegWit softfork and simply just increasing blocksizes in lieu of SegWit, the Bitcoin community was stuck.

They then attempted to settle this debate through miner signaling.  This meant miner's would run the client software they supported which would then be recorded in the block that they successfully submit.  Turns out the miners responsible for extending the majority of Bitcoin's blockchain wanted a simple blocksize increase instead of SegWit.

This then created another wave of debate as the discussion shifted towards how to exactly determine ""consensus.""  Then bitcoin clients were released that allowed non\-mining nodes to ""signal"" in support of SegWit or a Blocksize increase.  This revealed that many users actually believed in SegWit, contrary to what the miners wanted \(although even here there is some debate as to the authenticity of these nodes as they can be spoofed\).  It is from this movement that the phrase ""User Activated Soft Fork"" \(UASF\) was born.

# How Does Litecoin Fit into All of This?

In the beginning of 2017, Charlie wrote up an article outlining[ his vision for Litecoin, SegWit, and the Lightning Network](https://segwit.org/my-vision-for-segwit-and-lightning-networks-on-litecoin-and-bitcoin-cf95a7ab656b).  He \(along with the Litecoin core team\) then worked hard [to convince and gain consensus](https://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/63cgfc/my_letter_to_chinese_miners_and_pool_operators_on/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage) among miners to implement segwit.  In fact, they even hosted a ""[Litecoin Roundtable](https://medium.com/@Litecoinchina/litecoin-global-roundtable-resolution-001-2017-c67b729bc06d)"".

It was out of this agreement that the Litecoin dev team could confidently move forward with soft\-forking SegWit onto Litecoin which officially occurred on 5/10/17.

With the success of the soft fork, it showed that it wasn't difficult to implement and that it wouldn't disrupt the network.  Even though Bitcoin developers could have tested the implementation on testnet, nothing beats a live main net version to ""test"" on.

Oh, and Litecoin implementing Segwit also proved that the ""anyone can spend"" FUD was...well just FUD.

# The $1 MM SegWit Bounty

A random redditor \([u/throwaway40338210716](https://www.reddit.com/user/throwaway40338210716)\) created a throwaway account and posted a [$1 MM Bounty](https://www.reddit.com/r/litecoin/comments/6azeu1/1mm_segwit_bounty/) for anyone who could ""steal"" the LTC from the P2SH address.  This person even provided the raw hex tx for miners to try and steal the funds from:

&gt;010000000100a2cc0c0851ea26111ca02c3df8c3aeb4b03a6acabb034630a86fea74ab5f4d0000000017160014a5ad2fd0b2a3d6d41b4bc00feee4fcfd2ff0ebb9ffffffff010000000000000000086a067030776e336400000000

\(P.S. u/coblee later revealed [he was the person who put up this bounty](https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/914372293232660481)\)

No one was successful in doing so.  In fact, the funds were left there for about [4 months](http://explorer.litecoin.net/address/3MidrAnQ9w1YK6pBqMv7cw5bGLDvPRznph)...or just a few weeks after Bitcoin activated SegWit.

# Litecoin's Value as the Silver to Bitcoin's Gold

Though many Bitcoin maximalists may not admit this, Litecoin was an important part in helping implement SegWit onto Bitcoin:

1. Litecoin proved it was safe to do so on main net.
2. The $1 MM Bounty proved P2SH transactions were safe disproved the ""anyone can spend"" FUD.

In the end, there were many reasons as to why Bitcoin ultimately implemented SegWit...one of it being the SegWit2X NYA agreement.  However it is undeniable that Litecoin played its part in squashing the FUD surrounding SegWit thereby removing some of the huge roadblocks Bitcoin faced during these debates.

In light of all this, we now can look forward to an exciting future of layer 2 scaling solutions through the Lightning Network.  Suffice it to say, there are many mutual benefits to Litecoin being the silver to Bitcoin's gold \(an analogy that highlights the close relationship Litecoin's codebase has to Bitcoin's\), two of which we've seen this year alone:

1. It allows us to be a testbed for Bitcoin.  Nothing beats main net implementation with billions of dollars on the line.
2. It allows BTC protocols and clients to be easily ported onto LTC.  This is evidenced by SegWit as well as how the lnd client has both BTC and LTC support.
3. It offers a secure enough network for those who are building on top of BTC to port their businesses onto LTC for cheaper transactions.  This was ultimately why Abra decided to add Litecoin as an underlying asset to its exchange.

Anyways, I hope this was helpful to you all and provided some context to the historical significance behind 5/10 and Litecoin activating SegWit.  In many ways, this was the date that Litecoin undeniably proved its worth to both the bitcoin and the cryptocommunity as a whole.  I will add UASF to my twitter handle as a way to commemorate it.

Bitcoin,"Buffet is painly wrong, but that alone is no guarantee BTC will have a bright future","Buffet has been a verry successful investor. Should we take his advice about BTC, no I dont think so. Every one has its own expertise and limited time frame in which they excel. Almost no one is ready to accept they are slowly becoming a part of the past and at an ever accelerating pace, it's probably the hardest for very successful people. It's hard to believe they really do not understand BTC or they simply do want to because the reality shift is too big and a threat to all the have been successful in. It threatens what they know, how they became successful and thus their natural action is to oppose it.

BTC today is the largest, open, peer to peer system of payment without intermediaries and without central point of failure. It is by design a thermodynamically guaranteed system of trust and immutability, it virtually tamper and censorship resistant, it is also resistant to most geopolitical manipulation, it is owned by all and very, very hard to change the hardcoded cap without all involved agreeing on it. It is the best known solution to the Byzantine general dilemma. 

Most current successful people prosper in a system which is based on control, manipulation, fear, oversight, cronyism, centralized trust, and impossible to fulfill promises. Compare that to Bitcoin.

The best in class at this moment, look at Buffet, made very serious money riding the latest financial crisis in 2007-2008. Most ordinary people lost wealth or worse their lifesavings and the hope for a decent retirement, Buffet, but more made a lot of money, made some $10 bln. 

The question is how could he made this money, is he smart, a genius, brilliant?
Despite some of his insights and strategies are, these last are not.
He himself admitted he knew, could check on forehand, government had to and was going to act.
He invested billions in Goldman Sachs while he knew the US government/FED would intervene.
If you have the right info anyone can look like a genius and with that kind of info become rich very easy. All current and a lot of future tax payers saved the very system that slowly drains them from all wealth and Warrent just hitch hiked on that move with the given inside information.

We as BTC believers should be very happy indeed with his disapproval of BTC.
The stronger and more childish words they use the better, ""rat poison squared"" really Warren?

Still BTC won't be a guaranteed success, I would say untillnow we are going unexpected strong and fast. We have to educate all around us. Let them see all doomed and false promises, show them all fake certainties and securities government and private banks tell us are there. Most people do not realize how much freedom and wealth they sacrifice for all the fake words and are suffering strongly from the Stockholm syndrome. 

BTC is not the solution to all problems but it sure is one of the best available basic building blocks to build upon a better more sane world.
Yes there are risks from outside and from the inside, a risk free bright future is simply not compatible with, human, nature. 
But we do need to embrace all solutions for a better future, mostly this will go hand in hand with personal sacrifices and some or a lot of determination, disbelief or opposition from others etc.
Still BTC is untillnow a quite effortless and even profitable exercise, in no way I want to down talk the fact we do have to put our hard earned money where our believes are, some hard battles are to be expected since it's power is just beginning to show.

Besides the HODL, we all should help building, spreading BTC, not by force, not like a religion, but by showing its good points and by pointing out the flaws and build in evilness in current fiat solutions.
To a better world..., and the MOON.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Navient Student Loans,"Sorry if this has been asked before, I tried searching for this question but could not find it.  I will try to keep this as simple and straightforward as I can.

I am repaying my student loans.  This month I owe $95 as my minimum payment.  I want to pay an extra $105 towards the loan with the highest interest rate.  I applied the extra $105 towards that loan and Navient gave me two options for my billing direction.    Here's what it asks me:

""You made a payment that is equal to or more than the amount of future monthly payments - do you want to be billed for your full Monthly Payment Amount? (Note: We'll always apply your Overpayment toward your Current Balance.)""

Option 1: ""No, Advance my due date by the number of payments I cover.  Even if you have zero amount due on your billing statement, continuing to make payments will reduce your total cost of borrowing.""

Option 2: ""Yes, Bill me for my full monthly payment.  You will be required to make a full monthly payment with your next billing statement.""

I read that I should be paying towards my principal, I'm not sure which of these two options does that.  I need a ELI5 on this.  Thank you in advance.",finance

personalfinance,(USA) Free Annual Credit Report?,"Quick question for fellow Americans \- I wanted to look at my free annual credit reports from the three major credit unions, and my usual way was to use [annualcreditreport.com](https://annualcreditreport.com) because it's the ""official"" website the FTC recommends. I've been using credit score estimate tools like on [Mint.com](https://Mint.com) and [CapitalOne.com](https://CapitalOne.com) but wanted to compare those to the real thing. To be sure, the FTC website reads:

&gt; You're entitled to one [free copy of your credit report](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0155-free-credit-reports) every 12 months from each of the three nationwide credit reporting companies. Order online from [annualcreditreport.com](http://www.annualcreditreport.com/),  the only authorized website for free credit reports, or call  1\-877\-322\-8228. You will need to provide your name, address, social  security number, and date of birth to verify your identity. 

I went through the form, requesting Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax. I get to the Experian report, and I can verify that all of my info is correct, see my previous addresses, my recent accounts, etc. But, when I click on ""Credit Score"", I just get a pop\-up message that reads:

&gt;See your FICO® Scores1 from all 3 bureaus  
&gt;  
&gt;Just $4.99 for the first month\*  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;\*Introductory price of $4.99 for your first month, then just $14.99 each additional month. Cancel anytime if not satisfied.

Isn't your official credit score supposed to be one of the things you can get once a year for free from Experian due to federal law? Did something change, or was the credit score not included in the free report? 

I feel like, with employment, housing, lending, investment, and more potentially depending on my credit score, I should have a fundamental right to see my official score from the Big Three without paying for the privilege. If Experian is supposed to supply me with my score, not just the facts of my report, who should I contact about this?

Thanks in advance for any guidance!",finance
personalfinance,Will Closing a Bank Account Negatively Affect My Credit?,"Hi! 

I currently have 3 bank of america bank accounts. 1 is a savings and  the other 2 are checking account. 1 checking account I use as my normal account for going out to eat, shopping, etc. It is where my direct deposit is deposited. I have another checking account that I use only for paying my bills. Every time I get paid I go in and immediately transfer the money needed for bills that need to be paid over the month as well as transfer money to savings leaving me with a smaller amount of ""spending money"" until my next paycheck. This system works great for me. The money can't get easily spent by accident and I know my bills and savings are taken care of right away. 

However - they just started imposing a monthly fee on my ""bill account"" I'm looking into moving this money into one of the online banks that has no fees associated with it since I don't ever withdraw or use the debit card for it. 

My question -- Would removing the money and closing the bank of america account negatively impact my credit score? I'm also considering moving most of my savings over to an online only bank that has a higher savings account interest rate as well and just leaving my savings in bank of america as my emergency money. Thoughts on your favorite online banks?

Ripple,Companies are like sheeps.,"Companies, especially non-investment banks, are very conservative / risk averse, and only move when the herd starts moving. But when the herd starts moving, it's unstoppable and massive. 

When the banking industry players notice more and more early Ripple Partners succeed in their pilots tests, cutting massive costs and gaining speed of execution, they'll quickly FOMO because the financial industry is extremely competitive and ripe for disruption, and none of the players here want to risk being the last to move.

So now they're all watching (some, laughing / fighting). 
Then soon enough they'll have to decide if they jump on board or laugh/fight a little more and take the risk of being left behind.

In 6 to 12 month I believe, billions will suddenly start pouring in, it'll be announcement after announcement.

In the end, no company will resist blockchain once it's been acknowledged / knighted / social-proofed by the business world &amp; institutions, and similarily no financial firm will resist Ripple products once their competitors &amp; partners start stepping in the train, because first movers advantage and FOMO. 

So just put your stack in a hardware wallet, and wait for the tide to arrive.

personalfinance,Flowchart 2: The Electric Boogaloo,"Hello PF! I commented on a thread the other day with my personal way of finding out what you should do with your money, which got a decent amount of updoots so I figured I'd share here in a post. When asking ""I have x amount of money, what do?"" I prioritize in the following way (which is *pretty* close to what the PF flowchart says):

-    $1000 emergency fund

-    Pay off all high interest debt, i.e. credit cards

-    401k matching percentage, at minimum

-    3 month e-fund

-   15% total income contribution towards retirement

-    6 month e-fund

-    Middle interest debt, i.e. a mortgage

-    If very risk averse, one year e-fund

-    Max out all tax-advantaged accounts (401k, IRA, HSA, etc.)

-    Lower interest debt, i.e. a car loan

-    Taxable brokerage


Change log, in the form of commonly asked questions that I get a lot:

&gt;Why $1000 dollars? 

This is a philosophy of Dave Ramsey. It's a somewhat easily obtainable goal for most, and it begins to work on stopping impulse spending. Of course there are other reasons to be in credit card debt, but I've found for the most part that it's due to consumerist culture. 

&gt;Why do you prioritize paying off credit cards before the 401k matching percentage?

This is another philosophy of Ramsey's, although I'm not quite as debt averse as he is. He would have you pay off *all* debt except your mortgage, in including lower interest debt like a car loan, before starting retirement contributions. The idea is that the psychological benefits of paying off debt will motivate you to start thinking about other longer term goals. Most humans are not wired to think that far into the future (retirement age), so the idea is to get you started by winning a shorter term goal.

However, on paper prioritizing 401k matching *before* credit card debt would actually make more sense, because it's a guaranteed 100% return on investment (assuming your employer matches dollar for dollar) as well as any market gains. Clearly this beats credit card interest at ~20% or whatever the interest rate your card is. Both sides of the argument should be considered.

&gt;Why do you split 3 and 6 month e-funds into separate nodes?

Once you have a 3 month buffer, the opportunity cost of *not* putting funds into retirement becomes greater than funneling it into your savings account. In my opinion, a 3 month e-fund should be plenty to float you through any middle-level to even higher-level emergency in cash without having to go into debt. The 6 month e-fund, prioritized after the 15% retirement node, is baked in to get you used to living off of ""less"" income if you aren't used to that smaller paycheck. 

&gt;Why do you prioritize paying off a mortgage before maxing out retirement?

I think paying extra towards a mortgage is highly undervalued on this sub. Not only do you get the guaranteed return on investment from the interest rate, you also get the ""unrealized gains"" from the housing market if you plan to sell the house. Alternatively, your house becomes *part of* your retirement package, winning you a place to stay rent-free (with the small pittance of property taxes, maintenance, etc.). And once again, I'll circle back to the psychological benefits of being debt free. Once a big debt like a mortgage is paid off, a person is much more likely to stick to a ""scarier"" plan like maxing out a 401k. A house, they can physically see. A 401k, not so much unless you constantly have your account on auto-refresh (not a good idea by the way! This might lead to bad financial practices such as panic selling when your stock picks take a dip).

&gt;Eww a Dave Ramsey fan, that must mean you follow all his advice including the bad stuff!

No, lmao. I attempt to combine the best practices from his teachings and those of this sub to create the best mix/balance of financially prudent versus psychological benefits of being debt free. I do *not* condone some of his other questionable (and/or straight up BAD) advice such as his high-fee retirement plans.

personalfinance,How to prepare for student loan repayment as a current student?,"I have just finished my second year of my bachelor's degree in computer science. Unfortunately, I go to one of the most expensive public universities in the country and I am going to have soooo much debt when I graduate. My parents make too much for me to qualify for any grants but they make too little to help with the tuition. So I am 100% on my own in this endeavor. By the time I graduate, I will most likely have about $120K in debt based on my estimations.

My question is: what can I do to prepare for this loan repayment when I graduate in two years? Obviously, getting a good job would be the best option. The average pay for graduates of my major from my school is about $77K, but I'm hoping to make more than that. I have an internship this summer and I'm hoping to get an even better one for next summer on top of doing research potentially. So I am starting to build a decent resume to put myself in that situation.

Most of my loans are private loans through Sallie Mae and I got HORRIBLE interest rates despite my dad cosigning (his credit score is high 700s) and my own credit score of low-to-mid 700s. Most of my rates are just below 10% so obviously I need to refinance ASAP. Any tips for that?

I'm also starting to think about where I would live after I graduate and as much as I would love to go after a Silicon Valley job, I've pretty much eliminated that as an option. I'm looking into Seattle potentially just because the pay for CS jobs is high but without the crazy Bay Area cost of living. I'm also interested in Colorado and Texas which have quite low cost of living as well. Of course, I could stay in my home state of PA or the East coast in general, but I'm looking to move west if possible. If anyone knows of any other booming tech areas that are cheap to live in let me know please.

Finally, what lifestyle choices can I make to prepare for my loan repayment? I would say I live somewhat frugally currently, but any advice is appreciated.


TL;DR: I'll be graduating with 120K in debt, what can I do to make it not suck?",finance
personalfinance,"I'm about to receive my first commission check and have the option of withholding Federal taxes, what would be the best thing to do in this situation?","Hello! I work in a sales position with base + commission salary... My first big commission check is coming up and my employer gives us the option of whether we would like to withhold Federal income tax or not. I spoke with our tax guys and this is what he told me: 

""The “normal” taxes would be 7.65% FICA (MED/SS), which is required. 22% for Federal Income Tax. And State &amp; County is usually between 5-7% combined.

Some people prefer to do no Federal Income Tax, or maybe they have a particular percent in mind. So you are welcome to email me to request changes on anything you like."" 


My commission total is going to be around $13k, so with the normal taxes taken out, I would be taking home around $8.5k. I was leaning towards just having all the normal taxes taken out to avoid any issues next tax season when filing my return, but just wanted to get some insight/Pros and Cons from this group before I confirm with my employer! 

Another thing to bring up is that business has been going down for our company recently and I might be changing jobs in the near future.. not sure if that affects what I should do now, but figured I'd include that in my post as well.

personalfinance,Mortgage Lump Sum Payment,"Hi All,

I have a question about lump sum payment. I am into 4th year of my 30 year mortgage. It was originally 280,000 and now I have 250,000 remaining. I have 80,000 sitting in my saving account and it has an interest rate of 0.5 &amp;#37;. My wife has about 60,000 in her saving account with same interest rate. Our family income is 165,000 per year. I am thinking of making a lump sum payment and want some suggestions from great people here.

My contract with mortgage company has following in the contract.

**You may pay more than your regular payments without charge as follows:**

**\(a\) You may once in each year of the term, at any time, increase your regular payment amount by up to 20\% of the principal and interest payment set out in the mortgage. Your request to increase the payment amount must be made at least 5 days before the regularly scheduled payment date on which you want the increase to be in effect.**

**You may pay up to 20\% of the original principal amount of the loan each year without a prepayment charge. Prepayments can be made at any time, but must be in the amounts of at least $500. Prepayment privileges for one year do not carry forward to future years.**

I want to pay off the mortgage as soon as possible and possibly buy a bigger house and rent the current house when house prices go down a bit. What it my best course of action here ?

personalfinance,Secure software/website/app to handle various types of financial holdings?,"I went to my elderly mother's place yesterday and she tried showing me all her accounts, what was making money, what wasn't, when she had due dates to move money, etc. but I wasn't able to comprehend everything.


My mom is very financially secure, with most of her holdings in a trust that my brother and I are named in.  She's very healthy and God willing there is no need for me to have to be involved yet in any of her holdings, but I'm very worried about the way that all her account information, profits, etc are written in a hundred different pieces of scrap paper.  On top of all this, she's constantly had issues with brokers who she's told not to do certain deals and they do it anyway.  For example a broker recently used money from the wrong account which then cost her a lot in taxes.


To top this all off, she tried explaining to me how each account works, when to pull money from which account, what account is tax-free, etc and my eyes glossed over.


I've tried to get her to use Excel or a Google Sheets for some of this documentation, but she's very worried about security.  I'm hoping that I can find a solution that has multi factor authentication so I can show her it's very secure.   She also wants to share access with me, so I can be aware of her accounts and I won't need to chase down banks and accountants, which would be very helpful.  She's given me account numbers every year, but she also changes accounts a few times a year, chasing after interest rates.  She is doing all her profit info by hand as well as using a paper calendar to monitor due and expiration dates.


Online, she is using Yahoo to monitor her stocks and the Harbor Group website to manage some of her investments.  She also has:

Money markets

IRAs

CDs

Preferred shares

Bonds

Shares

Real estate investments (harbor Group)

Savings accounts

Checking accounts


Is there a website/app/software that has 2 factor authentication, that can handle all the above holdings, and that she can share with me read access.   Bonus if it also has a training wheels mode for someone that will have to eventually inherits all these accounts but has no idea what to do with any of them.

personalfinance,Consolidating debt into mortgage,"This is my first post here and I first wanted to thank everyone for the advice I've seen in every post since I subscribed.

One of the posts I read recently mentioned rolling existing debt into a mortgage when a home is purchased and it peaked my curiosity. Can someone explain if this a common practice, and if so what typically is factored in? 

I used to work in debt consolidation for personal loans below $10k, so I have some base knowledge around factoring debt: income when applying for loans and meeting an ability to pay break point for eligibility on loans. 

When I purchased my home almost a year ago we had to look for an amount that would meet our budget given that my wife and I are paying an enormous amount in student debt as well. Given our incomes at the time, $60k/$34.5k and our SL payments at about $2k/month (rounding up) we were allowed to reach a monthly payment of$1500 (all escrow and PMI included). The home we purchased ended up being $1,051/month. 

As we have lived in our starter home we are now looking to see what we would like in our next home as our family grows, but I feel constrained by our budget and do not feel it to be a reality unless some major income changes occur. 

Our current incomes are about $48.5k/$51k, home was $135k, SL at about $90k/90k. (Mostly federal SL, about half of mine is personal. The federal are mixed between subsidized and unsubsidized).

Given the amount of debt we have, does it seem plausible that we would be able to consolidate the SL debt into a mortgage and reduce total monthly payment amount?

Again, but in more detail, our monthly loan payments are: Mortgage $1,051, personal SL $450, federal SL $300, federal SL on income based repayment $970. My SL are on shorter terms than my wife's, my wife's is already on a 30yr plan I believe. 

I apologize this a long post, but I was hoping to hear some viewpoints. Perhaps I'm most interested because our mortgage company that helped us secure our house did not mention consolidating SL as an option, it was never part of the discussion.

Long time lurker on this sub, but now I'm in need of your help! So here's the story of how my life got turn upside down (a bit of fresh prince to start us off):

1) I have ~14k in a new car loan I still have yet to pay off at around ~5% interest.

2)I'm 27, and have ~$6k in the bank.

3) I live in the northeast, and will be moving south (either atlanta or miami) for grad school (PA school to be exact; 2.5 year program roughly). So that means paying for apartment, school, and living expenses via loans (which I don't have a lot of experience with other than my car).

4) I have ~$7,300 in a state retirement fund that no longer grows. but if I were to withdraw the funds a 20% federal tax, 7.75% state tax, and another 10% additional tax because i would withdraw before 59.5 years old.





This would be my first major move away from home, and would pretty much be without support. So other than general advice anyone would be able to give some specific questions I have are:

1) Is there anyway I can put my car loan under my student loan so I can keep my car (which I'll need for getting around), and pay it off later?

2) Is there a commonly used loan to pay for grad school living?

3) Would it be best to rent, or to buy a place with said loan if rent cost=mortgage cost?

4) How do loans for living expenses work? Example: I need food for the month. Do I need to write a budget and tell them how much money I need? Or do I keep the receipts and give them over to be covered by the loan?

5) As you can tell by now I have hardly any experience with how loans of this nature work, and how I should budget to come out the other end without getting shafted. ANY and all advice would help

personalfinance,28 year old finally landed dream job with 10k in credit debt. Looking for best way to pay it off,"Hey y’all!

I’ve been working for the past 2 1/2 years as a freelance production assistant in Esports and was finally able to land a job in gaming as a community manager making 40K/yr with full benefits. 

I went from making anywhere between 800-1600 a month if I had decent contracts, but I ended up putting a lot of charges on my credit card when I had slow months with no gigs. 

My monthly expenses are roughly 1000 dollars including rent, credit card payment (usually the minimum), gas (I live in SoCal), and entertainment. 

I’ve already called Wells Fargo and I was informed that despite being with them for roughly 10 years they would not be able to lower my interest rate which is currently 20%. 

I’m looking into either getting a personal loan with a low rate or doing a balance transfer with another bank. Before I do I wanted to ask what everyone here thinks would be the best way for me to get rid of this debt or at least lower it significantly. 

Thank you in advance!",finance
personalfinance,"It's just $2k, but I'd love advice on how to show it the respect it deserves (my dad passed away and left it to me)","My dad died recently, and he had a death benefit with his pension that will pay me a one-time sum of $2,000. I know that’s a small amount, but I want to honor him by maximizing it. I’ve narrowed my options to two choices:


--I can take a lump sum, and they’ll withhold 20% for Fed taxes. If I choose this, I’d stash the $1600 in my savings, which has an APY of 1.5%.


--I can roll over the full $2,000 to an inherited IRA. I have an established inherited IRA created from being a beneficiary on my aunt’s pension. I don’t know if I can roll over to an established inherited IRA, or if I have to open a new one. If possible, I’d like to roll this sum over to my established one. In 2017, I had almost 22% growth on that account.


A little more info: I don’t particularly need to spend $1600 on anything right now. I have car debt and a few thousand in CC debt, but all of those debts are at 0% interest. 


Also I’m totally open to other options.

personalfinance,"25, doing well. Pay off a portion of student loans?","I wanted to get opinions on a large scale from the community that has helped me before. 

Detail/Assets. I’m 25 living in Boston with a job that pays me $75k/year. I have $15k in savings and $16k in a brokerage account. My 401k contribution is all in at 9%. My monthly expenses without trying to cut costs are at $3k on a bad month. 

Debt. I have $23k in Federal student loan debt, mostly subsidized averaging under 5%. I also have $20.6k discover loans that are half 6-8.2% and half at 5%. I’m currently paying $207/month for the discover loans and have 12.5 years of payments left. 

I’m wondering if it’s wise to pay off my discover loans and free up the payments I’m making so I can put them towards a car (passion) which I’ll need anyway once my free lease expires. The market seems to be peaking here and I’m not sure if it makes sense to keep it there, especially since I tend to pick the losers. I invested $12k in safe ETFs right as the market peaked two months ago. Literally timed it to buy in right at the top, so that’s left me with a bad taste. My 401k had a 29% return last year so at least there’s that. 

Edit. On top of my expenses and 401k I’m saving $800-$1,000/month. If that changes anything.",finance
personalfinance,Should I take out student loans to fund mine and my wife's ROTH IRA's?,"Please put all of the ethics questions to the side and look at this strictly from a financial perspective.

I have college completely paid for through my father, and am considering taking out federal loans to front-load our IRA's to get a head start in retirement.  

I have already taken out about $10,000 to supplement our income, but I now have a better job with the state to where I no longer need to do that.  

I am going to school part-time and will not graduate for the next 6-7 years.  I am approved for at least $10,000 a year and would take out a loan every year, resulting in about 70-80 thousand dollars in debt.  I would put the majority of that into our Roth's each year and either save or invest the rest in a brokerage account.  I plan to work very hard to ensure that I am able to get another job with the state once I graduate (as a civil engineer starting anywhere from 45-60K a year), get put on an Income Based Repayment (IBR) plan, and after 10 years of qualifying payments, utilize the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program.

Every time I run the numbers it ends up being a pretty good deal, with me paying back around 40-50K (through the IBR), netting about 20-30K, and getting a nice retirement cushion early in life that I can possibly pull from for a down-payment on a house.

The only thing that worries me, is the possibility of the PSLF going away, or me deciding that I no longer want a career with the state and go find another job.  My main drive to work at the state is the benefits (I would most likely be able to retire by age 51).

Am I being naive, or is this actually a very viable financial decision?  For me personally, the reward outweighs the risk.  Thank you all for your feedback.",finance

personalfinance,Value of credit bump from auto loan?,"**TL;DR** Got talked into an auto loan for the credit benefits. Have the cash to pay it off. Would paying this interest over 48mo significantly improve mortgage rates for me later?

Mid-20's. I bought my first car recently. I was ready to pay in full, but I got talked into paying some and financing the rest. I feel like an idiot for getting swindled but that's another story.

The argument of the finance guy was: despite my decent credit score, I had no loans of any kind in my history (true, except a couple credit cards I pay off monthly). So when I go to get a big loan like a mortgage, I may have trouble getting approved for a decent interest rate. So by financing part of the car I could show my ability to responsibly manage an account and secure a much better mortgage later.

It made sense at the time, but in hindsight I'm not sure the credit effects are worth the 7% APR over 4 years. Should I just pay it off? The numbers:

* Income: $~85k
* Principal: $~9000
* APR: 7.5%
* Remaining term: 45 mo
* Credit score: was ~770, after loan ~700, now back to ~720

EDIT: Looks like a consensus, I should just pay it off now. Thanks very much for responding. Next time, I'll be sure to completely ignore every word the slimy loan shark says :)",finance

personalfinance,Got a check from the IRS instead of a direct deposit. Questions.,"Hi PF,

I'm not really sure if this is the right sub for it, but here goes.s I had filed for my federal taxes jointly with my wife and had put in my direct deposit information so that the refund could be deposited into my bank account.

But I received a check today from the US treasury rather than a direct deposit. The amount is slightly different than what was on my 1040, by about $30. I verified from the US Treasury website to make sure that the check was not a scam, and it did verify that the check was indeed from the US Treasury. I have a couple of questions about it. Is this is a mistake from the IRS and should I return the check ? Or is it okay for me to go ahead and deposit the check in my bank account ?

The other question, in the event that I do deposit the check, will the account need to be a joint account since the check is addressed to both me and my wife? I've never dealt with joint checks before and we don't have a joint account. So I'm not sure if my bank will accept the joint check if it is being deposited into a sole account. 

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,"Debt Management and Payment plans, how can I improve my future financial situation?","First of all thanks for taking the time to read this.

I am a 27 year old trying to make my current financial situation much better than it is. Before I go into what I owe and what I make I'll give you a short background. I got a bachelors and a masters. Currently have my whole family overseas and I'd like to send some money monthly. I am not working in my field (basic, biochemical, clinical science/research) because after graduating I got the first jobs I could get. At the moment I am working two jobs about 60-80 hours per week.

In between school (~$150k), credit cards (~4k) and my living expenses (~1k/month) it keeps me busy and worried even though I make about double my living expenses each month. My biggest problem is eating out but it's something I am working on since I put some weight on and its not winter any more. 

What I could use help with is determining what my focus should be with the extra money I make. Should I go after the credit cards and then focus on the school loans? Right now, I am spreading my expenses out so much I feel I am not making a difference in my debt. I also am in need of a new car but I am not going to get one until I can pay for a used car completely.

I am hoping to get into medical school, which would alleviate some of the stress and help with some of the expenses if I am granted a scholarship. However, the problems would still stand and I still need to improve on my management skills. I appreciate any advice you can offer and thank you for taking the time.

Edit:
I can make anywhere from 2-2.4k monthly depending on the hours. 

Monthly expenses involve:
Rent - 600
Car insurance - 40
Cellphone 50
Food - 200 per month (give or take)
Netflix - 15
HBO - 15
Gas - 100 per month (may go up to 150 if I go hiking at most)
Cable/Internet - About 75 (shared)
Light - 50-75 (shared)
Going out - 100 per month (ideally, not reality atm)

So monthly expenses are about 1400, possibly more..

Interest rates for the loans range from 4.6 and higher, but I am not 100% sure atm. 

I also forgot to mention I owe family members money who I also have been paying. About $600 to one uncle left over, and getting this scholarship to medical school (if I get in) would mean it'd be paid off entirely (hopefully).",finance

I have a question I hope someone can help me with.

I filed my tax return through TurboTax and it was fairly uneventful. Then a few days later I realized I forgot to add a 1099. It was just one 1099 and a pretty vanilla one at that for just $1000. That said, I wanted to get it corrected.

I made the amendments online via TurboTax and it told me I needed  to print and send in the changes. Everything I've read says to send the 1040X and anything that is adjusted .... but I'm not sure what all that would be. Again, this is just one missed 1099 for $1000. What all would I need to send in, aside from the extra $200 or so due in taxes because of this changes.

CryptoCurrency,"Hard truths I wish people told me in December Part 2 (Yes, I’m back)","Hey everyone. My hard truths post I mentioned some of my predictions for this year and in a later post I said I will be leaving until the end of the year. I was roasted by the vast majority of the community. Even a popular character in this community wrote me an essay basically breaking down what I’m doing is wrong, and said I’m a danger to people. This killed my motivation to make posts because I was just getting attacked everytime. I’ll be honest those comments genuinely hurt me. But not because I thought they were true. But because they were turning people away from the genuine information I was trying to give. And I am back because there is still time to help people. The market will stabilize in a couple years and these gains won’t be possible again. Here are those posts.

And no this isn’t an I told you so moment. Truth is I don’t care about being right. I am here to help people, and that is my sole mission. The way the world is setup to be a corporate slave for 40 years and retire and do things you want to do when your body gives out isn’t right. Im here for financial freedom and I hope you guys reach that goal as well. What I will say and will continue to say till the day I die is this. Crypto is not random. It was never random. There is a method to this madness. Sure, you will have oddballs like tron or verge which you can’t predict. But there are stuff you can predict. If I had started sooner I wouldn’t of missed vechain or nano, and I know I wouldn’t of. The signs were there

I said I am never buying anyones top. Ever. Never again. I felt like an idiot buying the top in December and holding bags of coins that others sold and made millions. I listened to a lot of posts here and it ruined me. Like I said people will mention how great of an opportunity ven at $5 is but will call it a scam at 20 cents. These same people scuffed at tomo, bottos, origin trail, or even matrix ai network, but I bet they look appealing now. You have to get out of this mindset. I don’t recommend buying any of those coins now, even though I still hold a good portion of them today. Why am I telling you not to buy stuff I’m holding? Well, because they now offer more downside then upside. (Ok exaggeration they still have great upside but I’m making this point) High market-cap coins are riskier then low market-caps with good fundamentals.  You have to look at crypto as risk vs reward. What is the reward of buying $10 nano? It will have to go through hoops and great lengths to get to $100 and if that does happen it won’t be nano alone. It will be a bull market and everything would have risen so it won’t be an outlier. 

People said I was inexperienced even after I mentioned my hundreds of hours of research. They wanted results, well here they are today. I lost 70-80% of my portfolio in January. With that little I had left I managed to 10x my original investment in a garbage market. It wasn’t luck, and will never be luck. This time around I’m not going to post coins i like today here. I will be posting on my profile. Also, I won’t mention how I make my picks. That info is all there in my history. I just wanna say the opportunity of a lifetime is here. People will crap on you. They will laugh at you. They will call you an idiot. And I’m not talking just about reddit. My own friends thought I was crazy. My parents said I was wasting my time. I didn’t let the faze me. I did my research. I knew the potential was there and I kept that will to keep on going. Those same friends are now asking me for advice on coin picks. I will be a millionaire by the end of the year. (I am far from it atm havent broken 6 digits) But I say that with the same confidence I had months ago. Stay hustling guys. Set a goal w/e that may be, stay focused and keep going. This is the biggest transfer of wealth in human history. Don’t let anyone get in your way.

One of my wife’s family members has passed and we are about to inherit around $100k from their estate. Our #1 goal right now is to buy a house in about two years. What I need help figuring out is what to do with the money in the mean time until we’re ready to use it for a down payment. 

We have less than $3k in credit card debt. It seems obvious to me that we should pay that off immediately. 

We also have two auto loans at 2.99% and 3.29%. From my understanding, we might actually make more investing the money than we would save by paying these loans off early. 

Finally, our bank has really competitive interest rates on savings and CD accounts. 1.50% for savings accounts and 2.00% for 12 month CD’s. I know these are the absolute safe choice but even at those interest rates the money is still losing value. 

I’ve been looking at things like S&amp;P 500 Index Funds. The rate of return looks great, but they’re rated as “high risk, high return”. We would be absolutely devastated if we lost this money. Is an investment account like that really that high of a risk?

Also, a small chunk of the money will come to us in an IRA account. We don’t know what the rate on it is yet. We plan to withdraw this money at some point to use with the rest to buy a house.

personalfinance,Mortgage company didn't remove the charge from my property after mortgage was paid off. Will this have affected my credit score?,"[UK] I bought a building that was made up of three flats so I could renovate them. I got a bridging loan in Dec 2016 and sold one of the flats in July 2017 and paid off the bridging loan in full. 

Because the property was made up of 3 flats, the mortgage company put a charge on each flat and the freehold = 4 charges.

I am in the process of applying for a mortgage and the broker told me yesterday that there is still a charge on the property. 3 had been removed but one remained. 

My solicitor has known about this for 10 months but didn't tell me, and lied and said she couldn't get through to the mortgage company to sort it. I called them and got through in 5 mins. Charge was removed within 15 mins.

Does having a charge on a property affect your credit score?  The only debt I have is a credit card and the last 8 months of a personal loan, but it also looked like I had a bridging loan as well, for 10 months longer than I should have. 

As far as I understand, your credit score has a bearing on what interest rates you pay on loans or mortgages, is that correct? 

I read somewhere that it takes 4 to 6 weeks for your credit score to update so will I have to wait another month or so to see what my new credit report says?  but presumably this won't change the interest rate I've been quoted....

Forex,AUD/CAD: Fundamental Review &amp; Forecast,"Sanctions resumption against Iran impacted the oil value and supports the CAD, as do the strong macroeconomic statistics. The deals to SELL seem the most effective.

The rates continue within a downtrend. The Canadian dollar is strengthening due to the rapid growth of oil value and good macroeconomic statistics. The Australian dollar has nothing to oppose this situation. Oil becomes more expensive due to geopolitical factors because the USA withdrew from the agreement on the nuclear program of Iran. They also plan to resume sanctions against Iran in full. This could lead to a disruption in oil supplies from Iran and some deficit of oil on the market. It is possible that oil will rise in price to $100 by the moment the sanctions are implemented again. The US actions are not supported in the EU and supposedly that this can lead to geopolitical tensions in the region.

The latest data about the Canadian economy shows continued economic growth. Investors were especially pleased with the PMI Ivey index of business activity which in April rose to 71.5 pips against 59 a month earlier. This is the highest level since 2011. The number of building permits increased by 3.1&amp;#37; in March, also exceeding investors' expectations.

Today the Canadian dollar may receive new support with recent data on the labor market. On Monday will held a meeting of the RBA, which once again will make a decision about the rate. Given the current situation in the Australian economy and the RBA's commitment to a soft monetary policy, the rate is likely to remain at the same level. This, of course, will have a negative impact on the AUD in the short term.

https://i.redd.it/p8mygk83n8x01.jpg

 In this situation the most effective would be the deals on the trend. Oil, influenced by geopolitical factors, will continue to grow with the resumption of sanctions against Iran, or consolidate at the current high level of 70\-72 dollars. In any case, at the moment, the situation is fully in favor of the Canadian dollar. The Stochastic oscillator confirms the efficiency of short deals, taking into account the recently passed price correction and the current rates in the overbought zone.",finance

* $12,000 in student loans, not sure on the interest rate but it is though Edfinancial Services and I think it is low (~4%-5%). Current monthly minimum is $115/month
* $4,100 in cash in my checking account (I know most of it should be in savings)
* A leased car which the lease is up in April 2019.
* Living with parents but would like my own place in a few months.

After going through my budget and deducting taxes, insurance, car payments, cell phone, food, etc. I am left with $1,400/month before any rent/mortgage expenses.

After talking to some people, the general consensus is that I should focus on CC debt and just pay the minimum on student loans. I could technically just pay off my credit card right now, however, I don't know if that is a good idea? The last two things are what is throwing me off. I want to move out in a few months and get a place of my own. I have half my family and friends telling me to buy a house and rent out rooms to supplement more income. The other half is telling me to rent for a while. I'm leaning towards renting for six months to a year after I move out and save up some money then buy a house.

The other thing I need to take into account is that in April 2019 I will have to decide what to do for a car since my lease will be up. I'm not sure if it will be best to lease a new car, buy my current car, buy a ""new"" used car? Not only that but what should I be doing savings wise between now and then to be ready when my lease expires? I should also mention that my job is going to be travel heavy. I don't know how heavy yet, but that is what I have been told.

personalfinance,Is it ever wise to finance a car for 60months ?,"Hi all
I’m getting ready to purchase a used 2013 Lexus gs350 with 60k miles for 21k. Taxes in my state are 6.25% and I’m buying from a private seller. I will be paying the seller $3500 and financing the rest. 

Which financing term should I select? Should I do 60 months and take advantage of the low payments? But pay extra payments? Does this actually knock down your principle? Or are you paying towards the interest first? 

Should I do 48 months?

personalfinance,6k credit card debt w/ good credit. Should I get a personal loan?,"I had a career switch about 1 1/2 yrs ago and I took a large pay cut, but am overall much happier. During that time I had to adjust to a lifestyle change, a divorce, and medical bills which have resulted in me acruing about 6k in debt. I've finally reached a stable point with my finances and I've managed to cut the following expenses: drinking at the bar every weekend, Netflix, eating out for lunch, and movies. This has managed to save me quite a bit of money and I'd like to start paying off the rest of my debt, but would like some advice.

I have $3,000 of debt on a 0% interest card and I have 15 months to pay it off. I'm paying $300 a month on that card and I'm not using it for anything else. 

My other card has a balance of $3,000 and I use that card for gas and bills in order to get reward points. It has an interest rate or 22% and I manage to pay $500-600 a month on it but it goes right back up after interest and bills so the balance never goes down. Instead it hovers around the $3000 range and I can never seem to bring it below that for a long period of time. 

I have great credit and I've looked into a personal loan for 5k with an 8.9% interest rate. I feel that's very reasonable and I'm considering taking the loan and paying off as much debt as possible with it. 

Does anyone else have any advice? Should I take the loan? How long should I pay the loan off for? Are there other options?",finance

personalfinance,Letting rental go into foreclosure-continue to rent?,"Has anyone continued to rent their property while its in foreclosure?  Long story short I have a rental property that the mortgage was discharged on back in 2013 in a CH7 BK.  Fast forward to now, we purchased another home and after renting out our first home for a while but had to stop paying because of other financial issues.  We have good tenants who pay on time and take good care of the property.  Their lease is through November of this year and I have a sense that they may want to re-up.  I just got a very carefully NOI letter from the bank's attorney explaining that that they are not attempting to collect the debt (which would be in violation of the BK discharge) but rather collect the collateral. Otherwise it signals the beginning of the judicial foreclosure process here in NJ.  I suppose there are two schools of thought here:

Do Nothing/Attempt a Deed-In-Lieu:

Allowing the process to run its course as quickly as possible or attempting to accelerate it means that we will be off title sooner.  At this point, since the old mortgage is listed as discharged in BK on our credit report and our credit scores are currently 700+, this is really is only a financial issue in terms of if we want to refinance our existing house.  The other issue is just liability for the property-especially if it eventually becomes unoccupied.  Also, I refuse to let the property fall into disrepair out of respect for my old neighbors who we are still friends with (we only live about 10 minutes away now)-so I'll need to hire a lawn service, keep the electric on, etc...if its empty.  

File Answers/Motions in Court, Drag the Process Out and Continue to Rent:

As I said, my current tenants will likely want to sign a new lease in November.  Legally I would be required to inform them that the property is in foreclosure as a Lis Pendens will certainly have been filed by then.  However, they themselves went through a foreclosure a few years ago, so if I explained to them that under NJ (and I believe federal at this point) law they would be protected for the duration of the lease even if the property were to be taken back by the bank that they would understand.  The advantage here would be continued cash flow from the property and built-in property maintenance as the tenant mows the lawn, rakes the leaves, clears the snow, etc...",finance

On top of this, my employer will reimburse me for a percentage of my tuition costs, say 75%, so $15k/year. Assume I will only make qualified withdrawals. The part I'm most confused about is how contributions are reported and taxed between state and federal.

- One of the above articles states that ""Contributions to a 529 plan do not have to be reported on your federal tax return"" which sounds wrong, unless there is some difference between contributions from payroll vs. from a personal account. Can someone clarify what this is supposed to mean?
- According to the IRS site, ""Contributions can not exceed the amount necessary to provide for the qualified education expenses [...]"". I'm not sure what this means; if I expect to have $40k in expenses for the year will I be penalized for contributing $50k? I won't know until the end of the year what my total education expenses would be.
- Given the above, what is the best way to reduce my taxable income for the year on the federal return?
- NYS allows up to $10k deduction for married filing jointly which suggests that I would still report my total income and pay the usual state tax.
- Gift tax limits in this case is irrelevant as I am both the account owner and beneficiary, correct?",finance

personalfinance,Does health insurance typically pay for and/or subsidize prescriptions? [US],"I am trying to understand if having health insurance affects paying for prescription medications. I am young and dumb; I realize these are rudimentary questions.

My doctor recently prescribed me a drug that I need to take on a daily basis, for an indefinite amount of time. This is basically my very first experience of having to make a prescription drug a regular part of my life.

So, I went to my local grocery store (Meijer) to pick the prescription up and paid for the prescription with my credit card.

I am curious if having medical insurance benefits me at all, when it comes to prescriptions.

For example, does medical insurance typically inherently contain a ""negotiated discount"" on prescriptions, where if I show my insurance card to the pharmacy tech at Meijer, they will give me a discount on the purchase?

Do prescriptions ever function similarly to medical bills, in that the insurance company and I ""split the bill"" (as opposed to paying for prescriptions entirely out-of-pocket)?

As I was reading about this subject online, I came across a company named ""Express Scripts."" My understanding is that this is basically an online store for purchasing prescriptions. But, I don't get how it is better than Meijer (or any local pharmacy), exactly. Does medical insurance only pay for prescriptions that are ordered from Express Scripts? If so, why?

I understand that the answers to my questions will vary based on my actual provider/plan, but I am not looking for specific answers, as much as I simply want a general, baseline understanding of how things work.

If you really find out the next ETH run , you should have a solid understanding of why ETH performed very well.What was the reason behind it? Do you think it is just marketing? Absolutely not!

Lets examine, what is making big money…

Before ETH, it was all Bitcoin. It was the idea of blockchain etc, you know the story. Bitcoin was a transformation from fiat currency to digital currency, first of its kind. It was a revolution , so it made fortunes for that lucky bastards who hold on to their Bitcoins. I am jealous of them. It was a idealogical revolution.

But, something changed with the arrival of ETH. It was also a digital asset but the main thing that made that huge gains was the ""Smart Contract"" idea. It the transformed “digital asset” into something that can be transformed into any shape the user wants to . It was like invention of ""digital check"". It was a redefinition. It was also a idealogical revolution.

After BTC or ETH, we have seen so many replicas of them. Some even did performed better than BTC or ETH but they never succeed as Bitcoin or ETH did. Because they didn’t have anything original. The market rewarded the revolutionary idea while gave almost nothing to replicas, so to say.

Now we have Fusion, with a revolutionary idea.

People haven’t noticed it yet. Still , some ICO Reviewers took a look at it but didn’t see the hidden gem. They didn’t see the revolutionary idea behind it. Probably because they have IT background.

Let me explain to you,

Briefly, just like ETH transformed “digital assets” into “digital checks” that you can custom the date or the terms of execution. Fusion is transforming the “digital assets” into “ digital bonds” “ digital loans” “digital equities” “ digital discounted cash flows”. Simple is that. This is also an idealogical revolution.

Loans, bonds, Treasury bills , these instruments are all calculated and traded on a financial logic. That logic is “ Discounting the future cash flows into today and adding them up” . That’s the way how a bond, loan, bill or any financial asset is valued. If you don’t have a token, that naturally you can define it as a sum of “ discounted cash flow series” , that coin is worthless in Finance. This is what Ian Balina doesn’t know while shilling Wanchain. If he had spend long hours valuing bonds, cash flows like I did, you would have seen that Fusion has the right tool to do it.

While there are many competitors in the Cryptospace who want to replace the Financial Infrastructure of the CryptoFinance. Only Fusion’s token has the right Token to do so.

To be the CryptoFinancial infrastructure, one blockchain has to be interoperable. That is a must. It is necessary but not sufficient. The token should be defined and made properly.

What others don’t have the right token. Fusion has it!

Fusion token , is going to be such a way that, it will enable time or event triggers. Which is a must for fixing interest rates , Options, insurance events or almost any financial event. An option will always have a condition like “ If BTC trades above 10.000 usd” then I will have the right to but Bitcoin at @9.500 usd, for example. This is an event trigger.

Or lets talk about bonds, loans; I will try to keep it simple as I can.

Suppose , you will have 100 Usd in a years time ( Flow A). And another 100 usd in 2 years time( Flow B) , another 100 usd after 3 ( Flow C )years time. And also interest rates in the economy is %10 ( too high just for the sake of example)

Flow A will worth : 90 usd today. You have to discount 100 usd by %10 interest per year ( 1 year time trigger)

Flow B: will worth: 81 usd today. Because there are two period to discount. We discount them twice ( 2 year time trigger)

Flow C: will worth 74 usd today. As we discount 100 usd for 3 times

So totally a cash flow like this will worth 90+81+74=245 usd.

You can exchange this Cash Flow with 245 usd. These are the same things.

That what banks do when they give you the loan. They price it like this. They give you 245 usd, and expect 100 usd each year for the next 3 years.

Fusion token will naturally will have this discounted cashflow pricing mechanism embedded into its native token.

That’s why Fusion is so big.. It doesn’t matter what alliances you make or what connections you have. It doesn’t matter how many shiller say it is gonna X1000, if you don’t have the right tool. It is just hype!

Fusion is the CyrptoFinance token to rule all financial transactions.

If you look at Fusion’s WP, you will find out where there is a huge gap in finance. And also realize that ordinary tokens or coins can not fill that gap without having tokens specially designed for it.

personalfinance,Is it better to lease or buy a vehicle in my situation?,"I realize that the most optimal financial solution with a vehicle is to buy a 5\-10 year old vehicle and drive it into the ground. However, I am now in my mid 30s and have a wife and soon a baby. I am not poor anymore, but I'm not so rich that I can afford to waste money either. When I was younger, my automotive decisions were purely financial. Now, I am looking to find a balance between quality of life and finances. If I have to pay slightly more per month to have a new car and not have to deal with the hassles of buying and selling and maintenance, I think it's worth it. Some more details:

* I work from home and rarely drive places more than 10 miles from my home, so I drive less than 10k miles per year typically, even with an annual road trip.
* I am self employed, so I may be able to deduct more on my taxes if I lease vs finance a vehicle, since principal payments are not tax deductible. About 15&amp;#37; of my driving can be classified as for business use. Not sure if this helps me at all, and I haven't factored it into the rough math below.
* I don't want to expend much time or effort messing with a vehicle \- I don't see cars as a hobby, merely a way to safely and comfortably transport me. The less time I spend in shops or having to worry about the vehicle, the better.
* I would prefer not to have to drive a vehicle more than 5\-6 years old.
* I have more than enough cash on hand to outright buy a vehicle and have excellent credit \- no need to even finance, although if I get a super low interest rate it might make more sense to finance and just invest what I would have put in to buying it 100&amp;#37; up front.
* My wife and I have worked our asses off for all of our lives and lived like paupers to get to a good financial position and would like to finally start to enjoy things in life.
* I'm looking to buy/lease a vehicle less than 2 years old and then probably get a new one after 3\-4 years and repeat this cycle ad infinitum. 

I talked to a dealership and did some quick and dirty math. I'm by no means an expert here, so I apologize if my math and logic here are lacking. The car is worth about $30k. I can lease it for about $260/month with $2k due at signing. 36 month lease. That's a little over $11k. I can buy a two old version of the vehicle \(which is generally recommended so I don't take the huge initial depreciation hit right?\) for about $20k. After three years it will probably be worth about $12k which means I essentially paid $8k. So buying comes out a little cheaper in the long run \($3k over three years\), but with leasing I get to drive a brand new car and don't have to mess with the hassles of buying and selling a vehicle. However, what if I need to get out of the lease early or end up needing to drive over the allowed mileage? I can't say 100&amp;#37; sure that that won't be the case, so this must be factored into my decision. I have never leased a car and don't know how it works exactly.",finance
personalfinance,"Spend $2,000 on a cheap car, or get an auto loan with 0 credit? (22 years old)","Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask. I'm just looking for the most Financially responsible solution to this problem.

For clarity I'm currently receiving Social Security Disability benefits. I could easily afford a car payment without a job in my current situation. The car however, is to be able to get me to and from a job.  Anyways:

The two options:

Get a cheap junker 1.5\-2K. Will likely need repairs frequently, no warranty.

Get an auto loan 6\-8k. Likely high interest rate. 3 year warranty

My dad thinks I should get a junker to get my going for the next year, where I think getting a loan would be smarter as it would build up credit \(which you need for just about everything in life right now\). I currently have no credit and no job but I do have several hundred in *disposable* income every month due to SSI. my interest rate would likely be quite high. I feel however, that buying a cheap junker, putting another 1\-2 grand into it by the time I get a loan for a car would cancel out the extra cost incurred by the interest. My dad thinks I should get a job and then get a better car.

Currently I see no reason to get a junker. Am I wrong? Is there some aspect i'm missing?

Thanks for any suggestions!

Edit: For reference, I have already had a junker. I've seen the horrors of trying to keep a dying car alive. I really don't want to go through that again \(but I will if it makes more sense of course\). I just don't know enough about this topic to make a solid decision.",finance

hydro,"Dutch Bucket system pump stops flowing after a few minutes, can't figure out why.","I have 5 buckets in a dutch bucket system that I'm setting up right now (no plants yet).  The 27 gal reservoir is buried in the ground up to the rim, and the buckets are 18-24"" off the ground.   I have the pump feeding a 1/2"" drip irrigation line with 2 feeder lines going to each bucket, open at the end with no emitters.   

Originally, when operated like described above, the flow into the first bucket would taper off and stop after ~3 minutes of operation, then the second bucket would taper off, etc.    It seemed like the outlet pressure of the pump was too high and it couldn't push enough water out and eventually the impeller just started cavitating.

So I opened up the end of the main irrigation line and let it flow into the drain pipe as a bypass.   When I did this, the LAST bucket eventually stopped getting fed.   I noted that when the last bucket lost flow, there was a gurgling sound, so I figured that the mainline bypass into the drain pipe was letting air gradually into the line and cutting off the last bucket (at least).   

So I added an air-gap right after the last bucket, before the 90deg bend down into the drain line, kind of the highest spot in the system.   I used an upside-down T fitting in the 1/2"" drip line, open to atmosphere.   Didn't really change much.  Flow seemed good for about 4-5 minutes, then the last bucket lost flow.

Anyone have any ideas how to get consistent flow from this pump/line system?    My plants really need to get into the buckets soon...   Thanks,

Currently in an assured shorthold tenancy on a monthly basis, lived in the property for 3 years.

When we initially rented, the house came with an out house that was good for almost nothing, had a tree growing out of it, tiles missing, it rained inside etc, but we used it for storing old stuff that we didn't need much, under a tarpaulin - we had a couple bikes in there, some old units that didn't fit in the house etc.

Just over a year ago, our house got bought by a new landlord.

One of the things he's done, is completely re-roof the outhouse and make it safe again, we were glad of this so that we could start using it more, and I had certain plans for it as we rent it and wanted to make use of it.

Long story short, he's re-roofed it, put a new lock on it and given the keys to one of his friends, so he can store his extra stuff there. Not only has he given the key to the outhouse, but also the key to the alley way that accesses it, that only ourselves and the shop underneath us has.

He's told me his friend is using the space as storage indefinitely and that we can't use it any more. Can I ask for reduction in rent on any legal ground?",finance

personalfinance,Property Prospecting Spreadsheet &amp; Amortization Calc.,"Property Prospecting Spreadsheet &amp; Amortization Calc.

Hi all!

I'm a long\-time lurker and follower. I want to share a spreadsheet some might find useful but anonymously given some details below and fear of ridicule.

After about 12 hours of excel building, I've created a property prospecting spreadsheet w/ amortization calc that can be very effective for rental real estate investors and useful in purchasing a multiunit primary residence. 

OR, if you're buying a house, it's a great way to look at the numbers and how it'll impact your budget \(you'll probably need to edit some of the cells for your specific needs\).

Also, I included an amortization calculator, where you put the loan balance, interest rate, and term \(#of years \* 12\).

It looks a little intimidating so I color coded it to make it more approachable: 

yellow cells are the cells where you input the values \(address, price, taxes, misc, etc.\).

white cells are output cells \(you might need to adjust down payment if you're owner occupying the property\).

green cells are a little more subjective and conservative calculations that you'll find of interest if you invest, but they certainly need your attention and calibration. 

These columns are the 'Vacancy Reserve, Cap Ex, Prop, Manag' and 'Capitalization' rate. As for the former, I work at a bank in the mortgage department and banks discount 25&amp;#37; of your gross rental, so I do the same \(when it's realized it's a nice reserve\).

Technically, the capitalization rate is calculated by taking the costs of the building \(taxes, insurance, and utilities\) from the gross rent and diving by the purchase price. This number is how much the property has paid for itself in a year. However, I included the mortgage payment \(my cost of acquiring it\) in my calculation to be more conservative. 

Before I provide the url to the spreadsheet: please don't change the formula cells in the first row of cells \(ie. row 3 A\-S\). I'm giving every one edit abilities so you can copy and save. Also feel free to mess around with the inputs on other rows.

My specific type of forgiveness had a three\-year waiting period, where I couldn't make OVER a certain amount, and only lived off \~$23,000 per year.  I was an independent contractor \(mental health counselor\) at that time, and had no benefits.  I am planning on staying in the same house, with the same car payment, thus those fees won't change and were doable on $23,000.

I just accepted a full\-time job with benefits and began on April 30th.  I signed on for a $42K salary.  I will still be able to get SSDI for nine months \(trial work period\), which will be an additional $8,424.

Life insurance is built in\-\-one year's salary, and I am unmarried so I don't believe I need any more.

I will be looking into short\-term disability, but I've heard it's expensive?  I believe if I needed to go on long\-term disability, I could likely just go back on SSDI, so I don't really see a point in buying that?

I just want to do this ""right,"" and put myself in a better place.  I am not a big spender, but I want to set myself up well.

Yet Abt, on behalf of Carthage College, in Kenosha, Wis., has returns that beat Harvard’s $37 billion endowment and most others. In the 10 years through the most recent college fiscal year, ended on June 30, 2017, the former beer company executive racked up a 6.2 percent average annual return, according to the school. That performance is better than 90 percent of his peers, based on data from the National Association of College and University Business Officers. Harvard’s endowment, the nation’s largest, averaged just 4.4 percent a year in the same period, in part because of heavy losses on investments in timber and farmland.

At Carthage, Abt’s approach was more pedestrian: mostly low-cost, market-tracking index funds from Vanguard Group Inc., the same funds used by legions of do-it-yourself individual investors. Why isn’t reliance on indexing more common among those who oversee the nation’s half a trillion dollars in college endowments? “Maybe it’s too simple,” Abt says.

The Vanguard funds charge institutional investors as little as 0.035 percent of assets per year, compared with the 2 percent, plus a share of profits, levied by some private equity and hedge funds. Abt, too, is an inexpensive hire, at least by Wall Street standards. Currently his only job is chief investment officer, but when his administrative duties at Carthage also included everything from personnel to technology to athletics, his compensation was $250,000 a year. (From 2010 through 2014, Harvard paid 11 top investment managers a total of $242 million.) To call Carthage an underdog would do a disservice to little guys everywhere: The college gets by with an endowment of about $120 million, less than a single 2014 gift to Harvard from hedge fund titan and alumnus Kenneth Griffin.

It’s worth noting that Abt’s strategy has benefited from a long bull market. Through the Vanguard funds, Carthage’s endowment today is about 90 percent in publicly traded stock. The average endowment, which has half its money in alternative investments such as hedge funds, private equity, and venture capital, is more diversified. But that kind of diversification hasn’t always helped soften the blow from stock market slumps—Harvard and Yale each lost about 25 percent in fiscal 2009; Carthage lost 21 percent. Abt says his endowment, which is essentially investing in perpetuity, can wait out the swings of the market. It provides only 3 percent to 5 percent of Carthage’s annual budget, compared with more than a third at Harvard, where the endowment supports star professors, massive research operations, and some of the most generous financial aid in the U.S.

Some of the world’s sharpest investment thinkers, including Warren Buffett and Nobel laureate economist Eugene Fama, have endorsed the idea that most investors should track the market at the lowest possible cost. Another advocate is the dean of higher education investors, Yale endowment chief David Swensen. Still, Swensen makes an exception for himself and other top endowment investors who have insiders’ access to the best money managers in the world. Yale’s 10-year average annual return of 6.6 percent edges out Abt’s 6.2 percent. Over 20 years, Yale’s annual 12.1 percent still trounces a broad index of U.S. stocks, the result of early successful bets on alternative investments such as venture capital.

At Harvard, alumni from the class of 1969, fed up with poor performance, wrote a letter in February to the incoming president suggesting the school buy index funds. Its new endowment manager is doing no such thing. N.P. “Narv” Narvekar is shifting to a Yale-like strategy of searching for top managers. Harvard declined to comment.

Charles Ellis, a former Vanguard board member and onetime chair of Yale’s investment committee, says active managers once had an edge. No more. “Today, everyone knows everything at the same time,” he says. Abt came to that conclusion earlier than most. After business school at Temple University, he worked 25 years in the beer business, rising through the ranks at Joseph Schlitz Brewing Co. and its successor, Stroh Brewery Co. He left in 1999 after the brewery he managed was sold.

A beer industry colleague told him a local college could use help. Carthage was originally founded in Illinois by Lutherans and once had Abraham Lincoln as a trustee. Like many small Midwestern schools, it was struggling in a region with a shrinking college-age population. The school enrolled only 1,200 students when Abt signed on as business chief in 2000. One of his first tasks: set a strategy for its then $30 million endowment. “That was kind of the heyday of hedge funds,” says Ed Smeds, then chairman of Carthage’s board. The former Kraft Foods executive says the board found such investments mystifying. “You could see the puzzlement on their faces,” he says. Abt and Smeds suggested indexing; since then, Carthage’s endowment has quadrupled in size. That’s not only because of strong returns. The school has grown to almost 3,000 students, helping to improve its financial condition.

After Abt retires in June, he may not be replaced. The board’s investment committee, made up of volunteers, would then take over the CIO duties. In an arrangement that would horrify Wall Street, they’d be managing money for free.

personalfinance,How to account for changing interest rates when paying off personal debt?,"Because of this subreddit, I found [Debt Reduction Calculator](https://www.vertex42.com/Calculators/debt-reduction-calculator.html), and that got me going in a good direction. Recently,  I made a balance transfer to a new card that has a 0&amp;#37; interest period. So right now I'm paying zero percent interest, but at some point it will go up. The calculator only allows for a fixed rate.  How do I account for the future changing interest rates.... Should I just enter what they are at the moment, and make another sheet when the percents change? Or should I enter the future percents now, so that I can pay it down before the rate actually kicks in?",finance
personalfinance,"Refinanced student loans, TransUnion/Experian shows the old being paid off but doesn't show the new ones yet!","I plan on buying a house over the next few months. I qualified for a mortgage last spring, but didn't get quite the offer I wanted because of my DTI (my original Sallie Mae payment was pretty astronomical). I refi-ed my private loans and am ready to start looking around as my DTI is much better...

SOOOOOO I just checked Credit Karma and both TransUnion and Experian shows all my Sallie Mae loans ($50k) as paid off, but does not show the new SoFi loan yet. Thus, my total debt is shown as $50k lower, which cuts my total debt in half.... MASSIVE difference in what kind of mortgage I'd qualify for if I apply today.

Now my question, will it appear the same on my official credit reports? Is there a time period where new loans don't show up yet?

If so, how long is that time period? (I know the the mortgage bank does it's final check before closing, would hate for it to appear at the last minute.)

P.S. I don't mean to be rude, but I am well aware I will have to continue paying the ""invisible"" student loans, and I will factor that into what I can afford. So please please no need to opine on what I can or can't afford. Even if I opt for the exact same loan amount I would otherwise get, having $50k less in reported debt would at least give me a better interest rate. Thanks!",finance

Trying to save money, but in two years went from dual income no kids, to dual income one kid, to one income two kids. I’ve got a handle on finances, but I want a home for my kids (currently in apartment) and a home here costs too much of my time (commute), money, or both. In-laws are in Charlotte, NC and I love visiting and the affordability. Has been a long-term goal to move there for a while, but we finally decided we did not want to keep kicking it down the line and end up stuck here grumbling about commute and costs like my other coworkers. 
Took a lot of guts, but I told my boss my wife and I decided we were going to move to Charlotte in the very near future to be closer to family. He was surprisingly very supportive, and although we agreed my current position cannot be done remotely, he wanted me to reach out to other offices within my organization to find a job that I can do remotely because they value me and want to keep me.
And now all sorts of opportunities are opening up for me that I had never considered, and I’m going to be moving to Charlotte with a lower cost of living and family to help out, all because I was unhappy and decided to do something about it!

personalfinance,Form W-4 with two jobs this year,"Hello everyone! I hope this post finds you all financially well.

I just picked up a second job and I'm needing some help filling out this W-4 for my new employer. Here's my situation:

* Job A Pays me $14.85 an hour. This is a corporate job that I worked for for a few years, and they withheld taxes for me. I can't remember ever having filled out a W-4 for this job, tbh. 

* Job B pays $12. It's a starting position in the field I want to work in. This one is a smaller company, and they are the ones requesting I fill out the W-4. 

* Filing as single for 2018

* No dependents, and I'm 25, So I don't believe anyone can claim me as a dependent.

* No exemptions as far as I'm aware. Take my money, Uncle Sam!

* At the beginning of this year, I had a full-time position with my first employer (Job A) up until May 6th, which was the final day of the payroll period. After that, I dropped down to a part-time position with Job A, working the weekends starting this week, May 12th. Gross income To-Date: $11,011 (includes PTO and a small bonus received last month). Taxes withheld To-Date: $1,100 (Fed Tax Only. Total including SS, Medicare, and State: $2,360). Paid bi-weekly. 

* I began my new full-time job (Job B) on the 7th of May. I won't get my first paycheck until the 31st. While I won't know how much my paycheck will be, I do know it's a guaranteed 40 hrs a week with very likely potential for overtime, paid at x1.5 my rate. Paid semi-monthly. 

* I estimate a gross pay of about $23,000 Yearly for job B. I realize as I typed this that this won't be an accurate figure for 2018 since I just started.

* I contributed about $160 into a 401k in Job A, but I don't plan on contributing more. 

I know this is tricky due to working half a year in Job A and my gross pay for the year will most likely bump me to the next tax bracket. My questions are:

1) How do I determine how much needs to be withheld from my paychecks so that I can at least break even this coming tax season?

2) Do I have to fill out two W-4's now that my full-time position has become part-time?

3) Is there a way to have all of my tax burden with one paycheck, as opposed to both of them? Or is it wiser to simply share the burden between both checks?

4) Is there anything I'm overlooking?

I had a hard time finding information on the web for my specific situation, so I figured I'd ask here. I'm not very good with taxes. They scare me. Any and all help is appreciated!

personalfinance,"Final Update RE: I might be kicking the bucket, what do I need to do for my wife here?","I believe this will be the final entry in what is, now, a month-long emotional rollercoaster. The previous posts can be found here: [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8co3an/i_might_be_kicking_the_bucket_what_do_i_need_to/) and [second](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8gjq68/update_re_i_might_be_kicking_the_bucket_what_do_i/).  

First and foremost, I’d like to take a moment and thank this rather amazing community. Our world can be pretty rough, harsh words are abundant, and apathy is never in short supply. Some scared, ignorant guy asked for help at a particularly challenging juncture and you people went above and beyond. I received some really great recommendations about financial preparedness, but I also received comprehensive insight concerning the legal, administrative, and even emotional aspects. So many of you just reached out to say something kind. I can honestly say that I was overwhelmed by your collective kindness; I did my best to respond to each of your comments and PMs and I apologize if I missed yours. 

Now, some of you asked to be updated regarding my condition, how things panned out, etc. So, [good news, everyone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8IVI0sZ6F8)- I probably won’t be dying anytime soon, at least not because of my unwelcome guest. I received a second MRI that focused on the area, a battery of tests and labs, and a number of consults with experts in the fields concerned (endocrinology, ophthalmology, neurology, etc.) and everything points toward me probably being fine. The blob doesn’t appear to be cancer and it doesn’t currently have any affect on my quality of life. That being said I’ll have to keep a closer eye on things because there will always be some threat to my vision and endocrine system, but it's marginal and I’m completely happy with how things turned out.  

I strongly recommend visiting the previous posts, specifically the second, and at least skimming the parent comments. Some final near-incoherent ramblings to round off this post:  

* Life changes quick. We all know some jagoff that’s compelled to make a tragedy about themselves and share similar sentiments on social media, despite not really even being involved in the situation. People like that have really cheapened a valuable lesson. My life was going amazingly until some guy told me I may very well be fucked.  

* Be an adult and address this rather simple aspect of life/death. It takes minimal effort and resources and it will spare your loved ones a ridiculous amount of inconvenience. Take care of it while it’s optional because it really sucked to deal with it while under the gun, so to speak. I had nightmares just about every night for the past month centered on my wife. It was some real Sopranos shit; I’d usually see her having a complete breakdown over a pile of scattered papers because I left her hanging. Death didn’t really bother me because I couldn’t get over the pain I would have caused.  

* Go see an estate planning attorney. These guys make a relatively simple process even simpler. More importantly, they’re familiar with laws that vary from place to place and they have experience with aspects of the post-death process that many of us may overlook and would otherwise prove to be pitfalls.

Feel free to reach out with any questions or if you need some help with this stuff. Thank you r/personalfinance, you're the fiscally responsible parents that I never had.



Someone asked for the short version of things I learned. In no particular order:  
* Sit down with an estate planning attorney. It's totally possible to do all this by yourself, but there are a ton of pitfalls and unforeseen issues that could render your efforts useless. Individual circumstances need to be accounted for.  

* Do everything you can to avoid probate (some of the other points will help with this). Virginia has a painful 18 month process and that's bull shit.  

* Do everything you can to avoid probate because the court will take a considerable amount of the value of whatever goes through probate. This can really fuck your S/O because it counts value, not equity. It doesn't matter if you've only made two payments on your $300,000 home, they're going to want a percentage of that $300,000.  
* Figure out a way to make the transfer of your money seamless. Joint accounts are the easiest, but carry inherent risk. You can also set up a ""pay upon death"" protocol with your bank. Your successor just has to prove you're dead and then the bank will initiate the steps in place to move the money to the person you identified. 

* Do not make someone a co-owner of your car because that puts all joint property at risk in the event of a civil suit stemming from an accident. 

* Some places/institutions have different levels of joint ownership, account owners, etc. and you need to verify which one(s) you have set up. A ton of people told me about how X added Y as a joint owner only to find out Y didn't have the rights they were meant to have.  

*  Figure out a way for your S/O to have the login information for *everything*. Social media and banking stuff is obvious, but there's a ton of things that aren't so apparent because you login so infrequently (401k, utilities, insurance, etc.). There's a lot of ways to do this digitally or physically.

* Redundancy is critical with valuable documents. Some people lost important documents at critical times and it caused heartache.  

* If you're going to use a safe deposit box, make sure your S/O has access. People wrongly assumed they'd be able to and the S/O had to go through a lot of legal trouble.  

* Don't just plan for your death, plan for that area in between. Set up an advance medical directive and a power of attorney. Remove the burden of having to decide when to let you die from your S/O. Let them focus on grieving and not making heavy choices. This will also stop them from racking up piles of unnecessary medical debt when you wouldn't want them to.  

* At least one copy of your advance directive and power of attorney documents should be readily available in your home so that your S/O can act quickly. You can also file a copy of your advance directive with your hospital. 

* Make sure your S/O orders a bunch of death certificates. Every institution will want one and having to order one will really draw out a process. They're not cheap, but (apparently) the cost is well worth it.  

* Verify the beneficiaries of your various trusts, policies, etc. Apparently a few people have neglected to update those documents over the years and current spouses don't appreciate previous spouses receiving piles of your money.  

* Plan your funeral. This makes life easier for those that survive you and you can save a fuck-ton of money. Aside from stopping your family from being guilt-ed into buying fancy shit you wouldn't have wanted in the first place, you can also pre-pay and receive a decent discount. You can also prohibit specific people from coming to your funeral (apparently some guys ex-wife showed up to his funeral and made a bad day worse for his current wife).",finance

personalfinance,Buying an extra parking spot,"Hi. I live in a 2br condo with a single parking spot in a multi level garage. 

I paid about $30K for the parking spot 13 years ago.

I have an opportunity to buy another spot for about $35K. 

I’m thinking of doing it for several reasons. 

1. I’ll be able to sell my condo with two spots. That seems to be pretty popular. 

2. It will help when family visits on weekends etc. I plan to rent it during the week for about $200 a month. 

My bank doesn’t do personal loans so I am considering a HELOC too. 

I also have the liquidity to be able to afford it leaving about 20K in my emergency fund. 

My thought was to pay it in cash so I don’t have to use a HELOC but I am going to open a HELOC anyway as it costs me nothing to do so and it won’t charge any interest unless I use money from it. 

The interest is pretty high considering that the prime lending rate is 4.75%. He interest rate on the HELOC would be about 6.25%. 

So my thought is to pay cash for the spot and keep the HELOC for super emergencies. I also have some funds in a managed investment account that I can pull if need be. 

Are there any things I’m missing that might allow me to do this transaction more efficiently? 

I don’t want to really use the HELOC because that’s about $200 in interest monthly at least. When you add principal, it’s more out of pocket monthly than it is from renting out the spot. 

Thoughts? 

This seems to be the smartest way to do it but I’m open to other ideas.

personalfinance,Sell or Leverage my property: what makes the most sense?,"Hey All,

I’m looking to buy a new home, in need of some more space after getting married and adopting a dog. I’m debating the merits of selling my condo, or taking out the equity and renting it out as an investment property. I’m of the mind that while holding two mortgages and functioning as a landlord is riskier, the long term financial benefit is too great to ignore. My wife, a little more conservative than I, would prefer we maximize our down payment on a home and sell. For reference, we’re in Toronto, Canada. 

Here are the details:

Current Property (1 bedroom downtown condo):  
- Purchased for $310k in 2014  
- Remaining principal $260k at 2.7% variable interest rate  
- Current market value is $590k  
- Average rent/month for a unit like mine is $2400  
  
A well-sized home in a good neighbourhood will cost us between $750k-$900k. Canadian mortgage rules will prescribe a minimum 20% downpayment.  
  
Other factors:  
- $150k saved for the downpayment  
- $40k in RRSP’s invested through Wealthsimple  
- $162k yearly household income  
- No cars  
- No debt (aside from the mortgage)  
- Credit score 818  
  
In preliminary conversations with my mortgage broker, it seems I’d be able to take about $150k in equity out of the condo, bringing our downpayment $300k. My existing unit is in a very hot downtown neighbourhood, and could be rented at a moments notice.  

If we were to go the route of selling the condo, I’d likely end up with a larger downpayment (even after considering taxes and realtor fees). I’m not sure that a larger downpayment, and the subsequently lower mortgage payments, would outweigh the financial benefits of a lifelong investment property, but I might be wrong.

Mortgage is large - $560k, Bay Area, CA. Lowish rate-3.625%. First (and probably only) child is coming in the next couple weeks. 

Both parents working. Income is $140-160k (I’m self employed and it fluctuates). Daycare will be like 1500-2k per month, which is a new expense for us. Mortgage is $2600. We already contribute to retirement. 

I can see both scenarios making sense.

Start the 529 quickly and strongly, be consistent, and let compound interest do it’s work. Pay the mortgage as usual and make extra payments if available. However, I also suspect college and schooling as we know it today will be different in 20 years. Don’t know how but suspect it. 

I can also see paying the mortgage off 10-15 years early and saving ~$200k in interest, which would go a long ways towards schooling, and allow us to better cash flow college when it comes. I’ll also add that I like the idea of no debt. Mortgage is the only debt. 

Conversely, that $2600 per month mortgage payment will feel like $1000 per month in 10-15 years and will feel like a bargain compared to today, assuming our wages increase with inflation. 

Although I don’t like his politics I appreciate the advice of Dave Ramsey. He would say college first and house after, and his logic does make sense to me. I understand some will say the low interest rate and interest deduction makes sense to keep the mortgage, but the idea of not owing anyone anything is appealing to me.

personalfinance,Renting vs. Buying - I have the ability to purchase in cash,"Hey all, just as a preface, I'm very new and unknowledgeable to the housing market.  Due to personal circumstances, I have been left with a decent sized inheritance, and I am currently in a place where I can decide to buy or continue renting.

I live and work in California with a roommate.  I will definitely live in the same county for at least the next 4 years.  After that, it's very much up in the air.

* Current rent is $2000, split with my roommate is $1000
   * If I were to rent, I can assume approximately the same rent with one roommate
* Income is mediocre for the county, around $80k
* Condo I have been considering is $500k
* I can comfortably buy in cash.  I am also in the process of looking into getting pre\-approved for mortgage.
   * I've heard mixed things about buying in cash vs mortgage.  People say interest rates are low, so it's actually not a bad idea to do that.  However, I would really like to not have to worry about loans.
* I have been using this tool \([https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy\-rent\-calculator.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html)\) to help me calculate the differences.  If I have been inputting everything correctly, it seems like buying is a solid decision.  See below for my inputs.
   * Inputs: [https://imgur.com/a/LJlXxzb](https://imgur.com/a/LJlXxzb)
   * My biggest question marks \(which, of course, are also the biggest factors in the inputs above\) are **home price growth rate** **and investment return **rate.
   * Realtor says growth in my county has been about 8&amp;#37; in the past year, and she doesn't see it slowing down any time soon.  But she has to say this cause she's a realtor right? lol.  Can I comfortably assume it will continue growing at least 5&amp;#37; a year?  For more details, we are in a community with super good school zone and a lot of foreign money.
   * Speaking to my financial advisor tomorrow about investment return rate, but we can assume average \(but also what is average idk T\_T\).

**TLDR;**

1. **Should I buy or rent?**
2. **If I buy, mortgage or cash?**

Thanks guys, sorry if I sound uneducated.  This is all foreign to me, and I want to make the best choice financially.  \(Plus the condo I'm looking to buy is so much nicer than the apartments here for rent.\)",finance
personalfinance,Pay college bill in full or take out low-interest loan and invest extra earnings? (18yo),"Hi PF! I'm an incoming college freshman, currently pondering my options for financing my education. I'm not receiving any financial support from my parents, but thanks to some scholarships and *wonderful* financial aid from my school, I'm going to have a $6,000 bill each year (tuition, room, and board included). This does *not* include books or personal expenses, which are not billed by the school but are estimated at slightly over $4,000 (school is in the Boston area, although I may be able to bring this down by being frugal).

I'm covering $2,500 of this with a no-interest loan, which leaves $3,500 plus personal expenses. My school has a boatload of money, so they are able to give me an institutional loan to cover the remaining term bill with no interest during school and a fixed 4% interest rate after graduation (10 years to repay). This would leave me only with personal expenses.

In theory, I don't need the loan. I'm working an internship this summer which should net me about $1,500 after I pay for housing/food, and I'll be working to earn approx $4-6,000 during the school year. I will be able to pay my bill through a payment plan during term-time, so immediacy of funds won't be an issue.

However, I think that the loan may be a smart economic move. Because there is no interest, I could earn returns on my money over the course of undergrad. The benefits to the loan are (A) returns on the money from some investment, (B) a moderate level of liquidity in case I need money for something, and (C) credit history that goes beyond minimal usage of credit cards. 

The cost of the loan will be (A) interest paid after graduation, and (B) 5% of the extra savings per year in school costs, since my financial aid requires me to pay 5% of assets each year. This means the returns would need to be higher than 5% to make an accounting profit (without considering the value of temporary liquidity from the loan). Should I take this loan because of the favorable terms, or should I just pay my term bills using earnings? If I should take the loan, is there an investment that would make the most sense?

I'm also going to a top 3 university, so earnings potential in the future is pretty high -- repayment shouldn't be much of an issue.",finance

personalfinance,Late payment on a student loan I didn't know about,"I got a credit alert a few days ago saying I had a late payment on a student loan. I have automatic payments on all my federal (and one private) student loans, so I had no idea what this was. I looked at my credit report and it said the lender was my alma mater. At first, my school's student accounts department had no idea either but, after some arm-twisting, I figured out I had missed the first two payments on a Perkins loan I apparently was given in 2013.

I told them I was not notified about this loan and had no idea what the monthly payment was or how to pay it. They told me they sent a letter to the residence they had on file 30 days before the first payment was due in March and that I could pay the loan each month via phone or mail. I hadn't lived at the address they had on file in years and, despite having my phone and email on file, they said they only contacted me about the payment by sending the one letter.

I immediately paid the two payments that were late and insisted on setting up some form of automatic payment, so they said I could fill out an ACH debit form they normally use for tuition payments. I asked them if there was any way I could have the late payment removed from my credit report but the woman laughed and said: ""that's not something we do.""

It's clear from talking with two separate people (and an ignored email to boot) that they have no interest in helping me. The Perkins loan program was discontinued last year and, given that you can only pay via phone or mail, I'm pretty sure I'm one of a very few number of people who actually have this loan at my school. I have never had any sort of black mark on my credit report before and this situation is very frustrating to me. Is there anything I can do to get the late payment removed from my credit report?",finance

personalfinance,rethinking how I save for retirement,"I make US $87,000 a year and I am 30 years old living in beautiful, expensive as shit, Silicon Valley California. I will continue to live here.

I have saved 10% of my income since I started working at 15, so saving comes natural to me. Investing does not.

I have depleted much of my savings paying off student loans when I was in a domestic partnership and living with my partner who already had a house/large savings. Turns out good future planning doesn’t make a good partner, and I am newly single and need to think about my future as a single person saving for retirement. 

I have an advanced degree, but my field isn’t known for making a ton of money. I’m hoping in the next 5 years jumping to 100k for yearly income, and then my max annual income will realistically be around $120k a year. I enjoy working, and do not have a date for retirement. When I create goals for myself I set it at 65 because that is what everyone else does. 

I spend around $3,000 a month total on all of my expenses. That being said, my current living situation is not permanent, and can end at any time (30 days? 5 years?). At that time, my rent will increase another $1,500’ish.

Before positing here my original thought was to save as much money as I can, in cash, to get ready to purchase a home. This seems a bit irresponsible though, right? Burned down houses in my area are selling for 900k, which is 100k over asking price. It seems out of reach to save in cash for 20% for the homes here, but feels even more ridiculous to pay rent. To note, paying a PMI doesn’t bother me, but is a bit daunting knowing that a lot of houses here sell for cash only and that I have such a small “down payment” right now.

--I pay around $550 a month to various student loans. My loans are $19,000 with 6.8% interest, $11,000 with 5.25% interest, $7,5000 with 6.55% interest, $1,700 with 2.11% interest.

--I contribute 8% to my 403b, and my company matches 4%. I contribute 8% and not 4% because I have no idea what I’m doing.

--45k in Ally Savings Account (interest rate 1.59%). All of my “extra” money goes in this account now, and does not go towards paying extra towards student loans. 

--I have no credit card debt.

Should I forgo the house saving and just save for retirement differently? I feel like I’m in an adulting trap. Rent is a waste of money (and will get worse if I have to leave my current place), paying off my student loans does not allow me to save for a down payment, and I know I am not contributing correctly to my retirement.

financialindependence,Bonds seem like a genuinly terrible idea to invest.,"Okay, so I am fully aware this post is a wild mix of kitchen economics and a couple uni lectures I had years ago - but nevertheless, I am intrigued by this theory.

So, bonds are generally seen as a safe investment. Most modern states are expected to pay their dues as a single missed payment would immediately make lenders lose trust and therefore request them higher interest rates. Right now a standard 10 year US bond yields around 3%, which sounds pretty solid when considering the fact that your money is pretty much bulletproof.

But while the US government (or any other large economy such as Germany or GB) would never miss a payment, they can always inrease inflation to lessen their dues on fixed rate bonds. This has been the main mechanism for states to lessen their debts in the past and it has always worked out in their favor. 

Historically, over the past 70 years, there have always been short spikes in the US inflation. 

http://www.inflation.eu/inflation-rates/united-states/historic-inflation/cpi-inflation-united-states.aspx

We all know the effects of compound interest. Therefore, a single spike in inflation can basically nullify your bond returns over a decade.

There are plenty of other investments that dont have this fallacy as they are not in money, but rather in abstract values such as company shares or real estate. While the annual returns of those investments might also be affected by inflation innitially, the underlying monetary value (such as a house) rises with inflation and would therefore (in an isolated scenario) hold its value.

In conclusion, bonds seem like a genuinly terrible investment to me, as they combine all bad factors an investment could have. To me, the argument of ""safe"" returns doesnt count, as the risk of state bancruptcy has just been shifted from a boolean value (bancrupt/not bancrupt) to a more flexble inflation rate. Whether my government goes bancrupt or experiences five years of 10% annual inflation doesnt matter in the end for a fixed rate bond holder - the value of their underlying investment turns into zero or close to zero.",finance

personalfinance,Diseased relative left me money. Should I pay student loans or keep it invested,"Hi,

I've been becoming more aware of better ways to use my money and am hoping personalfinance can help. After going home this weekend I found out that I had more money from a deceased relative than I thought. The relative passed away \~15 years ago and left me 20k in a Prudential account/mutual fund \(current value is about 40k\) and also \~80k in bonds \(although my mom isn't sure if they are fully matured\).   

I have about 25k left in student loans, and pay over 2x the minimum payment \(paying $1200/month\) as I would like to pay them off in a few years. At this rate I should have them paid off by the time I am 29. I'm wondering if I should just pay off my student loans with the money I have now so I can start saving for other things \(house, kids, etc.\).

Couple of questions:   

* Should I use the money in the mutual fund to pay off my student loans, or should I continue to pay off my student loans following my current plan?
* Whatever I do, the mutual fund its in right now has an above average expense ratio. I'm thinking of transferring it over to Vanguard \(centralize it with my IRA/rollover 401k\) and putting it in a better mutual fund. I know I will have to pay taxes on my capital gains. Does this sound like a good plan, or should I just leave it over at Prudential. 
* Same with with the bonds \- if they are fully matured, should I cash them out and put them into a taxable investment account, or is it better to keep them as is. 
   * Would cashing these out increase my taxable income? If so, would it be better if I slowly do it over the next few years while I am still in a lower tax bracket?

Some details:

* 27 years old in a high cost of living area
* Salary: 75K, 12&amp;#37; is saved is put into 401k \(no match\), and I've been maxing out my IRA over the past two years
* Student loans: \~25k \(interest rates 3.15\-6.5&amp;#37;\)
* Car loan: 11k \(0&amp;#37; interest though so am just paying the minimum payment\)
*  401k \+ IRA: 32k
* Money from deceased relative: 40k in mutual fund, 80k in bonds
* Emergency fund: 15k

personalfinance,Opinions Needed: Should I move back in with parents to pay out HUGE student loan debt??,"TL;DR - Worth moving home with parents to pay off student loans in 1-2 years instead of 25 years?


Hi! I am in desperate need of help here. I am considering moving back home with my parents for 12-24 months to try and pay off about 142k of student loan debt. I will describe my situation, and any help/advice/thoughts would be greatly appreciated!

I am 28 years old and my wife is 24 years old (just married about 7 months ago). We currently own a condo worth 165k, and I owe about 122k. I currently make 90k a year and my wife makes about 25k a year. I already have a side business but does not make consistent money, roughly 15-25k a year. I have 86k in student loans and another 56k in parent plus student loans. I have them setup now for 25 years of repayment, but grows interest faster than I can pay the loan itself. My thought for the condo is to rent it out during the time we live with my parents. Mortgage with HOA is roughly 1,100 a month and I could easily rent it for 1,300-1,400 a month. After that time, I will sell the condo to use that money as a down payment for a house. 

I have done months of research on how to make this easier on me mentally and have yet to find a suitable solution. Refinancing does not solve my problem as it still has a huge monthly payment and minimum decade repayment plan. A friend mentioned moving the debt from federal to private and then filing chapter 7 bankruptcy, but that thought makes me feel dirty. As sad as this sounds, my own mother mentioned to have the loans moved in her name as she is in her late 60s and doesn't plan to live longer than 25 years more as the repayment plan would be; this would be forgiven due to passing. I already work 50+ hours a week for regular job and another 5-10 a week for the side business. I considered getting a midnight shift job and just give up sleeping for a year, but my wife is strong against that. 

This leads me to ask, is it worth moving back home for 12-24 months and put everything we make into the student loans to try and pay them off so I can live my life after without the stress! Please give me your thoughts and suggestions! Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Always get receipts and keep them stored properly when dealing with Cable companies.,"Don't make the same mistake I did.

Last year I started new service for Spectrum cable, electing to install the equipment myself. They accidentally sent me two boxes of equipment. No big deal I thought and called in to ask what to do with the extra equipment. The representative said I could either deliver it to the office or put it in any (FedEx or UPS, can't remember) drop box. I decided to deliver it since I was nearby, went to the counter handed it to the guy who sent me on my way. 

I recently canceled my service and took my equipment in, 1 modem and 1 receiver. At the counter they asked about another receiver and I informed her I had already turned that in a year ago. She said they would do a search for it and it shouldn't be a problem. I was still naive enough to believe it. At least I got a receipt this time and stored it safely. 

A week later I get an email from support asking for my receipt showing that I returned the receiver. Of course I didn't have this because when I dropped it off at the store the employee never opened it and checked me out. Though that's exactly what would have happened if I put it in a drop box so how was I ever supposed to have a receipt? I called in and spoke to a representative who claimed to understand, she said she would make a note and to just send the receipt I had in and it would be taken care of. 

I called in again today, after a week, to find that I was still being charged. I talked to the representative and explain my situation. I asked her how many receivers and modems Spectrum shows me receiving, 1 each. I ask how many it shows me returning, 1 each. So Spectrum doesn't even have a record of the errant shipment to me, but had the receiver and modem in each box mixed up. That is probably what initiated the double shipment in the first place. After talking through all this with the representative she talks to her supervisor who is ""sending it up the line"" and I'll get to hear back in 3-4 business days. Which is probably code word for I'm screwed but at least she was nice. I asked for all of this information emailed to me but they don't do that and I can't log into my account online anymore because it's tied to the address. So I'm stuck with no trail or ability to prove my side.

The kicker in all this was that I was calling to make sure this was cleared up before starting new service at my new home. Now I will clearly never be using Spectrum and will be telling everyone I know to avoid. I know it's a small consolation but at least I'm a bartender with a large enough audience to make myself feel better.

TL:DR Spectrum has made a bank error in their favor, I owe $108. I would be fine if I just got a receipt a year ago.",finance
personalfinance,"No longer eligible for IBR student loan repayment plan, looking for advice on how to pay them down (in what order, how to allocate more per month, etc)","I've been repaying my student loans since 2013 on the income-based repayment plan. This year, my take-home income went down by $300 per paycheck but my AGI went up. Of course, the dept of education doesn't care what your take home is - so they've informed me I'm no longer eligible for IBR (even though I'm bringing home less money with which to pay them). 

The silver lining is that instead of another 20 years of payments, I am now scheduled for payoff in 8.5 years (end of 2026 instead of 2038). And I also am now able to pay more and have it count (before when I tried to pay a little more Nelnet explained to me that it didn't really matter on IBR because they would take 300 payments and forgive the rest after that time - that'd I still have to pay taxes on but whatever). 

The bad news is - this is going to be tight. There are a couple of places I can make adjustments but I wanted to get expert opinions first.

Here goes. I have a small emergency fund of about 1.5 months worth in savings. I contribute 6% to a 401k which my company matches 100% (but only up to 6%). Every month I have $250 direct deposited into that emergency fund. 

My car is paid for but it's 13 years old now. It's a Honda though so repairs and maintenance (as well as fuel costs) have been minimal. Call me crazy but I still carry full coverage on the car - mainly because it includes rental coverage which I would desperately need if my car were damaged or destroyed - but I get a 15% good driver discount with the little dongle device that monitors my driving. My mortgage is $935 and I'm not eligible to do anything with that as far as I can tell because I only bought the house in 2014 (and rent where I live is as much or higher which is why I bought in the first place). All my utility bills are averaged and I have a programmable thermostat that I actually use - so heating and cooling costs are pretty low. My cell phone is on the lowest plan. I don't have a satellite or cable bill. I do have internet - and I'm on the highest plan because I'm a gamer and use a lot of data. It's cheaper to be on this higher plan than to incur overage charges (I know from experience LOL). I have no other debt - no old medical bills, no credit card bills, etc. Just the house and the student loans. 

Should I reduce the amount I allocate to the emergency fund each month and add it to my student loan payment? Should I do the same thing with my 401k? What about the car insurance thing - should I be on the lowest coverage plan with a car so old (it's worth - blue book - about $2800-$4200). Edit to add: I have six loans all federal all through nelnet. Should I pay highest amount first or go by highest interest rate - what if more than one are tied for highest interest rate?

More info: my loans look like this

A: $5255 at 6%

B: $2715 at 6.8%

C: $2584 at 5.6%

D: $3612 at 6.8%

E: $30,793 at 6.8%

personalfinance,"Law school: part-time, full-time, or none of the above?","Hi All! Would really appreciate some career advice. 

As the title states, I’m contemplating part-time vs. full-time law school. Impetus being that a law degree will increase my earning potential. I was set on going part-time but from discussions with recent law school grads, the full-time option is back in play (more opportunity for extracurriculars, summer clerkships etc).  What would be your advice from a personalfinance perspective? Any advice from those who did a part-time grad program? Should I scrap law school altogether?

I’m in DC working for the federal government. I’ve been at my job a year and absolutely enjoy it. Day to day, I interact with big law firms representing some high profile clients. I love the subject matter and job environment which is why I was dead set on applying for a part-time program (GULC or GW). 

The hope is that at the end of 4-5 years (enrollment would be in 2019), I’d have a strong resume and work experience. In addition, with that law degree, I could explore joining big law or continue my career in the federal government in a different way (e.g. counsel’s office).
 
I make about $60K a year, have $30K in TSP, and $10K in savings (this includes a 6 month emergency fund). Oh, and no debts.

I’m ready to make the time commitment (in my late 20s with basically no responsibilities) for a part-time program and believe the law degree, although lots of $$$, will give me more earning potential in the future either through joining a law firm or moving elsewhere in the federal government. But perhaps I'd be better off going full time and that the work experience may not matter in the end? Thanks in advance for the help!",finance

Financial Stats:

90k in savings (saving for eventual house down payment and wedding with long time girlfriend)
25k in 401k (18k vested, fully vested in 3 years)
17k in Roth IRA
16k left on car loan 
No student debt thanks in large part to scholarships and paid off the remainder last year
Live with parents so minimal monthly expenses other than car payment/insurance but that will obviously change when I move out

So, I am a 25 year old male living in Massachusetts who graduated with a bachelor's degree in business technology in 2016. I chose this degree because I took a very basic class in SQL and enjoyed it/thought I was good at it. After almost 3 years in the real world, boy was I wrong. Also, I already knew people in the field and felt I would be able to have a fairly easy time securing a full time position. After graduating, I took a full time position with a company that I interned with for a year and have been miserable since. The pay is very good for someone with my experience (65k salary, 8K bonus, 401k, cell phone/tuition reimbursement, profit sharing, etc.) However, the job itself is wearing me thin. It is a multifaceted role where I am expected to wear multiple hats (business analyst and developer). However, I hate business analyst work because it deals with a lot of interaction with people and I don't have the mental capacity to be a developer. I really like what the company does and the brand name too.

I have always suffered from social anxiety and depression but these past three years have exasperated those conditions exponentially. One of the options I have considered is trying to get a job as a truck driver for ups, USPS, or fedex. I thought of this option when I realized the best part of my day I enjoyed the most was being alone in my car listening to music or sports radio.  Also, and this might sound silly, but I am balding and wearing a hat increases my self confidence and helps decrease my social anxiety/depression greatly. I also have pretty messed up teeth so being behind the wheel by myself for most of the day as opposed to holding meetings and constantly interfacing with developers and business users would help alleviate the associated stress. However, if it were to chose this path, 2 aspects would really weigh on me.

1. The pay/benefits I would be giving up
2. Having to explain my situation to friends and family",finance

What wasn't expected was that all of my federal student loan balances we're reduced to 0 and closed as well. Why is that? I thought that student loans couldn't be discharged without a hearing and proving that they we're an impossibility now or in the future? Any ideas on that?

Also, now that my credit is essentially at square one again in terms of having 1 consumer credit card left with a 0$ balance for a jewelry store (that I haven't used in years and don't really plan to), what are the most efficient and logical steps to take in the coming year to set myself up for credit repair and living a normal financial life again? I made a lot of fiscal mistakes right out of college that landed me in this mess and never EVER intend to be here again. I am highly motivated to set myself and my wife is for financial success and am more than willing to do whatever is necessary to make that happen.

Last question...in my bankruptcy I agreed to surrender my leased vehicle...I have not received word from the lender about when or where I am to surrender the car and do not want it to cause issues, however I also can't just leave it in a lot and call it surrender. I attempted to call the lender (Hyundai Motor Finance) and talk to them about it, biut am bounced around to different departments that have yet to give me an answer except (you're 90 days late at this time that is all we can see).

personalfinance,How do I preserve my credit score meanwhile preparing for grad school and taking out loans?,"Hello all. 

I'm an extremely responsible 23 year old who has had a credit card ever since I was 19. (Somehow I was approved). I've NEVER missed a payment, and actively use my card as much as possible. I've recently expanded my credit card numbers from 1 to 3 this past year (two new cards with $15,000 credit line) and although I use maybe 5-7% of the account, I always pay the balance rather quickly with out a balance carrying over to the new month. 

Here's my concern: I will be taking out my first student loan ever (three actually). Two will be federal loans, subsidized and unsubsidized that will equal approximately $12,500. And the third will be a private student loan of about $12,000 - $16,000. I'm worried because my credit is stellar. It's at 776 (was at 786 before I took out my two credit cards) and I'm worried that it will fall after these loans. How do I keep my credit as high as possible without it being shocked by the impact of a private loan?

Also, when shopping around for private student loans, do loan applications take a hit at my credit score? 

In the case that my credit does take a hit (I used a simulating and it said by -30 points) how can I quickly get it back up to the 770s+?",finance

personalfinance,Buying a house in a,"Hi guys! I'm thinking about buying a house in the Oakland, CA, but I'm a bit nervous about purchasing in a hot market.

The house is pretty sweet and has a separate bedroom with half bath attached to the garage...I was  thinking that adding a kitchen and renting it out as a one bedroom might help us cover at least half of the mortgage which would be nice.

Anyway, making the payments wouldn't be a hardship as my fiancee and I both have jobs that pay well, but I am worried about what happens in say 5 years if we want to sell the home. With interest rates steadily rising, what is the market going to look like for $1M homes at 6% interest?

personalfinance,Stuck between 2 options.,"So I'm trying to go back to school. I'm 21 and have been out for 2.5 years. I'm taking 2 online classes this summer being paid by federal unsubsidized loans. So I can take out discover student loans in order to pay for me to go to school full time once fall and spring semesters start. 

So my first option, is go down to 1 job during the school year and have discover student loans pay for the rest of my tuition plus pay for my housing. Which my apartment is $355 a month a may go up in spring since thats when the contract goes up. Plus, I have no idea if my roommate will be moving out and moving in with her bf. 

My second option is to keep both jobs, take mostly online classes, still open discover student loans. Since I only get $3250 a semester from the federal loans. Attend school half time and working 2 jobs that is way more than full time between the 2. 

I'm a geology major focusing in paleontology. So I'll eventually have to go for both my masters and PhD, but I'm trying to figure out what will suit me for the long run. I'm not a fan of taking out this much in loans. Since my apartment is about 1800 a semester, plus tuition is roughly $9-10 thousand a year.

* Loan 2: 25% down, 4.375% with no buy down

I will be getting married in December of this year (7 months) and I still have some financial ties with my parents. I have started looking for a house for when I get married and I want my credit score to remain as high as possible to get the best deal out there. Some of the ties are very small but the car situation is a bit more tricky.

About 4 years ago my parents had pretty bad credit and asked if I could take out a car for them under my name. I figured this could be a great opportunity to build my credit and they had stable jobs so I agreed to it. Everything has gone great, they haven't missed a single payment and I now have an almost 800 credit score. The problem is that they still have about 2-3 years left (about 10k) and I want to transfer everything to them as soon as possible. When I apply for a house loan I don't want my debt to income ratio to be a factor in getting the best interest rate or getting declined. 

They understand the situation and are completely on board with everything but I am looking for the best solution. They don't have the money to pay it cash so we are looking for other alternatives. I read that maybe they could just take out a personal loan to pay the full amount and then just start making payments to that new loan. Then I would just have to transfer them the title. Is this something complicated or am I overthinking it?

I also have other small financial ties such cellphone, internet and cable that are under my name and I will have to detach them from it. I am also under their car insurance and give them other financial help but nothing too big. I figure these are simple things so I'm not too worried.

I'm just trying to figure out how people approach investing.
Looking at past market crashes 2002, 2008 (though not frequent) and small recessions since then, are you mentally prepared to lose a significant portion of your current investments should such a crash occur?

I know people generally advise to keep emergency funds (like 6m of expenses) and to invest the remaining cash in index ETFs. But are you really mentally prepared to, in worst cases, lose even 50%-60% of everything besides that 6m of emergency funds? 

Maybe I'm more risk adverse than the average investor but the daunting thought would make me only want to invest like 40% (or even less) of my possessions in the stock market and keeping way more cash than 6m emergency funds.

I will try to keep my situation as short as possible with all the relevant information, with hopes that you guys can help me out of this horrifying situation. 

I have been unemployed for the past year and 6 months and have been living off my credit cards. I have held small jobs here and there to help me pay my bills and at least make the minimum payments. During this time I have amassed $46,000 in debt and maxed out my cards. Through this time, I had forced myself to go back to school with the hope that a career change would turn my luck. I am blessed to finally have a job and am now in a position to start paying back my loans. 

Here is my Situation:

Student Loans: $16,500 with $270 payment/Month

Credit Card 4: 18.49%, $6,400 Balance, 150/month, 4 Years Old
Credit Card 5: 17.74%, $5,000 Balance, 120/month, 8 Years Old

Here is my income and expenses
Income: Gross Income of $2500 bi/weekly, 
Mortgage: $1750/Month
Water: $20/Month
Electric: $50/Month
Gas: $70/Month
Cable/Internet: $110/Month
Car Insurance: $90/Month
Gas: $80/Month
Parking: $150/Month
Phone: $60/Month
Groceries: $250/Month

Total Expense: $3150/Month
 
I don't have any savings for now except for a 401(K) with a balance of about $25K.

As you can see I am living way beyond my means and need help paying it off so I can start an emergency fund so I wont get in this position again. I have recently started looking into credit counseling (Incharge Debt Solutions). They have looked over my credit profile and have suggested with a monthly payment of $545 (including their fee, without student loans), they will send a proposal to my banks to lower my interest rate and save me significant amount on interest (I can't recall the exact amount). 

The only problem I saw with that is that this process will close all my credit cards in the process. (That’s the only way my creditors will lower the rates on the card with this program). My cards are maxed out and I don't plan on using them anyways, but I don't want my credit to suffer once I finish paying them off 3 Years down the line. Since the age of my credit will basically start from 0 at that point.

Is this a good plan?

Are there any other plans I can look into to help pay off my credit cards faster. 

What are my options?

I will be applying for unemployment shortly, but Im also wondering, while I look for jobs, would it be wise to try to get a personal loan consolidation, and small additional loan for school from a credit union? I would like to pay a lower interest rate since my CC is pretty high, and consolidate. My worry is that due to the high amount I owe my credit score has probably suffered and I won't get approved.

I currently am supposed to pay about ~$743 per month on my loans in the 10 year repayment plan option and have been paying off $800 per month pretty comfortably. Given that, I had the maybe not-so-brilliant idea of changing my repayment plan to the cheapest one I am eligible for and then just continuing to pay $800 but throwing a larger amount at one loan at a time. Would this be smart route to go or should I just keep the more spread out amounts?",finance
btc,Consensus 2018 - an opinion,"Just wanted to throw my opinion here.

Last year I really enjoyed Consensus.  Things were weird and exuberant because of the price run up.  There was a lot of attempts to get outside perspective on things with the speakers.  There was the typical hype and more money being thrown around than was warranted but it was all in good fun and light hearted.  People were really trying to get things done and the ideas that were being shared were pretty new and exciting.

This year seems much more crass.  The talk tracks are weak and kind of boring.  There seems to be more angst and less raw curiosity.  Then they oversold the place by about 3,000 people.  It is annoyingly crowded everywhere.  By far the most interesting speaker was the president of the St. Louis Fed who obviously had made a life's study of money and historical monetary policy and brought a very interesting perspective to what was happening in crypto.  Everyone else is just lip service and surface level information.  No matter how much expertise they may bring they are never asked interesting questions.  Joe Lubin put it correctly that the point of this conference is to set up meetings with as many people as you can manage and that is honestly all you can expect to get out of it.

The real low point was Jimmy Song.  Why does anyone give this guy a microphone when there is a choice?  He constantly argues both sides of the coin and creates straw men to attack.  I really hope he goes back and listens to himself to see just how many times he changes sides on the argument for the sole purpose of claiming the other person is wrong.  He is non\-sensical and I come away with the idea that he really has no idea what he is talking about.  Then there are the dufuses in the audience that actually applaud him.  It got so bad that in an attempt to get him to shut up Joe said ""I will bet you any amount of Bitcoin that you want that you are wrong.""

Vitalik was right to avoid this one.  I am meeting the people I need to which makes it worth it for me, but I feel sorry for anyone who thought the content of Consensus would be worth it.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Student/Auto loans repayment. Weekly vs. Monthly payments?,"Hello r/personalfinance!

I have just landed my first job in California in my chosen industry post-graduation. I have a car loan and student loans I very much want to get paid off as soon as possible in the most efficient way. Just for now with these stats I can't pay more than my current monthly payments are but is there a better way of doing it? I have recently heard of people paying their loans weekly or biweekly instead of monthly and it saving them a lot of time and money. How much could I save by doing the same?  Is it really worth the effort? I am a month away from my first student loan payment. Here are the stats:


**(Income driven student loan CONSOLIDATED)**

Income is aproximately $4150 a month

Current Principal: 40,885.84

Interest rate: 4.625%

Monthly payment: $126.69

20 year repayment





**Car loan:**

Balance: $9329.44

Interest: 10.05%

Monthly payment: $240

3 years and 11 months left on the loan



So what would my best plan of attack? Weekly, bi-weekly or just stick to monthly?
I've messed up my credit before and it's slowly rising back up.  I really want to fix my credit and get my loans squared away. I'm finally realizing how important it is to be educated in my finances and would really appreciate the help!

personalfinance,How many cards to rebuild credit?,"After a layoff I ran up a sizable balance on several credit cards. After a couple of years of spotty payment history, I finished a masters degree and moved abroad. I subsequently worked with a debt management company and got on a manageable payment plan with reduced interest rates. I made those payments reliably and on time, and noticed earlier today when checking my credit report that I am almost done! My cards handled by the management company will be paid off within the next three months, and the money that was going to that will pay off the one remaining card not on the plan (but on its own payment plan) over 5 months after. Also, because of raise at work, I may be paying it all off even sooner. Once things are paid off, I plan to shift the additional money from the raise entirely into savings.

Now I'm still living abroad, and plan to do so for at least one more year, and likely three or more years. It's possible that a return could be far away. That means I don't really need my credit right now, though I presumably will once I move back. My score is back from abominable and into the ""needs word"" range, but I actually have no access to credit in the US right now. I do visit the US at least once per year. 

I've decided to grab a couple of secured cards, use them pretty minimally, and pay them off monthly. I want to get them to convert into unsecured cards and basically build access credit to credit, mostly to try to increase my credit score. 

Should I stop at the two I have already been approved for, or should I add a third? At what point does this become more risk and hassle than benefit? I have to make these decisions soon, as if I do not apply soon, cards will not have arrived by the end of my upcoming US visit.

CryptoCurrency,Blockchain Revivals – Getting rich or buying bags?,"**TL;DR**: Are Blockchain revivals a worthwhile investment?

&amp;nbsp;

Revivals of old Blockchains seems to be a new trend. With many ICOs failing last year, reviving an old Blockchain could be a more noble way to start developing. Investors get a trustworthy coin with a long history and loyal following, while preventing discussions on pre-mine or risking SEC regulations. On the other hand, it doesn’t provide any marketing/development budget or “hype” that can surround an ICO.  Over the last months, I’ve noticed several of these revivals starting on BCT and I’m still undecided whether it’s a good investment or a way for bagholders to offload their coins on new victims. 

&amp;nbsp;

I’ve missed out on the early days of crypto so I’m looking for other ways to get a x100 on my investment. Revivals of blockchains with a long history seems like one of the few (risky) ways left to make this kind of profits.   
&amp;nbsp;

For my investment, I decided on FUNK. Their project is currently the lowest marketcap and it has a clear business case / experienced team for the revival. However, most of them look very attractive. CRAVE has for example gone from a blood red ""skull"" logo to a very professional website. Therefore, I'm considering buying into all of them in the hope that one become very successful. Would that be smart or buying someone's bags? I’ve listed all recent revivals I could find below. Partially to get advice on whether these investments are worthwhile, but also to give some credit to people working on revivals without getting any compensation from an ICO.   

&amp;nbsp;

Curious to see what people think?

&amp;nbsp;

For developers: Are revivals a good way to circumvent ICO regulations and do you expect we see this happening more often in the future?
For investors: Does it make sense to buy into revivals or are most of them doomed to fail?

Bitcoin,Consensus 2018: Evolution of Bitcoin Acceptance,"Consensus 2018 is the largest Bitcoin conference ever. Libertarians, Business Owners, and Financial institutions are coming together in the greatest numbers we've ever seen.

In addition to the Libertarians, Coders, Crypto Businesses/Exchanges the roll call has some high profile industry leaders from outside the Cryptosphere, including:

-President of the St. Louis FED

-Twitter CEO

-FedEx CEO

Representatives from:

-Microsoft

-IBM

-SEC

-CFTC

-World Economic Forum

-Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency(HSARPA)


Bitcoin is being taken more seriously than ever before. Just a few years ago we were laughed at for suggesting Bitcoin would compete with the FED. Now we have presidents of FED banks speaking at the annual preeminent Bitcoin conference.

Bitcoin is turning institutions inside out. Individuals act principally in their best interests ; even if their behavior harms the group as a whole. This is called ""Tragedy of the commons"" ; when a resource is overutilized to the point where it is unusable for everyone.

Bitcoin turns this on its head. Bitcoins properties attracts speculators looking out for their best interests. These speculators then have an interest in seeing Bitcoin succeed and use the leverage at their disposal to do so.

So while Bitcoin is a threat to the power and sovereignty of every government and bank on Earth ; it is individuals who make up those institutions.

Individuals within governments and banks adopt Bitcoin for (hopeful) personal profit. These people aren't trying to overthrow governments and banks; but they will do what they can to soften their institutions stance on their investment.

As Bitcoin continues going through its growth cycles it attracts more and more individuals. More and more people in more institutions that have a vested interest in seeing Bitcoin grow. These people support projects and initiatives that increase Bitcoins usefulness and therefore adds to its overall value proposition; which helps create a positive feedback loop.

That is the genius of the Bitcoin revolution. No bloodshed required. No protesting. Bitcoin is as much applied computer science and cryptography as it is a global psychological operation. We are re-inventing the concept of value.

Instead of fighting the old system we are building a better system. Instead of forcing people to change with threats of violence; people willingly change to chase profits.

The end-game for this revolution is the end of central banks. Global Value/Currency Standard. Peoples savings will grow in value over time at the pace of productivity increases. People will no longer lose value to inflation. Governments will not be able to spend money they do not have. Unprofitable businesses supported by subsidies will fail. Defense spending will fall dramatically around the globe.

Bitcoin can solve most of the problems whose root cause is ""money"". Bitcoin cannot fix greed and human nature; but it can mitigate the damage done by greedy and power hungry individuals.",cryptocurrency

With that said (ha), I am considering taking out a loan on my 401k to pay off my loans.

Let’s say I have 100k in 401k and and 50k in loans at 6.5%.  I can get a loan for prime rate + 1%, but that money is paid back to me.  That means I’d essentially slash my interest rate to 4.25%—but it’s effectively zero as I’m receiving the interest.  Of course I have opportunity cost, but I’d hedge that with higher risk equities in the rest of the portfolio.

If I put the remaining 401k balance in high risk equities, isn’t this the same has having a portfolio that is 50% equity and 50% low yield bonds?

I contribute the maximum to 401k and would like to continue to do so.  I’m thinking I can wipe out the loans, pay myself back some “low risk” interest and still save for retirement.

personalfinance,"Managing private student loan debt, I have a plan but is it valid?","I've had some idea of my financial situation for some time, but after really scrutinizing thenparticulars, I'm much worse off than I thought I was, which has left me in a difficult situation to manage. I have about $180,000 in private loans through Sallie Mae with interest rates ranging from 9.5% to 11.75%, and even with a pretty decently paying job, I just can't realistically handle the approximately $2,000 a month I'm expected to pay right now.

The plan I have is to first call Sallie Mae and see if I can work out something with them by which I can actually manage to pay the loans. If not, then I'm going to apply to put the loans into economic hardship deferment to buy some time. During that time I'll save the money I would have been putting toward the loans to build a buffer in case I can't quite afford to make a monthly payment once I get out of deferment. Then I can make payments for a while and try to build up some payment history. Once I have that in place, ideally 6 months or so down the line, I will try to consolidate the loans into one payment that I can actually manage.

I have some specific questions I'd like to know about though, and general advice about my situation would also be appreciated. First, if I call Sallie Mae to discuss adjusting my payments will I be hurting myself by giving them more information than I need to? I'm not opposed to letting them in on my finances since I'm sure they can find out, but I'm concerned telling them outright I can't afford my terms could hurt me. Second, will putting my loan into deferment hurt my credit score enough to make consolidation a problem? I just came out of 3 months of deferment, so especially if I add more time to that I'm worried I won't be able to consolidate my loans which is the entire goal of this endeavor. Third, even assuming I can get all the way to the point of consolidating my loans, will it actually solve the problem? Right now I'm operating under the assumption I can get my monthly payments down a few hundred dollars from $2,000 by consolidating them, but if that isn't the case then I need to look into another solution. 

Thanks for anything you can tell me, I'm not feeling great about my finances, but with some help it might not become a personal apocalypse.",finance
personalfinance,Am I missing something? Leaving government job and I'm thinking about taking lump sum of my contributions to federal pension plan even though vested,"Details:  

* I got a new job and I vest in the pension plan at 5 years this month. 

* I contributed ~3% and the government contributes about ~10% of base salary (sounds great, but read further).  

* If I take the pension plan, in the year 2049 (age 62), I'll be able to collect $462/month until I die, and then my wife gets $250/month after that until she dies (assuming she outlives me)

* If I take the lump sum of my contributions upon leaving, I'll get back about $18,000.

* If I take the lump sum and invest it at (conservative?) long term 6% annual rate of return, that comes out to about $100k. Dividing that by the $462/month, that gives me the same money for 18 years worth of pension. I REALLY can't imagine living past 80 years old, given my weight (frankly, obese), diabetes, and family history of CV disease.  In fact, living past 65 seems like a stretch honestly, and If I die before 62, I only get the lump sum of my contributions back anyways, with no investment return.  For my wife, it's only $250/month in the pension, which the 100k would be equivalent to 33 years of the pension at (90 years old).

The outlook for market returns has precipitously worsened in recent months, with analysts and investors growing increasingly confident that the lengthy bull market that began in the wake of the financial crisis could be, if not coming to a close, petering out. More market participants view the economy as being in the late stage of its cycle, and a recession is widely expected in the next few years. All of that could result in an equity\-market environment that’s a mirror image of recent years, where gains were pretty much uninterrupted, and volatility was subdued.

“2018 is seeing multiple tailwinds of the last nine years abate,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a report to clients that was entitled “The End of Easy,” in reference to the investing environment. “Decelerating growth, rising inflation and tightening policy leave us with below\-consensus 12\-month return forecasts for most risk assets. After nine years of markets outperforming the real economy, we think the opposite now applies as policy tightens.”

As part of its call, Morgan Stanley reduced its view on global equities to equal weight, saying they were “in a range\-trading regime with limited 12\-month upside.” It raised its exposure to cash, following Goldman Sachs, which last week upgraded its view on the asset class on a short\-term basis.

U.S. gross domestic product grew at an annualized 2.3&amp;#37; in the first quarter, below the 3&amp;#37; average of the previous three quarters, as consumer spending hit its weakest level in five years. While slowing growth isn’t the same as a contraction, the data added to concerns that a period of synchronized global growth was coming to a close. According to a BofA Merrill Lynch Global survey of fund managers in April, just 5&amp;#37; of respondents expect faster global growth over the coming 12 months, compared with the roughly 40&amp;#37; that did at the start of the year.

One of the primary reasons for Morgan Stanley’s tepid view revolves around central bank policy, which investors have increasingly cited as a primary risk factor. The Federal Reserve in particular is moving away from an accommodative monetary environment. The U.S. central bank has been gradually shifting its monetary policy in two significant ways: raising interest rates and reducing the size of its balance sheet. Low rates and the Fed’s bond\-buying program are seen as major contributors to the equity market’s massive rally over the past decade, and losing them could lower or remove a floor that has limited equity losses for years.

“These cyclical and structural headwinds are quite the one\-two punch,” Morgan Stanley wrote, adding that rising interest rates and a possible change in the economic cycle raised “the risk of a turn that would suggest strategically depressed returns.” Earlier this year, the investment bank said that expectations for future returns were at an 11\-year low, or at their weakest level since before the financial crisis.

Howard Wang, the co\-founder of Convoy Investments, called the Fed’s ballooning balance sheet “the fundamental driver of asset prices over the last decade.” He provided the chart below, which compares the growth in the U.S. money supply against the long\-term return of all assets, including global equities, bond categories, real estate, and gold. 

**1970\-2008** 

* US Money Base Annual Growth **\(9\%\)**
* Average financial asset annual return **\(9\%\)**

**2009\-2014**

* US Money Base Annual Growth **\(19\%\)**
* Average financial asset annual return **\(15\%\)**

**2015\-today**

* US Money Base Annual Growth **\(\-1\%\)**
* Average financial asset annual return **\(2\%\)**

 Courtesy Convoy Investments“I believe the trend of shrinking money supply in the system will continue for some time to come,” Wang wrote. “This adjustment is a painful but necessary process for healthier markets and economies.”

 So far this year, the U.S. stock market has mostly traded in a tight range. After rallying in January, both the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, \-0.97&amp;#37; and the S&amp;P 500SPX, \-0.86&amp;#37; swiftly fell into correction territory, where they have remained ever since—their longest such stretch since the financial crisis. A relatively strong May performance, however has pushed both indexes back into positive territory for 2018, with the S&amp;P 500 up 2.1&amp;#37; in the year to date, while the Dow is up 0.7&amp;#37;.",finance

personalfinance,Where to get a private student loan from?,Hi! I could use some help with finding a private student loan. I know that it is best to start with Federal loans and I still need private loans after that. Should I go from bank to bank and try to find out which one has the lowest interest? Right now I am banking with Wells Fargo. Do I have to apply for the loan first and then see what they tell me about interest rates. Can I do this at multiple Banks to compare them? I already know that I will need a cosigner.  Thank you for any answers to any of these questions!,finance
personalfinance,Auto loan or student debt priority?,"Quick question hoping an expert can turn my head into the right direction. I’ve recently become stabile financially, paying down my credit cards and plotting out my week and month making sure I’m making my goals. Progress is going so well on the credit end now I’ve got a target on the loans I’ve taken out. 

One is a student loan. Current sitting around 5700 @ 4.29 fixed - 66.11/month.

My auto loan is at 16500 @ 4.24 and went up a tiny bit on the new year. I pay 289.80/month.

I pay only the minimum as I’m currently trying to plot my attack on my 0% apr cards before the promo expires. I’m just wondering should I pay the smaller loan with the higher interest rate first or do I throw everything at my auto loan before they hit me with a higher rate than 4.29? I expect to be able to pay everything off before the end of the year I just wanted to get an expert opinion on the proper course of payment to save even a few bucks at this point. I’m think of going at the higher loan to reduce the interest but I wasn’t sure if killing off the smaller loan first would be better? I only know simple basics about apr I have the impression you’re supposed to pay off your highest APR first but I wasn’t sure if the amount would change that.",finance
personalfinance,How to calculate ROI - home ownership vs investing,"So I just bought my first home, and although its too late now, I would like to know what the ROI would be in 5 years with the home ownership (downpayment, mortgage, etc.) versus, if I had continued to rent and invested that money in ETFs.

For this, I have some questions:

1. How do I calculate my ROI on a home I am paying mortgage on? How do I factor in monthly mortgage payments, and should I only include principal payments? If avg home prices rise by appx 3.5% YoY, do I compound this interest rate?

2. If I had put all that downpayment in ETFs, and had a SIP where I would contribute the difference between my mortgage payments and rent, if I can estimate the rate of return, how do I compare this to home ownership?

3 Has anyone done this before, and do they have a template?",finance
personalfinance,Is it worth refinancing my Student Loan?,"I recently refinanced my loan of 15K down from 10% to 6.2 (Sallie Mae to SOFI). About 1 year ago. Over 10 years.

Well my working situation and credit rating has improved. I now make 15K more a year and stuff. So anyway, what that means is that I can refinance to a sub $300 a month payment over 5 years at an interest rate of 4.875%. SOFI claims this will save me about $2000+ over the lifetime of the loan.

personalfinance,Should I consolidate my debt?,"Hi everyone. Mid-20s. No savings to speak of, and no debts besides the ones mentioned below.

I'm sitting on about $4500 at 19%APR in CC debt that has ballooned from $1000 over the past year. I know that I have a lot of bad habits and I need to change, but I'll look through the sidebar and other threads for advice on budgeting

My particular question is this: should I roll my CC debt into my car loan and get a lower interest rate? I currently owe about $4500 off the original $8000(on the car loan) with a 4-year 4.5% (fixed, I believe) interest rate. My credit is in the 750s.

I make $45k right now, but that might not be the case in the next 6 months due to life changes. This life change would also involve selling the car, so a good chunk would go away.

How much would my credit be affected? How much higher would my interest and monthly payment likely be?

Any help would be appreciated, thanks.",finance

personalfinance,Should I buy another house? I’ve been house hacking for a year now. Need advice.,"I recently bought a multi family home last year for 240k. It’s quite a unique set-up. It’s three separate bungalows on one piece of land. Each was fully renovated with new floors, walls, pipes, etc. I had all homes inspected thoroughly before purchasing. Each home stands alone, and has its own water/electricity etc. My wife and I live in the main house up front, and rent the other two in the back.  

We bought this home with an FHA loan, and put 3.5% down with an interest rate of 4%. The current mortgage is $1800.00. We rent our two homes out for $900 &amp; $800 respectively. We use this money to pay our mortgage. The home that we’re currently living in up front can probably fetch about $1200-1300 in rent if we decide to rent it out. We would like to purchase another home in the area. The home is about 350k. Would it be wise to purchase this home, and use additional the rental income from the home we are currently living in to pay the mortgage for the new house? 

Stats:
I make 50k
Wife makes 40k
Utilities: $300 
Food: $200
Car payments $300 and $350
Insurance: $240 both cars full coverage 
CC debt: 3k 

We don’t have that many bills since the mortgage is pretty much covered by our rental homes. We would like to purchase another home soon. 

Thanks",finance
personalfinance,"Almost 40, just bought a house, 70k in credit card debt, trying to get a small business off the ground, with a baby on the way","This will probably read as more of a ramble but I'm at the end of my rope. Honestly I feel like my life has been a series of bad decisions. My wife and I used to get into arguments a couple years ago because she would want to go on vacation or do this or that and put it on the credit cards, and I'd protest because I HATE debt and I'd just spent the last couple years, and a divorce, getting clear of it. She'd tell me ""debt is fine, that's how you live life!"" Then a great job opportunity came up for her and we moved out of state, but had problems with my house and I wasn't able to get it corrected and sell it for over a year so that whole time I was paying a mortgage in another state while renting a house, way more than we could afford but it was like what can I do? In the mean time, more credit card debt racking up since there's not enough cash flow to pay for fuel for my 100 mile daily commute or the ikea furniture we needed.

That house was sold a while back and I used a lot of that money to fund a photography business which has been a passion of mine for a long time. I've actually got a shot at it and I've been doing decent booking weddings, but not enough to keep me afloat yet. However, it did become enough that I can't do it and my very demanding job that I had so I went part time, work from home with that making about 1/3 as much. Now that I have all day to sit and stew about where I'm ta in life the reality is setting in that I'm never going to get out of this credit card debt which is around $70k, and if I don't get more bookings I actually can't even pay all my bills. We've been paying only minimum payments because that's all we can afford, for over a year. Across probably 13 or 14 accounts this totals about $1800 a month. A few have balances as high as $13000, interest rates in the mid 20s. On top of all that she's got $150k in student loans which is getting us for about a grand a month, got two car payments totaling about $900 \(one of which is about to end, the other in three more years\). I guess that's it lol. Her salary is around 87k and I WAS making about 50k with my management job but now it's about 20k with the part time, plus whatever I make with photography \(around 10\-15k this year, should be much more next year\). We're going to be insolvent in probably two or three months max. I can't declare bankruptcy because they'll take all my photo gear which is worth about \~20k and I need it to shoot the weddings that I have booked out through next year, and obviously I'm not going to grow my business if I can't actually do the work. I financed most of it with the deposits from these people's weddings so even if I sold it all I'd just have to pay them back anyway, and destroy any prospect of having a future in this business. I'm ok with stiffing Discover or Citibank but not some young 20 something couple trying to start their life, you know? 

I just don't know what to do. I'm not too far from checking myself into a psyche unit somewhere because I can't deal with this stress, and all the regret almost every single decision in the past five years. From moving out of state, to the wedding \(not marrying my wife but spending money we didn't have by way of credit cards\), to using the proceeds from my house sale to start a photography business, to basically every time we went out to eat because we were too burnt out from our stressful jobs to bother preparing for dinner, to buying a more expensive house than we needed because it was ""nice"". Still not even expensive by my state's standards at all, at $250k , but a lot more than the house we were renting which we could have bought for $180k, if we had known the landlord was going to sell it when we moved out. 

What are my options?",finance
personalfinance,"Aggressively pay off car, or...?","After all monthly expenses, I easily end the month with $1,000 available to save. This is after contributing 10&amp;#37; to deferred comp, monthly amount for NWmutual life insurance, and I've already maxed out a Roth IRA for the year. I also have a pension through work. I have a few thousand in a savings account as emergency money, I am already a homeowner. Zero consumer debt \(pay cards off monthly\). 

I feel financially comfortable; what bothers me is my car loan and feeling like I could do something differently there. I still owe $7,500 on the loan. Interest rate is 8.25&amp;#37; and I have called USAA more than once to get this lowered\- I have excellent credit, do auto pay, and am not upside\-down on the loan \(looking up sales in my area and comparing condition/miles, I could reasonably ask 10k and it would be an easy sell\). Multiple people at USAA have explained that at this point, I am already paying less than what the lowest rate would be for a loan of that size today, so there's no ability to drop my rate. 

My question is: since more of my payments are going to principle at this point anyway \(payoff date is June 2020\) and that will continually be the case to a higher degree, is it worth aggressively paying the car loan off? Or would I be better off investing excess $ into something else where it can grow at a higher rate than I would save from paying off the loan early? 

I'm also kind of at a loss for what to do with my money next \- for more info, fiancé and I get married this summer \(paid for\) and intend to have a kid; some liquidity of investments would be nice just in case things get $$ with that whole process.  

One option I've considered is putting it towards principle on the house. We bought last year on a conventional loan; 4.125&amp;#37; 30yr; $380k balance. We pay PMI.  As soon as his ex does a re\-fi on the home they used to share \(she's delinquent in getting this done\), we will re\-fi ours to the VA loan she will free up. This will knock off PMI and lower the interest rate. Unsure of how paying down more of the principle right now will be beneficial, as opposed to other options.

I'm starting a summer job on Monday that's full time and 9.50 a hour. If I lose the grant now I wont be able to get it back for the rest of my time at college.

I tried going to the credit union that I'm a member at and got denied, they said my credit is too young and I don't have enough employment history since I'm just now gonna start my summer job on Monday. They said I could try to reapply with a cosigner but the person helping me warned me that its still likely I'll get denied because they don't really do student loans. It also appears that the private student loan lenders I've researched wont approve a loan to just take a single three credit class. I can't do a payment plan with the college because the tuition is due in a month and there's dates you have to enroll by to be able to do a payment plan. Do I have any other options to try to get a loan for this class? I really don't wanna lose out on the grant from my school because it'll be pretty difficult to afford to stay in school without it and without turning to private loans for the rest of college.",finance

I’m currently underwater on a loan I have for my daily driver.  I owe 20k on it right now and it has 60k miles on it.  I went to see what I could get for this vehicle on a lark because I’m tired of it and want a truck.  Went to the dealer and found out it is worth 12k because the market is flooded with this particular model ect ect.

So working with the dealership I found a sweet midsize pickup with 40k more miles than my renegade.  They would add the appropriate lift kit and tires ect for a reasonable price that I can’t live without.  The trucks themselves hold their value fairly well atleast better then my current ride.  All told the package would be $28,500 out the door if I put down $6,000 down.  

How I’m looking at this is, I gain $8,500 in debt and 40k more miles on my daily driver.  My monthly payment increases by 62.00 dollars a month and I have a gorgeous truck that I see sells for anywhere from $8,000 to $10,000 at 200,000 miles.

At that time we would sell our primary residence. We are not sure of the best way to purchase / finance the 2nd home.

Here is some background:

Current home value $360K, no mortgage, have a variable rate Equity Line of Credit of $280K with a $0 balance \(original purpose was for a safety net\)

2nd  home purchase price, $470K

Current gross income \- $190K, \($120K me &amp; $70K wife\)

I plan to retire in 2 years, wife in 5 years

Liquid cash \- $490K, minus any safety net

Retirement plans total value \- $1.3M

Pension Cash value at retirement \- $540K

Misc. Mutual funds &amp; Stocks \- $160K

No outstanding loans or credit card debt

Any advice on the best way to finance the 2nd home? 

Should the down payment be minimized or maximized or be somewhere in\-between?

Should we use the equity in the primary home and cash and have no mortgage?

With the new federal tax laws, with the deduction limits on state and local taxes of 10K, even with a large mortgage we probably will be border\-line for taking the standard deduction vs. itemizing.

Also we don’t want to have a mortgage when we are in our 80’s either, haven’t had one in almost 20 years and kind of like it that way.

We may also want to purchase another property in a warmer climate in the more distant future that would possibly be used for rental income and a winter get\-away. We haven’t looked into this in any detail yet though.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance

Hello everyone, I think this is the appropriate place for this type of question. I suppose the attached image makes no sense without a little back story/why I am interested in getting a different vehicle. I am a 27 year old registered nurse that just graduated with my family nurse practitioner degree (Still working as a registered nurse until boards, etc…). For the last six years I have been driving a 2006 GMC Canyon (Purchased used) which is in fair condition and now has 160k miles on it. It has been a great vehicle and treated me well, however there are two primary issues with my current situation. The truck gets pretty terrible gas mileage (20 mpg highway), and my girlfriend just moved 50 miles away to a neighboring city for school (Quickly finding out that my truck really doesn’t do well on gas costing me nearly $45 a week in gas). Secondly, the truck is getting up there in miles. On a late night trip home from my girlfriend’s (During a downpour mind you), my water pump stopped working and my truck overheated on the interstate. With a job switch ensuing, I need to have reliable transportation, especially if I anticipate starting a new job where late night breakdowns cannot interfere with my ability to go to work. Now I realize old vehicles break down, and need upkeep/maintenance (I am not afraid of doing this myself), but this event led me to evaluating my current mode of transportation.  My current financial situation is as follows: I am single with no dependents, all recurring payments are listed on the table above. While I am currently working a staff nurse, I will begin applying for Family Nurse Practitioner jobs within the next month, which in my area, the starting salary appears to be around 85-87k (However, I included my current salary as well. I have no student loans and the only outstanding debt is due to my mortgage (Which is more than I would like it to be, but life happened, I intend on attempting to refinance in attempt to lose PMI, etc… but that is another story). After I find a new job, I would also like to increase my overall financial security, contributing more towards my retirement, etc…


SO NOW THE QUESTION: Can I afford to purchase a new vehicle? If I were to purchase a new vehicle, I intend on keeping my current truck due to hobbies/need of having something to use without fear of tearing up a nice newer vehicle. When I checked with the insurance company, it would cost roughly $40/month to keep the minimal amount of coverage on it; which to me is worth having it on hand. Also, the KBB value of the truck is 4-6k, which again, it is worth more to me as an available tool.   In regards to make/model of a new (At least to me) car, I am looking heavily at hybrids (Accord, Sonata specifically. As far as purchasing a car, I am between going for a newer a used car from enterprise/Hertz where 1-2 year old cars appear to be priced 4k less than the book value. However, I have concerns with warranty information, and the increased in interest rate present with purchasing a used car (6%). The alternative would be to bite the bullet and purchase a brand new hybrid which appears to cost between 26-28k. My question with this is: when plugging information into generic calculators with $10,000 down (which I definitely do not have), the monthly payment is still &gt;$500 for a 36 month loan. Is it common to take a loan of 60 months? As someone that has never purchased a new vehicle, these terms/prices seem kind of crazy; yet I see people driving new cars on a continuous basis. – it just seems like a terrible idea…

I know that was a lot in a small amount of time, if there is ANY information you need from me please let me know.",finance

personalfinance,"Relocating internationally, no savings, how can I leverage my condo to quickly fund setup costs in my new home.","I am moving back to the SF Bay Area with my family of 4 after 3 years abroad that were a great experience but not so good for our finances. The bright spot is that we own a condo that we've been renting and will move back into. Other than that, we are basically arriving with the clothes on our backs and nothing else.

Big purchases we will need to make: 2 cars, all the furniture for condo, and we'd like to remodel the kitchen and/or bathrooms.

We have an emergency fund that I don't want to touch, and retirement accounts, but our savings have dwindled to almost nothing. 

My first question is, what is the best way to get access to the money we need?  Specifically, which is worse financially?

* Re\-financing \(we owe 200k on a condo worth 500k, with 25 years left on a 30 year fixed at 4.125&amp;#37;\) with a new 30\-year term \(to keep the monthly payment near what it is now\)
* Re\-financing with a term that is the same or shorter than our current term. 
* Getting a HELOC \(which I confess I am slightly confused about the mechanics of. Is is basically a bit like a credit card with a lower interest rate? E.g. we get approved to borrow a certain amount and when we access the money, we then have to pay back the amount we used in monthly installments that are charged interest\). 
* Getting auto loans for the cars, and stumbling through the first 3\-6 months slowly taking on projects at the house, like getting beds, replacing the kitchen sink, etc. as we can with the income from my new job.

I have excellent \(800\+\) credit, and see re\-fi ads offering APRs of 3.5 or so &amp;#37;, which makes me feel like if we could get a lower APR, and get 30\-50k to finance our set up costs, that this would be a reasonably good solution. 

Question 2 \- I am starting a new job, so I do not have a nice paper trail to support my loan application. If the re\-fi is the best option, will I be able to get one within a few days or weeks of stepping off the airplane? I really need the car situation sorted out quickly, and life without furniture isn't something I want to deal with for any longer than necessary. 

I can give more details if that would be helpful, but don't want to dump too much unnecessary info on the redditors who are kind enough to offer their advice. Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,Car loan denied weeks after signing papers and driving off the lot,"My credit was frozen across Equifax, Trans Union, and Experian due to the Equifax fiasco.

I recently signed the papers at a Honda dealership to get a certified pre-owned car with financing through the dealer (Honda Financial Services). 

May 2nd: When I filled out the credit application with my co-signer, my dad, the finance manager came back to tell me there was a freeze on my credit-I forgot to lift that freeze. No worries, we'll come back in a couple days and in the meantime, I'll lift my credit freezes. Honda seems to only use Equifax but just in case, I temporarily lifted the freeze at all three bureaus 

May 3rd: I used the websites for all three credit bureaus to temporarily lift my freezes from May 3rd through May 30th. 

May 4th: My dad and I visit the dealership again to sign the papers and get the car. The finance manager tells me my credit score and it's within range for an ok interest rate. I get the car, great. 

May 9th: I drive from the Midwest down south about 1000 miles / 11 hours away to move to my new job.

May 10th: One of the salesmen at the dealer has kindly agreed to mail me the car title (not yet in my name on the paper) down to my new address since it would be mailed to my parents' address in the Midwest otherwise--wouldn't do any good for me. The title arrives.

May 15th: I get notified that a lovely piece of mail has come from Honda financial services to my parents' address stating that my credit loan has been denied. The reason: Credit Freeze.

So how did they know my credit score when we signed the papers and what should I do now (for those of you who have dealt with this kind of headache before)?

I'm calling the dealer and Honda financial services tomorrow to see what's up and what I can do. I don't want to get suckered in to signing a new contract with the dealer because they think I want to keep the car at all costs but it doesn't sound like that kind of bait and switch game. 

My credit freeze was definitely lifted so what gives?

personalfinance,Debt payoff plans: comparing avalanche versus snowball methods,"Hello PF! Today I'll be going over avalanche versus snowball debt payoff plans, and I believe *each plan is an equally valid method, in it's own way*. 

Avalanche method is the one most proposed on this sub, paying down debt in order of highest interest rate. Assuming the person sticks to it, this saves the most money in the long run and is the objectively prudent choice. I recommend avalanche method to users that are confident that they will stick to the plan and won't be discouraged by seemingly ""slower"" progress. 

The other, *equally valid* method is snowball. A philosophy of Dave Ramsey, the idea is to pay down debt in order of smallest balance to give you nice psychological wins along the way. In addition, *and this part is critical to its success*, you must apply the minimum payment of each debt you eliminate towards the next debt (thus the symbolic ""snowball""). A huge benefit of the snowball method that many people don't consider is that it more quickly frees up minimum payments, providing an ""out"" for someone that's struggling with cash-flow problems. Even if they can only payoff *some* of the debt, at least they'll have less minimum monthly payments to worry about. However! One must consider that you'll likely lose more money to interest. Even if there's only a small percentage difference, avalanche method is always the mathematically smarter choice. 


Hopefully this clears up some of the confusion about definitions and the benefits versus costs of each method. Have a good day everyone :)",finance
Bitcoin,Bitcoin (crypto) death spiral,"I've seen quite a few articles about the so called ""Bitcoin death spiral"" few weeks ago, but since then I haven't seen any other post about the subject. Not sure if it's heavily moderated, thus such posts never make it on reddit anymore or the people just don't care or don't believe it will happen, thus not showing much interest.

Basically, the ""death spiral"" refers to the repeated cycles of shorting the Bitcoin ( or any other currency ) until its value goes close to 0. This is not some of the ""Bitcoin will go to 0"" old theories that appeared pre 2013 since in those theories nobody had the incentive to actually bring Bitcoin to 0 and it was only based on the fact that people will, all of a sudden, FUD and start dumping the coin. 

In the death spiral theory, the ones shorting the Bitcoin ( Banks, Governments, Federal Reserve or anyone having close to unlimited printed fiat money ) can actually destroy it WHILE STILL MAKING A PROFIT and never even having to own/touch a single Bitcoin! 
This is a win-win for them and I was wondering if the community have any plans on how this can be countered, other than just downvoting, trolling or ignoring the theory.

Long story short I started a new job on March 19, 2017. I submitted a W\-4 with a withholding of 7, IIRC. Payroll did not put it in and had me as single/0 withholding for the first 2 checks.

So I ran the calculator again and was given a result of 10 again \([https://imgur.com/3NeDOZl](https://imgur.com/3NeDOZl)\). This shows that I will owe $2000 in taxes at the end of the year, but is still saying to keep it at 10????

Should the withholding be a 10? With a 10 should I be paying more thatn $10.10 per check?

My first two years of college have been almost completely loan free due to my grades and family financial situation. However, yesterday I learned that all financial aid from federal or university grants are gone due to my parents financial situation in 2016.

During the year 2016, my Dad's father died. In his inheritance, my Dad received over a hundred thousand dollars (I believe in the form of a pension? unclear on this one). My understanding as of now is that over the course of a year this money was blown (in large part by my Mom). It has been made unclear to me where this money actually went. My assumption currently is credit card debt, terrible spending habits, and medical bills is where it is gone. Regardless, there is nothing left of it today. However, this of course is not known when applying for FAFSA and henceforth is it now assumed my parents can afford to make up a large sum of tuition. My new financial aid package for this year has gone from a max of 1-3 thousand dollars in loans or private scholarships to reach full coverage of my yearly tuition to 11 thousand of my 30 thousand dollar a year tuition being the only aspect covered by merit-based grants and scholarships.

My question at this point is what I can currently do outside of apply for more scholarships. I have been living at home and lack my own personal funds to make up the 12 thousand dollars left after my financial aid package (which does include a 7,500 dollar unsubsidized federal loan). I am planning on apply for as many scholarships and grants as I possibly can, but am unsure how much I can plan on receiving this quick (college junior, political science/history major, 3.86 GPA).",finance
personalfinance,What is the best company that will approve a loan to consolidate 50K worth of credit card debt for someone with an average credit score?,"Let's say I have 50K worth of credit card and personal loan debt. My credit score averages around a 650. Most loans that have been applied for, were denied because they require a 700 credit score or better. The 50K worth of debt is costing around $1,000 a month in total due to all the interest rates and there's no end in sight on this reducing in the next 10 years... but I feel a 5 year consolidation loan may help if the rate is lower. What company would be best to do this and guarantee approval?

Just to clarify, bankruptcy or selling a home/car is not an option here for me. Issues that got me into this debt, have already been identified and worked on the past 2 years but the process has been slow. I've also sold a lot of personal items but it only put a small debt.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Gives Me Faith in the Future And I’m not alone.,"Across the world, there is a question of trust.   
Assets disappear, currencies devalue, properties ceased, tax laws changed.  Even safe-haven bank deposits can be unilaterally gouged by negative interest rates.    My financial future is being controlled by political forces which I object to. 
   
And there is a lot going on that I object to… the collusion in big pharma and big banking.  Libor rates are rigged, funds are embezzled, collusion, fraud, unethical practices abound.  Across so many industries it the same story: big gone bad. 

But why does ‘big’ become ‘bad’?   One reason is it is hard to follow the money.  In most industries the mesh of rebates, kickbacks, subsidies and transfer pricing, confounds the ability to detect and fix problems. These kickbacks,  prevalent in every industry, are symptoms of a deeper structural problem : Layers of intermediaries and aggregators have confounded the transparency needed to detect and fix problems. 

Antiquated workflow processes, put in place by ‘appointed’ middle men, the elite who are ‘permissioned’ in the middle, create hidden relationships and hidden agreements.  Once in place, unintended collusion calcifies the industry, stalls innovation and invites theft.   

Take for example one of the largest, most liquid markets in world, the U.S. Stock Market.  It’s a fully digital market, yet every time I purchase a share of stock , more than five intermediaries are part of the transaction.  Why?  Think of the possibilities for misappropriation at each step.  Think about the inefficiencies.  

And ‘middlemen’, because of where they sit, are quite powerful.   Their ethics are tested every day.  They have information advantage, knowing both sides of the transaction.  They control access, they set artificial boundaries, they can dictate price.  In financial services, some intermediaries can re-use our assets without remuneration, generating ‘free float’ with our assets.   And, as we see with Facebook, middlemen can use our behaviors against our own self-interests.  

But, if we could collapse the middlemen, make transparent the transactions, eliminate information asymmetry, there could be a fix to the mess we are in. 

Bitcoin eliminates the middlemen. Using technology to drive consensus and vet transactions, the distributed, open access paradigm allows for everyone to participate.  There are no appointed middlemen to restrict entrance or to dictate the terms of membership.  

To me, when I think of bitcoin, it is more than a digital currency.  It is an economic platform for people around the world.  People just like me who are fearful of the elected – and unelected -- third parties who control our financial well-being.   

So, as a peer-to-peer economic platform that eliminates the need for antiquated, intervening ‘middlemen’, both bitcoin and blockchain-inspired markets look clean, accessible and efficient.   This is why, bitcoin and blockchain-based markets give me faith in the future.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"First time home buyer, questions about how to find a mortgage","Hello,

My wife and I recently had an accepted offer on the purchase of a new home in Seattle. We worked with an independent mortgage company fairway when we submitted the offer to get preapproved for a mortgage. They were recommended to us by our broker and had good reviews online when we looked them up.

The price of the home is 700,000. We are putting 20% down, have combined assets of $230,000 and combined income of $240,000 and both have excellent credit, 750+. We are looking for a 30 year fixed.

Our mortgage broker has been frustratingly vague about rates up to this point, talking about daily fluctuations and just saying that their offer will be competitive. When receiving disclosure documentation the interest rate was listed as 5.25% which seems really high. I know interest rates have gone up in the last few months, but when receiving quotes from other companies they were in the 4.7-5% range. Our broker tried to reassure us that those are bait and switch type deals where they will list at certain rates but when they pull credit and get all the financial details the rates go up.

When speaking with our real estate agent they enthusiastically encouraged us to go with our existing broker, too enthusiastic, to the point where I wonder if they are receiving some sort of kickback.

At this point we are 3 weeks away from closing, I don't even know if we can start this process over again and close in time.

How do I know if I am getting a good deal?

Are there good ways to calculate what a good rate is based on current market rates and our financial details?

Should I worry about fielding too many offers from banks if they are going to pull my credit report each time?

At what point in the process do we lock in pricing and a rate?

Is it too late to consider other options considering the immanent closing?

Is there any reason to suspect that our realtor may have an ulterior motive with her advice or would any sort of kickback be illegal?

Thanks for any responses,
Happy to reply with further details if necessary.

Update:
When I told my broker that I was shopping around and had a better rate in hand this was there response:

When I asked about other competing rates that I have in hand this was my brokers response:

""Wanting the lowest rate you can find is totally understandable, and I appreciate that you’ve done some due diligence to make sure I’m competitive. Consumers are trained to focus on rate. While rate is an important consideration, equally important (in my view) is partnering with Realtors to help our clients get their offer accepted, speed of execution to help your offer stand out, and also to ensure a smooth, timely close with minimal stress. Mortgages are just like most ‘products’ …we often get what we pay for. Lenders that have below market rates don’t have access to different money sources, they are just subsidizing the rate to compensate for operational deficiencies. By that, I mean they are trying to entice consumers with rate, due to longer turn times, along with much less communication. It’s a very transactional process for these lenders, but it’s how they are built (Chase included).

 

I bank at Chase, and so I called them today and shared your same scenario, and they are quoting lower rates. However (and this is key), they are quoting 35 days to close. I asked if they could expedite that and they said if they have EVERYTHING needed within 24 hours, they MIGHT be able to close in 30 days. We are currently 23 days away from closing.

 

To help you get a sense of where rates are for most local, reputable lenders, I’ve completed rate quotes at BECU and Guaranteed Rate. It’s unlikely either could close in the time needed, but checking their rates gives us a good sample for comparison.""

personalfinance,Are there any benefits to retaining my TSP account after leaving federal service?,"I'm not too well-versed in retirement-savings account as I don't contribute at the moment (loans) but will be doing so in the next few months (yay new job!)

I recently left federal service after about 10 months (lol) and got a far superior position back in the comfort of the private sector where life and decisions make sense. Anyhow, I'm having the hardest time attempting to move the money that was put into my TSP account (of course it's impossible to get money back from the government) and so I'm considering just keeping it there.

There is about $400 in there at the moment. I never contributed any of my own money into it, this is just the 1% the govt automatically puts in for employees. My questions are twofold:

1. Can I contribute money into the TSP account while not an employee? (I believe yes, it just can't be directly taken out of my paycheck and requires some paperwork--confirm?)

2. Are there/what are the benefits of the TSP that has people saying it's so great? [Everyone says the health benefits are great too but all I know was that I paid out the ass for shit coverage, so I'm weary of this statement]. When I have the money to put money in, what should I elect to put it toward if there are certain accounts that are better than others and what makes TSP 'better' than a typical 401k?

I'm mostly tempted to somehow extract my free $400 and wash my hands of the government and their ineptitude once and for all but wanted to see if I'm wasting an opportunity to truly benefit myself in the future..and what the margin of that benefit may actually be.",finance
personalfinance,Advice in dealing with defaulted loans,"So long story short,

I've had taken out a rushed consumer loan \(with no collateral\) a little over a year ago, with 18&amp;#37; yearly interest rates for 3 years. 6 months into it I was trying to settle it and pay it back in full, sent the agency multiple \(signed &amp; scanned\) letters asking to cancel my loan and calculate the settlement amount but everything was either ignored or after a few email exchanges directed to their phone lines which they never pick up. Without things moving anywhere, 7 months later \(so 6\+7 = after 13 months in total\) I stopped paying it hoping to catch their attention and get this thing resolved. Today, 15 months after I took the loan I found out I've been sent to collections agency \(essentially they sold the credit and all rights to it for another agency\). Due to interests being paid first, despite paying for 13 months I still have 87&amp;#37; of my loan to cover. So my question is, what are the usual rates that defaulted consumer credit loans are bought for and is it possible to make a deal with collection agency to, for example, only pay half of the loaned amount and annul the debt. Since I feel mistreated by the original credit company I'm considering an alternative \- to just let it go to trial. I don't live in my home country \(where I took out the loan\) anymore, don't have any work relationships there, no real estate or any other kind of property and no bank accounts, so possibilities of them actually collecting in on the debt are limited. What is my best recourse here?

personalfinance,Student Loan Advice,"Hey everyone, this will be a long post but I wanted to include all the details to get opinions for my student loans.

Background: Currently on my sophomore/junior co-op (internship) term at my school and looking to where I should be putting my money towards. I make $1186.04 every two weeks and it seems like by the time I am done working I will have made $14825.50.

Private Loans:

Sallie Mae: Principal: $40,812 Interest Rate: 10.625% Variable 1-month Libor Index (It hurts) Interest Accrued: $5,028.23

Wells Fargo: Principal: $22,467 Interest Rate: 10.24% Variable Prime Index (yea) Interest Accrued: $1,091.72

Federal Loans:

A: Principal: $5,500 Interest Rate: 3.760% Interest Accrued: $282.60

B: Principal: $6,500 Interest Rate: 4.450% Interest Accrued: $84.14

Questions:
Okay! After typing all that out I have a few questions that vary from place to place.


Idea: Okay so far I have earned 2 paychecks at my job meaning I have made roughly $2372.08 so far. I'm thinking to completely diregard the federal loans right now because of their better interest rate. My main idea is to start throwing all my earned cash at the sallie mae loan and pay off the ~5-6k interest and made a ~7-8k dent in the principal. 


1.) Is this the right idea to just start paying off the highest interest loan or is it a better idea to throw it at the Wellsfargo loan since there is less accrued interest and more of the money will go towards the principal for the Wellsfargo?


To sum this question up: Plan A: throw all money at sallie mae and nothing else  Plan B: throw all money at WellsFargo and nothing else. Plan C: A mix?


2.) Which of the two indexes is ""safer"" and less likely to rise in your opinion: prime or 1 month libor? I know that my wellsfargo uses prime which only really changes when the federal decides to change and has a lower rate but I wanted to know if the prime rate would cause it to eventually overtake my Sallie Mae loan since the libor rises daily.


3.) I know these loans will capitalize at the end of the 6 month grace period, should I still throw all my money at the highest interest and let the lower interest rate loans capitalize? I wasn't sure if I should pay down the interest on them all or just throw my money at the highest interest loan. My logic was that it would be like transferring my loans from a higher interest to a lower interest by letting the lower interest ones capitalize.


4.) My parents claim was that my bad interest rates were due to their mistakes in the past but according to my dad lately, he says his score is actually high surprisingly. Was this due to something other than his credit score?


5.) Can a cosigner ever hurt your interest rates?


6.) Am I able to refinance any of these loans before I graduate? I know many require graduation but I wanted to ask anyway since I'm working at the internship.


7.) Is there any way to lower these interest rates  (like a fixed rate) or am I pretty much out of luck until I graduate?


I really appreciate all of your help and I'm trying my best to stay ontop of this to save myself as much money as possible.",finance

I have $4K in an emergency fund, which is sufficient because I can't lose my retirement and am in virtually no danger of losing my job.  I have an additional $5K in savings, which I intend to use for home improvements, new decking, landscaping, etc.  

I have about $28K in a traditional IRA (USCGX, capital growth mutual fund) that I put about $3K a year in.  No Roth.  I currently put 11% into TSP and matched at 5%.  Balance is $88K, estimated to be $313K at age 60 ($1,519 before tax per month payout).  Social Security estimate (hahaha) is about $1.5K per month at age 62.

I have roughly $800 per month of extra money that I'm saving for above mentioned home improvements.  After that, it will be pay as we go for carpet, paint, etc.  We live frugally, but want to retire at 60, and be able to travel some and maintain a decent standard of living.

I know I should start a roth, but $5K per year for 12 years doesn't seem like a lot of effort.  I could stand to increase my TSP up to around 15% (+5%) and split it between roth and traditional.  I have excellent medical care as a retiree.  What am I missing?  Thanks for your time and advice.",finance

Today I noticed I had not yet received my tax refund. I logged onto the IRS ""Where's my refund?"" and it said that my refund was applied to a balance that I owe. This was confusing because I have never received a letter that I owe, and I have never owed on my taxes before. 

I made an account on the IRS website to see what it is saying, and it is saying that I owe $4,500 from 2015.

personalfinance,Hisband charging to my credit card-19K debt and counting. Recourse?,"Found out husband took a pay cut. Never told me and started charging business expenses, monthly bills and BS purchases on my credit cards. Two months he’s racked up 14K. He still owes me 5K from a credit line I took out for 10K that he said he would  pay back, but didn’t. I whittled it down to half in 2 years.

We keep our finances separate-especially taxes, due to his financial problems. But I loosened up some and gave him access to 2 credit cards to build up his credit score. He needed a card for business expenses and misc.  and had been pretty good about paying it all off every month.

So given I have much smaller earning power, I am scared. I’m increasing work and cut off one credit card completely, but no way can I dig  out from this.

After speaking with him about it, he assured me it is a temporary issue and his pay will double next month. But when he told me the amount, it was only 20% more than usual. Then he explained that his bonuses aren’t included in that figure and he couldn’t tell me how much they would be-the same, more or less than before.

I asked him to project a timeline for paying off the credit cards and he dropped the bombshell.  He will owe state and federal tax payments of $3K over the next 5 years. Or, I can sink into greater debt  by letting him use my credit to renovate the rental house he has and sell it. Since he just got out of Chapter 13 last year ( previous tax debt)  he can’t refinance the house for renovations, can’t get lines of credit.

Of course I said to sell the  house as-is and pay off all debt.

Until then, month  to month life until then is not going to get much better.  The 3K tax payment is coming off the top, leaving very little for credit card debt. He’d be able to pay monthly bills, but it would be tight, and  I don’t see how he’s going to handle the credit card debt. I’m especially uncertain because of the fact he never paid back the 10K credit line.

Any ideas about what I can do? Obviously, I need to strip him of credit cards. But the problem is that the  bills on the credit card are in his name, not mine, so I can’t call to take them off auto-pay. 

I am gathering as much stuff as possible to sell. Would love to sell the car he drives. It’s in my name, worth $20K and it’s paid off. But then he’d probably want a new car it would be another bill. My car is leased m, so no savings there.

It’s a bad situation so any ideas would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Reddit!",finance
personalfinance,Would I be able to refinance my debt in any way?,"So I got my finances into a mess. I'll save you the story, but suffice to say I'd like to get back on track asap.

financialindependence,Mortgage Recast?,"I just received a packet from my bank about a ""mortgage recast"".  I owe about ~$270,000 on my house that's worth approximately $450,000.  

It looks like the interest rate stays the same (3.65%), and they are just offering to lower the required payments from $1750 each month to $1395.

I had previously made several large payments in the past years to lower the amount owed, and they've caught on that now I'm 88 months ahead of schedule.  

I understand that their ""plan"" is that I just do the minimum payments every month and keep my original end of loan date and end up owing more in interest, but from my perspective if I accept the offer I am lowering my overall minimum expenses each month, and can still just put the extra principal down any time I want.  From a risk perspective (job loss, etc) this is very attractive.

I am not FI yet, but plan on RE in ~10 years, and would consider investing the extra principal each year into additional savings in tax advantaged accounts.

personalfinance,Refinance Student Loans or Assist with Payments,"I'll try to keep this short but still provide the necessary information. When I went to undergrad \~7 years ago, I agreed to take out as many federal loans as possible under my name.

The agreement was that as soon as I pay off the loans under my name, I would assist with paying off the loans under his name.

Fast forward to now and I've paid off all of my own student loans and now I've got to help my Father out. I have two options from what I understand. I can refinance his loans \(partially or in full\) so that they are under my own name via SoFi \(or a similar company\). OR the loans can remain under HIS name, and my father can make me Authorized Payer on Nelnet, which will allow me to make payments. 

I don't understand the tax ramifications for both options. Is there a clear option that is ""better"", or does it not make much of a difference. I'm guessing refinancing will achieve a lower interest rate, which is nice. But I'm also aware that I'll be creating a private loan by doing this, which will cause the loss of certain protections like IBR.",finance

* Car and Insurance \(full coverage\) were under my Dad's name \- I wasn't in the insurance policy so the the insurance company will most likely not cover my car \(plus the repair would cost more than the car is worth\)
* I'm assuming the car is just a total loss/wont be getting anything from the insurance
* I'm looking into getting a car from a dealership and need a loan
* I have a 720\-ish credit score \(I moderate it carefully\)
* CATCH IS I might have trouble getting approved for a car loan
* From Sept. 2016 to Fed. 2018 I was working under the table in construction with my dad \(earned approx $1700 a month\)
* For the past 3 months I was working at an actual job paying me an actual wage but now is my last week as I cannot afford to get another car soon enough with minimum wage\(things are hard as it is\)\(I have the pay stubs\)
* Starting next week I'm returning to my old construction job that will be giving me a pay raise to around $2100\+ a month \(plus my dad will be doing all the driving so having a car isn't urgent at the moment\)
* I will be unemployed with income by the time I attempt to apply for a loan
* I can't get a good co\-signer for a car loan \(friends/family have bad credit, no credit, or just don't trust me enough to co\-sign\)
* I'm looking to get a recent compact at around $13k\-$16k

Approx 14 months ago I went to a credit union and applied for a car loan. After a credit check \(730\-ish points\) they approved me for up to $20,000 at 3.25&amp;#37; interest with $2500 down for 60mo. I was so close to taking the loan until they asked for proof of income. At the time I was working under the table and only got paid in cash. I had no proof of income even though I could easily afford to pay. I couldn't find a co\-signer so I had to turn to buying a car off craigslist.

I'm working on starting my own business in the coming months and I need a reliable and efficient car that would also help me make an impression \(thus why I want to get a recent compact\)\(Don't worry I'll be in the insurance policy this time\)

What can I do to get approved for a loan with a reasonable interest rate?",finance

personalfinance,Should we stay or sell our townhouse?,"We bought a townhouse just over a year ago at 247k + 5k towards closing. Monthly payment is 1200 mortgage + 225 taxes + HOA. When we moved in, the HOA was $250 and the reserve seemed healthy with $500k. We didn't realize the upcoming roof replacement was going to total upwards of $1 million. Since we closed, the HOA has moved to $300/month and our management company says it will be $400/month in a year in order to pay for the roofs. So our monthly payment will have moved from 1675 to 1825. 

Home prices have skyrocketed and if we were to sell, we could get $280k for the townhouse now. So that would be 33k minus the realtor's fees on the sale of the townhouse (5% ; 14k). It's extremely soon to sell and we love living here -- but the prospect of a $400 HOA may hurt property values in the future. There's a house we like listed at $335k, so we are considering listing and making an offer contingent on the sale of our townhome. We would put 20% down and have an interest rate of 4.625% with closing of about $10k. 

Nearby communities have a significantly lower monthly HOA, but they do not cover roofs and a lot of other items our community handles. That said, we would have completely written this community off if the HOA had been $400/month when we were looking to purchase. Is it too early to sell? Should we stay in the townhouse? Thanks for any help, not exactly sure how to navigate this. I tried to be pretty detailed, but let me know if there's any additional information I can give.",finance

BlockChain,A conversation with a friend about what blockchain has the potential to do to the economy.,"Now, I'm going to preface this and cover myself by saying that I'm neither an expert in blockchain, economics, or clairvoyance. These are just thoughts and I welcome discussion, pushback, feedback, and telling me where I'm wrong with open arms. I'm making a lot of claims here without an equal amount of warrants. I know what I know and I don't know what I don't know. This is, at least for me, a pretty damn dense collection of thoughts which is why I'm typing it out and even then, I flirt with the character limit without my full syllogism. 

Now lets dive right in, shall we? I predict that in our ever more automated economy (assuming that blockchain technologies become successfully commercialized, which, if you've seen the LastWeekTonight episode on cryptocurrencies, is definitely not the status quo), a few things will happen, in no particular order, and I'll throw an arbitrary timeline down of this all coming to fruition in the next 2 decades. 


1. Seeing as how the only professions that are really safe from automation these days are those that are either legally protected or licensed professions, we will still have human politicians, lawyers, doctors, entrepreneurs, emergency services, etc. The rule of thumb that I am operating with here is that if there is a powerful enough industry lobby or if the public would have an absolute fit seeing a computer doing something that we just want to be done with a human touch, then that profession is relatively safe. More automation might happen in the background and foreground both, but at the end of the day, we won't cease entirely to interact with people that are paid to provide some sort of service. There are just too many societal pressures and prestigious universities and people with a calling to see a significant portion of the population not participate in the workforce and settle for receiving a living wage. Noticeably less human interaction on the day to day and the richest people and companies are the owners of the intellectual property that everyone is using. Don't quote me on this but I'm pretty sure that the Forbes Fortune 500 has seen an increasing percentage of tech companies over the years and that trend will almost certainly continue. 


2. The economy will shift more heavily from B2C (business to consumer) to B2B (business to business) companies. This won't necessarily take entry-level opportunities away from people (or, according to CGP Gray, it will a lot) but more unskilled labor away from consumer-facing positions and into administration and manufacturing. We will still have minimum wages and the ajoining debates. This will still be where students learn transferable skills. There may even an uptick in the viability of labor unions.    

 
3. Taxes. The government still needs to run and it's in their interest to make sure that their revenue stream isn't threatened. In an ideal situation, we have return free filing (Adam Conover does a fun piece on why we don't do that in the US), but suffice it to say that day will never come. When the economy runs like normal on the surface and significantly fewer people are declaring significantly less income per crypto sources, I bet that internet usage will become an official utility (if it isn't already. Idk what the status on that is) and on top of paying ISPs for the access, Uncle Sam get's his cut too. I don't know how net neutrality plays into this but I forsee ISPs becoming pseudo utilities providers. Some forseeable potential reactions to this might be a spike in the number of LANs, intranets, Tor use, and other communication technology safeguards. I am not up to date with how nimble federal law has historically been compared to the tech industry but I will assume it is safe to not give congress and the glacial rate at which they get anything done the benifit of any doubt.

TL;DR Our jobs are safe, our money isn't. 

Again, if there are experts in the room, please chime in. I'll also try to link sources.",cryptocurrency

investing,How are you structuring your portfolio for the quantitative exit we're about to experience?,"I know the Fed has already begun the exit, but we are still in the relatively early stages. The QE program put in during the credit crisis pushed interest rates to historical lows, made bond and CD yields extremely unattractive, and basically forced investors into stocks and other riskier assets. One must assume that the end of the program \- rising rates, rising inflation, rising yields will cause an opposite effect. Additionally, one of the only metrics by which stocks are attractive is that they are clearly a better option than bonds. Once that valuation boost is pulled, what happens?

financialindependence,Clarification and guidance on ROTH calculation,"Below is what I found in a Federal forum so the information in it might be talking about US Federal employee benefits but my question is more about ROTH IRA/401(K)/TSP. 

Can anyone identify any weaknesses in the argument below that is AGAINST ROTH if at a certain tax rate? I would like to know and learn too.

    Target retirement age = 62
    Will have 25 creditable years in Federal service with a modest high 3 (or 5) of $80,000.
    Plan on making modest withdrawals of $30,000 per year from TSP/ROTH until age 70 at which time I will begin to collect Social Security of approx., $2,800/month in addition to Fed retirement and the $30k.
    Investments in either account will continue to earn the 5% per year.
    
    First, let’s look at the TSP scenario:
    TSP balance at 62 = $477,000 earning 5% per year.
    Federal retirement = $20,000 per year.
    TSP withdrawal = $30,000 per year for a total before tax income of $50,000 per year
    Taxable income (assumes standard deduction remains at $12,000) = $38,000
    Taxes due = $4,500
    Expendable income $45,500 per year.
    TSP Balance at age 70 after 8 years of drawing $30,000 per year and earning 5% per year on the remainder = $404,000.
    
    Now for the ROTH Scenario:
    ROTH balance at 62 = $310,000
    Federal retirement = $20,000 per year.
    ROTH withdrawal = $30,000 per year for a total before tax income of $50,000 per year.
    Taxable income = $8,000
    Taxes due = $950
    Expendable income = $49,050 per year.
    ROTH Balance at age 70 after 8 years of drawing $30,000 per year and earning 5% per year on the remainder = $157,000.
    
    At age 76 the ROTH account would be depleted while the TSP balance would be $327,000.
    
    I could take $36,000/year out of the TSP to make up for the taxes and that would still leave me with $340,000 in the TSP at age 70 versus $157,000 in the ROTH. Where the ROTH runs out of money at 76 I could continue taking $36k per year from the TSP for another six years before depleting it.


Edit: There could be a lot of assumptions in this section I got so let me try to clarify a bit. Can someone tell me for the salary and tax situation here, with a max contribution to ROTH TSP or Traditional TSP, which one will come out ahead in $ terms assuming same return? Simply trying to check if ROTH TSP is a better option given the tax bracket, contribution, and other factors. Use withdrawal rate if beneficial but I think it could be distracting from the original question.",finance

personalfinance,Got a promotion at work with a 50% pay increase! What debts should I pay off first?,"For the past few years, I've been working 3 jobs (one full time, two part time), in part to pay the bills, and in part to have some spending money. Even with the three jobs, I only pulled in 55k gross last year. This new job pays 60k, plus up to an 8 percent bonus every year.  I plan to stay on at one of my second jobs for the time being, since it's only one weekend a month, and two weeks a year (yes, it is what you're thinking it is). 

So altogether, I should be pulling in approximately 70k gross going forward, and I'd like to pay down some debt a bit more aggressively. What should I tackle first? 

Current debts:

Mortgage balance of approximately 155k, 30 year mortgage @3.375% (28 years remaining) . Taxes and insurance are escrowed, so monthly payments are 1150.

Vehicle payment of 260 a month. 9500 remaining balance, 2.5% interest rate, approximately 3 years remaining on the loan. 

Student loans are 180 a month, with a variable interest rate which is currently at about 2.5%, with a 25 year repayment schedule. Remaining balance of approximately 40k.

Special assessments on my house (think of them like taxes that are paid yearly). Remaining balance of 8k owed over roughly 10 years, with an interest rate of about 4.5%.  It is escrowed into my mortgage payment, and I figure that if I pay these off, it will lower my mortgage payment by about 80 bucks a month.

I know general consensus is to pay off highest interest debts first, but I've heard about this snowball method where you pay off the smallest balance debts first, and then roll that amount into the higher debts next.",finance
personalfinance,Does it ever make sense to take out student loans when you can pay out of pocket?,"I'm hoping to start a masters program in my field next year that should make me more employable. While I'm planning out how the next few years should look, I'm trying to figure out if it could make sense to have some of my schooling paid for in loans, or if I should just pay it all up-front from my savings. 

The program I'm hoping to get into will cost around $20,000 for tuition and fees total for 3 semesters. Currently, I have $30,000 saved up, but I'm planning to have 40k by the time I'm ready to quit my job. If I'm accepted to the program, I will be able to live rent-free at my mother's place while I'm at school. The school is in a low cost of living city, and I can live frugally for those few semesters if I need to. I will have a car (provided by my parents), but I will need to pay my own health insurance, car insurance, gas, and food. I can work a little while I'm in school, but I don't see myself pulling in more than 10 hours per week while I'm a student. I can also work during the summer.

I am eligible for a federal grant of just under $4,000 per year, but the grant has some conditions attached to it that I'm not sure I can follow through on. If I accept the grant, but then don't comply with the conditions after graduation, the grant will be converted into an unsubsidized federal loan. The conditions stipulated by the grant would severely limit the places I could work and would probably limit my income for several years.

Should I gamble by taking the grant and then having it possibly convert into a loan? Should I try to get some other kind of loan? Should I suck it up and just pay entirely from my savings and then start my post-grad career with very little left-over? I currently don't have anything in a retirement account, so I'd like to put $5,000 into a Roth IRA this year, but that money might be better utilized avoiding debt/interest from student loans.",finance

Obviously, I’m not going to get myself involved in a car payment like that, so my current plan is as follows:

1.) Pat off the medical debt in one lump sum, which will leave me about $5,000 in savings.

2.) Apply for a credit card and make some small purchases that I will pay off quickly.

3.) Continue to build my savings.

However, this still leaves me with questions.  Is this the right way to go about fixing my credit score the fastest?  What kind of credit card should I apply for?  How long am I realistically going to have to wait to get my credit score to recover to have a chance at a loan below 10-15%?

personalfinance,First Time Home Buyer in Phoenix area,"We recently got married and moved to Phoenix, currently staying at our family friends rental property (rent free). No kids!

Both of us have decent jobs and our combined pretax income is a little over 200k. Monthly savings are around $8-9k right now. Both our FICO scores are more than 800 each. 

Based on my research right now, housing and interest rates are increasing rapidly. Our near future options on house hunting are either - 

A) We buy a townhome around 200k possibly in Tempe (closer to ASU), compromise a bit, pay it off in the next 5-7 years or so, then move into a bigger home when we have kids, where good school district matters (Scottsdale / Chandler) and put the townhome on rent. 

B) We buy a house right now in Chandler/maybe Gilbert (not too far because we both work in Scottsdale and prefer the area over North Phoenix because all our families and friends are in Chandler). This house would ideally meet all our expectations (newer construction, upgrades, 3-4 beds, pool, 2500-3000 sq ft, etc) budget 300-425k, and invest in a rental property later.

C) Wait for a year or so for housing market and interest rates to stabilize, while we rent or lease for 6 - 12 months. 

What are the first steps on getting a house? I already reached out to a realtor and a loan officer, who said he'll get us pre-approved for 30 yr at 4.75% or 15 yr at 4.25%.

Is it even a good idea to buy right now or should we wait for a dip? What should we do?

Another is also $8700 with a 9.750% interest rate. We have unpaid interest in fees (in deferment from school and we no longer have to pull out private loans since our circumstances changed). Any payment towards the loans would go towards the interest and fees first, which is unfortunately at $1,391 right now.

investing,At what point does the principal risk of holding bond funds offset the fixed income they provide?,"With interest rates surging after years of being relatively stagnant, bond funds seem less attractive. For example, Vanguard's VBTLX currently has a 2.7% yield, but is down just under 4% YTD and about 8% since it's high in Summer, 2016. I understand that the yields of the fund's holdings rise with interest rates, but they haven't kept up with the decline.

With interest rates and inflation picking up, are cash and actual bonds looking like better holdings than bond funds in the short term? Or is there an expectation that the bond funds will level off at some point? Thanks in advance!",finance

personalfinance,Cash out refinance to pay off credit card debt?,"So in the past couple years I ended up racking up a significant amount of debt on 2 credit cards and a line of credit, totaling right about $20,000. Situations didn't play out well for a while and this is the result. I've been stuck now for quite a while making absolutely zero progress on this debt. I've managed to not expand the debt further, but every time I make some payments and get ahead, I end up having to draw on the credit cards just to meet basic living expenses again and have been left hovering right around this $20k mark in debt on them.

I recently was told that I may want to consider a cash out refinance, but I was hoping to get some advice from people who know a bit about this stuff and also don't have a stake in trying to get me to sign anything for their company. (Bank in this case)

Quick note: So far I have not signed anything and they have not done any credit check as I froze my stuff after the equifax breach
 
My mortgage at the moment has a current principle balance of $96,300 at a 4.125% interest rate, which I pay roughly 760$/mo on(This includes mortgage/hazard insurance and property tax) and after a short consultation with an employee at the bank I go to that recommended this to me, she gave me a rough estimate of a new mortgage rate of around $960/mo at a 5.75% interest rate and 5.84%APR on my home, which is now valued at around $175,000. In order to give the precise numbers she said she would need to do a credit check, but that was her initial number she gave me.

I've been trying to figure out the math behind this and trying to figure out if this is something that would benefit me, but as it is I am paying:
$760/mo mortgage
$250/mo minimum payment on CC#1 (interest 23.6%, balance $5,900)
$140/mo minimum payment on CC#2 (interest 19.8%, balance $5,100)
$110/mo minimum payment on LoC (interest 17.6%, balance $9,800)
Totaling around $1260/mo on my mortgage and debt minimum payments.

Due to this I'm barely scraping by, and just barely keeping level. Like I mentioned earlier, I have been unable to get my debt below $20k no matter how I seem to try. If I could get this debt rolled in to a mortgage and drop my monthly payments by nearly $250-300 per month this would be a pretty big deal for me, but I just can not for the life of me figure out how to factor in the interest rate increase and how that affects things.

So my big questions are: 
-Would it be worth it to consider this and go through with the credit check and figure out the exact numbers and if the estimate is about right?
-What are the risks in a cash out refinance, and is there any other fees or hidden costs?
-Looking in to previous questions on this topic, I noticed people mentioned needing an appraisal on their house, is this a mandatory thing for all cash out refinances? If so the person I was discussing this with has so far failed to mention it what so ever which concerns me.

I just feel like I am stuck in an endless loop with this debt. I've gotten a slightly better paying job in the past year, which thankfully has stopped me from racking up more debt, but its not quite enough to make progress towards paying it off. I've cut costs pretty much everywhere I can, I no longer have television/cable plan at all, I ditched my smart phone and now use a $20/month flip phone, my internet is the cheapest available to me in my area, and I'm cutting electricity use any way possible, and all of this is just to make sure I break even. 

I understand that the trade off of this method seems to be a significantly higher amount of interest you are paying in the end, but it also seems like it may be a way to actually begin making real progress on paying it off, even if I do end up paying more in projected interest in the long run. I just hope I can get some advice from people who understand this more than I do however. Apologies that this is so long-winded, this has been weighing on my heavily lately and I figured putting as much detail in to this as possible may help any advice people may have to offer.",finance
personalfinance,"Student loan has a 0.96% to 1.26% interest rate, my PEL (Plan Epargne Logement, french medium term account) earns 1.5%. Should i borrow enough to ""cap"" it?","Hello Personalfinance. I come to you today with a question that i hope you might be able to answer, even if it concerns someone in France.

I recently went back to being a student, and even if i saved some money while i worked, i still need to borrow some money if i want to live the next 2 years. 

At first i thought about using my PEL which meant ending it since you once you withdraw money from it, you can't place money on it anymore, and it doesn't produce anymore interests. But my banker told me that a student loan would be more interesting since it cost between 0.96% and 1.26% (still have to see how much exactly, that's why i'm going), which will still allow me to earn money from the PEL.

Now i'm thinking, if i earn more money with the PEL than i will pay back for the loan, wouldn't it be logical to borrow enough to cap my PEL (the maximum is 45000€ i think), or at least place as much as possible on it? The loan also has a maximum, i really don't remember how much but it's not the most important thing in this question (i think it's 30000€).


So should i only borrow the 5-7000€ i need? Or should i borrow more to allow my PEL to yield more interest over the years? I know that i'll have to pay back the interest at some point, but since it's a student loan i can delay the start of the paybacks up to 3 years (i think), and the job that i am sure to have in 2 years (hearing care specialist) will pay pretty well. So this won't be a problem.

I hope this is enough informations, i'll add more if you need them, just tell me.


Edit: I just forgot to say that it seems too simple to be true but after all, why not see if it's true? I signed on that PEL years ago, the interest rate is much lower now.",finance
personalfinance,How should I invest 1million USD cash (CAN),"Apologize in advance for the lengthy and disorganized writing, TLDR at bottom

This is not a hypothetical question. I'm a Canadian living in Toronto. 2 years ago my family planned to do some business in U.S. but ultimately decided not do. So now they are trumping me with a small loan of million dollars. Initially I planned to buy a house in Toronto with the money, but I dont think it's worth it.
I want to use this million to make more money for me, and i rather use the capital gain on this mil to get a mortgage on a house.

I want to put the money in low-mid risk funds, from what I looked up and asked around I can get anywhere from 4-6% annual return. 

I’m a 27 years old dental hygienist and I have very little to no knowledge of finance and investment. I do consider myself to have pretty good common sense and I usually make my decision on data/evidence and numbers. 

So this is what I’ve been doing: 

I went to my Canadian bank (RBC) and they advised me to put the money in equity and bonds. But those are mainly its own bank products, more importantly, Canadian economy is doing pretty hot right now, prices are high, it may literally be not worth it. 

I plan to go to other banks and speak to more financial advisers; I just want to hear what everyone has to say. 
I’ve been talking to everyone, from financial advisers to my accountant. Bank’s financial advisers want to buy their own product, and my accountant just gave me his honest subjective opinion (he put it in berkshire and s&amp;p500)

I want to put the money somewhere so it can grow or at least keep up with the inflation, and while also expect to have a steady return from it. I also need to keep it liquid so when the timing is right I might have to take the money out to exchange to Canadian dollars. 

The bottom line is I don’t know where to start and there are simply too many options. So far the best bet are funds from what I can gather and been told, but I’m still pretty clueless. 

My issues/questions:

What should be my expectations? Im definitely not going to put much if any money in high risk funds, but at the same time I expect a higher return than to say put the money in the bank and collect interest rate. 
Should I expect 5%? More or less? 

Should I put all the eggs in one basket or diversify the funds?  Should I go for the bigger institutions like JP morgan and Goldman sachs ?  Right now I literally don’t know who to go to. 

Handling my family’s finance and learn to manage money like this is something I have to pick up sooner or later, and it’s quite crucial to me. Any advises on where to start? Reading recommendations? Websites? Im even willing to take a course(s) if it’s helpful. I brought warren buffett’s fav book “The intelligent investor” and I find it difficult to read   

On the side note, if there are any Canadian financial experts here please feel free to drop your two cents for me as well, I’ve also consider to exchange the 1M USD back to Canadian dolllars when the exchange rate is good, so I can expect 1.3M in Canadian dollars.  I can put 300k to down payment for the house and collect the capital gains from the 1M CAD I invest. Ive told I should put the money in the Bank stocks (Maple bonds?) because the bank is linked directly to the Canadian economy, and I can expect a safe 0.04 return right now. I’m also looking in to that as well. 

Link to some of the options i've been given

I want to invest it safely so I can have steady return from this million. Need to be low-ish risk, keep it liquid.

CryptoCurrency,Cryptoassets Vs. Economic Macro Trends - The Big Picture,"I wanted to touch on an important topic that often gets overlooked or not discussed in the Cryptoasset space. This discussion has to do with global macroeconomic trends and how Cryptoassets fit into the larger overall picture. If you aim to be a disciplined and successful value investor, you have to take global macro trends into account as they absolutely play a vital role in the Crypto markets.

Critical Issues - Since the last market downturn, the divide bt/wn US household wealth versus GDP has grown significantly. Almost all asset classes - stocks, bonds, property, crypto - have benefitted from an extremely loose monetary policy (including SEVEN YEARS of zero percent interest rates in the US and negative interest rates abroad) over the past number of years. Low-interest rates mean increasing asset values and distortion is introduced into the markets. In these times, asset valuations become detached from their true intrinsic value as investors continue to allocate money into riskier assets in order to increase return and yields. As interest rates are now on the rise and inflation has returned as a concern, asset prices are vulnerable to a correction. 

Margin/Credit Debt - Margin &amp; Credit debt reached a record high level in January 2018. Leverage leads to increases in volatility. The magnification that leverage brings can cause extreme market swings when things begin to unwind. 

Volatility - Last year, the S&amp;P 500 moved 2% or more in a day zero times. There have been six 2% plus moves in the first quarter of 2018. High valuations and high leverage across the board have introduced volatility back into markets in 2018. 

Global Trends - Worldwide government stimulus plans, increasing debt levels, excessive spending and monetary policies, growing support of protectionist measures (aka opposition to free trade agreements) should be cause for concern for any investor. Japan has exploded gov. debt and market manipulation while their economy has stagnant income and slow GDP growth. China has increased debt levels and a surge in speculative investments. Europe has an overburdened social welfare state and few countries have mass amounts of debt. The US major issue is its underfunded public and private pension fund obligations. 

The key takeaway is that it is important to be mindful of global macroeconomic trends as any number of discussed issues could lead to major market disruptions. Make sure you have a financial strategy to protect yourself and loved ones. It is important to only invest what you can afford to lose and do not bring on any debt obligations that could put you in a difficult position if (and when) economic conditions change. The key to value investing is Capital Preservation. Develop a strategy that allows you to be in a position to be offensive when market distortion is low and asset valuations are more in line with their true intrinsic value - and hopefully a whole lot cheaper!",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Inherited 900k - how much do I put down for a 700k house?,"I'm 25, married, living in Orange County, CA. Currently my wife and I earn a combined $130k a year. Credit score in the 800s. I received an inheritance of about 900k.

How much should I put down for a house? I've heard 20%, 25%, and 40% all get you better interest rates. However, I don't see interest rates dealing with 25% and 40% down. Is a 15 year mortgage better than a 30 year mortgage?

I did some quick math using numbers that I pulled off Google: Assuming my investments return 7% a year, and I put 20% down, it looks like that around year 27 the total amount that I will have in investments after a 15 year loan will surpass the amount that I have in investments after a 30 year loan, not to mention I pay about 250k less in interest total.

personalfinance,How to escape from home?,"Hey everyone,

I'm a 20 y.o. college student. I commute from home by bus, since I don't have a car. I live at home with my parents. I have an on\-campus job that lets me work 20 hours per week, and I've been working there for 5 months \(it's a work\-at\-home type of job, I just clock in and clock out from my laptop while I do research\). I haven't saved any money, since I didn't think I'd need all that money until this moment. 

Because of difficulties within the family, I'm looking to move out ASAP. Thing is, I'm not sure how to do it. I've always been fed and clothed by my parents. My parents pay for everything, including my college, food, living expenses, etc.  Also, I don't know how to sustain myself– I have 2 more years of college to go, and the school I go to is fairly expensive for in\-state tuition \(I'm also looking at grad school when I finish undergrad\). Then there would be living expenses \(rent, food, clothing, utilities, maybe a car, etc\). If I move out now \(well, in a little bit, assuming that I save some money over the summer and into the semester\), I'd have to support myself with a job while keeping up 18 credit hours in school starting next semester, which seems like quite a workload. I don't know if there're enough hours in the week to pull it off.

Given that my parents pay for everything I have right now, including my tuition, it'd seem sensible to stay at home and not have to support myself. Thing is, the situation at home is turning grim \(and has been for the last few months\), and I think I'd be better off on my own, whatever amount of stress it'll bring.

Is it worth it to try saving up and moving out, and, if so, how can I start?

Thank you.",finance

I know Virginia is a right to work state so they can basically do whatever they want.

personalfinance,Contribute to 401(k) or pay down student debt?,"Before anyone says anything i have looked through the flowchart on how to handle my finances but i would like some more personal input from you all. 

OK so I think I need some guidance about how to move forward financially. I just recently started a new job and will be eligible to start putting money into my 401\(k\) in July, however, I am unsure as to whether I should focus on maximizing my 401\(k\) contributions or pay off my remaining debt. 

A little background of where my head space is it. I just turned 30 and have spent most of that time financially stupid. About a year ago I was way under water on an auto loan \(8 years at 4.5&amp;#37; APR and probably financed 4K over the value of the truck\), had about 10k in credit card debt \(at 15&amp;#37; APR\), and about 30k in student loans with interest rates as high as 6.5&amp;#37;. It’s been a long year and some stuff happened out of my control, but I finally paid off the credit card debt and got out from under the auto loan. I drive a Subaru now instead of an oversized truck. 

With my lessons learned I feel way more financial stable both in my new job but mainly just in my own ability to self\-regulate my budget. So now back to my current situation, my current debt is as follows:

· Student Loans – 25K, APRs range from 4 – 6.5&amp;#37; with probably 80&amp;#37; of the loans over 6&amp;#37;, approx. 5 years remaining.

· Auto loan – 19k at 1.9&amp;#37; APR with 4 years remaining. 

Going into my new job I have about 115K sitting my in 401\(k\) from my previous employer, I still haven’t figured out if I’m going to roll this into my new employer’s 401\(k\) or keep it where it’s at. Some information about my new position:

· Salary based at 80K before taxes

· Company 401\(k\) match is lacking, they will match between 15&amp;#37; \- 50&amp;#37; of what I put in, but they do not have a percentage limit and do not decide how much to put in until the end of the year. They’re an ESOP but that’s a whole different can of worms. 

· Company will put 2K/year into an HSA which I will be opening in July. 

Currently I have about 2k in savings, I have been putting everything I had toward getting rid of that high interest credit card debt. My current plan is to continue putting 20&amp;#37; of my paycheck and everything else not allocated to expenses at the end of the month towards my rainy day fund, with a target amount of 3 months income. Once that it done, however, I don’t know what to do. 

Do I focus on maxing out my 401\(k\) or do I pay off my student loans? I know that you can assume 7&amp;#37; long term returns on investments but since most of my loans are fairly close to that is it worth it to even put money in the market instead of paying down my debt. Also I feel as though my employer match is somewhat lacking, the way I interpret it, I don’t really get the full benefit of their match unless I can put in the full $18500/year. 

So anyway what are your thoughts?",finance
personalfinance,How much is a 401(k) worth in salary?,"I work at a small startup that doesn't have a 401(k) program yet, and I recently asked my boss if he could set one up. He looked into it and decided that it doesn't make sense for the company to do that yet, but he also said that he'd give me a raise for whatever a 401(k) would be worth to me per year.

He left the task of figuring out what that number should be up to me. I did some back of the envelope calculations and came up with a number (or rather a range, depending on interest rates, retirement age, etc. -- not going to list that range here to avoid influencing anyone), but I'd really appreciate a sanity check.

A few details:

* Assume no match, but an otherwise respectable 401(k) with decent investment options
* I can afford to max out a 401(k) and probably would if I had one
* The last $18,500 of my income falls entirely in the 24% federal income bracket and a 9.3% state (CA) income bracket
* I'm currently 26
* Let's use 67 as a retirement age
* I'm already maxing out a roth IRA, and still would be with a 401(k)
* Assume that without a 401(k), I'll take the 18,500 (whatever is left of it after taxes) and invest it in a taxable account

So to rephrase the question, if you were in my shoes, how much of a salary bump would it take for you to forgo a 401(k)?

Really interested to see what you come up with. I appreciate any help.

My plans are to open another account at my bank to manage payments with, since my habit of putting money aside in savings and pulling it out on payments kinda sucks and I want better organization. I can get a checking+savings linked so I won't have a maintenance fee. 

I want to throw some monthly payments that I need to make (Adobe CC, Spotify, etc.) on a credit card, maybe buy a couple things for the cash back, then pay the card off in full every month. I might finance something later, but I don't really know--probably not. Really, I just want to help build my credit on stuff I'm buying anyway.

I've looked at:

* DiscoverIt Student Card

* Chase Freedom

* Chase Freedom Unlimited

However, I really don't know what to do here. What card would be best for me? Should I wait for my next credit report to get a new card?

personalfinance,Advice on debt,"I recently moved to another country with my wife.

I have what I consider a good salary, it was tough at first \(to the point where we couldn't save money\) since we had to buy a lot of stuff \(like furniture, clothes, our dog expenses, etc.\) and pay our previous debts from before we moved since we had no savings at all.

Now we are in a better situation, even though I'm the only one working \(for now\) we have enough money to start saving. So here comes the problem:

It was a really really hard thing to be able to move, back in our country, even working a lot we had no money, always on negative \(credit card bills to pay and such\). Prior to our moving I started working remotely for a company abroad and made a lot of money, with that money we were able to move and pay some of our debts.

But I fucked up, in my previous country I had to declare my salary to the government on a monthly basis and pay the taxes right afterwards, which I didn't. So now I have an amount of taxes \+ interest rate that equals to approx. a month of my current salary.

Since I'm not in my home country, I'm afraid of not saving more money \(because I'm: afraid of losing my job, afraid of an unexpected problem or expense or any unpredictable event that'll put us back on debt again\) and it's been a long time we don't spend money on us \(me and my wife\), like buying proper clothes, traveling, and buying random/entertainment related stuff.

I have the option to split the taxes in a certain amount of payments, and I can't possibly pay everything at once.

I already was awarded some sleepless night thinking about it, but I still don't know what to do. I know that it's a matter of financial planning, but we both are very anxious people, so it's being really hard to come up with a solution. My intention here is to get constructive feedback and helpful tips so we can get out of this nasty situation.

TLDR: Came from a nasty financial situation to the point where we can save money but still have a \~1 month of salary \(gross\) in debt left. My salary is to support two people \(me and my wife\) and we pay rent, no savings. What do we do?

FYI: throwaway account.",finance

personalfinance,Boosting my credit at 26,"Hey everyone! So, I, like a lot of people don't know what they're doing when it comes to getting a great credit score. So I need help. 

Up until I was 23, I did not have a credit score. No history. It was not 0, it was non existent. But I finally had to upgrade to a newer vehicle as my 88 Cadillac finally became more expensive than necessary. I got a 2009 Pontiac G6 with 35k miles for about $12k @5.99%. I took what I could get. 

Now, my credit is hovering right at the 660 to 680 mark. I am planning on upgrading my car again this year so my brother can buy my G6 and start his driving career. So, how do I get my credit score up so I can get as low of an interest rate as possible? I'm assuming credit cards but I'm afraid of just getting one since I don't know what to look for. What is the best plan of attack and how should I use the card should I get one? 

Also, monthly payments are about $230 right now but I've been paying $500 for the last few months to try and get it paid off early. Is this smart or is there aore efficient way to go about paying off a car?",finance

business,BitCoin ONE Will Be Huge,"How will cryptocurrency help you?
This is in regards to BitCoin One:

Fraud: Individuals cryptocurrencies are digital and cannot be counterfeited or reversed arbitrarily by the sender, as with credit card charge-backs.

Immediate Settlement:Purchasing real property typically involves some third parties (Lawyers, Notary), delays, and payment of fees. In many ways, the bitcoin/cryptocurrency blockchain is like a “large property rights database,” says Gallippi. Bitcoin contracts can be designed and enforced to eliminate or add third party approvals, reference external facts, or be completed at a future date or time for a fraction of the expense and time required to complete traditional asset transfers.

Lower Fees: There aren’t usually transaction fees for cryptocurrency exchanges because the miners are compensated by the network (Side note: This is the case for now). Even though there’s no bitcoin/cryptocurrency transaction fee, many expect that most users will engage a third-party service, such as Coinbase, creating and maintaining their bitcoin wallets. These services act like Paypal does for cash or credit card users, providing the online exchange system for bitcoin, and as such, they’re likely to charge fees. It’s interesting to note that Paypal does not accept or transfer bitcoins.

Identity Theft: When you give your credit card to a merchant, you give him or her access to your full credit line, even if the transaction is for a small amount. Credit cards operate on a “pull” basis, where the store initiates the payment and pulls the designated amount from your account. Cryptocurrency uses a “push” mechanism that allows the cryptocurrency holder to send exactly what he or she wants to the merchant or recipient with no further information.

Access to Everyone: There are approximately 2.2 billion individuals with access to the Internet or mobile phones who don’t currently have access to traditional exchange, these people are primed for the Cryptocurrency market. Kenya’s M-PESA system, a mobile phone-based money transfer, and microfinancing service recently announced a bitcoin device, with one in three Kenyans now owning a bitcoin wallet. (Let me repeat that again. 1/3)

Decentralization: A global network of computers use blockchain technology to jointly manage the database that records Bitcoin transactions. That is, Bitcoin is managed by its network, and not any one central authority. Decentralization means the network operates on a user-to-user (or peer-to-peer) basis. The forms of mass collaboration this makes possible are just beginning to be investigated.

Recognition at universal level: Since cryptocurrency is not bound by the exchange rates, interest rates, transactions charges or other charges of any country; therefore it can be used at an international level without experiencing any problems. This, in turn, saves lots of time as well as money on the part of any business which is otherwise spent in transferring money from one country to the other. Cryptocurrency operates at the universal level and hence makes transactions quite easy.

There is no other electronic cash system in which your account isn’t owned by someone else.

Take PayPal, for example: if the company decides for some reason that your account has been misused, it has the power to freeze all of the assets held in the account, without consulting you.

It is then up to you to jump through whatever hoops are necessary to get it cleared, so that you can access your funds. With cryptocurrency, you own the private key and the corresponding public key that makes up your cryptocurrency address. No one can take that away from you (unless you lose it yourself, or host it with a web-based wallet service that loses it for you).

Overall, cryptocurrencies have a long way to go before they can replace credit cards and traditional currencies as a tool for global commerce.

Fact is, many people are still unaware of cryptocurrency aka Digital Currency. People need to be educated about it to be able to apply it to their lives. Businesses need to start accepting it They need to make it easier to sign up and get started.

The future appeal of cryptocurrencies lies in allowing you ultimate control over your money, with fast secure global transactions, and lower transaction fees when compared to all existing currencies.

When used properly and fully understood it would be the initiator of many emerging systems that will fundamentally change our global economic system.",finance

personalfinance,Did I Get Owned?,"Hi,

First post here. I’m wanting to know if I didn’t get a good deal on my auto loan. I make $80,000 with a credit score of 710. Last year I bought a new 2017 Wrangler for 34,000 financed at 3.99% over 7 years. I have no kids, not married, and low debt. I didn’t want to buy a used car that may break down on me, and I liked the resale value of a Wrangler if something happens and I need to sell it. I know it wasn’t the absolute best decision ever, but I just wanted to know if I should look into refinancing. I at first thought 3.99% was a good rate but now am wondering otherwise. I don’t struggle to make my payments at all and have a decent score so now think I should’ve had a much lower interest rate. Should I refinance? 

Edit: not sure why I’m being downvoted for asking a question",finance
personalfinance,18 y/o needing help w independence,"hi! so, I’m an freshly graduated high school senior (going to SVSU in the fall!) and I am completely lost. I’m 18, I live in Michigan (Genesee county), I drive a 2010 Aveo, and I have a job at meijer that I’m starting in one to two weeks for $11.50 an hour (part time, so between 12-24 hours a week). I have already gotten in close contact with a townhouse corp for $595 a month, and I’ll be splitting the rent with a roommate. 

I’m planning on trying to convince my roommate to split grocery bills with me, with a heavy focus on buying bulk from either GFS or dollar stores nearby.

but! I need recommendations!

1. I currently bank with Chase bank. They’re giving me a bank account without a minimum balance (because I’m a student), but I would really like to change to a credit union. Nearby me I have: Elga and Dort Federal, but I’m willing to go to an online bank or someplace further away. Is it a good idea to transfer? do other places offer student accounts?

2. so I don’t know how much my car insurance is (my mom has always paid for it) but I believe they’re still charging me as “high risk” for being a minor - but I’ve been 18 for 5 months. I’m looking for the minimum insurance for the cheapest amount available. what places are best for a poor college kid?

3. I am planning on outright buying a phone with my graduation money (a Samsung Galaxy A3), and am looking into changing carriers. I would want unlimited data (because I won’t have consistent internet access, but need internet to communicate w family and friends via FB Messenger) but I don’t need unlimited texts/calls; I hardly text nor call anyone. Are there any reliable, yet cheap, service plans?

tldr; 1. what are good credit unions w/o a minimum balance? 2. what’s the cheapest car insurance out there? 3. what company offers unlimited data for cheap, that I can bring my own prebought phone?

personalfinance,Merchant Dispute,"Well, this is a first for me... And I am not sure what to do.

I purchased some doll/baby stuff for my girlfriend. She makes these things and sells them. It is her hobby... In February I was charged $899.00 for an item we didn't purchase. She bought similar items from Facebook groups, Ebay, and random... whatever places. God knows really. I caught this charge a few weeks later when I was doing my taxes. I attempted to contact the website but they have no phone number. Only an email. I cannot get a response and have tried since February. When typing the website in, it shows a scam. https://siliconebabysale.com/ and currently it looks down. Haha... it was up just the other day though.

Anyway, I disputed the charge with my bank - Banterra Bank. And they gave my money back temporarily. That temporary part, or provisional credit, made me very uneasy about the situation. I transferred all my savings to my other main bank and pulled my $4,000 out of checking. I was also disturbed that maybe the account was hacked.

Yesterday they contacted me again and reversed the provisional credit. My account went negative 899.00 as I withdrew every single penny from it. They state that visa got a receipt from the merchant and an IP address. They can not give me a phone number, address, or a tracking number (proof of delivery) because they don't have any of those. But because Visa ruled in favor of the merchant they have to go with it.

Basically I was scammed and they gave some bogus receipt but no actually physical proof. Banterra said my only other option was to contact the place again. A place I haven't made successful contact with in 3 months and now has closed shop up. Is it really that easy for scammers to win? I also called them a few weeks back and asked if I should get a lawyer or call the police. They said no because at this point they were the victims and not me. When I talked to them yesterday they told me to call the police or seek legal help. The manager was worthless and extremely rude. She essentially blamed me for this.

A lawyer isn't really worth $900 unless somehow their fees could be paid from a lawsuit. What are my options? 

I absolutely refuse to pay this bill. I understand they will sell it to debt collection, mark me on their ChexSystems for 5 years, and harass me for payment.

I have the ability to pay this bill. It isn't about the money (fortunately I make decent enough salary). But I 100% absolutely refuse to pay the bill and fully expect the consequences of $900 bill turning into $2000 and then smash hit on my credit with endless phone calls. Still I will never pay it unless they garnish my salary.

Do I have any other options? I can't seem to actually contact their fraud dept. They just send me to a local manager (I am starting to doubt they even have a fraud dept. and just send it to Visa). I don't know what to do...

Am I just scammed and nothing can be done? My credit is 770ish and I expect I will sink into the 600's (my house is paid completely and my car is locked at a %0.34 rate) I have 4 credit cards with good interest rates. One is only 7% I believe from my main bank that I actually keep my money at.

Any advice on how to escalate this for more help? What can I do besides take a hit on my credit?",finance
personalfinance,"Refinancing After Divorce, inrerest rates now higher","I just settled my divorce last week. I got to keep the house and I need to get my ex-husband's name off of the mortgage. I've been told that the only way to do that is to get a completely new loan.

If you had a $400,000 mortgage at 30 years and a interest rate of 3.92 percent, it would cost you $680,000. Then if you got a $400,000 mortgage at 3.92 percent and 15 years it would only cost you $530,000. Also the payment would increase from $1,900 a month to $2,900 a month. I know $3,000 is a decent amount for 15 years, but why even bother with a 30 year mortgage when its obviously a waste. A few more details, currently total assets I have roughly $14,000.

personalfinance,Payoff Low-Interest Intra-Family Loan to significantly Increase Monthly Cash-Flow?,"Hello r/personalfinance redditors! Appreciate any advice &amp; other considerations you have.

**Background:** My SO \(29F\) and I \(29M\) are considering whether to try and tackle our mortgage debt in one year or keep our current financial plan going. 

Right now we have a combined pre\-tax income of about $90k, saved\-up a safety net of $25k, and have a combined $40k in retirement accounts \(401k, 457b, &amp; Roth IRAs\). Our vehicles are reliable, and we don't have any other major expenses upcoming.

Fortunately our only debt is a $58k mortgage balance on our house. Due to some family circumstance we were recently able to do an intra\-family refinance of our house with my mom at extremely favorable terms: $65k loan; 1.98&amp;#37; interest \(Applicable Federal Rate at the time\) amortized over 4\-years; with $1,300/month payments. The monthly payment amounts are higher than they were prior to our refinance, but shortened our term significantly, and is helping us rapidly build equity.

Our question is ***should we try and payoff the low\-interest mortgage in a approximately one year \(as opposed to current schedule of 4\-years\) if it requires us to stop Roth IRA contributions and other savings?*** For us to payoff the mortgage balance in approximately one\-year and 3\-months we'd have to increase our payments to about $4,000/month. I'm really confident that we can meet this monthly debt service amount using by redirecting some income that we currently allocate towards the Roth IRAs and other savings, hustling from the remainder, and even using a reasonable amount from our safety net if need be. Also, note that we both contribute enough to receive full employer match \(5&amp;#37;\), and would continue to do so even if we choose to aggressively payoff our mortgage.

The main benefit I see of paying off this debt would be an instant $1,300 extra monthly cash flow than what we have now. We could easily continue our savings &amp; investment goals at that point, and have a lot more of a buffer to ensure we're able stick with the plan long\-term. Also, we're both debt averse and this would really be a satisfying achievement.

The downside of an aggressive payoff is that it's money that would redirected from long\-term investments, and it doesn't really provide a lot of additional financial security. My mom has verbally committed to helping us in the event something happens and it would be tough to make our existing payment. Paying her off early wouldn't really help us in the event of a major emergency or similar event.

Finally, the last variable in all this is that SO and I are beginning to think about having kids. We would look to have kids in the next year or two, and we both think owning our home free\-and\-clear would be a boon as we learn to incorporate new expenses into our finances. Additionally, the cash flow savings could allow my SO to become a stay\-at\-home parent.

**TL;DR:** Should SO \(29F\) &amp; I \(29M\) aggressively pay\-off $58k, 1.98&amp;#37;, $1,300/month intra\-family loan with mom in one\-year in order to increase our monthly cash\-flow, or continue to payoff over existing 4\-year time\-frame and keep maxing contributions to my SO &amp; my Roth IRAs and making other investment contributions? We have a sufficient emergency fund; no debt besides mortgage; no pending major needs/expenses; Planning to have kids in the next 1\-2 years.",finance
personalfinance,I'm trying to pay down debt and dog needed unexpected surgery...debt goes back up,"Sorry for the long post!

So I have been trying to slowly pay down debt these past couple of months. 
I had racked up about $6,500 in Debt from being stupid, trying to keep up spending with a bf who makes more than me/has less financial burdens, and plane tickets/travel accommodations for a family vacation to Japan (visiting sick grandma/taking bf to see my home country kinda thing). Plus I have about $29,000 in Federal loans (I graduated a year ago and pay about $320 a month)

I was doing ok with paying anywhere from 250 - 600 down every month on the CC debt  and cutting out a lot of the misc fun things I used to do. Mentally I was slowly getting to the point where I felt like I was making some headway. I had cut down on daycare for my dogs, had budgeted a bit better on date money and ""fun"" money (these are still higher than they should be, mainly it's eating out with BF or random ""spontaneous weekends"" where we spend like $70-100 each...really really trying to be better on this one).

My savings are pretty much nothing... I opened a Discover savings last month that deposits 184 a month that I refuse to touch (there's $350 in there now) and I have $550 in another savings account for future moving fees (2 dogs = $$$ when moving apartments). My work provides a 401K but I just became eligible and need to request to be added to it. Seeing the savings go up (even slowly) was giving me a really good feeling.

My puppy needed surgery for a growth plate fracture yesterday that set me back $3,000 and I definitely hadn't budgeted for that. I have now bit the bullet and signed both dogs up for pet insurance for future issues JUST in case (total of $56/ month).

Mentally I feel defeated because of this since even when I was trying to really reduce debt I haven't made REAL headway.

How would you all proceed at this point?  And the trip is nonnegotiable ( Last time I see my grandma most likely and most things have been paid for)

My Budget Looks like this:

Income : ~1840 x2 = 3,680 / month

Mandatory: 
     Rent: 692
     Electric: 79 (I pay 158 and roommate pays me back)
     Internet: 21 ( Total 41, roommate pays me 20)
     Fed Loan: 320
     Car Insurance: 66
     rent Insurance : 21
     CC Minimum payment: 250 ( 107 cc1 + 25cc2 =132 minimum)

- How do you guys recover from a mental set back/ mountain of never ending problems that seem to always cost money?
- Cheap things to do as a couple?
- and how would you budget the debt vs savings? After July I can 100% pay 400-500 for cc debt a month...but it feels like I'm using a tiny shovel to dig myself out of debt rn :( 


——————————————————
**Edit to add **
Ok all - I get my budgeting is shoddy and I need to cut down. And I AM trying. I think more than enough people have told me that very bluntly. I have been trying for 3 months now and thought I was doing better. I will continue to tighten my budget.  
I can and will definitely reduce the date money and find cheaper/free things to do and reduce my “me” money to 40. 
I’ll get rid of bark box BUT 200 is  what I was averaging overall including food (~$60/month), trifexis for 2 dogs for a year (~$400/year), insurance ($56/month), general check up, etc divided by 12. So yes- some months would be cheaper others other more.

I want to reiterate that I’m budget stupid but I’m  learning. 
Since we’ve covered the “OP needs to cut their budget down more” part..can we discuss my other points please? 🙏🏼

personalfinance,"Partner got a kidney stone for the first time, no insurance - bill is confusing and worrying.","Couldn't really explain it well in the title.

Partner and I live with my mom still. I'm unemployed, disabled \(but not disabled enough to get SSI/etc according to Florida standards\- tried, got denied.\) . I take care of the house and take care of my mom, and try to help him with things that get overwhelming and confusing.

He works a tow trucking job and gets salaried pay for $300 a week. He has no insurance, and suddenly wound up with a kidney stone for the first time a couple weeks ago. Terrifying pain, enough that we went to the ER just in case it might've been his appendix. \(If we knew it was just a kidney stone, he'd have just dealt with the pain and take care of it himself..\)After a bunch of pain meds and fluids and a CT scan they sent us home with a few prescriptions saying it was 2 mm stone. It passed on its own 4 days or so later, but the bill just arrived today.

I actually don't understand a few things about it, but we also don't know how to get it reduced a lot more. His last tax return was $1k and it was taken for an old school loan he hasn't paid off. \(Long story there \- credit is already bad because of it\).

For us two who are not used to ""adulting"" and have never had to deal with this before, how do we do it? We were JUST starting to pull our lives together a tiny bit, and were about to start looking for a car that's not a beat up run down $400 craigslist car that needs thousands in repairs. Now we've got this to figure out..

So, questions:1\) What does the MAJOR difference in price on this first bill mean? [https://i.imgur.com/0LKJcO7.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/0LKJcO7.jpg)One person told me it meant ""pay in cash"" difference \- if we paid in cash, we'd have to pay the 2.7k. Otherwise we'd have to pay the 12k. That doesnt look right from the bill itself.

1a\) did the hospital knock off $9k when we told them we had no insurance? \(multiple times we told them\).Second bill: [https://i.imgur.com/AAODwwl.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/AAODwwl.jpg) What one is that from and why did we get a second bill? That's another thing I don't understand.

2\) How do we get it lowered \- specifically? Instructions, guides, anything.

The specific hospital is Florida Hospital Fish Memorial. I tried to look on the website and it was utterly useless, as I expected it to be. I heard something about Florida having a ""Charity department"" for hospital bills  \- does anyone know anything about that?

We only have maybe $1k in savings, and that was supposed to go towards a car and other things.  At 300 a week he'd only make about 15k a year. Add car insurance, ""rent"" \(electricity \+ internet bill\) and food...and we barely make ends meet during the month. We're broke, but not fully poor.

\-\- A very confused and anxious person who really doesnt understand any of this.

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-EDIT:

Thanks  everyone else for the helpful comments, I've taken the time to try and  do a little more research into ""charitable programs"" for the Hospital  and i MIGHT have found something.

[https://webcdn.ahss.org/internet/policy/fh/en/FAD\_fhfm\_fh\-en.pdf](https://webcdn.ahss.org/internet/policy/fh/en/FAD_fhfm_fh-en.pdf)  I found this on the website, which seems to be something we can look  into. Based on the information in the PDF... \(and he clarified how much  he makes per check \- $450 before taxes, about $380 afterwards\)...

""  If your annual income is equal to or less than 200&amp;#37; of the current  Federal Poverty Guidelines you will not have to pay your bill""

Poverty guidelines: [https://webcdn.ahss.org/internet/calculation/AGB\_Calculation\_Letter.pdf](https://webcdn.ahss.org/internet/calculation/AGB_Calculation_Letter.pdf)

He  technically counts as a household of 1, because we're neither blood  related, he's not adopted into our family, and we aren't married. 200&amp;#37;  of the Poverty guidelines is about $24k \- so neither before or after  taxes does he go above the guidelines.

Below  the application states this as an asterisk: "" When calculating the  number of people in the household, only the following people are  counted: 1\) Blood relatives living in the home, 2\) Relatives by marriage  living in the home, and 3\) Relatives by legal adoption living in the  home. ""

so...all of this confusing mess,  but there seems to be a possibility that it can get reduced or waived  entirely. It's SO confusing still, but I think we're getting somewhere. I  just needed some of the advice you guys have given and it's very  helpful, so thank you all. I'm trying to sort it out, and we might make a  trip over to the hospital itself to get information about it in person.

He  is not covered by medicaid, or anything else. We're going to try and  look into the ""Blue card"" 'insurance' that our county has for low income  people. It's what I have from my mom's help and it's at least  \*something\* despite being a major headache to get and keep.

---edit 2:
I only asked for help in navigating the annoying situation of a medical bill , not judgment on anything else. Thank you to those who replied and truly helped. 
I'm done here as it seems not everyone follows the rules of the board and want to jump on me instead.  Hopefully what I found will work out for us and this  all be behind.",finance

personalfinance,28 y/o just looking for advice on where to start,"Hi guys, 

&amp;nbsp;

I’ll try to be really brief and give enough history. 

&amp;nbsp;

Credit/Charge Card Debts: $1100 + $2200 + $6900  + $600 = $10,800 Total

Student Loans: $3000 + $1600 + $1800 + $4800 + $3400  =  $14,600 Total 

Federal Taxes: ~$3000 Total 

Total Debt: ~$30,000

&amp;nbsp;

Income: $~46k/yr

Take home pay monthly: ~$2800

Savings balance: $2000

&amp;nbsp;

Expenses: ~$1600 monthly for just the essentials/bills. 

&amp;nbsp;

I’m trying to figure out what my best course of action is at this point. Do I focus only on paying off debt? Do I start investing in some sort of fund? Do I just put away an emergency fund first in a good savings account? 

&amp;nbsp;

About me: I’m a single guy, all of my family lives at least 100 miles away, so not something I rely on. I live in Southern California. I work in the accounting dept. for a small manufacturing business (&lt;25 people) that does very well for itself. I was brought on as a temp for about 4 months, then hired on April ’17. I was needing to find a new place to live, which I took as a sign that maybe it was time to move out of state. The CEO offered ~$8k/yr raise if I’d feel that was enough to keep me in CA and be able to afford a new place. I took the offer, found a great place for myself that’s dirt cheap, all utilities included, and 3 miles from work. Besides being so close to home, another great perk is they’ve never denied any time off requested, and overall I’m very comfortable here. It’s probably safe to say I’ll be at this pay for another year or two, seeing as this was an uncommon raise for such a short employment period. 

&amp;nbsp;

I’m a college dropout. I have around ~90 credits to my name, but I went to a liberal arts school on the east coast, so I’ve always had issue getting them to apply correctly here in CA. After some community college, I just kinda stopped taking classed and pursuing it. It bugs me every day though to think that I quit on it, and I’d like to see myself at least finish my bachelors.

&amp;nbsp;

Unrealistic goals by the time I’m 30:

making $60k/yr

debt-free

Have started a retirement fund of some kind

Have an emergency fund

Visit my mom – who lives in France – for at least 2 weeks. 


&amp;nbsp;

Realistically, I know not all, maybe even none, of these things are viable. But I’d like to at least get an idea of where I ought to be heading and what my best course of action might be for the foreseeable future.

Yeah... if I want to be making more in a year and half’s time is going to mean probably finishing my degree and probably switching jobs. There may be the potential to earn more at my current job as I take on more roles, and possibly transition into sales, where I know their top earner is making $100k+/yr. 

Yeah… clearing out that debt is going to take time. But any preference in which order/balances to go after first? All my debt is in collections, and I’m not sure what to do about that. Do I try to appeal to the original debtor and pay them, is that better for my credit? Do I take these settlement amounts I see so often from whatever collection agency the debt is with now?

My work does offer a match program for an IRA – any further details I’m not 100% sure on. I can’t open an account yet because I have to be hired on here for 2 years. In the meantime, is it worthwhile investing into anything else? 

I’ve been saving just since the start of the year. I’ve put $2k into just my Chase Savings because I don’t know any better on what to do with it. I’ve read numerous times about Ally savings, but I’m ignorant in all matters here, so I’m not sure where to start. 

Yeah…visiting France really ought to not be a priority, but my mom raised me as a single mother, finally found someone she could love again, and they moved to France 8 years ago and I haven’t seen them since. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'd really appreciate any advice anyone might like to offer. Thanks in advance!",finance
personalfinance,Final Student Loan Payments Question with regards to Credit Score,"My wife and I have taken a fairly aggressive approach to paying off 35k in student loan debt over the past two years. The interest rate was between 6-7%, so we elected to pay this off before moving onto paying towards retirement or saving towards our first home. 

We're approaching the final payments of our student loans ($1k a piece) and realized that it may not be in our best interest to pay off the debt completely, and instead make minimum payments ($50 each). If we pay them off completely, we remove an account from our credit history by paying it off. If we elect to pay it off completely, we could save $200 in interest payments over two years, but that seems like a nominal amount at this point.

Is it worth waiting to pay off the debt to keep constant student loan payments on our credit history?",finance
personalfinance,[NL] Investment options/advice for unused savings,"Throwaway because friends / family know reddit username.


A few days ago I was reviewing the annual report of my bank account and I saw that my combined savings were over 14k EUR. 4.5k is on my debit account which consists of my paycheck from supermarket work and and other (smaller) incomes. The rest comes from my savings account which I built over the years by transferring from my debit card and some from family.


I make around €450 a month working in a supermarket at approximately 18 hours a week. About 300 euros of the 450 is saved since my monthly expenses are only my phone subscription and insurance (30), the remaining 120 is used for concerts / weekends. 


I don't have any large expenses planned soon other than a  guitar so I don't see myself using this money soon. Only after I graduate next year and I will go to uni am I going to need it. This means I have a window of about 1.5 years that this money will be unused at an interest rate of 0.025% (on the savings account). 


I was wondering what would be the best way to invest or manage this money properly. I have thought about starting my own small business since I can put about 18 hours a week into it if I quit my current job, of which I am getting rather tired. I don't however have an idea for a small business so this plan is currently of the table.


A few months ago I dabbled in crypto and put around 500 euros in Bitcoin and other altcoins. This is money I consider lost and is kind of for fun. I realize this is not a responsible option to invest larger amounts into.


Stocks are an obvious choice and I do plan to put some undecided amount into it. I do want to consider all of my alternatives first, and I am not yet aware what all those are. Working on a business idea currently appeals the most to me currently, since this has the most potential.


I am 17 years old, I realize this might limit my options. I could arrange things via my father however. I am also Dutch.  I am fairly knowledgeable and interested in chemistry and electronics and currently teaching myself basic progamming. This is what would be ideal to work with/on if I start something on my own. 


So /r/Personalfinance, I was hoping I could borrow some of your knowledge and put me on the right track. Either telling me to keep going the way I'm going right now of put me on a way different track.

personalfinance,5k to use: Pay off credit card (zero interest with plans to roll to new card) or pay down car (6.25%)?,"My husband and I are closing on the sale of our condo in a week and downsizing to really attack our debts and increase our savings. We plan to put most of the proceeds (estimated 25k after we pay off the mortgage and all fees) into savings. We already have a large savings, we are saving towards a future purchase and long distance move: we will be living in a downgraded sense for the next few years to quickly eliminate our debt and amass at least 100k cash before we take the plunge and do the big move.

We want to throw 5k of what we are getting towards a debt right off the bat. We could use it to fully pay off a credit card (medical expenses, with zero interest, and plans to roll it over to a different zero interest card for a $200 fee in November if we don't pay it off by then)

Or, apply it towards one of our vehicles, the one with the higher interest rate (6.25%, 9k balance left.) 

If it helps the decision, our total debts are this credit card balance of around 5k, this car at 9k and another car with a similar balance but lower interest rate. Either way we do this, we estimate with our new much more affordable living arrangement that our debts will be fully cleared within a year or less, and to reach our 100k savings goal by 2.5 years or less.",finance

personalfinance,Looking at Dental School Loans of ~$450k and I am already loosing sleep,"Hello r/personalfinance,

I apologize for the wall of text, but I am reaching for any amount of advice that I can get. I am 24 years old and graduated from undergrad last year debt free, have a paid off car, and about $5000 to my name right now.  Normally I would feel ahead of the curve given my circumstances, but the profession I have fallen in love with may be the death of me.

Over the past year I went through the application cycle to start dental school and graduate at 2022. I graduated from a state school with a BS degree in health science and a 3.6GPA and my Dental Acceptance Test (standardized entrance exam) was similarly good. I applied to fourteen schools and wound up receiving five interviews, with one acceptance letter, three rejections and one school has me wait listing as an alternate. I do not expect to hear back from that final school but it is still possible I suppose, if I were to attend there they would give me instate prices after one year, making it vastly cheaper.

The school I am planing on attending is, as I said, out of state and I would never switch over to instate tuition. That would bring the educational expenses and instruments to around $80k annually, or around $320k over all. The other issue is cost of living in a medium expensive city, where depending on my living situation that I still haven't figured out yet will be between $18-24k a year. I am shooting for exiting dental school after four years with $400k debt in principle and somewhere around $40-55k in accrued interest.

The program is far too intense to have a job during school, and there is not enough time to work between semesters due to the short breaks. My family in no way could afford to cover the cost of me attending and because I don't know anyone in the city, I can't find a way to live with friends or family cheaply or free. 

Originally I applied for the Health Professions Scholarship Program with two branches of the US Military, but sadly due to an issue with my medical history I was deemed unfit for service. As a plan B I had applied to my state's Western Interstate Comission of Higher Education student exchange program, where my home state would pick up the difference on instate vs out of state tuition, but this week found out that I will not be funded. This leaves me with no Plan A or Plan B. Finally I am looking into applying for the Health Service Corps which has a public health program similar to the military, but is ridiculously competitive.  

I already contacted my bank and asked what kind of deal they could give me for professional school loans and I could get up to $300k with a variable interest capped at a max of 8.5% and currently offered at 5.5%. This is due to my good credit score, which is about 825 on the FICO scoring system. I am going to look around for several other offers before choosing something, but the federal loans have abysmal interest rates and I would hate to choose those.

Right now my only plan is to move to a state with little to no income tax when I graduate and practice in a rural area for several years. I looked online and found several job positions being advertised for fresh out of school dentists in those types of areas offering up to and sometimes a little over $200k as an annual salary where it would cost next to nothing to live there. Those kinds of jobs would be about my only way of staving off of financial suicide.  

I am really at a loss on what to do. My state doesn't have an instate school to begin with, so that is out. Meaning that applying again next year would be incredibly risky and very unlikely to get in anywhere that would give me instate tuition past the first year. I have come too far to give up now, but just am looking for some advice on what to do when I get there.",finance

1991 \- 1995: 4.0&amp;#37;1996 \- 1997: 1.56&amp;#37;1998 \- 2005: 1.66&amp;#37;2006: 3.20&amp;#37;

1\) What determines the varying interest rates here? I found it weird that the interest rates fell by well over 50&amp;#37; and then arbitrarily doubled in 2006.

Even weirder, a bond issued in 2001 with 1.66&amp;#37; interest has accrued $25.20 interest. Meanwhile, a bond issued in 2002, 1 year later and the same 1.66&amp;#37; interest rate has only accrued $11.48. What gives?

2\) Is it possible to calculate how much the bonds will all eventually be when they reach full maturity? The calculator I found only shows me how much they're worth today.

I don't know if the interest rate on these will continue to remain the same over time, or if they continually change.

3\) Why is the denomination considered $50 when the actual value once the bond reaches maturity \(30 years\) can be more than $50? Is $50 just a projection, or is there some other reasoning behind this?

I've taken some basic accounting courses, but they always depicted bonds as pretty straightforward: Here's what you pay me, this is the fixed interest rate that you'll get, it compounds precisely twice a year until maturity date. The end. I feel like this is far more convoluted.

Thanks for your assistance!",finance
stocks,Bright Horizons Family Solutions (BFAM),"Happy Friday my friends! Today I was hoping to share with you all a company I recently purchased some shares of. I’d love to hear your thoughts and if you think I made a decent choice here. The company is none other than Brighter Horizons Family Solutions (BFAM) and specializes mainly in child care and daycare centers.


Some quick facts right off the bat. The company has a PE of just under 40 and pays no dividend. It has a roughly 5.75 billion dollar market cap and its listed stock price has increased roughly 30% in the past year. It experienced a 10% Growth in revenue from Q1 of the previous year while having exceeded earnings estimates several quarters in a row.


Net Income, however, decreased 9% from the Q1 of the previous year. The changes in tax law were actually a main cause behind this as despite the decrease in federal taxes paid, the company’s tax benefits weren’t as significant. The tax law changes have kind of threw off a lot of company’s financial figures so it’s tough to say just how much of an impact the new changes will ultimately have and how companies will adjust (for better or worse).


Now, why does this company draw my attention? The first is that it offers a unique sense of diversification similar to how REITs can. Childcare and daycare is unique in that for many it’s a necessity in today’s world. With baby boomers working and retiring later than their parents had, it makes it harder for younger adults to have their parents babysit their children. This leads to the question of paying for daycare or having one spouse stay at home. For many careers, taking time off can be a killer and major delay in career advancement. To add to the debate, many companies do not offer paid time or things like maternity leave making the decision even more difficult. During mighty bull market or brutal bear markets, parents need someone to look after their kids while they work.


While the almost unavoidable problem of child daycare and the growing cost of it, a company like this should benefit from raising costs in the sector. Whether parents pay directly or companies pay, the business should profit. Right now in the US, we really don’t have an answer for daycare and this isn’t a problem that is likely to go away anytime soon as it hasn’t received too much floor time on tv or political debates despite how ridiculously expensive daycare can be. I can’t really see any new law being implemented anytime soon that could change things and negatively impact a company like this.


The growing debate of importance of early education and parents willing to pay to top dollar for daycare centers offering unique and trustworthy care. This company certainly caters to upper middle class and high income parents hoping to find the best care possible for their kids. Simply put, it parents have the money they aren’t shy paying top dollar for their child’s education and care. This company tries to sell itself as offering tremendous early childhood education and social interaction.


The company has over 1,000 centers in several countries around the world. They specialize mainly in child daycare but also offer support and services in things like college coaching, workforce training/consulting, elderly care, and special needs care. I think daycare can be a big money maker but I’m curious to see how their elderly care sector will work out as it has massive potential if done correctly (which has proven difficult for many in the sector). The diversity in not only sectors but countries should prove beneficial.


The company has solid reviews from both a client and employee perspective. They were listed by Fortune magazine as a top 100 company to work for and as one of Colorado’s top workplaces to work for going into 2018 by the Denver Post. Most reviews online of the company are positive and there are no bad stories or articles when you google their name. While reviews should often taken with a gain of salt and looked at carefully, I think they still play an important part. This company doesn’t have any nightmare stories or major issues that can often plague companies involved in things like childcare or nursing homes for example.


I don’t think this company is a stock one would hold looking for a quick and easy gain. Instead it reminds me a little of a company like Visa in that it’s one of those companies that doesn’t have huge swings day to day or week to week but that you look say one year later and realize how well it’s performed. Obviously the two are totally different companies and on different scales but hopefully my comparison makes sense.


Normally I’d say wait until a dip to buy unless you absolutely love a company and have major hopes but if you look at this stock’s history there really hasn’t been too many major dips and buying opportunities. I do feel it is priced fairly reasonable in this current market environment so wouldn’t argue against buying in now. Of course past performance doesn’t equal future performance but if you’re looking for a company with pretty consistent performance this isn’t a bad pick in my view.


After looking at what both analysts and the company itself have stated, the view is that revenue should continue growing around 8-10% per year but the rate of growth should remain relatively consistent, possibly slightly lessening. For a small-mid cap company this isn’t ideal but for the type of sector this company is involved in I’d also argue its both realistic and feasible.


So what do you guys think? Right move here that just require some patience or did I miss the boat here and am perhaps missing something? Somewhere in between?


Would also like to state for what it’s worth, I do own shares of this company and have a positive long term outlook for them.

He cannot speak very well right now given his condition and my aunt is not a native English speaker. I've been asked to help with getting their affairs in order and have been granted power of attorney.

I've already started setting up their bills for auto-pay so my aunt wouldn't have to worry about that. The challenging part is figuring out his retirement options. He's twice retired, once from the military and the other from the federal government. He's currently working for the state and is not drawing social security. He was in the process of applying for disability (unsure through who) but apparently HR said it may be best for him to just retire. Can he draw social security given his military retirement? Can my aunt draw social security as well even though she's never held a legit job? They're both over the age of 65.

What can I do to ensure my aunt does not end up in a financially burdensome situation if my uncle were to pass?",finance

BlockChain,Blockchain for better US voting - need help,"Millennials in the US literally have the numbers to decide who our lawmakers are, and consequently our future policies. At the forefront, at least for me, of this power is the ability to influence modern gun laws. But my vision involves much more than just one policy. It involves an essential framework for the future of voting. 

I'll be the first to admit that we.... need a little bit of a push to get to the polls. And education. But that's alright -- that's how things work this decade. With endless resources (we consistently use social media and the internet to interact with the world, engage with each other, learn, and act), we need to harness the technology of the present to facilitate change for the future. 

""There's an app for that,"" the famous Apple slogan that illustrates the variety of services now technologically available reminds me that with careful but bold effort, one can create something (in this case, a movement) that reaches millions (and, in this case, to affect change.) 

Although I, in full disclosure, am left-leaning, this vision has nothing to do with influencing opinions. It has everything to do with educating and enabling my generation in the voter registration and polling process. Why isn't it easier to know how and when to register? And why can't voting be digital? And secure? And transparent? 

Blockchain brings a unique and needed characteristic to online identity management, and can be harnessed for voting purposes without concern for identity fraud, DDos attacks, or double voting.

To bring all of this to one conclusion: I'd like to build a platform by which anyone can register (with 2 forms of legitimate state/federal ID plus a facebook, email, and face recognition) and be fed important dates, times, and procedures for civic engagement. In a few years time, I'd like this platform to evolve into polling for public opinion, and, finally, a mechanism for casting votes with blockchain immutability and finality. This sounds ridiculous, but to be honest, with self-driving cars and AI-powered drones around the corner, a transparent and trust-worthy manner of digitally casting votes shouldn't be written off. 

The face recognition part will make some people shit their pants. We'd have to ensure anonymity but legitimacy. Sounds impossible, but can be done with todays tech.

personalfinance,Which loan first?,"Hey everyone, this will be a long post but I wanted to include all the details to get opinions for my student loans.

Background: Currently on my sophomore/junior co-op (internship) term at my school and looking to where I should be putting my money towards. I make $1186.04 every two weeks and it seems like by the time I am done working I will have made $14825.50 to put towards loans.

Private Loans:

Sallie Mae: Principal: $40,812 Interest Rate: 10.625% Variable 1-month Libor Index (It hurts) Interest Accrued: $5,028.23

Wells Fargo: Principal: $22,467 Interest Rate: 10.24% Variable Prime Index (yea) Interest Accrued: $1,091.72

Federal Loans:

A: Principal: $5,500 Interest Rate: 3.760% Interest Accrued: $282.60

B: Principal: $6,500 Interest Rate: 4.450% Interest Accrued: $84.14


My Plans:

Option A: Throw all money at Sallie Mae loan and disregard the rest. It's the highest interest so paying this one down before touching anything else and letting the rest capitalize (assuming that I only have enough for this loan and nothing left for the rest). I would make less of a dent on the principal but I think I would save more money since it's like transferring my higher interest loans to a smaller one? (Is this correct thinking?)


Option B: Throw all money at Wells Fargo loan and disregard the rest. This would make a bigger dent in the principal since there is less accrued interest at the moment but I'm not sure if that saves me more over the course of the loans.


Option C: Mix?

Which of these options are the best or is there a different option that is better? I know that short term I think putting it all towards wells fargo would save me more on interest a year but I wasn't sure about the life of the loan if I would save more with option A and the capitalization since I definitely won't be able to pay them back until a few years after graduation.

personalfinance,Has anyone ever taken a counteroffer at their current company and then got let go?,"People always advise ""never take a counteroffer"" and I definitely had that mindset but I've never seen someone take a counteroffer IRL and have it not work out.  I also feel like I see tons of advice on this sub about not taking a counter, but then so many people always provide personal anecdotes of it working out.  I'd like to hear about cases where people were in fact let go and what led to that, if they saw it coming, etc.

I recently got a job offer offering me a promotion making about $13k more than my current salary.  This is actually below market value by a bit for the promotion, but it was work\-from\-home.  You need to have a specific license/certification for the promotion, which I got over a year ago.  My current company has been trying to work with me to promote me, but there weren't really any openings and they didn't really have enough business yet to justify creating a new opening just for me \- we are understaffed admin/secretary\-wise, but really had no need for another non\-admin employee.  Promoting me means hiring someone new to fill my current position, so I honestly do completely understand that it makes 0 sense to pay me more money \(or even the same money\) to mostly twiddle my thumbs until more work comes in, and to additionally hire a new admin and train them, as well.   I actually spoke last week with the partner about a promotion timeline, and she confirmed that it seemed fall or early next year seemed to work best, and she actually wanted to make sure I was still interested in the promotion.  This tips me off that maybe they were about to put steps in place to promote me in the fall, OR it tips me off that they were hoping I'd say ""no I'll just focus on school"" so that they could give me more admin responsibilities.  Either way, I think it's kind of hilarious I ended up with the job offer a few days after this conversation \- I think in their minds, it looks like I was unhappy to hear they couldn't promote me soon, so I went out that day and got a job promoting me.  Really though the offer kind of fell in my lap, and that prior conversation just made it look even sweeter.

When I presented the job offer to the head of the company I work with, she said she understood why I would want to take it, to not feel bad about it, and that she had honestly anticipated that they may not be moving me into the new position fast enough.  But she went to bat for me with the other head of the company, so today they offered me the promotion I wanted and an additional $10k, all starting in July \- making the raise about $23k.  They said they thought work would pick up by then \(but that I'd still be getting paid even if there was no work\), and that they wouldn't be offering me a counter if they didn't want me to stay.  They also said this new salary for me is on the lower end of what they usually pay people in my position, and I know for a fact that's true, so there is some security there in that I know they don't feel like they are overpaying me for the new job.  I have personally seen them let people leave without offering a counter \(one girl had actually gotten a job offer with the sole purpose of trying to bargain, and she was surprised that they told her to take it\), and they usually make one of their other admins fill in the gaps/take on extra work until they can find a permanent solution.  However, we have been super understaffed lately admin\-wise, so it would really suck if I was no longer an admin \- either by leaving or being promoted, so I acknowledge it is certainly possible they are just telling me what I want to hear until they can let me go.  It's a risk, for sure.  I will say the whole discussion today made me feel pretty valued, although it did rub me the wrong way when the head of the company started the conversation off by comparing monetary compensation, benefits, etc. instead of talking about the new role.  I talked to my dad, who said that if I take it, I should demand that the new salary starts immediately \(he says to never accept a counter, but he also said that my situation seemed a bit different than a standard counter\) but I really wanted to make sure they understood that this was not about money, but about my personal growth, so instead I asked for a firm date to put the promotion in place and told them I trust them, despite all of the advice out there on not taking counters.  I also proposed a solution for my replacement as admin that would involve not hiring anyone, but also sent them a resume of a smart recent college grad who they could probably pay less than what I was getting paid in that role, so I'm hoping they see that I'm trying to make sure the business side of things works out. I also feel the firm has invested a bit in me \(as I am technically in training for the new position and have a small caseload already, but it's not a full\-time docket\).

Last year I got a perfect annual review and a raise, so there is a paper trail that I'm a good employee \(and I've also saved all of the letters of recommendation, etc. they've written for me\).  I suppose if they gave me a horrible review this year \(if they even do give me a review\), that would tip me off that they are putting motions in place to let me go.

I know a girl at my current company recently got a raise by presenting another job offer and accepting their counter, and they have not let her go in the last 8 months since getting that \- although, they did pile on more admin responsibilities.  I'm pretty sure her raise was only $5k, based on her drunken ramblings to me, and I was kind of thinking that it's stupid to leave a job for only $5k for the same position, but whatever.  So it's possible they are fine with her counter because it's honestly not that much money.

My bf, who also has had a good experience so far with a recent counter, wanted me to take them up.  He says it would be really messed up for it to not happen.  My immediate boss \(who wasn't part of the discussion today\) also said that they really value me and would want to keep me.  So I feel ok, but I keep psyching myself out.  Worst case I guess is that I move in with my parents and focus on grad school full time, or take out student loans for living costs.  I'm not happy about the bridges being burned for nothing though.

TL;DR: As twisted as this sounds, though, I'd like to hear about the worst case scenarios out there because I think if I can anticipate it, I'd feel a bit better.",finance
personalfinance,Debt vs Retirement savings HELP!,"I just turned 26, and I currently have 11.5k in credit card debt at 0% for the next 15 months.

With rising interest rates im not sure how much longer those offers will be around. I currently make around 55k per year. I am currently contributing 20% before any employer contribution. The reason I am contributing such a high percentage is because I switched jobs 1.5 years ago and I wanted my current take home pay to be the same, so the pay increase I got I essentially am putting in 401k.

financialindependence,"My story. One year update with progress, thoughts, and perspective.","Good morning,

A year ago I posted this:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/6b3gwu/my\_story\_learn\_from\_it\_critique\_it/](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/6b3gwu/my_story_learn_from_it_critique_it/)

The post received a lot of comments and great feedback from this community. Here I am about a year further into my journey with an update. No history this time, more dwelling on the current moment.

Age: 32

Salary: \~100k/yr as mechanical engineer for federal government

Savings \(cash\): 58k

TSP \(401k\): 156k \(\~4&amp;#37; match from job\)

Roth IRA: 67k

Mutual Fund: 8k

Wife's tIRA/Roth: 70k

Wife's Salary: 5k post baby #2

We have a house. Paid 360, put 20&amp;#37; down. Currently owe 270k @3.75&amp;#37; 30 year mortgage.

Total expenses are roughly $4k/month \(incl. mortgage\).

**Personal:**

1. My wife and I had another child so now we have 2.
2. A lot of loss and illness around me \(colleagues with cancer, kids of colleagues with cancer, deaths in the family\). Makes me realize how very short and precious life is. I have really been into spending more time with my young kids and relishing that time with them because it is precious. Being FI helps.

**Home Maintenance:**

1. $6k on getting the house painted
2. $9k on getting a new roof
3. $3k on installing a ductless mini split. \(installed myself and saved \~$1500\).

**Major FI Milestones**:

1. I managed to save \~18k in my TSP and contribute the max \(5500\) to my Roth
2. We were able to keep our savings relatively steady even though we spent around $17k on home maintenance.
3. I recently turned down a job offer for $110k/year to stay with the government atleast until 10 years \(to get the 10 yr pension at 62\) and also if you add up the benefits package and everything I would be taking a pay cut.
4. We were able to deduct almost $20k last year giving us an effective tax rate of around 7&amp;#37;.
5. At one point last year my TSP had made more than I had put in to it. This is mostly attributable to the abnormal increase in the stock market, but I consider it a huge milestone. A few years ago I realized that if I put the max in every year and was assuming \(generously\) a 10&amp;#37; return, in a few years it won’t matter how much I put in, the value will essentially track the market. Having my returns surpass my contributions is kind of where I think to myself “I’m letting my money work for me.” For you folks starting out and wondering why you would dump $18k/yr into your 401k/TSP, this is why.
6. Studied for and passed the P.E. exam. This is part of my long term plan to start my own engineering consulting company after RE.

**Lifestyle inflation:**

1. Started getting a haircut once every 3 weeks \($30\) which I consider worth it. Makes me feel good, look professional, and be taken seriously.
2. Paid for the work on the house. This was less lifestyle inflation and more simple math. There is literally not enough time for me to do everything that needs to get done maintenance wise.
3. Bought a small sailboat and a mountain bike. I want to own a boat before I die and I enjoy mountain biking…
4. Thinking of paying for lawn service so I can spend more time with my kids. Depends on price. May just buy a bigger mower.

We are really in autopilot with the savings now and dialed in on our budget. Managed to save a lot of money on food by going to a low cost grocery store and I have been more strict about eating out for lunch and packing my own lunch.

**My thoughts:**

1. We are really in autopilot with the savings now and dialed in on our budget. Managed to save a lot of money on food by going to a low cost grocery store and I have been more strict about eating out for lunch and packing my own lunch.
2. The house is still an angsty decision for me. Worth it to have a nice place to live, but damn it’s always work! Also, the value of our house is worth about $70k more than we paid for it \(neighbors just sold their house for $430k\). But it doesn’t matter because I plan to live here until I die. At this point even if we moved and bought a similar house the increased prices and increased interest rates would kill our budget too.
3. Our tax situation changed. The new tax bill changes our taxes a bit. We will get the greater standard deduction of $24k but lose out on our local\+real estate\+mortgage interest deduction \+ \~$16k exemptions \(total around $35k but decreasing\) which will now be replaced with $24k deduction \+ \~$4k child tax credit and slightly less marginal rate. We will be about even. The whole tax bill saga reminded me of \(a\) why we plan regardless of tax incentives and \(b\) how little the general public knows about their taxes.
4. I started doing the math and writing a point paper on whether to pay down the mortgage more quickly or not. I compared 15 year mortgages, paying down the mortgage faster, and putting the difference between 15 and 30 year mortgages into investments. Part of it was because I was told by someone at work that I should have gotten a 15 year verse 30 year mortgage. Well, that makes sense if you’re not investing the difference \(in tax deferred accounts\). I am not ready to draw firm conclusions, but from the numbers it looks like \(in my exact situation\) 6&amp;#37; return on investments is the breakeven point for 15 vs 30 year mortgage. As for paying it down early, I prefer to have liquidity and obviously I'm hoping for better than 3.75&amp;#37; returns on my investments.

**Plans:**

1. I plan to put in 15k in my TSP this year and max the Roth.
2. Only major expenditure planned is another ductless mini split.
3. I am meeting with a business lawyer next week to discuss starting my engineering business \(most likely incorporating as an LLC\). I plan to spend the next 1\-2 years building it up and testing out the waters of self\-employment.

**Thoughts:**

My savings and everything are on autopilot pretty much so it is fairly unexciting. However, I am really seeing the benefits of this lifestyle:

Having money allowed us to enter into repairs on our house without stress.

The tax changes won’t break our budget.

I was able to buy something \(the boat\) I always wanted and am looking forward to the experiences I will have on it.

I am about 8 years into my financial journey. From absolute zero in college to the numbers you see today was the product of hundreds of small decisions \(see my post from last year\) but now the discipline is automatic. From reading the Millionaire Nextdoor, to listening to David Ramsey and reading this blog, it all reinforces those decisions. Being financially ok makes life less stressful. I am very lucky to have the salary I have so my journey has been shorter, but for everyone out there, just know that the rewards come sooner than you think. As I see tragedy around me I see that life is amplified by these decisions and they are worth it.",finance

personalfinance,How do I build credit while living overseas with the prospect of moving to the US in 12-18 months?,"Hi guys!

I've been lurking here for a while and thought I'd come to you with my first big financial question of my life.

I'm a US citizen, 22 years old and currently in medical school in Germany. I am planning on doing my residency in the US, so I will be moving back in approx. 12\-18 months. I will realistically begin earning a substantial salary when my practical training is complete and I start my residency in July 2021.

I feel relatively confident about my current financial situation; no student loans \(free education \- thanks Germany!\), and no credit card debt or other debt of any kind. My parents cover my living costs while I'm in school, and I have a decent student job to supplement that support, mainly for ""fun money"" purposes.

My concern right now is this: Although I feel I am financially in a good situation, I am painfully aware of the fact that I will not have any credit whatsoever when I move back. I am worried about getting a car, finding a place that will rent to someone without any credit history. I have some family and a partner who could probably cosign/ vouch for things in a pinch, but I would rather start actively working towards building credit.

I have a credit card through Santander in Germany, which has a high interest rate and small line of credit \(standard for students\). I pay this off in full before it's due every month, but is there any way I can have this recorded for credit in the US?

What options do I have for building credit now? How bad would my situation be if I don't manage to build any credit before I move back? Any and all advice is greatly appreciated!",finance

investing,Brighter Horizons Family Solutions (BFAM),"Hey everyone, I posted this in the stocks sub yesterday but wanted to hear what you guys think as well as I enjoy reading both subs. 

Today I was hoping to share with you all a company I recently purchased some shares of. I’d love to hear your thoughts and if you think I made a decent choice here. The company is none other than Brighter Horizons Family Solutions (BFAM) and specializes mainly in child care and daycare centers.

Some quick facts right off the bat. The company has a PE of just under 40 and pays no dividend. It has a roughly 5.75 billion dollar market cap and its listed stock price has increased roughly 30% in the past year. It experienced a 10% Growth in revenue from Q1 of the previous year while having exceeded earnings estimates several quarters in a row.

Net Income, however, decreased 9% from the Q1 of the previous year. The changes in tax law were actually a main cause behind this as despite the decrease in federal taxes paid, the company’s tax benefits weren’t as significant. The tax law changes have kind of threw off a lot of company’s financial figures so it’s tough to say just how much of an impact the new changes will ultimately have and how companies will adjust (for better or worse).

Now, why does this company draw my attention? The first is that it offers a unique sense of diversification similar to how REITs can. Childcare and daycare is unique in that for many it’s a necessity in today’s world. With baby boomers working and retiring later than their parents had, it makes it harder for younger adults to have their parents babysit their children. This leads to the question of paying for daycare or having one spouse stay at home. For many careers, taking time off can be a killer and major delay in career advancement. To add to the debate, many companies do not offer paid time or things like maternity leave making the decision even more difficult. During mighty bull market or brutal bear markets, parents need someone to look after their kids while they work.

While the almost unavoidable problem of child daycare and the growing cost of it, a company like this should benefit from raising costs in the sector. Whether parents pay directly or companies pay, the business should profit. Right now in the US, we really don’t have an answer for daycare and this isn’t a problem that is likely to go away anytime soon as it hasn’t received too much floor time on tv or political debates despite how ridiculously expensive daycare can be. I can’t really see any new law being implemented anytime soon that could change things and negatively impact a company like this.

The growing debate of importance of early education and parents willing to pay to top dollar for daycare centers offering unique and trustworthy care. This company certainly caters to upper middle class and high income parents hoping to find the best care possible for their kids. Simply put, it parents have the money they aren’t shy paying top dollar for their child’s education and care. This company tries to sell itself as offering tremendous early childhood education and social interaction.

The company has over 1,000 centers in several countries around the world. They specialize mainly in child daycare but also offer support and services in things like college coaching, workforce training/consulting, elderly care, and special needs care. I think daycare can be a big money maker but I’m curious to see how their elderly care sector will work out as it has massive potential if done correctly (which has proven difficult for many in the sector). The diversity in not only sectors but countries should prove beneficial.

The company has solid reviews from both a client and employee perspective. They were listed by Fortune magazine as a top 100 company to work for and as one of Colorado’s top workplaces to work for going into 2018 by the Denver Post. Most reviews online of the company are positive and there are no bad stories or articles when you google their name. While reviews should often taken with a gain of salt and looked at carefully, I think they still play an important part. This company doesn’t have any nightmare stories or major issues that can often plague companies involved in things like childcare or nursing homes for example.

I don’t think this company is a stock one would hold looking for a quick and easy gain. Instead it reminds me a little of a company like Visa in that it’s one of those companies that doesn’t have huge swings day to day or week to week but that you look say one year later and realize how well it’s performed. Obviously the two are totally different companies and on different scales but hopefully my comparison makes sense.

Normally I’d say wait until a dip to buy unless you absolutely love a company and have major hopes but if you look at this stock’s history there really hasn’t been too many major dips and buying opportunities. I do feel it is priced fairly reasonable in this current market environment so wouldn’t argue against buying in now. Of course past performance doesn’t equal future performance but if you’re looking for a company with pretty consistent performance this isn’t a bad pick in my view.

After looking at what both analysts and the company itself have stated, the view is that revenue should continue growing around 8-10% per year but the rate of growth should remain relatively consistent, possibly slightly lessening. For a small-mid cap company this isn’t ideal but for the type of sector this company is involved in I’d also argue its both realistic and feasible.

So what do you guys think?

Would also like to state for what it’s worth, I do own shares of this company and have a positive long term outlook for them.

personalfinance,I'll be 40 next year and I have no retirement savings - How Screwed Am I?,"**POST IS RESOLVED** ^20:35:00

My previous employer was acquired a few years ago and rather than rolling over my pension to a personal IRA I cashed it out and used the money to wipe out 20 years of accumulated debt between my wife and I. 

I am now working at a job with no employer provided pension (401K only) and I'm starting from scratch. 

According to Social Security Administration I'm supposed to have saved $280K for retirement at this point in my career and I have zero saved. 

Good news is that I earn a high salary and have no debt other than mortgage and two vehicles. 49% of my gross income each month is used to pay bills + mortgage so that means 51% is available for other things (though it does need to also cover gas + groceries + expenses). 

  

**How screwed am I?** ^NOT_AT_ALL  
  


----------------

**UPDATE** ^^2018-05-19

Turns out that I'm not that screwed at all. As long as I save between 12%-15% of my income I should reach around $1 million worth of retirement savings (assuming an 8% average annual return). Combine that with Social Security and it should be smooth sailing.

* Initial Investment: $17,000
* Per Month Contribution: $1,200 
* Years of Investment: 25
* Annual Interest Rate: 8.0%

**Social Security** 

I've created an account on the SSA website (https://secure.ssa.gov/RIL/SiView.do) and was able to see my entire lifetime earnings ($1.5 million) so far along with my estimated benefit which is around $3,000 per month. Combined with my wife's social security we should be earning over $4,000 per month in Social Security

**UPDATE** ^2018-05-24

My wife and used a financial planning service provided by my employer to create a tentative financial roadmap. When we laid all of our debt on the table for the administrator it turned out we actually had $37K worth of debt (not the $27K I knew about). 

The advisors have created a plan that I think my wife is onboard with. The plan implements a debt snowball that will complete in 2020. From there its 6 years until our home is paid off and from that point onward 80% of our combined net income goes into investments to set us up for a comfortable retirement 16-20 years from now (depending on the performance of the market and our ability to stick to the plan)

personalfinance,Parent Plus Loans -&gt; HELOC -&gt; Student Loan Refinancing?,"I graduated in 06/2016. My mother's parent plus loans for my education were $45k. I myself had $30k of federal student loans on top of that with Navient.
  
My mother had a fixed 7% interest rate through the Parent Plus Loan provider so we opted for her to take a HELOC out on our home and received a variable 3.25% interest rate. At the time that felt like a good option, however, in today's rising interest rate environment, we're now quickly approaching 5%.   
  
My current balance on my Navient student loans left in my name is $15k and there is $40k left on the HELOC.  
____________________________________________________
  
What are our options for refinancing the HELOC and potentially moving those loans into my name. I was quoted 5% fixed through SoFi and Earnest for a student loan refinancing (called because I had a feeling they couldn't do it) but learned since the parent plus loans were already refinanced into another separate non-education debt product, they could not help me.  
  
What options do I have here?

personalfinance,Best way to consolidate and pay off credit card debt?,"I was unemployed for a few months and I managed to rack up some debt on my credit cards in order to survive. Not I’m playing catch-up. 

I currently have three cards with 12k+ limits on them and between my wife and I, we probably have about 15k (give or take) of CC debt. 

All of my cards have rather high interest rates (20%+). 

Here is my question. I might be able to get a new card, at a much lower rate, through my credit union and transfer all of the balances over. But then when I’m done, I’ll have yet another card with a high available limit. 

Or do I see about getting a personal loan to consolidate the debt. Then when it’s paid off, the account/loan is closed?

personalfinance,"Grad School Loans, Tuition Reimbursement, Saving in General","Ok so first things first. I've never taken out a loan before, and I know next to nothing about them. I was lucky enough to get through undergrad with a full scholarship and parents who were generous enough to help me pay for books when my very small paychecks couldn't cover them. Now I'm two years out of undergrad with a stable job, and I'm trying to save up money to go back to school for my master's degree. Thankfully, the company I work for has a tuition reimbursement program that gives me up to $2600 per calendar year to go toward classes. I only have to pay the money back if I get a grade lower than a C or if I leave the company for whatever reason. 

That being said, $2600 a year will obviously not cover paying for an entire degree unless I spend the next decade in school. The degree program in interested in will cost about $29k, not including books or other course fees that might come up. What I'm trying to figure out now is how to go about getting a student loan that won't kill me with interest rates and how I can fit it into my budget without going broke. I won't be starting classes until this fall, so I have some time to plan this out to see if it will work out to where I can take at least two classes each fall, spring, and summer for the next 2-3 years.",finance

personalfinance,"Using a 0% apr credit card to pay for living expenses, then paying off the credit with school loan money - crazy or genius?","Hear me out. This is literally a shower thought of mine but could maybe work??!

I start medical school in July. I can get federal direct unsubsidized loans for my living expenses in medical school with an interest rate of almost 7%. I also have great (&gt;775) credit and could qualify for one or several 0% apr for 15 month credit cards. I have around 10k in savings rn in the bank, but that will be around 6-7k by the time school starts because of all of these weddings I have to attend dammit!

Would it make sense to put my living expenses on one of those cards and then at the end of the 15 month period pay off the debt with loan money? The reason I thought this might be preferable is because with loans, the interest starts accruing as soon as you take out the loan. I thought that with this plan, I could limit the loan money I take out this year to just what I need for rent. This would delay the accrual of interest and if I did this every year, I would save several thousand dollars.

If I make all of the minimum payments, will carrying a balance tank my credit score? Are there other downsides to this that I'm just not thinking of?

I was planning on just taking loans out for rent (since I wouldn't want to pay that with a card) but use the card for everything else (I tend to spend $800-1000/ month, (i'm trying to cut that down but am struggling)).

personalfinance,"Just got a decent paying internship, looking for advice on restructuring my debt","So I've accumulated a decent amount of credit card debt because I've been in school for the last two years and haven't been making enough to make ends meet. I've tried to get a credit consolidation loan to pay off my cards and pay a lower interest rate, but my income wasn't high enough, and since most of my income was tips, it was hard to prove my income anyway. I just started a summer engineering internship though, so my income will be much higher and easier to prove for the next several weeks, so I'm planning to use that opportunity to restructure my debt before the next semester starts in fall.

My first plan of action is to get a credit card consolidation loan. From what I understand, that will boost my credit score a good bit because it will reduce my revolving debt to limit ratio. My score is currently around 600, but it was 725 before I accumulated all the debt. After my score goes up, I plan to refinance the two vehicles in my name (EDIT: my wife pays for a drives one of them, but the loan is in my name), and hopefully get a better interest rate than I'm paying now since I'll have a higher credit score.

Also, there was a substantial report done by none other than Fox News. It's one of the most jaw-dropping things I have seen produced by the mainstream media. 

Massive Spy Ring Uncovered in US.

Fox News has learned some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S., who may have known things they didn't tell us before September 11. Fox News correspondent Carl Cameron has details in the first of a four-part series.

• Part 1: http://youtu.be/5fm0_7jVqcE

Tonight, in the second of four reports on spying by Israelis in the U.S., we learn about an Israeli-based private communications company, for whom a half-dozen of those 60 detained suspects worked. American investigators fear information generated by this firm may have fallen into the wrong hands and had the effect of impeded the Sept. 11 terror inquiry. Here's Carl Cameron's second report.

• Part 2: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhAEjSQghj8

Last time we reported on an Israeli-based company called Amdocs Ltd. that generates the computerized records and billing data for nearly every phone call made in America. As Carl Cameron reported, U.S. investigators digging into the 9/11 terrorist attacks fear that suspects may have been tipped off to what they were doing by information leaking out of Amdocs. In tonight's report, we learn that the concern about phone security extends to another company, founded in Israel, that provides the technology that the U.S. government uses for electronic eavesdropping. Here is Carl Cameron's third report. 

• Part 3: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENwze5owq4w

This week, senior correspondent Carl Cameron has reported on a longstanding government espionage investigation. Federal officials this year have arrested or detained nearly 200 Israeli citizens suspected of belonging to an ""organized intelligence-gathering operation."" The Bush administration has deported most of those arrested after Sept. 11, although some are in custody under the new anti-terrorism law. Cameron also investigates the possibility that an Israeli firm generated billing data that could be used for intelligence purpose, and describes concerns that the federal government's own wiretapping system may be vulnerable. Tonight, in part four of the series, we'll learn about the probable roots of the probe: a drug case that went bad four years ago in L.A.

I've currently got 20K in short term savings, and 20K in retirement savings, since I have only been out of college and working for a year.

I have no debts or loans out.

I've been living super modestly this year, and I'm pretty content with most of my life, I like my inexpensive apartment and my cheap hobbies. 

But there's one big purchase I'm considering. A new car. My current one is, to put it plainly, a beater. Before I bought it for $2000 in high school, it had been in a few minor accidents, and since having it, I got rear ended and the back is kinda crumpled in. I found a mechanic who will pass me on my inspections, but I seriously need something new.

I've got my heart set on a used Mazda Miata. (3 - 6 years old, $15,000 - $20,000) I'm a huge car lover, and have always wanted a sporty car.

I was considering saving up for a while, until I can pay for it in full upfront, from my short term savings, while still having about a 10K safety net in short term savings. (That way, I won't have to pay any interest, most used car loans have bad interest rates) 

 But that would be, by far, the biggest purchase I've ever made. And I don't know if it's a bad idea. I've been able to keep a complete POS car chugging along for 6 years because I'm handy with cars, so I feel like I'm overspending.

personalfinance,Any reason I should pay off my car now?,"Hi PF!

I bought a car just over two years ago and got a 60-month loan. However I ended up paying more than the minimum required monthly payment (always applying the extra amount to the principal) so now I only owe ~$200 on the loan, with the next payment due sometime in 2020.

With an interest rate of 1.4%, I was thinking of just paying a nominal amount every month ($10?) instead of paying the loan off completely, so this way the loan will continue to show on my credit report and help my credit score by having a better credit mix/an additional open line.

crypto_currency,Vanig - new e-commerce,"The e\-commerce economy and the supply chain are facing some difficulties: from long periods of hope for finishing payments due to exorbitant payments. In addition to this, it is difficult to track deliveries according to the supply chain, as it is divided into almost all delivery services, and because of this, the number of arbitrators increases, the final cost of the product is still increasing. In addition to this, there is a lack of transparency, as soon as the craft reaches the initial ones \- it is not just generally available, faster, it often hides in these silos.

To solve these difficulties, Vanig's plan gives an ecosystem of e\-commerce and supply chains, which, it is said, will be fed from the Hyperledger Sawtooth Blockchain notebook. His target is contained in the simplification of manual actions in the supply chain and the elimination of the need for intermediaries, as if he is preparing the most efficient supply systems, especially for e\-commerce platforms. One of the features that the plan is required to implement is the tracking device, which allows users to track applications in real time. These traces are kept constantly and permanently on the block chain. Another 1 highlight, which must exist is available in the Vanig ecosystem \- probably an instant board with the support of VANIG tokens. With this function, according to news, transactions will be eliminated, and, as payments become immediate, traders will be able to send products sooner. There is also the possibility of a peer\-to\-peer relationship between the main stakeholders in the supply chain; probably must allow manufacturers to reduce / destroy the commission intermediary services. In the case of a response, Vanig will have even the most effective process, consistent with the comparison with the status quo. It is said that the main information will be transferred to all interested sides through the block chain, eliminating all the narrow places that are all likely to exist due to asymmetry in the distributed information.

Vanig will have his own token, the ERC20 VANIG token. It is assumed that it will facilitate transactions in the present time in the ecosystem. Apart from this, the partners have a chance to get retribution in VANIGbecause of specific actions based on ecosystems, such as listing, acquisition, etc.

Why I think we'd make a good partnership:

* Aforementioned cost figures
* We've been friends for nearly a decade and trust each other not to steal/lie/etc, and we both have similar lifestyles so we would mesh well as roommates \(especially in a 4br house\)
* He benefits because I can do any necessary renovations at material cost and keep the house in working order. I benefit because he has a very stable income and his credit score is higher than mine \(\~760 vs \~720\)
* Collectively, we can manage a 20&amp;#37; down payment.
* We're both interested in property investments \-\- if this goes well, we may make more in the future.

We've already talked about writing out a contract to make us equally liable for the mortgages, taxes, renovations, etc, as well as covering what happens in case one of us goes insolvent or dies. While I'm less certain of where I'll be in the future than he is, we're both willing to hold onto the property for at least 5 years.

I feel like I can make better use of $2k now then whatever it will become 20\+ years from now, even if I have to pay a 10&amp;#37; penalty to get it now.

*Side note: Even though I will have lucrative employment opportunities after I graduate, I will have massive loans and doubt I will be contributing any serious funds to a retirement account anytime soon.* :\-\(

Is there any angle or argument I'm missing here? Should I take the money, pay the penalty and go?

personalfinance,Purchasing a new house. Better to put more money down for lower mortgage payment or invest?,"Here's my situation. Current house is under contract to be sold for 260k and I'm looking to purchase a new house in a different area for 260k. Good news is I can get much more house in my new area for 260k. Going to make about 80k on the sale of my current house. Bad news is my new mortgage has to be FHA due to a poor rental property investment 5 years ago.

My plan was to take the proceeds from the sale and roll them into the new house leaving me with roughly the same mortgage balance of 180k. Interest rates are currently higher now but taxes are lower so I would have roughly the same monthly mortgage payment, minus PMI,  which I like. I feel comfortable having roughly 25% equity. 

After speaking to my mortgage broker, he suggested only putting 20% down. Keeping cash in hand, especially because I plan on refinancing into a conventional mortgage in 2 years. 

I'll mostly afraid of being in a position where I'm so underwater and feel trapped. I'll still have a healthy emergency fund and savings of  about 30k

personalfinance,Need advice in dealing with a loan,"So long story short,

I've had taken out a rushed consumer loan \(with no collateral\) a little over a year ago, with 18&amp;#37; yearly interest rates for 3 years. 6 months into it I was trying to settle it and pay it back in full, sent the agency multiple \(signed &amp; scanned\) letters asking to cancel my loan and calculate the settlement amount but everything was either ignored or after a few email exchanges directed to their phone lines which they never pick up. Without things moving anywhere, 7 months later \(so 6\+7 = after 13 months in total\) I stopped paying it hoping to catch their attention and get this thing resolved. Today, 15 months after I took the loan I found out I've been sent to collections agency \(essentially they sold the credit and all rights to it for another agency\). Due to interests being paid first, despite paying for 13 months I still have 87&amp;#37; of my loan to cover. So my question is, what are the usual rates that defaulted consumer credit loans are bought for and is it possible to make a deal with collection agency to, for example, only pay half of the loaned amount and annul the debt. Since I feel mistreated by the original credit company I'm considering an alternative \- to just let it go to trial. I don't live in my home country \(where I took out the loan\) anymore, don't have any work relationships there, no real estate or any other kind of property and no bank accounts, so possibilities of them actually collecting in on the debt are limited. What is my best recourse here?

personalfinance,Should I refinance my student loans?,"Hi r/personalfinance

I have a couple of questions about my student loan situation and am looking for advice as to what to do. My grace period is about to end on my private loans and I am trying to figure out if I should refinance or not as I enter the repayment period. 

This is my current loan situation:

Private Bank Loan #1 $116,697.16 at 4.00&amp;#37; variable \(tied to Fed Prime rate\)

Private Bank Loan #2 $15,384.64 at 4.49&amp;#37; variable \(tied to Fed Prime rate\)

Federal Perkins Loan $14,694 at 5.00&amp;#37; fixed interest starting to accrue interest in September

Total debt $146,775.80

I am currently thinking about refinancing my loans through First Republic Bank. Their refinancing terms are below. These are estimated payments for $145,000 of student loan debt are below:

5 year at 1.95&amp;#37; with a monthly payment of $2,538

7 year at 2.55&amp;#37; with a monthly payment of $1,887

10 year at 3.35&amp;#37; with a monthly payment of $1,424

15 year at 3.95&amp;#37; with a monthly payment of $1,069

The catch is, “In order to qualify for the fixed rates listed above, applicants must open a First Republic ATM Rebate Checking account with automatic loan payment and direct deposit. Minimum $500 to open an ATM Rebate Checking account. A monthly fee will apply if a minimum monthly average balance of $3,500 is not maintained. Monthly fee waived for ﬁrst three months; monthly fee is currently $25. Ask your banker for details. For fixed rate loans, if at any time during the life of the loan the borrower does not maintain automatic loan payment or direct deposit, the rates will be listed as above plus 5.00&amp;#37;.”

This is my current financial situation

Income $115,000 per year living in Northern California \(after taxes I have about $6413 take home per month\) I also have an emergency fund of $15,000 sitting in a CIT money market account currently sitting at 1.75&amp;#37; APY daily compound. I don’t have any other debts. I spend everything I can on my credit cards each month and pay them off in full every month for maximum cash back/point redemption based on what gets me the highest yield per purchase. I have never paid interest on a credit card.

Breakdown of expenses

Roth IRA \- $500 per month \(contributing 11 months this year for a total of $5,500 for 2018\)

HSA Contribution \- $575 per month \(starting in July for a total of $3,450 for 2018…will drop to $287.50 per month in 2019 if the individual max remains the same\)

401k – None yet. I am a new hire and won’t have access to the 401k/profit sharing until July of 2019. 

Disability Insurance \- $128.34 per month \(supplemental coverage to cover what my company DI policy does not cover\)

Rent and utilities \- $1,000 per month \(I rent a room in a house with all utilities included…I’m a single guy so this works out well for me and is a great deal for the area\)

Health Insurance \- $67.08 per month for my contribution \(heavily subsidized health, dental, and vision insurance provided by my company\)

Variable monthly expenses for food, fun, gas/car stuff and random expenditures \- $1,600 \(for the most part I spend less than $800 per month on food, gas, fun, etc, but I have that budgeted so if I have to spend extra on something unforeseen each month, I can afford it such as the $690 I spent on tires that needed to be replaced last month on my 12 year old Honda that I bought used about 7 years ago and paid for in cash.\)

So to summarize all of this above, I have about $6,413 of take home money per month after taxes and whatnot leaving me about $2,542 per month left over. From that $2,542 I am expecting to pay about $1,600 per month with my current student loan situation on a 10 year repayment plan, but I am expecting that to go up as the Fed raises the prime rate.

So \(thank you for sticking with me so far\), my questions are as follows:

1. Should I refinance my loans? If so, does First Republic’s offer seem like a good one or do you recommend something else? 

Current thinking \- I think that at a minimum, refinancing to the 10 year at 3.35&amp;#37; makes sense since it beats what I have now and what I have now is most likely going to go up. 

2. If I do refinance, am I better off keeping it at the 10 year and contributing more to my 401k as well as regular brokerage account or am I better going for the 5 or 7 year aggressive payoff plans?

Current thinking – If I pay off the loan over the 10 year, I will have more money to contribute to tax deferred accounts like my 401k once I have access to it next year. I am expected to get raises each year as well as bonuses, but I do not want to rely on those for budgeting purposes.

Thoughts and advice are greatly appreciated.  Thank you for your time.",finance

Bitcoin,Current Bitcoin Carbon Emissions. The numbers. Can we discuss please?,"I received a PM from a redditor about a [old comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6jlfes/cryptocurrency_mining_is_making_some_graphics/djff69k/). His PM reads -
&gt;So back 10 months ago I posted this comment and you responded with the most reasoned response about the entire Bitcoin network emitting less carbon than a single 747. It made me feel much better about Bitcoin. It also confused me this past few weeks with people posting stories stating that Bitcoin will soon use nearly 0.1% of the world's energy and already consumes more power than every single solar panel in the entire world produces. Those two don't really square, so I looked back and the article you reference was from 2014. I'm curious if you've reevaluated your stance on bitcoin or perhaps have some insight that the current hysteria is just overblown?

Since I've spent the time doing some napkin math (I could be horribly wrong on this, someone *please* correct me!), I thought I should make this post public for everone to evaulate my maths and my reasoning.

First, I would just redirect to AA's great clip on the subject -

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fExR-IKozOY

As for re-evaluating my position, yes, constantly. Im going to do this really quickly, so unsure of accuracy, but should give a rough ball park.

http://www.yousustain.com/footprint/howmuchco2?co2=761+tons

Says its about 761 tons for a 747 to fly 24 hrs.

https://www.thebalance.com/how-much-power-does-the-bitcoin-network-use-391280

Claims 1 watt per 1 second gigahash. Comes out to 343 mW per second. Thats 1234800 mW per hour, which equals 29635200 mWh for 24 hrs. The formula used to calculate megawatt-hours is Megawatt hours (MWh) = Megawatts (MW) x Hours (h). In this case, I've used 24 hours since we are comparing to 24 hours of a 747 flying, so 24 MWh. So currently btc mining has a rate of 1,234,800 per MWh.

Putting 29635200000 (previous mWh * 1000 for kWh) into [this government calculator](https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator) will give you caron comparisons. That calculator claims an equivilent of 2,481,717,074 gallons of gas consumed. Yes, thats nearly 2.5 billion.

To make this comparison more comprehensible....

https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=23&amp;t=10

&gt;In 2017, about 143.85 billion gallons (or about 3.40 billion barrels1) of finished motor gasoline were consumed2 in the United States, a daily average of about 391.40 million gallons (or about 9.32 million barrels per day). 

This would be equivilent of 6.33 days of gasoline usage in the USA for a single day of mining.


So go go back to our airplane analogy, the carbon calculator says that many mW = 22,055,020 metric tons of carbon emitted.

I do recall looking into the airplane thing back when we were discussing it, and I remember looking at the numbers. Frankly, its impossible to believe those were accurate and im sorry. I should have double checked everything.

According to - https://charts.bitcoin.com/chart/hash-rate

We had around ""5EHash"" in august of 2017, when that comment was made. We are now at 31EHash, over a 6x fold since that comment was made.

Now that we have the numbers out of the way, some things to consider...

These estimates are based upon the USA's carbon calculators which measures average carbon output based on the varying technologies in the US. [According to the wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_the_United_States) the US only is around 12% (in 2016) for renewable energy.

So in general, our energy is pretty damn dirty and we put out a **lot** more carbon than we sequester.

In that AA video, he talks about the geolocation arbitrage used by miners. This makes a lot of sense. If you are going to invest 50-500 million into a mining operation, are you going to do it in a area where it costs 12 cents per hour (US average), or where it costs 3-4 cents per kwH? See -

https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2018/01/13/renewable-energy-cost-effective-fossil-fuels-2020/#1c69d08e4ff2

Obviously you are going to massively reduce your operational cost as that is what will lead your investment to become profitable.

Fortunately for us, and the world, many of these arbitrage opportunities are in hydroelectric and geothermal energy areas. These plants are designed to be future proofed, so enterprising mining congolmerates will move to areas where they can secure very cheap energy prices. When these companies are currently using 5-15 GwH for their cities, with 50 GwH capacity, they will happily sell their extra capacity to the mining operation since that is a very favorable economic incentive to all parties.

Another factor to consider is that for every single new ASIC design, they are becoming more energy efficient. So even though the hashrate is jumping, I would say the overall energy used by the network will plateau, if it has not already done so. With GMO and other giants like Samsung entering the mining design fray, this will only speed up energy efficiency.

None of this is intended to be a sidestepping of the facts - Clearly the bitcoin network uses a **lot** of energy. And when you have less regulated countries (china, India), it presents opportunities for locals to setup mining operations inside their locality, which then uses dirty energy, increasing carbon outputs.

The amount of carbon emissions per day (22,055,020 metric tons) that is above is obviously not very accurate when you account for these arbitrage opportunties. We know for a fact many of the largest mining colo's are situated near hydroelectric and Geothermal energy plants, which means that they are practically *zero* carbon emissions. Since we do not know the location of every miner, due to the decentralized unregulated nature of bitcoin, it is impossible to calculate how much of a reduction of tons of carbon we will get for that calculation.

But even if we are generous, and say 50% of all mining is done on renewables, that still leaves 11 million tons of carbon per day, a pretty staggering amount.

There is also [much to hope for with scientists claiming we can be 100% renewable energy across the entire planet](https://www.pv-magazine.com/2018/05/18/study-100-global-energy-system-feasible/). Such as scientists setting to prove through empiracle data that it is feasible to convert the entire planet to 100% renewables. Though it is probably not realistic that this will happen quickly, or even at all. To give perspective, CFC's have been banned for decades and thought not in use for over a decade, [yet recent data has shown levels are increasing](https://interestingengineering.com/banned-ozone-destroying-gas-back-on-the-rise-warn-scientists). There will always be industry willing to destroy the world in the future for short term profit now.

We should also weigh the costs and benefits of this massive network. If bitcoin becomes adopted across the world as a currency, which if you look at places like Japan, it clearly is, then this will enable *literal billions* of people who are currently unbanked to join into the global financial ecosystem.

The personal financial soverignty that bitcoin brings is of *incalcuable value*. Whether the carbon emissions are worth these trade offs is a philosophical question that probably does not have an right or wrong answer.

Then we must also evaluate the carbon impact that the bitcoin network would have if cryptocurrencies were to *replace* traditional financial networks. There are some good analysis on the carbon footprint of banks, and bitcoin mining, coindesk has done several articles, see -

https://www.coindesk.com/microscope-conclusions-costs-bitcoin/

&amp;

https://www.coindesk.com/microscope-true-costs-banking/

If we are properly to examine the impact that cryptocurrency carbon emissions have on society, then we should also examine the *reduction* of carbon that cryptocurrency networks will have upon the banking sector.

[This site](https://www.comfort-pro.com/2015/10/how-much-energy-does-an-air-conditioner-ac-use-infographic/) Claims AC &amp; Heating results in 47.7 % of the entire USA's electricity usage. This example is just to present a understanding of how much energy these systems use.

How many Banks are there around the world that have their AC on 24/7? I can imagine just that number alone would lead to a staggering level of CO2 emissions. The coindesk article claims 591k bank branches around the world. The above aritcle claims 3.5k watts for a single central air unit. I had a family member that used to run a A/C business and I've been on top of many businesses. A bank will likely have several of those units to keep the place cool, I would estimate between 2-10 depending upon size.

In more good news, [Bank branches are declining](https://www.wsj.com/articles/banks-double-down-on-branch-cutbacks-1517826601), and cryptocurrencies will only accelerate this. Lets hope that bitcoin is the amazon of retail brick and mortor closures.

In conclusion, there is a valid and rational concern as to the amount of power that the bitcoin network brings. And instead of being dismissive, we should recognize the incredible rate at which the bitcoin network is growing on an annual basis. From 4.3EHash to 31EHash over the last year, that is about a 8x fold increase.

Since we can assume that the majority of hashpower is coming online in the last year is likely newer models, these units should be at the current efficiencies.  The estimates above should be *roughly* accurate based on this information.

This information will only be used by politicians and media congolmerates to spin a very bad negative impression of the bitcoin network. And you know what? *Maybe they are right*. Maybe bitcoin is growing into a massive CO2 producing beast that outweighs the benefits that it brings to society.

But how can we reach a consensus on this issue unless we, the hardcore bitcoiners and techophiles, bring the numbers into sunlight and discuss?",cryptocurrency

* Andrew Poelstra of Blockstream got juices flowing with a presentation on MimbleWimble, Scriptless and Adaptor Signatures. What we were suprised to learn, mentioned by him at the event, is that Adaptor Signatures were previously believed to be not applicable to ECDSA and require Shnorr, however that may not be the case and Roasbeef is on the job.

I have called the state number about how to rectify this, but the guy on the phone was a little unhelpful and actually unsure of how to answer some of my questions, but maybe I just got a new employee or something...

personalfinance,"First time homebuyers, can we switch mortgage company if we already ""locked in our rate""","Long story short. My wife and I have found a home, made an offer and started the mortgage application process with company A, who we have been working with from the very beginning. Company A issued us a pre-approval letter where it the mortgage rate was clearly stated as 4.75%, a bit higher than what we were expecting but still within what we considered an acceptable range given the research we had done. 

Once the offer on the house was submitted, and it came time to formally start the mortgage application process, Company A attempted to ""lock us in"" at a rate of 4.99%. This struck us as a pretty dramatic shift from the pre-approval letter over a very short amount of time (it took 3 days between the pre-approval letter and the initial offer being accepted by the seller). I called Company A on the phone and they tried to justify the rate spike as ""daily interest rate fluctuations"" and that it was currently the best rate they could get us, but that they would ""see what could be done"". Not an hour later, I receive an e-mail from Company A  saying that an ""exception"" had been approved, and that our new rate would be 4.875%. This is still a full eight point higher than what was in the pre-approval letter.

This made my wife an I start thinking, and we signed up for Lending Tree. Within minutes a representative from Company B (a very well rated, reputable lender) spoke with me on the phone and he was able to generate a rate of 4.625% with 0.25% in points ($850 for us). I have done my research on Company B, read the reviews, checked their BBB records, and it all checks out. We have not signed any documents with Company A, but we have ""locked in"" our rate with them.

The idea is to only owe payroll taxes (15.3%) on the reasonable wage. The rest of the income (140k?) the LLC takes in is passed onto me through profit sharing via K-1 and is only taxed as normal personal income (not payroll).

I've created an individual 401k and individual roth 401k to take try to maximize tax preferred savings. From my understanding, the employer contribution has to go to the traditional 401k and my employee contributions can go into the roth 401k for the max of 18.5k. The max profit sharing the employer can contribute is 25% of the reasonable wage (not K-1 or business income?). This would limit the total value to 38.5k and be below the overall 55k limit. I would manually move both of these contributions from the business bank account to the 401k provider each payroll.

I pay estimated quarterly income taxes based on paying 100% of my income tax from last year to be safe. Also, federal and state unemployment taxes would be paid the first quarter they are due and then they are maxed out and not paid anymore since they are only on the first 7k or so. 

Provide myself a W-2 at the end of the year and file business and personal income tax. Franchise tax does not apply (?) since I would be below the 300k business profits limit for Texas.

Is that a reasonable plan or what other aspects am I missing or problems am I creating? I randomly stumbled upon franchise tax for example but what else is out there for taxes / savings I'm missing out on? Thanks for the help!",finance
personalfinance,"Bought 'Starter Home' 5 years ago, and planning on selling it within the next 5. When is 'investing' in this house no longer worth it?","My wife and I bought our starter home 5 years ago for $96,500. Since then we've invested money into it for our own comfort, out of necessity, and under the hopes that we are increasing the value of the property.

Most upgrades have been cosmetic (Full refinish of wood floors $1250, laying new laminate floors over old ones that were in bad shape $1300, new windows where needed $600ish so far)

Some upgrades have been out of necessity (New metal roof on garage - $8000, new Breaker Box to upgrade from Federal Pacific (known to be unsafe) $750, new appliances in kitchen (Fridge $1500, Dishwasher, Washer, Dryer ~$300 ea), Bathtub upgrade / Bathroom remodel $1600.

Now we're strongly considering having Central Air installed ($4500, probably. Quotes coming). The house is old, and has no built in cooling. We currently have no AC available at all and instead of buying multiple small units (and one large one for the open-roomed lower floor - would cost $800ish for lower floor, and would need 2-3 units for upper floor at $300ish a piece) we're considering a whole house solution.

We're also considering painting the exterior or siding it and will likely need to put a roof on the home eventually if we stay the full 5 years.

At what point is improving the property not going to pay off assuming we put some amount of value on our own comfort? What adds to resale value? What kind of things don't add to it?

Thanks!

1. I plan to furnish the house and rent it out.

   2. Should I rent out to AirBnb \(Amsterdam is the city, house is \~8km/20min by metro from City Center\) or a long term tenant?
   3. If I get long term tenants, what's better, finding tenants from my workplace or outside?
2. Whenever I get extra money, should I pay off the principal or invest/save it to get interest. The points to note are:
   1. When principal drops to 90&amp;#37;, the interest rate will be 1.99&amp;#37;. 80&amp;#37; \- 1.94&amp;#37;. 70&amp;#37; \- 1.89&amp;#37;. 55&amp;#37; \- 1.79&amp;#37;.

personalfinance,3866 Acquisition Fee?,"Hey Reddit,

I am in the process of buying a pre-owned certified car, and I found a nice 2016 Corolla with 4,180 miles for $13,600. 

The thing is that I only have $3,000 in cash with me, so I would have to finance it... And to finance it, my credit is relatively new, so the bank doesn't trust me.

So the dealership I get the car from tells me they'll get the loan and will charge me $3,866 in ""acquisition"" fees, so they can get the loan for me regardless of my credit.

So now, with the car being 13,600 and the acquisition fee being 3866 along with other small fees like dealer documentation fees and others, the car becomes around $18,000 in fees.

And then on top of that, the dealership now says that I can get a loan approved for 8% APR on the $18,000 which would make my monthly payment with GAP around 350 for 5 years.

Being frustrated over the fact that my interest rate is almost 100% now, I tell them to remove the acquisition fees. They say they can't, and they tell me not to worry, because after 8 payments, I can refinance.

Now, I don't know if I'm being tricked or not, so can someone please help me out?

personalfinance,Use Roth IRA or emergency funds for downpayment of a house?,"I'm considering putting an offer on a house in DC today and I will need around $30K for the downpayment if I decide to pay for the PMI at closing in order to decrease my monthly payments. I currently have that amount but part of it is my ""emergency fund"". I also have ~$9K in my Roth IRA and my understanding is that I can use that money without penalties if it is for buying a house (I'm a first time homebuyer). Should I use the money from my Roth IRA or emergency fund? My fear from using my ""emergency fund"" is that I wont  be able to have liquid money just in case I really have an emergency (plus I'm sure there will be more expenses when we move) but on the other hand, I'm afraid I will loose my compounding power by taking the money out from my Roth IRA. I should also mention that I will be able to recover that amount once my husband starts working (hopefully later this month).  Also, if I put that money back into my Roth IRA, will that count towards my 2018 taxes? If so, I will loose the opportunity to add more into my Roth this year (so far I deposited $600 for 2018 taxes)? 

Note: This house is in a upcoming and growing area in DC and it is priced well. The house has a basement which we plan to AirB&amp;B to help us with the monthly payments.

personalfinance,Early withdrawal from a Thrift retirement plan (age 41)...covering my bases (North Carolina),"I'm trying to make sure that I'm handling this less-than-desirable decision as well as I can:  


I have to buy a home at this point in time (long story regarding the ""have to"" part). I have no savings, except for 2 retirement plans offered by my nonprofit employer, a Thrift Plan, and a Defined Contribution retirement plan. I'm also a single mom.  


As a first time homebuyer, I would qualify for a good program through my credit union with a low APR, but without at least a 3% down payment, my monthly mortgage payments (w/ insurance etc) would be higher than I can afford (and this home is the cheapest I can find, so please don't suggest I find something I can afford, lol).  


As a result, I'm looking at taking an early ""Hardship Withdrawal"" (as called by my plan manager - they let you withdraw for a # of reasons, including down payment on a home). I have about $25k in there, and was looking to take about $12k out.  
  
I understand that this amount would be minus:  
* 10% for federal tax withholding  
* about 7% for state tax withholding (I'm not totally sure on that #, but I tried to overestimate it)  
  
  
And, I would need to set aside another 10% of it (post-withdrawal) to cover the early withdrawal penalty payment.  
  
  
Doing the withdrawal will not bump me into a different tax bracket. One other consequence of doing this is that no contributions can be made to my retirement account for 6 months.  
   
  
Does this all sound about right?  
  
  
Am I missing any other problems that could come up as a result of this early withdrawal? I'm really, really not thrilled about doing this, but I can't see a way around it.  

  
Thank you so much...  




Edited to add: I genuinely appreciate all the words of caution intending to help me reconsider my decision to purchase this home. Please keep in mind that you haven't seen my personal budget, and the word ""afford"" means something different to one person than it does to another. In my case, ""affordable"" means that I will have leftover after all monthly payments for the purposes of:  
*Saving for my child's college fund  
*Putting $ into an emergency fund  
*Putting a little $ into retirement savings (not through my employer)

personalfinance,"Two closed-by-grantor CC accounts, making monthly payments on one, how to proceed?","I'm looking to figure out how to best approach the revolving debts that I have right now. My current financial situation sees me making minimum/slightly above minimum payments on what credit accounts I have, and for the foreseeable future, I wont be able to make large increases in payments.

I have 2 closed CC accounts carrying balances. Both were closed during a period of unemployment and family tumult in 2016. The first was the first CC I ever got, currently carrying approx. $3600, with a 26.74% interest rate. The account is closed, and I make a monthly payment of $120 (the minimum is around $115 presently, I usually get charged about 75 in interest per month)

The other card was closed and charged-off in 2016. It carries a balance of approx. $2700. This was issued by my local credit union, with whom I maintain a checking, savings, and personal loan account. They've never requested payment on this account since the account was closed down, though I realize I am liable for any debts on it. Interest has not been charged since the closure in 2016 (at least, not as showing in an online banking portal/card website). I have not made payments on it since the closure.

Upon my annual Equifax report, I noticed that both accounts are marked as ""payroll deductible"" (the first card has it as a denotation monthly, the second just has it on the account remarks), and, upon realizing what that means, am now slightly concerned that I will have a wage garnishment (though I haven't yet). 

I don't know if I can afford making payments on the 2nd card right now, but I'm wondering if it would be wise to attempt to look for a balance transfer card, if not for the first card, then both. Doing the math it'd be about a $100 transfer fee for the first card's balance on most 3% cards (if I get approved with a ""fair"" credit score), then in 15 months, I'd already be paying $1800 (lowering the balance by half, and following that, likely having a lower-than-current rate).

stocks,Energy sector suggestions for yoh,"Hello, 

I just wanted to give some advice to people looking for energy stocks to purchase and or sell. Also a full disclaimer I do own or have owned the stocks I am about to list

GE- let me say that this stock is trash and if you own it I would abandon it. This is a backwards flip from my previous veiws after doing some digging. The main reason I am no longer a fan of this company is because of its debt. It carries some of the largest debt in the industry and if interest rates pick up (which they are) they are going to be unable to maintain a cash flow to handle all there obligations. I would recomend buying it only when it hits $12-$12.5 range until then it is a high risk investment with little upside. The company needs to abandon its dividend to take care of its obligations.

RIG- This is a stock I absolutely love. Why because it is volatile in a good way. This is a oil stock with its roots in deepwell drilling. It also pays a great dividend and after the collapse of oil they were able to restructure and gather more assets to take advantage of the new increase in oil. Now if you believe oil is going on the wayside dont buy this. However, i believe oil is going to keep rising due to the many geopolitic issues that are driving demand up and supply down. Also now that the US is a exporter it is recomended to look at stocks like BP, EXXON, and OXY. 

CEO- everything listed above but this is an chinese based oil company. And it is and is going to be an oil powerhouse for a long time. As we are witnessing right now China is a huge powerhouse player that rivals American corporations and laughs at the attempts to impose tarriffs on it. Also with chinas ever growing population and the acces to a 1/3 of the worlds population in its backyard they have a plenty of ways to develope growth. The biggest concern i have for China is that like America it has a baby boomer surge, but theirs is way worse and I feel in the next 20 years their aging population is going to put a huge strain on their economy. But until then this is a great stock. 

OGZPY- This one has hit some recent snags but still has the potential to explode. This a a Russian own natural gas company. It currently pays a 6% dividend yeild and the Oligarch essentially has a monopoly on the natural gas market in the region. They are also pouring money into infastructure for distribution. Some would call it a value trap but even with the dividend alone it is a good buy, because all the fundamentals are there. 


So there are a few suggestions. Let me caveat all these with a couple pieces of advice. Stock in foreign countries have the dividen tax that does cut into gains a little. However, my biggest concerns are with the governments themselves. Since the US really has no control of them they have the potential to be very volatile due to the host country mingling in them and it is a risk I am willing to take until we see some real tension between countries build. 

Also the energy sector is high but i wouldnt recomend these if I didnt think it would go higher. I have a huge portion of my portfolio in them because i bought them during their crash and I would continue to buy but at a slower pace.",finance

investing,Oregon's flooded recreational pot market a cautionary tale,"[Amy Smart, The Canadian Press, at 07:05 on May 21, 2018
](https://app.tmxmoney.com/news/cpnews/article?locale=EN&amp;newsid=VGB210400&amp;mobile=false) 
VANCOUVER - As marijuana farmers in Oregon say a flood of supply is killing their businesses less than three years after recreational cannabis was legalized, economists say it's a warning to Canada.

Stephen Easton, professor of economics at Simon Fraser University and senior fellow at the Fraser Institute, says large fluctuations in price and supply are bound to happen when you create a legal market where an illegal market already exists.

""There is no reason to think it won't happen here as well. In a broader sense, we are adding legal production to an already robust illegal production,"" Easton said.

""Consumption may simply not increase in proportion to our ability to grow.""

Robin Cordell, owner and grower at Oregon Girl Cannabis Company, said she saw the influx of supply coming on social media that would choke out her farm.

""I saw just massive fields planted on Instagram, just huge acres and I just knew that was going to be the result,"" she said in an interview.

**While she once sold her pot to a wholesaler for $2,200US per pound, she said that dipped to $600 per pound.**

Cordell said she's planning to pull the plug entirely on recreational pot and focus on medical marijuana and hemp products until new markets open up across the country.

""I think I am going to actually give up my licence and wait for nationwide legalization to happen, just because the market is terrible,"" Cordell said.

Oregon's inventory of marijuana is staggering for a state its size. There are nearly 450,000 kilograms of usable flower in the system, and an additional 159,000 kilograms of marijuana extracts, edibles and tinctures.

The Oregon Liquor Control Commission, which regulates the industry, said some of the inventory of flower goes into extracts, oils and tinctures, which have increased in popularity, but the agency can't say how much.

Yet the **retail price for a gram of pot has fallen about 50 per cent since 2015, from $14 to $7, says a report by the Oregon Office of Economic Analysis.**

Commission spokesman Mark Pettinger said the agency still doesn't have complete information about demand, but a comprehensive market study is underway that will be released in January.

He said about half of the 2,014 producer applications received have been granted in a process that has typically taken between two and six months.

**""It's a free market and the legislature did not provide us with any authority to limit licences,"" he said, ""so that's probably an issue the legislature will need to take up during the 2019 legislative session.""
**
The regulatory framework emerging in Canada already looks a little different.

There are 104 licensed marijuana producers in Canada, including 57 in Ontario and 22 in British Columbia.

**As of May 11, Health Canada had received 1,974 applications from producers and had refused 268, while others were in progress, incomplete or withdrawn. The entire application process takes more than a year to complete.**

Under the federal government's proposed approach to cannabis, regulations would not prescribe a limit on the amount of cannabis a producer cultivates under a standard licence.

**""However, the Minister of Health could establish a production limit as a condition of the licence if there were reasonable grounds to believe that a licensee was producing more cannabis than this licensee was able to sell, and that the excess inventory was at risk of being diverted to an illegal market or activity,"" a November 2017 consultation paper by Health Canada says.**

Werner Antweiler, professor of economics at the University of British Columbia's Sauder School of Business, said market fluctuations will depend on whether the government restricts licensing and prices.

**If left up to the free market, prices can drop to almost nothing, temporarily, he said. The market typically corrects itself over time, with smaller-scale producers that have higher production costs exiting the market and larger-scale producers being able to survive the roller-coaster because they work in economies of scale.**

""If you want to prevent prices from dropping dramatically, there can be regulations in place that maintain a minimum price of some sort. That's easier to do if the distribution channel is regulated,"" Antweiler said.

But he said price controls can backfire.

""That said, the danger is then, **if prices are regulated and we have players trying to sneak around them and provide their product illegally at a lower price, that could lead to an undermining of the idea of liberalization**, which is getting the market into the legal domain and preventing an illicit market from surfacing,"" he said.

""It's much better to get it right from the beginning,"" he said, and decline to licence more producers than the estimated demand can support.


*****[edit: It's different here?]*****

One Canadian producer says he's not too worried about being pushed out of the market the way producers are in Oregon.

""I think it's a function of a far more relaxed regime,"" said Dan Sutton, CEO of Tantalus Labs based in Maple Ridge, B.C. ""Right out of the gate, you've got a far more sophisticated production regulation regime, which inherently applies a barrier to entry.""

Tantalus Labs is a small-batch producer, which grows unique strains and only harvests about 100 plants at a time, he said.

**Sutton is counting on recreational consumers to pay more for a higher quality product**, which could mean unique strains, cannabis with a ""farm to table"" story or organic cannabis that has been meticulously cared for.

""In Oregon, while there are massive over-supplies of commodity-grade quick and easily grown cannabis, there are still cannabis products that sell for $15 or $20 a gram at the dispensary level,"" Sutton said.

""All cannabis is not the same.""",finance

investing,Companies in emerging markets are more leveraged than they were before the last big meltdown.,"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-05-20/here-s-one-reason-to-worry-about-emerging-markets

&gt; A lot has changed since the late 1990s, when a period of credit-fueled growth ended in a wave of defaults and devaluations that swept from Asia through Russia and all the way to Latin America. Governments have built up big reserves to fend off attacks on their currencies, and they aren’t trying to prop up fixed exchange rates like they did back then.

&gt; But one lesson seems to have faded: the perils of debt. After a long period of relative caution, companies are borrowing more for each dollar of shareholders’ equity than they did at any point in the 1990s.

&gt; Such leverage leaves companies vulnerable at a time when rising interest rates are increasing the cost of servicing the debt — as Harvard economist Carmen Reinhart recently noted. Worse, a lot of the obligations are denominated in dollars, which makes them harder to pay off when emerging-market currencies depreciate — as they have been doing in recent weeks.",finance

Private student loan (husband): $27,659.08

My current thought is to go by largest monthly payment to free up cash-flow first.  I was toying with interest rates, but the cars are similar, my student loans have many different rates, and the private loans are relatively low.  SO, work from largest monthly payment to smallest made sense to me.

Here’s our plan for  when credit cards are paid off in July:

Cars first, as that will decrease our monthly payments by almost $700 when they are gone.  I should be able to have this done in 14 months.

Then, Private student loans.  Assuming that we have an additional $700 a month, plus what we were throwing at other debt, I think the private loans will be gone in about 10 months. This will free up an additional ~$450 a month combined 

Then my federal student loans. With the additional $1150 a month, and what we were already paying towards debt, These should be gone in 8-10 months (I haven’t figured out how much my balances will change due to interest yet because this is a few years in the future).

Is this a good plan?  I have assumed that our income will remain flat (it won’t) but I have also assumed that our savings will remain flat (probably won’t either considering that we’re having a baby in August)  Thanks for your advice!",finance
personalfinance,Student loan repayment &amp; interest,"I'll be graduating soon and begin working, so I will have to start paying off student loans (I've made a few interest payments here and there thus far). I know that it's best to pay of the highest interest loan first in order to save the most money. However, I'm curious if the interest deferment for federal subsidized loans plays into this.

For example, one of my loans is a $2,500 subsidized loan @ 4.66%. Another is $1,800 unsubsidized @ 3.76%. The subsidized loan doesn't start accruing interest until January 2019. If I could pay an extra $200/month towards principal on the loans, is it better to pay off the lower interest loan currently accruing interest, or the higher interest loan that is interest-free for another 6 months?",finance

business,Proactive Vs. Reactive,"“Proactive” creating or controlling a situation rather than just responding to it after it happened

Source:  Oxford English dictionary

“Reactive” acting in response to a situation rather than creating or controlling it

Source:  Oxford English dictionary

Every year we hear new buzz words.  Sometimes it is useful to make your own buzz words to motivate or as a reminder when times are tough.  It can be a cruel world sometimes.  We psychologically tend to remember the negative more readily.  There is nothing wrong with retaining the unhappy moments, they can help remind us to not “go down that path” again or learn a lesson to approach a task or activity differently.

There’s a difference between dwelling on our past experiences and using them simply as a reminder.  The personality type who is often caught up not wanting to try again is in a way paralyzed by the bad memory of a prior effort that didn’t turn out well.  We become reactive.  We wait for a defining moment then act to either stop it from happening again or becoming more impactful.  One might say, “that’s the way it is supposed to be, I’m not a mind reader”.  If there are mind readers out there, then this article may not be for you.

Most animals are equipped with a reactionary mentality.  It is part of our evolution to recede from things that are scary or dangerous, or in many cases perceived as such.  We don’t want to get too close to the edge, or do we?  A lot is learned from pushing boundaries.  I would make a gentleman’s wager your favorite professional athlete experienced crushing failure over and over yet willed themselves to continue the path toward being a champion or a legend in their sport.  We admire these people, just like the Romans and Greeks did so to the pantheon of gods.

Our society includes many professional careers rooted in a reactionary mindset.  An example police or disaster response units.  Yes, being reactionary in certain instances is for the greater good.  However, disaster responders may have a less perilous job if more precautions are instituted.  We can learn from past disasters and how to make future unpredictable scenarios less cruel.  The 1989 earthquake in Northern California was an event I won’t forget.  The double decker freeway traversing West Oakland collapsed upon itself, killing several people and severely injuring many more.  It was a hellish sight.  The rebuild is a wider, single deck span.  One might say, how can we be proactive in a situation such as this?   It’s an extreme example.  There are so many factors involved, local, state and federal government.  Who pays for what?  Who is responsible for upkeep, on and on.  The larger the project, the more complex it is orchestrating a proactive approach.

We have the freedom to develop processes in our business and personal lives to limit the impact of a negative occurrence or eliminate it altogether.  Make time to think through a costly aspect of your business, there’s a starting point.  Take a minute to write down one or two activities in your business you feel is a negative.  The negative can be something that is a time waster or a financial burden on your business.  An example, outsourcing a call center operator to a third party, whether right down the street or in a foreign country.  Does this third party make your business leaner, or does it cause more issues for you or a high paid person on staff to manage?  Keep the $15 an hour work for the lower skilled staff.  Allowing a key member of the team spend more than an hour a week on supervising or handling an issue a call center person is handling is a redundancy.  Be open minded about it.  Realize you allowed it to happen (forgive yourself) and know it is fixable.

Trial and error is being proactive.  It’s easy to confuse whether we are being proactive or not.  If you are making a concerted effort to improve your product or service, that’s the action of pro-activity.  I have heard some say they think proactive action leads to perfection.  Maybe it will if that’s what you are after.  Yet, how long is something truly perfect? 

Being proactive is something we do continually.  It is a means to stay competitive in the market place.  It is a source of ingenuity and helps make the mundane interesting again.  When we spend our valuable time thinking and most importantly acting on improving a process or procedure, we are making our business more efficient, safer, more profitable or a combination of all three. 

This year make “proactive” and “reactive” your buzz words.  Be aware of distinguishing one from the other when thinking through your activities for the day.  Is this activity one or the other, and whether to attack or plan before acting.  It may go a long way in building a better more efficient business or project.

“I believe that everyone chooses how to approach life.  If you’re proactive, you focus on preparing.  If you’re reactive, you end up focusing on repairing”

personalfinance,Buying a used car,"Hello Everyone,

I am in the market for buying a used car but my credit score is not the greatest \(\~570\) and I am also in a good amount of debt \(bankruptcy score \~670\). I do need a car to get back and forth from work as well as to take care of my kids. I have tried going to a car dealership for a used 2011 Chevy Equonix for $9,065 at 19.95&amp;#37; interest. I didn't take that deal for I would be way under once the car is paid off if it last that long. So then I tired going to my local credit union to try to get an auto loan from them but they said since my debt is high that the committee would turn me down. Thus, the credit union was a no go.

So my next option I am thinking is to either go to a place that approves ""good credit, bad credit, no credit"" and probably get a high interest rate around 20&amp;#37; but get a car for no more than $5,000 \($3,000 preferably\). I know all of this is a bad financial move but I really do need a car and doing those monthly car rentals would be as much as buying a car or Uber. Also I want this to help my credit because even if I get a high interest rate, I would do my best to make more than the monthly payments.

Do you guys have any other options you can think of that may help me out in this situation?

While this seems to fall under any taxation rules for inheritance, my question relies on the estate side as the estate was worth in the 10's of millions.

Sorry to post twice in succession, but I felt that this necessitated a separate thread.

I currently have a Discover It card with a FICO score of around 790, and a credit limit just shy of $9,000. However, that credit score hasn't moved in four months at all, despite me paying my statements in full each month. Plus, Discover no longer offers extended warranties on electronics and other purchases, and is limiting their price protection coverage as well.

Apparently, FICO recommends me to open another line of credit to increase my credit score further; how true is that? I guess a better question would be, *how necessary is that?* If it is, what company offers the best benefits to non\-travelling consumers? \(I don't really fly or go on vacation all that often.\)

From what I've read, the difference between 700s and 800\+ on credit is merely bragging rights; you'll get offered similar interest rates and approvals in either bucket.. Again, how true is that?

personalfinance,Received a cash graduation gift - start retirement fund or start paying off loans?,"Hi,

I graduated from medical school last Friday and received a generous $5000 graduation gift from my long\-time mentor and friend. I am unsure what to do with it. I will be moving to Atlanta in June to start my residency and have enough money to cover all of my moving costs without the gift. I'll have a $57K salary during my first year. Like most medical students, I'm pretty under\-educated about personal finance, but am doing my best to get up to speed. There are a few things I'm considering putting this gift towards:

1. Starting a Roth IRA \- I've heard that I should start this ASAP. As a resident, I'll be making low enough salary to contribute to this every year, but once I graduate and have a full salary I will probably no longer qualify.
2. Start paying off student loans \- I have $220K in total loans from undergrad and medical school. All of them are direct Stafford, Perkins, or Manchester \(i.e., no private loans\) and I had them consolidated at a 5.5&amp;#37; interest rate. I'm also signed up for the Revised Pay As You Earn \(REPAYE\) income\-driven repayment plan during residency, which subsidizes most of the interest for the first few years of repayment. I plan on working for a non\-profit and staying in academics, so will also try to get into the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.
3. Down payment on new vehicle \- I have an '01 Camry, and while it has no major issues, it is a little unsightly \(some rust, an off\-color replacement driver\-side door handle\). I honestly don't care that much about this and am cool with driving a beater, but part of me thinks it would be nice to have a newer car.

personalfinance,Calculating cash difference in paying off loan now versus just making the payment,"I will try and give as much info as possible.  And I know that it is much smarter to payoff the loans with the money you have.  But I am doing different calculations and am slightly confused at what I can specifically use to show my fiance that it is smart to payoff my loans now rather then continue normal payments.  I am doing basic calculations not taking into account variables of higher incomes, different payments, etc.

So the info:

Savings $200,000

Student Loan totals: $60,000 currently

Loans range from 5-8%

So after paying off student loans we will have $140,000 in savings (we own a home already)

Roughly 10 year payoff, with average total cost after interest rates on the student loans is say at roughly $136,000

Currently $200 a month will go into savings, without the student loans we can afford to do $500 a month.  What is the easiest way to show the difference over the 10 year period the actual cash value of paying off the loan now?  I know the logic that it is beneficial, but to be able to bring an actual number to her in the differences would help me figure that out, any help would be greatly appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Debating a job change. I could use some others' perspectives,"Engineer here, and I have been at my job for approximately 4 years. A recruiter contacted me about a position with a competing company a little over a month ago. I did the preliminary phone interviews, lunch interview with hiring manager, interviewed at the regional corporate office with regional management, etc. All that went well, and pending 1 more interview with the National Director of engineering, I expect to get an offer. I expect my offer to be a generous boost in base pay - approximately 20%. The competing company's incentive package is also much more generous than my current company. The new position would also be a promotional step in my career. 

My reluctance is that I am not unhappy with where I am. I enjoy the work, and I enjoy the people I work for and work with. I have a lot of autonomy. My boss trusts me. I'm well liked. My only issue is my pay. Despite great annual reviews, good productivity, increased responsibilities, increased workload, and obtaining my professional engineering (PE) license, I have not gotten (what I deem to be) proportional increases in my pay. The last two years I have gotten increases of 4%, which my manager insists are he highest he could get for me. 4% doesn't even cover the increased cost of living in my neck of the woods. 

Here's where I am torn...due to a spike in potential projects and a coworker taking a leave of absence, we are going to struggle meeting project deadlines this summer, and if I leave, they will be severely understaffed. Do I give them a heads up that I am thinking of leaving even before I have an offer?

I haven't filed personal taxes since 2014 \(4 years back\). I opened my LLC in 2016 and have a TaxID, but have never submitted state/federal taxes.

1. **2015** \- Lived in Maryland, worked freelance \(no LLC yet\). Moved to Florida, started employment at company. Prepaid $750 for federal taxes during extension, but never followed through with filing personal taxes. Started employment at other company halfway through year.
2. **2016** \- Lived in Florida. Ended employment at company from 2015. Opened LLC in Wyoming using registered agent, got tax ID, never filed taxes.
3. **2017** \- Lived in Florida, Traveled abroad for 4 months, then moved to California. Started employment at new company halfway through year.
4. **2018 \-** Still working at same company from 2017. Haven't filed personal or LLC taxes. LLC will be profitable soon.

Fortunately, I do not believe I owe taxes and the LLC has consistently had a loss since I opened it. Also, I have paid taxes consistently, so I will likely receive a tax refund. Later this year the LLC will start to have a profit WHILE I am employed, one of many reasons I need to get this under control soon.

investing,How much you will have if you invest $x every year for y years at i%,"Hey guys,

I made this [table](https://i.imgur.com/N0bc5PY.png) you can use to quickly see how much you will have if you invest a given amount of money per year for certain amount of years, making an average given interest rate. To use the table simply multiply the number in the chart that corresponds to the amount of years you want to invest and the interest rate you expect to make by the amount you will invest per year. 

For example, if you plan to invest $5,500 per year for 25 years and expect to make 7% per year, you would multiply $5,500 by 67.68 giving you $372,240. This table assumes you put your money into the account at the beginning of the year. 

For those of you who do not know, this is called the future value of an annuity due. If you put the money in at the end of the year meaning that money didn't accrue interest it would be the future value of an annuity. If you don't have this chart handy you can do it on the fly after a little bit of memorization. 

For the future value of annuity the formula is:

((1+i)^n -1)/i * pmt

i being your interest rate as a decimal, n being the number of years, and pmt being your contribution amount. For an annuity due simply times the whole thing by (1+i)

So using our example above the formula would be

((1.07)^25 -1)/.07 * 5500 * 1.07

If you want to do this in excel or google sheets the formula is:

=FV(rate,nper,pmt,[pv],[type])

Where rate is your interest rate as a decimal, nper is the number of compounding periods, pmt is the amount contributed, pv is the starting value of account, and type is if the payments are put in the account at the beginning of the year or end. 0 for end and 1 for beginning. Keep in mind the pmt and pv have to be negative because they are cash out flows. For more help on the excel formula go [here](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fv-function-2eef9f44-a084-4c61-bdd8-4fe4bb1b71b3)

A family member has generously decided to help me by lending me money, so I can pay off all my credit cards and pay them back every month with a reasonable minimum payment and a very generous interest rate of 4%. 

Once the balances are gone, do I ... 

A) ... cancel the credit cards? 

B) ... call the credit card and ask them to AGGRESSIVELY lower the APR while I keep them open to improve my credit score? 

C) ... something else?

* ~$350-400/month on food, restaurants, and the bar

* $150/month on entertainment and shopping

* $35 insurance on my truck, and the GTI would bring that up to $130/month (actually less than my Accord by more than half for some reason??)

I feel fooled and am in the process of trying to find a new position either with the Department of Education or through a friend's school who definitely qualifies for the program. I also feel scared. 

However, I'm nervous with the current administration that attempting to even begin the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program will ultimately fail. I know that I have to re\-apply every year to make sure that I am making qualifying payments. 

By the time I finish the PSLF program I will be 38....but if I don't qualify how will that picture look? 

I currently am doing the IBR repayment plan for my loans.. I would say with my main job and after school jobs, I make 70k annually. What should I do? Should I try to overpay my loans and get them over with? 

The likelihood of eventually being in a PLSF qualifying program for the next 10 years is VERY, VERY high. Please let me know what you think!!!!!!!!!!",finance

CryptoCurrency,Hello Ripple my old friend,"TLDR: hit me with the FUD cannon cause these goggles are getting pretty rosy.

My exploration into alts began with XRP, for no other reason than I read in some shill article that it was a promising project. That was right before the epic run, during which I FOMOd in more rather than take some profits. Now, it seems, I’m ending up right back where I started.

Like a lot of people, I’ve owned a lot of coins. I had a nice diversified portfolio with a mix of high risk and medium risk coins (is there a low risk crypto?).

I learned some hard lessons. I chased pumps that were already over and lost money. I tried to time pumps before they happened and lost money. On my few good calls I didn’t take profits when I was up and lost money. Actually, I take it back. I didn’t learn anything, as evidenced by my most recent shark-like move. I already had a position in EOS, then I sat on my phone watching it shoot up like a Roman candle and thought, I’m gonna buy a little more since it’s ripping and make a few quick bucks. Then it turned about three sats short of my sell order and never went back.

Along the way I’ve been doing my own research (20% reading quality information, 80% bickering with Redditors). Now I’m starting to realize something as I’m sure most of you are: most of these projects are garbage. Or maybe they aren’t and I’m just bitter. I honestly don’t know anymore.

But here’s what I do know. I’ve read OMGs white paper about five times and while it makes sense while I’m reading it, I still can’t tell you what it does. I probably could somewhat, but nothing near a concise 30-second elevator pitch. If you can’t explain something in simple terms to a child, you don’t really understand it, Jack.

Was that Einstein? Springsteen? Is there a difference? Nothing against OMG btw. By all accounts they’re amazing, and it’s probably true.

XRP makes sense on a very deep intuitive level for me. I see very clearly the pain point it’s trying to solve, and how XRP solves it. I see a good use of blockchain technology. I see a team that has connections, understands the world beyond their computer screen, understands investors, and isn’t afraid to make bold moves or to play the long game. They also seem to be accountable for their progress, if for no other reason than as a response to the attention that’s on them resulting from their size.

Gradually, I’m getting fed up with all the false promises in this space, and my portfolio becomes less diversified and more XRP heavy. All these “soon” promises. How long will the ICO money last if you’re paying for fake pumps? I still have some Nano, because it’s cool. I have some REQ, because if crypto payments become mainstream we’ll probably need a way to invoice them. I’ve got some PRL &amp; SHL because fuck net neutrality.  And that’s it. Not even ETH, just because I have no idea which of the bazillion platforms is going to win, and with my track record I’ll probably pick the wrong one. Same with privacy coins.

So what’s the problem then? Why make a huge reddit post? I want to know if I’m missing something because I feel like the price should be a lot higher by now. There’s enough people who know about Ripple. How is every employee at WU &amp; MG not loading up? Why aren’t bankers loading up? It’s so freaking cheap compared to the kind of money FIs have. I’m currently aware of two criticisms:

1. Banks may decide not to use it. That’s valid. We can’t control that. But isn’t the risk of non-adoption the main danger of every single crypto? Something that is common to all can’t also be a point of differentiation.

2. It’s centralized. Ok. So? So is bitcoin. Is everybody that anti-establishment? Anything that makes things better is not making them bad right? I’d make friends with Satan if he was going to make the world a better place and my life easier. Plus, every month XRP is getting a little more decentralized.

So what am I missing? I feel like I must be missing something. Talk some sense into me, Reddit!",cryptocurrency

I am interested in starting Roth IRA’s for both my wife and I. I make 55k a year and she makes 65k.  We both have company Roth 401k’s.

My 401k is a vanguard target 2050.  If I open a Roth IRA through vanguard, would it be bad to do a vanguard target 2045?  I read this would be poorly diversified, but I thought vanguard target packages are diversified packages?  I don’t know enough about choosing eft’s and/or mutual funds to select intelligently.

We've got around $40K in student loan debt and I'm trying to figure out if we should pay that off immediately, or save for the down payment on a new house in a year.

personalfinance,Selling house to roommates and need advice.,"UPDATES:
Thanks for the feedback!
Advice so far is to find a lawyer/realtor that charges a flat-rate (maybe $1K) and sell the house at a fair value.  Since the profit is less than the IRS's limit, I wouldn't have to pay any taxes either.  Any fees/commissions can be split 50/50 which should help keep the whole deal fair.  Sounds like this might actually be pretty easy.

&amp;nbsp;

I will be selling my house to my roommates later this year after they get married.  I'm not too concerned about the sale price yet because we agreed to get the house appraised and then use that number.  I'm looking for advice on how to complete this transaction the smartest way, avoiding as much taxes and fees that we legally can.  I also don't believe my roommates can afford to pay too high of a monthly payment.

Currently, I have:
    15 year mortgage with about $105,000 remaining
    3.8% interest rate
    original loan was $127,000 after I refinanced 3 years ago
    monthly payment including taxes/insurance = $1,450

&amp;nbsp;

Based on the Zillow, the house seems to be valued at $170,000 now.  However, that doesn't include the renovations to the basement level of the house (bathroom, living space, and laundry room) and a renovated full bathroom.  Other houses in the neighborhood are selling closer to $200,000 for a fully renovated house.  The only renovations left is for the middle floor (kitchen, dining room, living room)

economy,The American economy is growing faster than expectations while others such as Japan and Germany are missing estimates. This is causing the dollar and US treasury yields to rise. The US 10 year yield is higher than the other advanced economies for the first time since June 2000.,"One of the most important data points last week was the industrial production report. Production growth was 0.7% month over month which beat estimates for 0.6% growth. Manufacturing growth was 0.5% month over month which beat the estimate for 0.3% growth.

Capacity to utilization rose from 77.6% to 78%. It’s still below the cycle peak of 79.6% in November 2014, signaling there’s still manufacturing slack left. The NY Fed Nowcast is similar to the Atlanta Fed’s model except it doesn’t have as severe volatility in data, which implies it’s more trustworthy during the quarter. The model pushed up its estimate for GDP growth to 3.2% as the industrial production report boosted it by 0.32% (0.14% from capacity utilization and 0.18% from industrial production).

personalfinance,Big student loan and trying to figure out possible Student Loan repayment options correctly?,"I have a US Student loan of $46k @ 7.25%
This leaves me with about $500 a month (15% gross per pay check)  repayment

If I want to make life easier I have the following options
1. try to go to one of the 4x income based plans (IBR/PAYE/ICR/REPAYE) 
Main advantage is lower monthly payments and possible forgiveness BUT for a much longer time and dependent on eligibility
*gross oversimplification but the gist is true?*

2. refinance into a mortgage. 
main advantage is much lower interest rate, but I risk the house. But as I don't own a house yet (started shopping this week) this doesn't seem like a viable option until later down the road.

3. Continue doing what I am doing. Coping and just accept it will be 15% of every paycheck. I can survive, but looks/feels terrible on my excel spreadsheet.

4. Instead of paying 15% a month to personal short term savings contribute a larger amount to loan.
Advantage is it gets paid off faster. But no savings and relying on a spouse is not attractive and feels like a recipe for divorce. (or at least was for my parents)


As I understand it those are basically the only 4 options to me? I feel like I should do something different. 

** Edit after reading the first set of responses**

I really appreciate the responses. I realise I didn't put enough background so let me expand

This is one school loan taken 2017-2018 school year. It was a 1 year teaching program in the UK. International cost are high. Gov told me I was eligible for scholarship and would receive it, only to be told by the university the representative misinformed me and I wasn't eligible and I had to pay them. It was too late to look at other options and did the student loan. 

I just started a new job and looking at my first pay check. For the past year I was making 600$ a month. a 500$ student loan was MASSIVE and I was relying on my wife for everything. Year before that I was in a 1 year teacher course in England (international fee, hence the 48k loan for 1 year program) where I brought in 0$ a month. It has been a massive stress for the past 2 years where I haven't contributed to family expenses. 

My wife has a good salary (nearly 3x mine), and savings, and 10 years with same company. She owns property in France. I've spend the last 6 years working illegally in other countries making just enough to live on and pay off undergraduate loans.  

So my new salary is about 2k pay check 2x a month. 
Starting financial 
1. student loan of 48k @ 7.25% -$500 repayment
2. Roth IRA @ 800$ 
3. Age 30
4. total of 2x bank accounts $18
5. previous salary ~600$-800$ a month 

Current budget plan
1. ~200$ to taxes  
2. ~100$ to medical
3. ~100$ to 403(b)  | total 200$ a month 
4. ~250$ to Roth IRA  | total 500$ a month
5. ~250$ to student loan  | about 500$ a month 
6. ~500$ to family expenses (food/rent/fuel/utilities)  | about 1k a month
7. ~270$ to short term emergency fund (currently at $0)
8. ~150$ to personal living expenses

As far as how are able to house shop. My wife makes way more than me.
She has 12k deposit as a loan from her retirement fund. we are looking at small homes where bank says mortgage will be +/- 80$ of current rent. That is why we feel we could afford a home. If we are are going to pay the same amount anyway, might as well have equity. 


The most common advice I read was that I should just pile everything into the loan repayment
So instead of Roth, 403b, and emergency fund I could instead increase loan repayment from minimum $500 to ~$1500 a month. This would pay it down way faster. IT would also leave me 5 years with no retirement contributions. 

** Replying to comments **
I see a lot of responses to buying a house. I think I've answered those

I see 2-3 responses about the 7.25% interest rate
I'll continue to investigate looking to lower interest rates. It appears I could redo the loan down to closer to 4-5%. Which if I understand the math means the minimum payment goes down to 400 and the same amount being paid means higher overpaying.

General advice seems to be to pay every dollar I can into loan.

personalfinance,What to do with car total loss settlement,"So last week, I managed to be in the right place at the right time, and my car is covered with hail damage. I got ridiculously lucky and somehow my windshield didn't break, but with all the hail marks, my insurance decided my car was considered a ""total loss"". However, since it's all cosmetic, I decided to buy my car back from insurance and register it with a salvage title, etc. My total settlement from insurance after paying off my loan and deducting the salvage amount is around $2700.

The hail did crack my tail light and chip the paint in a couple places, so I'm going to fix those for the sake of not having to put any more money in it than I have to, but I'll probably do some diy fixes and keep it cheap, so I don't estimate spending more than 2\-300$ on these repairs.

This leaves me with roughly $2400 that I didn't have before, as well as an additional $200/month that I was paying towards my car that's now freed up \(and possibly more due to the reduced insurance rates\).

My situation:

\~$18,000 in school loans \(still in school so no real need to pay on them yet, although the balance is increasing as I continue to take classes until august 2019\). Interest rates vary between 3.67 and 4.45&amp;#37; on these.

\~$4100 on a 0&amp;#37; BofA CC that I've been putting $400 to monthly and will be paid off before the promotional period   expires, easily

\~$1,300 E\-fund \(enough to cover a month of expenses, though it is currently stagnant, as any extra funds I have are going to the bofa card, not savings\)

\~$15,700 in 401k that I'm contributing 8&amp;#37; of my paycheck to

My question:

Do I put this $2400 into my high interest savings for the purpose of a ""car e\-fund"" in the event that something happens and my car is deemed undriveable \(I won't get much for insurance because of the salvage title\)? Or, do I chuck it at some of my student loans to get a head start at paying that? or throw it on that BofA card to bring the balance down, freeing up the $400 monthly so I can begin paying off my student loans sooner?

Additionally, does it make more sense to start putting the extra $200 towards a car savings, or a general e\-fund, or towards any of this debt? I could easily split the amount and put $100 towards savings and $100 towards debt, buuut...

Basically, I've brought my CC debt from 9,000 to 4,000 over the last year and I'm really just getting antsy to pay it off, However I just wanted to see opinions on what would make the most financial sense to do in the situation I'm currently in. Thanks!!",finance

**1\)** Ideally, I wouldn't get rid of the car; I would just stop driving it.  I'm hoping this just means I will stop paying insurance, gas, and maintenance and only have to pay the loan off while I store the car somewhere.  I'd probably run it in park once every other week to keep the engine and battery from dying from neglect.  Would this be possible?  Am I right in assuming I wouldn't have to pay the excise tax anymore?  Do I still have to get the car inspected?  If this is possible, I could maybe save up to $400/mnth and afford to go to graduate school.

**2\)** The other, less preferred option, would be to sell the car altogether.  I'd only be able to break even if I sold it for at least $5k, but being conservative with KBB's estimates, I'll likely end up only getting $4k and having to pay the remaining cost of the loan \(around $1k\).  I'm also worried that going this route would cost me even more money to get back on the road once I'm able to afford it again.  I had planned on keeping this car for at least another 3 years after I paid off the loan; so, for 3 years, assuming no major breakdowns, I'd save on the loan payments \($170/mnth\) plus whatever discount insurance gives you for owning the car rather than making payments for it.

personalfinance,(UK) Savings vs Credit,"Hi all,

I'm not sure if it is, but I assume that this is the right sub for this type of question.

I turned 18 7 months ago and am wondering if its better financially to start saving money or to get a loan/credit card. My dad seems pretty set on saving my money but from what I understand about credit score, if I were to go for a mortgage for example, this would be difficult with savings alone. Plus if I actually needed a loan in the future, I would have a problem with interest rates.

I'm in college but have a part time job earning between £300 and £600 per month. I spend around £70 a month (this is a phone bill, Odeon Limitless and Photoshop) these are things that I can't back out of unlike Netflix, NOW TV etc. FYI, the phone bill is in my dads name.

So, Reddit, what do you suggest?",finance

Scam of the Week: GDPR Phishing Attack With Apple Flavor / Royal Wedding

Social engineering follows seasonal patterns. It's also connected to major events. We see this every year with holiday-themed phishing attacks between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day.

We're seeing it now with this week's implementation of GDPR, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, and the Royal Wedding. GDPR takes effect on May 25th. In this case the phishbait is the claim that Apple is proactively preparing to better protect your data.

This sophisticated phishing scam targets Apple users, threatening them with account suspension. If your user falls for this social engineering tactic and is manipulated into preventing a negative consequence, they're redirected to an ""account rescue site"" which of course is established to extract credentials and other personal financial information.

The phishing website is a legitimate-looking but bogus Apple site. It presents itself as a place where the users can rescue their account from being ""restricted.""

In addition to looking legitimate, this website is more sophisticated than most phishing sites because the bad guys correctly set the web directory permissions, and encrypted the spoofed site using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), allowing it to bypass some anti-phishing tools embedded in antivirus solutions.

One of the things the victims are asked to do is ""update payment details."" Once they've entered the requested information, the scammers say, the victims will see their accounts ""returned to normal."" Upon completion the victims are asked to click a button labeled ""unlock."" Doing so sends the information they've just entered directly to the scammers.

The site looks legitimate, but as usual there are red flags: First, the phishing emails were not all that highly targeted. Some of the recipients haven't even been Apple users. Second, the URL is off. For all of its convincing appearance, it's not an Apple site at all.

Companies worldwide are indeed working on becoming GDPR compliant (part of that, train your users) and try to make sure that the people whose data they've collected have in fact consented to give them their information.

Criminals are aware of this, and are following suit. You should remind your users that GDPR is indeed taking effect this week, but that they should be wary of this flavor of social engineering.

The Royal Wedding Is a Social Engineer's Dream

And obviously, this weekend's royal wedding is a social engineer's dream. Wedding fever has taken over the net and a variety of scams and attempts to steal personal information are out there.

For example, there are quizzes out there asking for your Royal Wedding Guest Name and then want your mother or father's middle name, pet names, street they live on and the like.

I suggest you send this email to your employees, friends and family. You're welcome to copy/paste/edit: Be on the lookout for a new Apple-flavored email phishing Scam of the Week. New European data privacy regulation is going into effect this week. It's called General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and bad guys are using it as bait in a variety of ways. This scam looks like it is from Apple and claims that if you do not take action, your account will be ""restricted"". But in reality they steal your identity and credit card information.

And then there is the royal wedding. It's a scammer's dream so be very careful. Only go to trusted websites to get information and news about it.

Do not click on links in emails, or social media links related to the royal wedding or open suspicious attachments that claim any kind of problem with ""GDPR"". Delete the email or click on the Phish Alert Button to forward it to IT and delete if from your inbox. Let's stay safe out there.",finance

I currently owe about 7.5k on a used car I purchased at a 10% interest rate. 
I have about 1k balance on Amazon credit card (recently paid off about 2k credit card stupidity with Wells Fargo and Ashley’s Furniture)

Have about 11k in Subsidized and Unsubsidized student loans, auto-paying $25 monthly (they’re still deferred since I have about a year until graduation).

Credit Score is in the mid 700s, SO’s score is in the mid 500’s. We just got him a secured card and paid off his debt in collections.

My income is going up I’m going from about 20 hours a week to an internship at 13/hr., 40 hours a week.
 
My SO recently began working as a Correctional Officer making more money (overtime) than he ever has so I don’t pay rent, car insurance, anything other than my car, credit card, child care and groceries. 

So my monthly expenses are 200 for car payment, 50 for Amazon, and 400/month for the babysitter, I have a little over 
1k in savings. 

We’re wanting to purchase a used SUV when his car dies, he’s upside down on it and he has really bad credit. Right now the plan is to continue paying minimum payment and trading it in when the time comes but I’m unsure how to go from here.

 Do we pay his crap car off? Try to pay off as much of my car as possible, or do we save all my extra income and try to save up enough money to buy SUV outright (unlikely we’d be able to save enough).

I’m not sure if I’ll be able to finance an SUV on my own and I know his credit score would likely result in straight denial or an atrocious APR.",finance
business,I stepped into a restaurant that's circling the drain as a line cook...,"Hey, gang.  Never posted here before.  More or less looking for more reasons to be involved with the Reddit community because it can yield some cool things.

So, for context - I'm an aspiring entrepreneur.  I've studied business pretty intensely and specialize in the more executive/direction set of skills, such as S&amp;OP, marketing, HR, etc.  I have a business partner in the form of my best friend whom I have known since I was 10 years old, who has a degree in economics.  We're both just trying to build something to get out of the rat race and have some solid plans for the future and a good idea of  how to accomplish them.  For one, we're looking to go into small business consulting for a wide variety of reasons.
Outside of business skills, I'm an experienced professional chef and I know a fair bit about epicurean culture in general.  I'm studying to be able to brew and distill (something which I hope to do professionally) and I have an intimate knowledge of spirits, beers, tea, cigars...  A general background of things having to do with taste and community, is a way to put it.

As for what's going on, I couldn't really think of anywhere else to put this, so I've decided to post it here and see if it sticks, and maybe update it as the story develops.  
So:

I got hired at a franchise restaurant.  Mediocre bar and grill kinda chain that apparently also owns another chain of burger joints (I visited the local location once and it was also aggressively average).  First day on the job went like this: A mysterious Indian woman saw me approach and asked what I was doing, which was just a little weird and not really important.  Just seemed weirdly suspicious.  I told her I was there to work and she realized I was the new hire.  The place is  attached to a hotel and is heavily staffed by Indian, Pakistani and other people from similar regions/ethnicities, which isn't super relevant except for something I'll explain later.
I come into the restaurant and introduce myself - One of the two ladies who interviewed me tells me that I get a free staff meal with any shift of a certain length, so I decide that'll be a great way to start my training and ask her to show me how to make whatever I order.  She shows me how the particular item is made and all throughout, I can say their prep methods are pretty gross for a professional establishment.  I say nothing for now, go into the staff dining area and eat.  I had ordered chicken and waffles; the waffle was premade and had been microwaved to thaw it, then thrown on a flat top grill - You could really taste the pre-made microwaved flavor.  The chicken tasted weird and stale, and that's because the batter was basically glue (flour and water, mixed together and left out all day to be reused) and chunks of the batter had been sitting in the breading, which got stuck to the chicken and fried whole.  It made my stomach actually ache a little after which I just ignored as I started my shift.
She proceeds to train me in the various evening prep stuff and shows me around the kitchen and the material I would need to learn the menu.  She's obviously kinda nervous and unsure of herself - When I discussed that with her in trying to put her at ease, she explained that she and the other lady who had hired me on had never really run a kitchen before this and all they know is the menu and what the previous manager (who had been fired) had trained them with. 
As the conversation went on, one thing led to another and we ended up discussing how the place had been empty when I had been in to drop off my resume - Which should have been a lunch rush - And when I came to do my interview, during dinner hours.  This is where more problems cropped up.
She informed me that they'd fired the previous manager for being generally crappy, that they've been getting rid of people left and right and that while she didn't feel she had real authority in the business, she worked there as a sort of acting manager because her uncle owns the joint.  So at this point I am now actively suggesting that the poor food quality may be why they're empty and given my resume, she just asks straight up what I'd change.

One thing led to another and soon I was going back through the kitchen with her, showing her how a normal restaurant keeps their chicken, telling her how a good batter is made, explaining how a few of their main methods for cooking major items is pretty awful.  Stuff that would be really easy to change with what they have.  She listens to all of it.  Orders start coming in and I find myself giving direction for how to fill them - A burger would come up and I'd get to making it myself since it's not something that needs a lot of training, and I ask her to make the salad and the third person on to get the fries on.  They both just go along with my lead, no questions asked.  I did stop briefly to show her how which bits of the cabbage didn't make a good salad, as they were just cutting the whole thing up and tossing it in.

By the time we were near the end of that first shift, her and I were now openly and frankly discussing the problems of the restaurant.  I was actively suggesting bigger changes now - Things that wouldn't utterly change the menu items but would greatly improve them.  How to counter the bad press they'd gotten under the old manager.  How to make the whole kitchen more efficient.  The benefits of changing how they go about getting their supplies, such as raw meat and buns.  How to store said things so they keep better (I had to throw out a bunch of stale stuff, repackage some meat that would have been unsafe if left as it was and... Just kinda work around having many freezer burned portions).  We talk about their marketing and how her uncle is an absent owner, who'd rather just have the place running nicely and make money than ever have to come in to work on it himself... Which is fair, given that's what some entrepreneurs see a successful business career as.

As per why the ethnicities of people involved are relevant, it's just a background detail that adds to the challenge I might face in trying to make a positive change.  The girls I'm immediately working with are very cool and very modern, but there's a good chance the uncle is from family money and while he's not likely to be out and out racist, there may be an unknowing cultural bias, at least given the fact that the majority of the staff is from the same region.  He may think that because I'm from the local culture, I am soft or possibly foolish with business (which, to be fair, I do feel like other cultures raise their kids to be more resillient and hardworking than North America overall).  But he may rightfully just dismiss me for not being a successful business owner yet, despite my good intentions, and it may be that no subconscious bias enters into it.

We agree that I should make some notes on the ways I would improve the food and run it by them and we'll work on the changes over time, together.  I tell the waiting staff that we have a few customers waiting up front because they're entirely not paying attention to the entrance, despite only having a few tables all night.  I get off work, go home and start making notes.


So all this is kinda why I'm posting this to r/business.  Basically, I came in as a day 1 cook and turned out to be more qualified than basically the whole staff, by their own admission.  I've been looking for a job I can take pride in since I must have a day job while working on my own plans, so having this much to work on at work is a great thing...  But obviously there's a greater potential here.  I felt so motivated to actively pursue improvement for this place that I called up the head office of the chain just to ask some questions, such as how much variation they have in their menus from location to location.  I found out through their website that they openly invite outside ownership of locations to help expand their franchise, as a lot of chains do.

I don't want to get ahead of myself for a lot of reasons, but this could end up with me being the head of the kitchen.  I'm going to take my notes in and ask for an official sitdown to have a bigger discussion about all this.  I forsee myself even potentially sitting down with this uncle and hopefully having a chat about helping his business be more functional, but I am just a day one chef so we'll see what happens.  I'm going in for my second shift today and I'm going to spend these first couple of weeks taking notes and making sure I show them what I'm made of my effectively learning what's already in place before making changes.

Things could get very interesting.

**TL;DR - I walked into a poorly run kitchen and the whole staff immediately began following my directions during my first shift, and I am now slowly negotiating my way to get the kitchen to run properly and improve the restaurant overall despite having no authority to do so.**

**Update:**
After another shift, I'm seeing some allegiances and ideals.  One of the two girls is very hesitant to break away from the formulas of the company that owns the name of the restaurant while the other is more open to improving our general methods so long as problems don't arise and we don't incur cost increases that would otherwise upset the owner.  Some say the uncle is cheap and unduly dismissive while others say he's not that bad.  I have no idea if I'll ever even get to meet the man or get my chance to present any kind of ideas to him personally.  I'm just focusing on learning what's here right now and improving wherever I can within my station.  One thing I can say is there's an awful lot of things around that are just left in a not working condition and seem to have been like that for a while.  The bar's taps are completely nonfunctioning, things leak that shouldn't leak, the ticket printer doesn't work.  Stuff like that which has kinda always been that way.  I've seen a maintenance man around so that's weird.

Found out the uncle owns the restaurant, the entire hotel and the hotel across the street.

I have taken to apologizing personally to customers when any major error with their food is the fault of the cooks - This means going out into the front room.  Very unorthodox, but it felt instinctive to me and it doesn't happen all that often.  One of the leading ladies doesn't like the idea of chefs in dirty clothes going out in the front (a fair point), the other lady is neutral on the matter.  The entire waiting staff and the lady who runs the hotel we're attached to, who had been visiting at the time, seemed very impressed.  I'll chill on that for now and have an official discussion when the upcoming meeting comes.

Our dishwasher smelled of beer upon clocking in.  I had a gentle word with the leading ladies about it and they had a gentle word with him about it.  I'll have a more in depth discussion about it with them - The man admitted to having three beers before his shift.  Aside from being generally unprofessional, he's washing the knives which are damn sharp.

Hoping to negotiate the elimination of the microwave and heating things by other means, but it seems like there's genuinely no one else there who has tasted the difference between microwaved and properly prepared food.  This isn't a huge deal, but it would go a step to make us better.
The toaster meant entirely for burger buns is totally unnecessary.
I'll see if I can get them into making their own patties, but that and many other things depend on how the chain has the supply set up.  Some things are likely to be regulated by a support center while others are probably bought locally as needed.  
I feel like I'll need to have an overarching conversation with the leading ladies to get us all on the same page to know which suggestions and ideas are appropriate.

Got unofficially promoted to front of line today for better coordination of the kitchen.  The staff in front now seeks me out personally when they need to say something about an order or make special requests, etc.

Looking forward, I can tell any really significant changes will be a matter of justifying it on a financial level.  I don't know when that will happen, but I have an economist in my pocket.  

Otherwise, I'm finding the world really enjoyable.",finance

Mom is 52 years old and is self employed.

Mom just opened up her first ever Roth IRA at Vanguard this year \(2018\) and has maxed her contribution \($6500\).  The Roth IRA is invested in Vanguard Target Retirement 2030 Fund Investor Shares \(VTHRX\).

She also HAD $35,000 in a taxable brokerage account managed by an advisor at LPL Financial that had her in some Target Retirement Mutual Funds that had some expense ratios of nearly 2.3&amp;#37; and some shares of GE Stock.  I immediately transferred this money to Vanguard, and sold all the shares of the mutual funds and GE Stock.

My plan for her now is to start a three fund portfolio using Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Admiral Shares, Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Admiral Shares, and Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund Investor Shares.

My questions are:

* \-Did I make a mistake by selling all of her shares of the mutual funds and GE Stock from the taxable brokerage account?  She had a total of about $5500 in gains, and a total of $300 in losses.  Right now the $35,000 is sitting in the Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund in her taxable brokerage account.
* \-To implement the three fund portfolio, do I invest her money in the taxable brokerage account, or should I open her up a Self\-Employed retirement account?  If so, which one?  \(She has about 5 employees, and does not offer benefits.  Super small business.\)
* \- If the taxable account is her best option, should I hold all of her bonds in the Roth IRA and her stocks in the taxable account?
* \-Is 50&amp;#37; US Stocks, 20&amp;#37; International Stock, and 30&amp;#37; Bonds for allocation a good idea for someone her age?

personalfinance,Should I finance a brand new car or find something lightly used?,"I am leaning toward buying a lightly used vehicle because that’s what my brother (a mechanic) has always encouraged me to do. However, my current car was pre-owned and I have had nothing but trouble with it. It had low mileage, one owner and was only 5 years old when I bought it. No accidents. I thought it was a slam dunk purchase.

I just want to buy something reliable that I can drive for years. I’m upset that I’m even having to purchase a new vehicle, I was hoping the one I have would have lasted me into my 30s, but at this point, the repairs on my current ride would cost more than the damn thing is worth.

My partner is opposed to the idea of me financing almost $20,000 for a new car. He would rather me find something cheaper that’s a few years old. I keep reminding him that I have done that in the past and it’s turned out poorly for me. I’ve dumped so much money into fixing the car I have now.

I have heard that financing a new car is a bit easier and can sometimes mean better interest rates + warranties. My primary concern is a payment that I can afford and reliability. I will be in graduate school next year (living off scholarships/grants/loans) and do not want to have a car payment I can’t afford. $350 is the most I’m willing to shell out monthly. I also don’t want something that’s going break down on me when I need it most.

I have great credit, a steady job (though that will change next year), and about $1500-$2000 I’m willing to put down.

https://vimeo.com/239856912

I've just watched it again for, maybe the 5th or 6th time and this point really stuck:

The reason why gold became the money in free competition between all stuffs that can be used as money, is because it is the hardest to increase the supply of, if the price rises because of increase in demand. That's it. If the demand for copper rises, the price rises, more resources go into mining copper and the supply increases, so the price normalizes again. That is also true for gold, but not as much, because it's harder to increase the supply of gold, so *naturally* that's what people use to store their wealth.

With bitcoin it's not harder to increase the supply greater than what the protocol has set in stone. It is *impossible*. It is the hardest money every invented.

personalfinance,27 Years old...Good Income but 40k in debt...40K in my IRA...you know what I'm thinking?

Now that we have that out of the way...

I'm 27, I'm getting married this year. I make a good income, $100k in a very high cost of living city, and I am now facing my debts head on.

I saved 10% into my 401k at my last job, which fortunately matched 100% of that. I then made some good stock picks in my IRA (not recommended, BTW, but here we are...) and have been lucky enough to get up to 40k in my IRA.

I have about 40k between 5 high-interest credit cards (avg 18%), a personal loan (around 13%), an auto loan (the car was totaled, not covered by insurance, sucks but only 2% interest rate).

Would it be the worst thing in the world to liquidate my IRA to pay down these debts?

I'm using the undebt.it website (created by a redditor, if you are in any amount of debt and want to change that start using today) and have a snowball payment plan setup. My payoff date would be about a year, assuming I can stick to the plan.

I have considered tackling a few of these debts and then looking for a 0% APR balance transfer once my credit score improves. Yes, my credit score is sub-600 with a 100K income, I know I am an idiot.

I'm wondering if anyone has ever had this type of thought before.

personalfinance,My dad wants to buy a $20k car at a 13% interest rate. Is it a good idea for me to lend him the money at a lower rate?,"I live in the US. My dad lives in Mexico, where lending rates are sky high. He's eager to buy a beautiful truck at about $20K (USD). He says he'd be okay making monthly payments for financing at 13% interest rate for 5 years. I've brought up to him that that's a ludicrously high interest rate and that I'd be more than happy to lend him that money at a fraction of the rate (say, 7 or 8%, which is what the market would average me in mutual funds). That way he pays less and any extra money won't go to the banks, but to me. Is this a good idea?",finance

personalfinance,25. US. Just graduated college. No debt. 65k salary. How to best take advantage of the situation?,"Hi all,

As the title says I just graduated college and got a full time job at the company I worked at part time during college. Earn 65k a year. Have no debt at all thanks to my wonderful parents and the sacrifices they made so that I wouldn't have to struggle through life. I want to be able to do the same for any future children I have so I was hoping to get some advice on how to best take advantage of my situation. I'm pretty new when it comes to being self-sufficient and planning for my future and ""adulting"" - so writing all of this down and figuring it out helps me a lot.

I have about $4000 in my bank account at the moment. 

The company I work for offers a 4% match on a 401k plan. I assume I should at least put 4% in to get the most out of that deal. They also offer Health Savings Account and that maxes out at $3450 a year. I'm not sure if I should put as much money as I can into that to try and max it out. The company also puts some money into my HSA - does that count as part of the $3450 max?

My goals for the future include eventually getting married, buying a house, having kids - but probably not for another 3-5 years. 

I ran my salary through a calculator with 65k salary, 4% contribution to 401k, $100 to HSA, ~$116 health insurance premium, and my semi monthly take home income is $1790. 

Current monthly budget:

**Take home pay** - $3580


**Rent** - $750 (currently looking for a new place to live, moving in the next few months. Could go up to $1000 possibly?).

**Utilities** - $170 (electric,internet,water)

**Car Insurance** - $125

**Phone** - $60

**Contacts** - $30

**Food** - ~$200  (this is a guess - don't budget food at the moment)

**Entertainment** - ~$200 (also a guess)


**Leftover money** - $2045

Assuming all these numbers are accurate and I'm not missing anything I should have around $2000 dollars per month extra after I pay for everything I need to. I could contribute more to my 401k and more to my HSA. Is there anything else you can think of that I should be doing? I currently only have one bank account (checking/savings) where all my money goes so I'm not sure if there is something better I could be doing there. I'm not sure what the interest rate on my savings account is to be honest because I have never really put money into it.

Thanks for reading this and let me know what you think. Appreciate you!!",finance

personalfinance,Looking at buying a foreclosure property and wondering if it's a good idea,"My wife and I are looking for a home; we are in Alabama and this is our first home purchase. We found a home that was recently foreclosed back in late April of this year. My agent got in touch with the lender that bought the property. The bank offered to let me see it at 1:00 tomorrow, and they would sell it to me for $310,000. The bank said if we don’t make an offer tomorrow it would be processed into the bank’s REO portfolio and would show up on MLS at some point in the future. Though for unrelated reasons, it wouldn’t be ideal to wait for that, considering how long it usually takes banks to process offers.

The previous owners bought it last year for $350,000, got divorced, and missed the payments. They put it on the market trying to sell it this Spring to avoid foreclosure. The pictures from that listing look fine. And it was only taken off of the market in March before the foreclosure. My agent got in touch with the old owner’s agent, who said it was in good shape when he last saw it in March. The asking price before they took it off the market was $349,000, and (per their old agent) they had two offers on the house at the time they had to take it off of the market. They weren’t able to make the sale work out (for some reason) because the owners had two mortgages on the property. The bank bought the property in a non-judicial foreclosure for $280,000.

As far as finances, I don’t think the asking price of $310,000 is a problem. I make around $120,000 a year (not including bonuses). Take home pay is around $7,100. Our monthly expenses average around $4,125 every month excluding rent. That will be $3,730 after my car is paid off at the end of the year. My wife is a teacher, but she is going to quit working for a year or two to stay at home with our brand new baby. Even then, I think the house would comfortably fit within our budget on a single income. We both have excellent credit. My score is in the 790s, hers is in the 810s. No debt outside the car expenses. All in all, it would be around $1,800 a month for PIMI plus PMI. Quoted interest rate is 4.75% with borrower paid PMI, 4.85% with lender paid PMI, both on a 30 year note (should I consider a 20 or 25 year?).

We would put 5% down ($15,500) and save another $25,000 for renovations/repairs and $8,000 in closing costs. Assuming we do the renovations that would leave us with $18,000 cash as an emergency fund. I also have a life insurance policy that has a cash value of $70,000 that would be the backup emergency fund (I don’t want to cash it in if I don’t have to because it is accruing $5,200 in cash value every year on payments of $1,200 a year).

Here are the reasons why I think it is a good idea. The house is in the exact location my wife and I want to be in, and because it is a foreclosure, it would be a good price for the area. Average home prices for this kind of house (4 bedroom/3 bathroom) are around $370,000 in this location. And this area has started seeing a significant increase in property value the last few years (relative to Alabama). Ideally, after renovations I’d have enough equity in a year or two to get rid of PMI.

Even though it is a foreclosure, it was on the market recently enough that I don’t think there would be any huge problems with it. But what do I know? What are some things I might be missing about this opportunity that I should think about before jumping into making an offer tomorrow? Is this a good idea?

If it is a good idea, what are some things I could do that would make it a better offer? And what are some things I should look for in the house as a foreclosure to make sure I wouldn’t be screwing myself over? (Since I know the bank wouldn’t make any repairs.) I doubt the bank will let me get it inspected tomorrow (I have an inspector on call in case they do). So I’d have to make an offer without one and hope they are okay with it being contingent on an inspection.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Can I ask an economic/ cryptocurrency conspiracy theory here to anyone knowledgeable about economics?,"Ever since my venture into cryptocurrency and the endless but good suggestion to ""DYOR"", I began to also DMOR into larger economic trends that are ancillary to cryptocurrency and came across a decent amount of what I would label ""dollar doomsday scenarios"". For instance, and I will try to not be too long winded here, there was significant people voicing concerns about a crazy financial downturn spawned by everything from a sub-prime auto-loan crisis to a stock crash caused by baby boomer retirees needing to liquidate equities to live off of, record amounts of companies are filing for chapter 11 Bankruptcy relief right now etc. 

Considering the (potentially catastrophic) problems that huge amounts of quantitative printing could create with respect to interest rates, servicing debt and the countries/ people that hold our current debt being irate that their instruments are worth less than when they bought the debt, is it possible that Bitcoin was created by the government as a sort of safety currency in the event of a dollar collapse? Don't get me wrong, I love Bitcoin and I realize that posing that question alone will offend some people's libertarian political sentiments with regards to this space, but it kind of makes sense to me. 

If intelligent people foresaw a dollar collapse, wouldn't it be a good move to pump lots of those dollars into something like Bitcoin in order to up the value before the dollar and it's associated equities went bust? I mean, if there is a massive equities sell off because of boomers and there was no younger buyers to pick up the slack because of poor economic times, investing in a new currency seems like it would make a lot of sense. Especially if printing the amount of dollars you would need to relieve the collapse was unrealistic. I mean, who do these ridiculously huge BTC wallets even belong to? Obviously very rich someone(s). 

Any economic experts here to tell me that I'm dreaming and completely off base? Or is there any validity to this notion?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Putting in an offer on a 750k condo,"Looking for people to comment and poke holes in my plan to put an offer in on a townhouse in coastal San Diego. 

I'm 30 years old, currently make 160k before bonus which can be up to 32k. No debt. 70k cash, 100k non-retirement investments. 170k in retirement investments. My wife started a business that isn't pulling in any income yet and will be getting a full time job once it can run itself, making hopefully at least 60k. 

Planning to offer 750k (5k over asking) and 150k (20%) down. We'd take out a loan from my wife's parents for 40k so we'd have 60k left in cash. We'd plan to pay them back 20k each year over the next two years (covered by my anticipated bonuses). 

Our lender is offering us a ""Jumbo"" loan which has a lower interest rate than their coventional loan product. Apparently in San Diego loans over 646k are considered Jumbo but he's classifying ours as Jumbo so we get a lower rate since we have good credit and are putting in 20%. He doesn't seem to think there are any implications on whether we get a conventional VS jumbo other than the lower interest rate. 

The townhouse is a beautiful completely renovated 3 bed/bath with a patio and roof deck. Two of the bedrooms are located on the first floor and have private entries. One of the bedrooms has another room attached which we would add a small kitchen to so we could get a roommate that would have their own private suite for $1200. We know the neighbor lists one of their bedrooms on airbnb for $80-$100/night and would plan to try doing the same for the second private bedroom. 

With 20% down we'd be looking at payments of $4079. With a roommate, $2879, which we're comfortable with but would hope to offset with Airbnb. We currently pay $2350 for a 2 bed 1 bath that is not nearly as nice and with termites and no outdoor space.

We still need to look into how and if we'd be taxed on income from a roommate or airbnb, any input on that  welcome as well. Airbnbs website says they only issue a 1099k form if you make over 20k and have over 200 transactions. 

Housing prices and interest has continued to climb since we've started looking 6 months ago. Buying is extremely competitive and finding a property that has everything we want in the right location has come up only a handful of times. We've been looking at 2 bed/baths that are now around 600-650k, not nearly as nice as this 3 bed/bath. A new construction, similar unit (size, bedrooms) a few blocks away just sold for $1.025 million.

How risky does this seem? Assuming we can get $1200 for the private suite, we would be paying $2879/mo which is well within our reach. Any input is welcome.",finance

personalfinance,Insurance company will not pay monthly cheques after motorcycle accident,"First time posting and on mobile so sorry for any inconveniences on those accounts

In August my father was in a motorcyle accident where he was in no fault and there is drastic proof to prove it. Our insurance company was giving us monthly cheques to pay our mortgage and internet bills etc. They kept doing this until christmas when they decided to stop because they believed he was still able to work and that he was making money with his company (he wasn't). 
They did this right after christmas so we had barely any money at all at the time as well. Of course my father gave our lawyer proof that he was not making money as well as notes from his surgeon and his chiropractor stating he is not able to work and can't do simple things he use to do like play hockey. So our lawyer sent the proof to our insurance company and they did nothing about it and simply kept denying that we had proof that he couldn't work and never sent the cheques. After that my father had to keep taking money from our lawyer who took money from lendors at a 10% interest rate. We are now being forced to sell our house in the coming months because we are unable to pay our mortgage because our insurance company will not give us our monthly payments that they are required to give. 
I know why they are doing this as well, my father has to go in for 2 surgeries and they want him to get out of the lawsuit before those surgeries so he gets less money out of the lawsuit. I am not sure what to do about this surely they shouldn't be able to get away with this.

personalfinance,Balancing loan payment and retirement contributions,"After about a year in my first job after college I've gotten pretty comfortable in my finances. I put 10% plus a 5% company match into my 401k and already maxed out my IRA this year. I have about 21k in student loans left at an overall rate of just under 4%.

My minimum payment for these is $200 a month but I pay $1500 a month to get them done quickly. My question is if it would be more worthwhile for me to reduce my repayment and increase my 401k contribution? I could drop my loan payment by $500 a month and add that to my 401k. I could even go further. At these interest rates, I just don't know what makes more sense.

As far as funds go in my 401k, I'm contributing to 3. I'm doing 50% VFT60TP, 30% VIIIX, and 20% VMCIX. The reason I'm only doing 50% towards the retirement trust is because I feel that 10% bond is too conservative for my goals. This still gives me 5% bonds, and 18% intl stock, at my highest expense ratio. The VIIIX has the lowest expense ratio and it seems to track very well. VMCIX is there for diversity. It also tracks well, albeit at a slightly higher expense ratio.

Let me know what you think. I'm not struggling to still purchase what I need, and I still have some income available for what I want.

personalfinance,Work overpaid my wife and now they want the difference recouped,"This is happening to my wife. Her work has overpaid her about $4,500 over the span of three pay periods (she gets paid bi-weekly) and now wants the overpaid amount recouped.

A little background, my wife's work pays her on a per billable basis meaning she gets paid for the hours she bills out. She recently went on maternity leave and prior to her leaving, the company agreed to pay her on a salary basis for a month so she could rebuild her client base back upon returning from maternity leave. I wasn't sure how much she would be getting paid when she returned to work which is why I didn't question her paycheck when she returned to work and took the bump in her pay without question.

They gave us two options:

1) Pay back the full amount owed all at once (which is what they want).

2) Pay back the amount owed by taking out the money from her check each pay period. They said they would take half of her paycheck until it is all recouped.

They are asking for the gross difference repaid but I assume they will be taking half of the net amount back (less taxes etc). Is this the correct way to recoup money on their part if that is the option we go with?


What are our other options? Are we legally mandatory to pay back the overpaid amount? If so, are their any other options we have on repaying the amount? This is in Oklahoma if that makes a difference. 

Thank you in advance!


Edit: Thank you guys for your quick replies! I have contacted my wife to have her company recoup the money owed through payroll deductions at the gross amount paid. 

For some of you that think I was trying to get away with being overpaid. As I stated in my original post, the company agreed to pay my wife a salary when she returned from maternity leave vs per billable hour as she was getting paid before maternity so I was not aware of how much her paycheck should be but they did say it would be more than normal. Plus one thing I failed to mention was with the new fed tax rates her pay would increase regardless of being paid salary or per billable hour (baby was born Dec 2017 so first pay check was the salary amount plus lower tax rate).

Anywho, thanks again for the advice and have a great day!",finance

My parents have 7 total whole life insurance policies through NWM with \~$75,000 in loans against the policies.

   1. The net cash value is about one\-fourth of the taxable gain??
2. Is it not worth surrendering the policies anymore?
   1. Even with the loans?
3. **Is a 1035 exchange from the life insurance policy into a Variable Annuity \(VA\) a reasonable choice?**
   1. **How do loans impact the 1035 exchange?**
4. Should they just take a hit with the taxes?
5. Are there any other options I am not thinking of?

Side Note: I have told my parents to look into term life insurance because they are insistent on keeping 1 policy each. I even walked through an online quote with them and showed them that they could save hundreds of dollars each month by switching to a comparable term policy, even at their age \(52&amp;65\) \- but they refuse to surrender all the policies at this time.

financialindependence,[Discussion] Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2017,"*Attn:* Analysis for /r/financialindependence


**[Report](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2017-report-economic-well-being-us-households-201805.pdf)**


**Summary:**


Yesterday the Federal Reserve released its 2018 rendition of the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households. 


*The Good:* 


&gt;In many ways, the latest findings underscore the overall economic recovery and expansion over the five years of the survey. Not surprisingly, the improvement in individuals’ own assessment of their finances largely parallels other measures, such as the falling national unemployment rate.


&gt;In 2017, more people say they are managing okay financially and would be able to handle a small, unexpected expense than in previous years since at least 2013.


*The Bad:*


&gt; Disparities in economic well-being and outcomes are common among minorities, those with less education, and those living in lower-income neighborhoods.


&gt;Small emergency expenses would still challenge a troubling number of households, and the opioid crisis appears to have touched many families.


&gt;Individuals also point to financial struggles across a lifetime—from repaying college loans to managing retirement savings.

---

**Highlights Pertaining to /r/financialindependence:**


(1) *Retirement*


(a) *Retirement Savings*

&gt;Less than two-fifths of non-retired adults think their retirement savings plan is on track, whereas over two-fifths think it is not on track and about one-fifth are not sure. In fact, **one-quarter of the non-retired indicate that they have no retirement savings or pen- sion whatsoever.**

&gt;Among those who do have retirement savings, a defined contribution plan, such as a 401(k) or 403(b) plan, is most common. Over half of non- retirees have money in this form. These accounts are more than twice as frequent as traditional defined benefit pension plans, which are held by 26 percent of non-retirees.

&gt;Older adults are more likely to have retirement savings and to view their savings as on track than younger adults. Nevertheless, even among non-retirees in their 50s and 60s, **one in eight lacks any retirement savings and less than half think their retirement savings are on track.**

&gt;**Among young adults under age 30, people typically believe that their savings are on track if they have at least $10,000 set aside for retirement. The amount of savings needed for a majority to think they are on track increases as people near retirement, rising to at least $100,000 of retirement savings among those age 40 and older. Approximately 9 in 10 people with at least $500,000 of retirement savings think that they are on track, regardless of their age.**

&gt;Some people withdraw money from their retirement accounts early for purposes other than retirement, despite the fact that they may incur a substantial tax penalty. Overall, 5 percent of non-retirees have borrowed money from their retirement accounts in the past year, 4 percent have permanently withdrawn funds, and 1 percent have done both. Those who have withdrawn early are less likely to view their retirement savings as on track than those who have not—27 percent versus 39 percent.


(b) *Reasons for Retirement*


&gt;Half of retirees in 2017 retired before age 62, and an additional one-fourth retired between the ages of 62 and 64. [This discussion of current retirees considers everyone who reports that they are currently retired, even if they also indicate that they still are working in some capacity. Sixteen percent of retirees indicate that they are still working either for themselves or for someone else. Analysis of the ages retired excludes those who don’t know.]


&gt;Average retirement ages differ by race and ethnicity, with black and Hispanic retirees more likely to have retired before age 62 (58 percent and 55 percent, respectively) than white retirees
(48 percent).


&gt;In choosing when to retire, a desire to do other things than work or to spend time with family were the most common factors. In addition, two-fifths of retirements before age 62 and one-third between ages 62 and 64 involved poor health as a contributing factor. About one-fourth of those who retired before age 65 said the lack of available work contributed to their decision.


&gt;For **income in retirement**, 86 percent of retirees in 2017 receive Social Security benefits. Fifty-six percent draw on a defined benefit pension, and 58 percent use savings from an IRA, 401(k), or other defined contribution plan. The types of retirement savings for current retirees differs substantially from non-retirees, for whom defined contribution plans are much more common than defined benefit pensions.


(2) *Income*


&gt;Over one-quarter of adults had less than $25,000 of family income during 2017, and nearly two-fifths had less than $40,000.


&gt;Wages and salaries are the most common source of family income; nearly 70 percent of adults and their spouse or partner received wage income during 2017.


&gt;Over 3 in 10 received some income from self-employment or gig work.


&gt;Sources of non-wage income vary with age. Among young adults (ages 18 to 29), gig work was the most common source of non-wage income. Among older people, income from gig work is less prevalent, while interest, dividend, and rental income is more com- mon. Additionally, over three-quarters of adults age 60 and older received Social Security or pension income.


&gt;Approximately 1 in 10 adults receive some form of financial support from someone living outside of their home. Nearly one-quarter of young adults received such support during 2017. Among young adults with incomes under $40,000, over one-third receive some support from outside their home. Conversely, older adults are more likely to provide financial support to individuals outside their home peaking at 23 percent of adults in their 50s.


&gt;This support is mainly between parents and adult children. Parents were among the providers for just over 6 in 10 support recipients, including 8 in 10 of those under age 30. Additionally, adult children are support providers for over half of people over age 60 who are receiving some assistance.


&gt;Overall in 2017, 31 percent of all adults engaged in gig work in the month before the survey, up slightly from 28 percent in 2016. This increase was predomi- nantly due to an increase in participation in offline activities—which rose to 20 percent in 2017 from 17 percent in 2016. Younger individuals are more likely to perform gig work: 43 percent of those ages 25 to 34 versus 18 percent of those age 65 or older. The typical person working in the gig economy spends five hours per month on these activities.


&gt;Gig work is typically a modest share of family income. For over three-fourths of gig workers, these activities account for 10 percent or less of their family income. This work comprises over half of family income for only 5 percent of gig workers. Despite the modest share of family income, many gig workers (45 percent) say that this income is at least somewhat important, including 15 percent who say it is very important.


(3) **Other Topics of Note**


+ Economic Well-Being 


&gt;When asked about their finances, 74 percent of adults said they were either doing okay or living comfortably in 2017—over 10 percentage points more than in the first survey in 2013.


+ Employment (See Gig notes under Income in ""Highlights"")


+ Dealing with Unexpected Expenses


&gt;Four in 10 adults, if faced with an unexpected expense of $400, would either not be able to cover it or would cover it by selling something or borrowing money. This is an improvement from half of adults in 2013 being ill-prepared for such an expense.


+ Banking and Credit


&gt;Among those with a credit card, about half always or almost always paid their bill in full each month, while 2 in 10 did so some of the time and slightly over one-fourth carried a balance most of the time. Twenty-eight percent of those with a credit card paid only the minimum on their bill at least some of the time.


&gt;Slightly over 7 in 10 adults keep track of their spending and over half follow a budget or spend- ing plan. Also common is the use of technology to track or automate financial management. For example, 62 percent of adults use auto-pay for some bills; 52 percent get electronic account alerts; and 46 percent use automatic saving.


+ Housing and Neighborhoods


&gt;For housing, 66 percent of adults own a home, 25 percent rent, and 8 percent have some other arrangement. Renters, on average, are younger and have lower incomes than homeowners. Among those with family incomes under $40,000, less than half of people own their home.


&gt;The median monthly rent is between $750 and $1,000, and among low-income renters whose income is below $40,000 per year, the median monthly rent is between $500 and $750.


&gt;Reflecting low rates of geographic mobility, nearly half of adults live within 10 miles of where they went to high school.


+ Higher Education


&gt; Economic well-being rises with education. Associate degree holders are somewhat more likely to be at least doing okay financially than those with some college or less, although a larger increase is associated with a completion of a bachelor’s degree.


+ Student Loans


&gt;The typical amount of education debt in 2017 among those with any outstanding was between $20,000 and $25,000.


&gt; Almost 3 in 10 adults with outstanding education debt are not currently required to make payments on their loans. Such deferments are common for those still in college. Of those who are making payments, the typical monthly payment is between $200 and $300 per month.

solar,How to determine if solar is right for me,"I'm interested in solar.  And i can kind of figure out these numbers, but i don't know how to make sense of them...
  
Currently there is the 30% tax credit from the Federal Gov't (expiring next year?).    
My state (NC) does not offer anything.    
My power company (Duke Energy) JUST began offering a new rebate of $0.60 per watt [10KW = $6,000, 8KW = $4,800].
    
To do this, i'd have to use my HELOC at a 4.5% interest rate.   
I do not have any savings to put towards this.
  
I've run some basic numbers... but without actual install costs - I cant know the exact number.  
I'm assuming an average cost of about 23k for an 8KW system. (Based on an article i found about NC)
   
The maths...
23k loan.  250/mo repayment
assuming I pay the $6900 + $4800 = $11,700 off in march when I file taxes (or sooner?) and continue making 250/mo payments afterwards... Total interest paid over the life of the loan: $2,036  
  
23,000 - 11,700 + 2,036 = $13,336
So this means I pay $13,336 for the solar system.
And a 8KW system will produce ~1000 kwh roughly
  
Then I know what I use for electric:
  
Bill Date|Electric Usage (kWh)
:--|:--
5/2/2018|833 
4/3/2018|1002 
3/2/2018|908 
2/2/2018|1362 
1/3/2018|1445
12/1/2017|724 
11/1/2017|755 
10/3/2017|1226 
9/5/2017|1926 
8/2/2017|1572 
7/5/2017|1948
6/2/2017|1314
5/3/2017|1080 
   
Which means my electrical is basically free for most months with too much on some others.  My electric rate is $0.093457 per KWh.  so at 1000kwh i'm looking at a savings of roughly $93.46/mo.
  
So if I assume a full savings of $93.46 x12 months for $1,122
(Last year i paid $1,514.75 for 12 months of electricity.)
  
$13,336 / $1,122 = 11.88
Does this mean that the Solar system pays for itself in 12 years?  I'm not really a math guy. and getting my head around this is proving difficult.  But if that number is right, it seems like a bad investment.  Anyone else have their thoughts on this?",energy

I am a 19 year old student who really needs some advice. So basically I am a semester away from graduating a 2 year community college and about to go to a full time university to get my bachelors or masters in accounting or some other business major. I am a full time student who also work part time, but do not have a lot of money. Next semester's cost is going to be double my semester at this community college so im going to have to take out loans. I am getting about 6k in financial aid \( i think\), but will still have around 7 k left to pay. The government said they would grant me around 2k in subsidized loans and 1k in unsubsidized, but im not even sure if i should take both of these. \( i know sub has no interest i think so i will take the one with no interest but what about other one?\)

Regardless, I dont know if I should take out loans from Sallie Mae, mygreatlakes, student[loans.gov](https://loans.gov/), wells fargo, TD bank, or whatever the f\*\*\*. I am not going to be able to pay them back and work while i go to school, so im hoping wherever i take them from doesn't accumulate interest until after i graduate, and doesn't have too high of an interest rate. I will hopefully pay them off when i graduate and get a job, regardless of the scary amount it will probably be by then.

If someone sees this who knows remotely where to start when trying to figure out where to take loans from please help.

I can only deduct 10k of property and income taxes, so even with 10k in mortgage interest I will not exceed the standard deduction (assuming no other deductions).. so it would be better to pay off the mortgage as I would not be able to take advantage of the mortgage deduction (and i would save that 10k in interest over a year).  Is that a correct line of reasoning?

btc,"Miners are considering project funding enforced by orphaning, according to this article (analysis inside)","I have seen many say the proposal discussed by miners for funding development and other projects with 1 to 10% of the block reward will be optional for BCH miners, and that ""no one is saying they will orphan those who don't pay.""

However, [this article](http://archive.is/L7oZ7) (live article, archived due to reddit filter) suggests that miners were assuming it would indeed be so:

&gt;Points of contention included just what percentage of the block reward should be used, **and whether any at all would be a disincentive for miners to stay with BCH, driving them back to BTC**. Suggestions were 5 to 10 percent, however Ver pointed out that as little as 1 percent could provide a healthy boost.

If it weren't enforced with orphaning, it wouldn't drive any miners away, since they could simply choose not to pay. This article implies the point of contention is how much to require BCH miners to pay, not whether to.


If miners are seriously considering requiring anyone who wants to mine BCH to pay 1-10% of the reward to fund proposals, especially without demonstrating any awareness of how deep and potentially onerous such a change is, that is quite concerning. Both at the level of sophistication of miners and at the thought that this might actually happen in a ""gotta keep up with Dash, Neo, etc."" impulse or the familiar politician-style ""things need funding, we must *do something* and this is something therefore we must do this"" false syllogism.


In  the simplest and fairest terms I'd describe any such ""project funding enforced by orphaning"" proposal as a mechanism where miners vote to invest some of BCH's hashpower security into projects in hopes of gaining greater hashpower security later (through faster adoption and the resulting price increase).

Besides the obvious short-term security hit (less block reward on offer) and miner centralization (marginal miners pushed out) effects,* which are two sore spots for BCH already, when you get into the nuts and bolts there is a rat's nest of administrative issues. It's analogous to venture capital investment by hashpower voting, a kind of DAO, with extremely cumbersome administration.

*unless the news pushes up the price enough to compensate (short term and long term), but that's part and parcel with the investment gamble; it could succeed short term purely for image reasons, sure, but if ""purely"" that means it was in fact counterproductive as a funding program and that the market should eventually come to its senses and punish BCH for it

Yes hashpower voting is superior to democratic voting, and yes miners have skin in the game and thus motivation to make good choices, but that doesn't remove the ""voting with other people's money"" effect** nor does it make mining companies into investing geniuses (at least until the industry matures and reliable analysts and/or prediction markets exist).

What are the odds a panel of non-VCs, some of which are obligated to pay even if they disagree, pick winning bets? Would you buy such a fund?

**even with a conservative 75% threshold, up to 25% pay even if they think the investment is negative expected return for them

Finally, the devil is in the details. The inevitable clunkiness of such a voting scheme creates a fundamental trade-off between simplicity and accountability. For example, what if a project is funded and progress turns out to be slower than miners anticipated, it goes in a different direction than miners hoped, or there is worry about custodial malfeasance? The options to deal with that seem to be limited to these:

1) Very detailed rules about fund usage and conditions for revocation, such as by smart contract (pitfall: boondoggle by rigidity, custodians handcuffed by rules that fail to account for unforeseen contingencies, tying up a lot money or forcing it into meaningless avenues - and the opportunists to pop up to capitalize on that malinvestment)

2) Another vote each time a concern arises (pitfall: 75% cutoff very hard to reach - or if 50% then the ""voting with other people's money"" factor doubles from 25% to 50%, too annoying for miners to bother with the research and voting on every issue, language barrier, each miner must have reps go meet people in person to even get close to VC-level of success if dealing with potential malfeasance, incompetence, or just plain disagreements about project vision - boondoggle by administrative nightmare)

3) Let it ride, keep money spigots on and hope for the best (pitfall: boondoggle by even more waste and even less connection with miner wishes; projects could require quarterly re-vote, but that's yet more overhead, moving the problem back toward (2))

All in all, it seems obvious to me that

Minimal administrative complexity to have much chance of net benefit &gt; Maximal administrative complexity that is manageable in an inevitably clunky blockchain-based voting scheme

and it does need to be a net benefit (positive expected return), or else it harms BCH price and security even if it makes certain people happier (such as devs who deserve funding).

This situation is classic Bastiat. [The seen and the unseen.](http://steshaw.org/economics-in-one-lesson/chap01p1.html). We see the projects funded, the well-deserving devs finally getting paid to go full-time, the increased adoption through marketing in some spheres, and maybe even price spikes (and therefore security increases) that seem to correlate with those things, but what we *don't* see is whether security would have been higher or lower in the absence of the program (if an attack happens, it's too late).

For all we know, the program was tremendously wasteful and resulted in nearly all of the X% investment being unproductive. Something inevitably gets done and its backers inevitably try to paint it as a big success. ""Look at that beautiful bridge built, speeding transport, a definite benefit!"" This is of course the refrain of every boondoggle.

The refrain to ""look at that nice app that was made and that new smart contract function that was enabled and that merchant marketing that succeeded"" is no less misleading. Nice things can be built by sacrificing Bitcoin's security, but that doesn't make the sacrifice worth it. The analysis is always incomplete until we know whether the security is higher thanks to the project on net, after paying the initial price in security. The fact that there is a strong tendency to assume so, despite there being no reason to, is exactly why such proposals are dangerously tempting.

Naturally the fallacy is obvious when considering cash investment: the fact that you get *some* of your money back is never mistaken as success. The mere fact that it would be better if a project had more money (almost always true!) does not even come close to implying it is an investment that will have a net positive effect to invest current hashpower security into it.

I think a better solution, if miners don't want to just individually and directly donate to or hire/contract people for their own needs,*** would be mining industry consortium(s) whose membership dues go toward projects. Miners may join thanks to typical benefits such industry groups provide: a seat at the table in negotiating standards and best practices, a structured venue for coordination and information-sharing, etc. Another non-orphaning option would be to do a blockchain-based scheme where only the miners who want to join in the funding program do. It has some of the downsides mentioned above but avoids several of the worst ones.


***it seems to me, for devs seeking funding, that direct hiring or contracting is by far the most likely way they are going to get pro-level (multi-6-figure) salaries paid by miners. Think of the overhead involved with vetting, hiring, monitoring, and - if needed - firing a $200-500k/year dev through blockchain voting by the whole group of miners in a way to ensure net benefit. It doesn't seem remotely realistic to me. Some will say all that could be outsourced to a trusted custodian, but that involves even greater hazards (millions entrusted to one person, or if a committee more bloat and overhead) and potential for waste and miners regretting the decision because the custodian doesn't do quite what miners intended (hires/fires for reasons they may not understand or agree with, seems like they might be playing favorites with friends, etc.). And note that there would likely be a crowding out effect, where miners already pay into the voted funds pool so are less likely to shell out additional money to hire/contract or donate to their favorite devs. I want to see more devs getting paid more, but please consider that a scheme enforced by orphaning is unlikely to be the best way to maximize dev pay (even if the goal were to maximize dev pay at all costs).",cryptocurrency

I am a 18yr old with a full time job.,"Hey guys so I just recently got a full time job and opened up my first own bank account. I was talking to my banker at the time and she was saying that it was probably not in my best interest to open up a card immediately and that I should go read up a little bit about from Federal credit bureau ( I could just be making that title up but it was something along the lines of a federal agency tasked with credit) and make a informed decision. She was also saying that I should wait a while and that after having a savings/checking account with chase for a little while, chase itself would offer me a preapproved card. I have  been on my moms credit card line for a couple years now and so I do think that I have some credit history but that's about it. I am not sure if I were to get a credit card which ones that I could/should apply to. My banker suggested that I should get a card from a big box store like Walmart, Target, etc. to start building my credit up as those aren't as risky and have low limits so that I can ease myself into the life of credit cards. I know I get two yearly free credit checks but I think that I would rather hold off on those and not waste them... Would now be a good time to use them ? 

I also want to buy a used car mainly for going out some where to take a break from everything on the weekend as I leave my house at 7 am and come at 6 pm just to start grinding on college homework. I know that a lot of others have it much worse but I still feel miserable and I don't think that is particularly healthy for me. Essentially I am trying to figure out is do I go against the judgement of  my banker and apply for the credit card? I make about 16.25/hr now but later on in a couple months I should be making closer to 20/hr when I go from temp to actual employee. I will be only buying the car when I transition from temp to full time so that I know I can fully afford it but I would like to just start building up my credit now so that I can get a loan for the car.

Thank you so much for your guys help I am still learning a lot about adulting and so on so if you want to throw in any extra information about credit or credit cards or anything relative to what I am trying to figure out I would really appreciate it!

Edit: So the biggest thing that I am hearing is to not get a loan for the car but I should have mentioned it earlier and I didn't. I will have paid off almost all of the car and I am taking the loan out for the sake of taking out a loan to get it on my credit report. My dad who has  very good credit is cosigning on it so it shouldn't have very high interest. The main reason I am doing this is because I am a junior in college and I am planning to move out in about 7 months so that my parents can retire away from the city where we live now. I really wanted to get a average or good credit score by then so that I can get a lower rent on my apartment and get cashback or rewards of any kind on credit cards because I have to spend the money I might as well get something back for it.

personalfinance,Should I take private student loan with variable or fixed interest rate?,"Scenario: found out I can’t get government student loans for the summer and can’t pay for this class + rent without any loans, so I’m looking to get a private loan.

Pretty much, I can take a 3,000 loan with payment deferred until a few months after I graduate (graduating in December) and can choose between a variable interest rate of 8.1% based on the LIBOR index or a fixed interest rate of about 10%. The variable interest rate can rise as high as 25%. 

Now I realize how much money I can save with 8% interest as opposed to 10%, but I’m worried that the rate could go up substantially and have me paying a ton more than the 10%. Is it risky to take the variable rate since it might go up, or is that considered unlikely historically and/or at this current time? Any other input would be appreciated.

**TLDR:** We believe the future of messaging is decentralized and that anyone who’s worked hard to build a following should be able to create, earn, and transact freely, without having to worry about privacy, regulation, censorship or demonetization. 


**What does it do?**

	•	It makes it dead easy for content creators to earn paid direct messages via Ether from their supporters 

	•	Makes it easy for supporters to message their favorite content creators with ETH  


**How it does work?**

If you’re a content creator, you can start earning Ether quickly and securely in three simple steps:

	* Pair an Ethereum wallet address to a messenger like Telegram 

	* Sign &amp; verify your wallet address using MetaMask 

	* Once you’re signed up, you’ll get a custom address link you can paste anywhere on the web, enabling anyone with an Ether wallet and MetaMask to send you ETH and a short note in just three clicks.  

It’s that easy. 


**What’s the catch?** 

None. No hidden fees, no middleman, no time wasted. Supporters determine the amount a creator gets paid, and the creator keeps 100&amp;#37;, every single time. 


**Why are we doing this?**

We believe the future of messaging is decentralized — content creators build entire businesses around the audiences they engage with across networks like Twitch, YouTube, Reddit and so many more, but there’s growing fears surrounding data, demonetization, censorship and discovery.

Our mission is to release the first truly decentralized messenger, and Crypto DM is a prototype in motion of the technology that will power it.

So why would people be OK with the Justice Department now trying to get their hands into it?,cryptocurrency
economy,"WARNING: if you like Trump, do not support him based on the current state of the economy.","I sympathize with Trump. But the truth is the US economy is heading to a crisis. Many ""Austrian"" economists \(Austrian School of Economics\) have been predicting for a long time. Hard to summarize, but it's something like this: For decades the FED have been lowering interest rates. And since the creation of new money under the actual system depends on taking credit \(yes: every dollar bill is also a debt\) that lower interest rate fueled consumer spending and bubbles everywhere, and of course... debt \- individuals, corporations and the government; everybody is heavily indebted now. That was only possible because the US exacerbated the dollar's status as world's reserve currency. But at some point, sooner than later, this will change, because in order to roll the record debts we have now, interest rates must remain \(and are been kept\) artificially low. That's only possible by a mechanism that in the end of the day means printing more dollars \(adding more debt to a debt problem\). Eventually, the dollar value will be compromised. What happened in 1980 and 2008? The FED raised interest rates to restore confidence in the dollar, in the system itself. Now they simply don't have where to cut. And, even more serious, the whole US economy \(like many others in the Werstern world\) rely on debt to function and on the purchasing power of the dollar. Notice that the ""world reserve currency"" status ended up harming the american manufacturing sector, and you may easily realize how serious this is. The end result will be a monetary, economic, financial and social collapse much greater than the last one, because the numbers are much greater now.

Blame the FED and all presidents who did nothing to stop that \(Clinton, Bush, Obama and now Trump, although in a lesser extent\); this problem was created many decades ago. There's nothing Trump could do except to stop the printing. But that would bring the crisis, and the political cost to do it is too big. Anyway, it's coming. I doubt Trump will be able to pass this problem to his successor.

I'm writing this because if that happens under Trump administration \(likely\), capitalism and conservatives will be blamed, although this is the result of government intervention \(through the Fed\) in the economy. Absolutly nothing to do with a real free market. But we know how political propaganda works.",finance
personalfinance,How do I effectively use an extra $1050 towards my debt?,"When I was in school, I never claimed the American Opportunity Tax Credits. I filled out the 1040X form in late January and sent it into the IRS, and low and behold, I got some money back. 

I have an Amazon Credit Card, at $650/700 with a higher interest rate than the Wells Fargo Student Credit card at $786/800. I think I've got to the point now where I understand the first step is paying down credit cards from highest interest to lowest, then paying down loans from highest interest to lowest. 
Should I pay off the Amazon card entirely, and put the rest towards the Wells Fargo card? Should I save any portion of it? Considering keeping a small amount for myself, should that even be a thought in my mind, or should I forget about that entirely.

My credit score is in the 620-640 range, probably due to having 2 credit cards close to the max. Would it be smarter to pay $500 to each?

Edit:

Thanks guys, here's what I think I'm going to end up doing. I'm taking your advice about the emergency fund, in all honesty, I wasn't planning on using it towards that, so I'm going halfway. I'll put $400 in the fund to get it to $500, put $200 on each credit card as to get it away from the credit limit so my credit score stops going down, and then keep the last $200 for personal use, as I know I'll need it for moving expenses. I know, this isn't the absolute 100% most financially sound plan, as step one to controlling my finances is starting that emergency fund, but I think this is a healthy mix of the big 3 - unplanned expenses, emergency fund, and credit cards. If this is an ABSOLUTELY horrible idea, feel free to let me know! I'm always open to constructive criticism.",finance

Hello,

We're possibly going to be buying a new car. We currently have a 2010 Honda Fit we love! but after installing the infant car seat we discovered that my 6'1"" husband will no longer fit comfortably nor safely in the passenger seat. We're still entertaining the idea of him being in the back when I'm driving since I'm only 5'0. 

We have 1 year left of payments on the Fit of roughly 4000$. So trade-in should should cover most, if not all of the balance. My current interest rate is quite high as at the time I was still re-establishing my credit. My husband has only been in Canada 3 years and not really established credit other than paying his cell phone bill. We're looking at 15,000$ and under for the purchase.

So here are my questions should we choose to purchase:

Should I still add my husband to the finance agreement or will it hurt the interest rate? 

Would a strong co-signer help the interest rate?

I'm assuming still buying used is the better option? We would most likely go with a 2014-2015 model.

Bonus:
We're thinking of a Honda civic sedan, if anyone tall has experience with this car would it be suitable for tall husband and infant car seat?

So lets say for example to keep it easy: You enter with a $100,000 in student loans.  Lets say a 6% interest rate. So lets say your paying $1000/year and would have $5000 interest unpaid.  (I think first 3 years are exempt).  So I know there is the 10% cap.  So year 1 balance would grow to $105,000; Year 2 the unpaid interest would be $5300.  SO does the cap come into pay with capping the capitalized interest at 10 or $110,000?  So if I am thinking about this correctly, year 3 your total interest $6600 (less $1000 your paying) and every year after would be the same since it is capped at $110,000?  So at the end your forgiveness would be $110,000 plus in this example about 18 years of $5600 (the $6600 minus $1000 paid).  Am I on track here?  I know the figures are rounded and simplified a little but I am going to try and create a spreadsheet to help them with different scenarios.

btc,AsicBoost and the strange case of CVE-2017-9230,"# About CVEs

In the public interest of tracking and remedying cybersecurity
vulnerabilities quickly, a public database was created in 2000:
the CVE List [1].

CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures.
Its database records, known as CVEs, track and record publicly known
cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Each recorded vulnerability has a unique
ID and lifecycle where it follows certain states.


# The AsicBoost controversy

In April 2017, Greg Maxwell published an email [2] on the bitcoin-dev
mailing list which described AsicBoost - a patented optimization to
the algorithm used in Bitcoin mining - as an attack on the Bitcoin
protocol.

There was much contention [3] about whether AsicBoost constituted some kind
of harmful exploit, or whether it was merely a technological innovation
which enabled more efficient mining hardware (ASICs).

There were allegations, widely reported in media, that the patent served
the interest of Bitmain [4]. The purported benefits of exploiting this
patent as alleged by Core developers were contemporaneously disputed by other miners [5].


# CVE-2017-9230 raised against AsicBoost

On 18 May 2017, Cameron Garnham posted to the bitcoin-dev list [6], urging for
getting a CVE assigned to the perceived vulnerability.

On 24 May 2017, this CVE was created as CVE-2017-9230 [7]. It was simultaneously
published under Bugtraq ID 'BID 98657' at [8].

The justification in the CVE stated that the AsicBoost method

&gt; 'violates the security assumptions of (1) the choice of input, outside
&gt; of the dedicated nonce area, fed into the Proof-of-Work function should
&gt; not change its difficulty to evaluate and (2) every Proof-of-Work
&gt; function execution should be independent.'

It seemed a plausible enough reasoning for the CVE to be assigned. It was
entered in the list of Bitcoin-related CVE's at [9]. Detailed information
on this particular CVE is still missing/incomplete on the wiki page,
a year after the CVE was raised.


# What happened since the CVE was raised

If you've followed along, you've learned that the CVE was raised to
counter the exploitation of the AsicBoost method by miners.

Since then, however, a Core developer, BtcDrak, has been involved in the
founding of a mining company, Halong Mining. Several online sources state
his (part?) ownership of this company.

BtcDrak has put forward a proposal [10] which would enable the use of
AsicBoost within the Bitcoin Core software (the dominant client software
on the BTC network).

This proposal appears to directly contradict the CVE claims of how
AsicBoost violates ""security assumptions"" of Bitcoin, and indeed does
not address how it mitigates them, nor is CVE-2017-9230 referenced in
any of its related documentation.

While the proposal's specification [11] and implementation [12] have not
yet been formally accepted, the situation is that Halong has shipped
mining equipment which is now actively employing AsicBoost [13,14] on
the Bitcoin (BTC) network. There is even a website showing the blocks
where AsicBoost was used [15].


# Conflict of interest

There a clear conflict of interest in the actions of the Core
developer BtcDrak. His actions as a Core developer appear to be
furthering his company's interests and competitive
advantage in the mining industry by exploiting a vulnerability of which
he must have been keenly aware, having participated on the same
bitcoin-dev mailing list where it was discussed.

The CVE was vociferously used to paint Bitmain as culpable for delaying
Segwit (Bitmain was accused of using AsicBoost and blocking Segwit
activation for their own profit motive - claims that
Bitmain has publicly denied strongly and which were never substantiated).

One might have expected a similar outcry against Halong's *proven* and
*announced* use of AsicBoost, but the parties that had previously
condemned Bitmain remained mostly silent. Only an anonymous
non-developer, Cobra-Bitcoin, co-owner of the bitcoin.org domain,
spoke out on the Github pull request in [11], and Core developer Luke-jr
spoke out against the use of the proposal on the Bitcoin network while
consensus had not been reached on it [16].

Subsequent discussion on the bitcoin-dev list on this topic since March
has been minimal and only concerned with technicalities of stratum
protocol changes.


# The bigger elephant in the room

It seems logical that either AsicBoost constitutes an exploitable
weakness, and thus merits a CVE and measures taken to prevent its use
on the Bitcoin network entirely.

Or it is not a problem and the CVE should be invalidated.

The Bitcoin Core project should use its consensus processes to
arrive at a coherent decision.

# Other problems raised by the use of overt AsicBoost

The Halong implementation uses version rolling of the `nversion` bits
of the header. It reserves a subset of those bits for overt AsicBoost.

These bits are no longer available to BIP9, but there was no update
of BIP9 proposed to address this impact.

This is a question of sensible procedures being followed (or not).
The author did not find any review comment mentioning the lack of BIP9
specification update, which suggest a lack of thorough review on a
proposal which dates back several months.

A minor issue is that the Core implementation warns when a
certain proportion of unrecognized version bits are detected.
This behavior can be triggered by the AsicBoost method used on the
network.

personalfinance,Getting a personal loan at my credit union,"I had a few financial emergencies and stupidly resorted to two payday loan type places. High interest rates and monthly payments that don’t really get you anywhere until the interest is paid down. I have pretty bad credit but have paid the loans on time every time. They come out automatically. What are the chances of going to my credit union and presenting the pay off amount for both loans, record of paying them on time and records of my pay stubs and being approved for a loan to pay them off completely with a lower interest rate and monthly payment? Has anyone tried to do this before?

As suggested here are the exact details of my predicament. I’m new to reddit and appreciate the tips!

Each check is $1245 take home after taxes/health ins every two weeks. I make roughly $100 a month in commission paid once a month. The payoff amount for the two loans are $3200 and $1850. I pay $301 ($186/$115) each paycheck for the loans. So $600 a month for the next 3 years. After rent and bills I know I have every month I’m left with $100 or so each check for groceries, supplies, etc. I have no savings and nothing to show since they don’t report to credit bureau. The bank offered rates as low as 7%. With my terrible credit I know it won’t be that low but even if I pay $500 a month it’s saving money and I know I’m capable of doing it",finance

Currently I am a college student who has a work study job. Typically at this work study job I get paid bi-weekly based on the number of hours I had worked in that pay period. However,recently I have not been paid while my co worker has. My manager says she has submitted my time sheets and that won't reply back to me. Earlier this year, she also forgot to submit my time sheet and I wasn't paid for a month, since that amount of money was added on to the next pay period. However, I really need to pay some bills. Any advice will be appreciated. Thanks",finance
personalfinance,"Question about taxes, student loans, and 401k's","So, I started a new position this year that has a salary of $99,000, which now has me solidly in the 24% tax bracket (was in the 22% before, single guy).  In addition, I get a 7% annual bonus, paid out quarterly, and the option of contributing up to 15%, after tax, to an ESPP which is a 15% discount and no holding period.  The ESPP gets better over time, but at the start will be a flat 15% bonus.  I'd estimate that'll have me somewhere around $110k when all is said and done, give or take a bit.


I have about $77k @ 5.25% in private student loans with a minimum monthly payment of $837 a month.  I also have about $139 in federal loan payments but the rates are so low I'm not really considering them and just have them on auto pay.  Not really worth rushing to pay off currently.


Right now I am contributing about 8% to my 401k to get my employer's match.  I'm torn between whether I should max my 401k (increasing my deferral to about 18%) to drop down into the 22% tax bracket, so 2% less in taxes, or if I should stay at 8% and use the ~$600ish extra per month to pay towards the student loans.  My goals are to FIRE, so the compound interest of the 401k could be a big benefit.  My concern is that the interest rate on the student loan isn't exactly low, but it's not insanely high either (I refinanced with SoFi and previously had 9.88%, f**k Sallie Mae and me not thinking right).  Ignoring other expenses, I expect it would take about 3-ish years to pay off the student loans if I were to not max the 401k, and probably 5 if I did.  Rough estimates.  I'm also getting married sometime in Q2 of 2019 (we've got it narrowed to those months but no specific date) which will affect the tax bracket and ability to pay loans as well.  


Regardless of how I do this, I am taking full advantage of the ESPP as I can afford to live with 15% less for 6 months until it pays out and I get the 15% bonus on that money, which will in turn the whole amount will be sent to student loans.


So, hopefully this is descriptive enough, but I can add more if it is needed.  I'm not really sure if the average return of the market, plus the 2% less taxes, makes it better to max my 401k and then pay as much as possible to the student loans, or if I should stay where I'm at and just blast the student loans.  I'll be paying more than the minimum on my student loans either way, I just need some advice on what the best route to take would be.",finance

I've spent enough time at dealerships to know that I hate em'. There always seems to be a catch.

Anyways, I'm approved for $14,100  at an interest of 3.99% over 72 months. If it's anymore then that I have to put a down payment to make up the difference. 

There's a car that I keep coming back to but when I spoke to the rep on the phone they told me they can sort out the finances from their end. I told him I was already pre-approved and that I can work it out with my bank. I told them there was no need for that and I can just get the contract of sell and go to my bank and get the check. The saleman said they may be able to get me a better interest rate. However, if I decided to do it myself I'd need to pay an extra 1000 dollars! Since they wouldn't make much money I guess. One thing that's comforting, is that by law, they're required to give me the same interest rate.

personalfinance,Sitting on Cash After Abandoning Home Purchase Pursuit,"My wife and I have decided to postpone our quest to purchase a house in Los Angeles. The housing market steadily climbing, alongside rising interest rates, has made for a difficult time to buy. Especially when most houses are going for 7-10% over asking and the median price is hovering around $700,000.

Our current situation is fortunate with a low rent payment in an apartment that is plenty big. We're not desperate to purchase a home and end up in a ""house poor"" situation like many otherbuyers seem to be with the interest rates projected to jump several more times in the next 18 months.

**The Situation**:
We're currently sitting on a lot of liquid cash in checking/saving accounts as we were preparing to have it available for a down payment. I'm looking for some guidance on reallocating/investing this money to make better use of it than sitting in a saving account that will net $10 in interest per year. 

* **Income**: Combined income is around $152,000 per year.
* **Rent**: Currently pay $1200 in rent for a 1000 sqft 2/1 apartment that is big enough for us to have our first child in.
* **Liquid Assets**:$123,000
* **Roth IRA**: Currently each have $6,500 in Vanguard Target Retirement Fund. Haven't contributed any money for 2018.
* **Retirement**: We contribute 6/8% of our annual income into a 401K/403B
* **Other Investments**: A few thousand dollars are currently invested in various stocks -- Nvidia, Under Armour, AMD, Valeant, crypto for shits and giggles.

My experience in reading this subreddit and /r/investing is that I should keep 3-6 months of expenses into something highly liquid like a savings account. Beyond that I'm a little weary of what to do with the rest of our cash assets. I'm thinking of opening a money market account with Capital One, currently at 1.6% interest with at least $10,000 deposit.

Would you recommend we each put $5,500 into our Roth IRAs knowing that we may want to take back our contributed funds within the next few years for a house purchase? The other path is to invest in stocks, index funds, ETFs, etc, through a traditional broker/trading.

CryptoCurrency,AsicBoost and the strange case of CVE-2017-9230,"# About CVEs

In the public interest of tracking and remedying cybersecurity
vulnerabilities quickly, a public database was created in 2000:
the CVE List [1].

CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures.
Its database records, known as CVEs, track and record publicly known
cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Each recorded vulnerability has a unique
ID and lifecycle where it follows certain states.


# The AsicBoost controversy

In April 2017, Greg Maxwell published an email [2] on the bitcoin-dev
mailing list which described AsicBoost - a patented optimization to
the algorithm used in Bitcoin mining - as an attack on the Bitcoin
protocol.

There was much contention [3] about whether AsicBoost constituted some kind
of harmful exploit, or whether it was merely a technological innovation
which enabled more efficient mining hardware (ASICs).

There were allegations, widely reported in media, that the patent served
the interest of Bitmain [4]. The purported benefits of exploiting this
patent as alleged by Core developers were contemporaneously disputed by other miners [5].


# CVE-2017-9230 raised against AsicBoost

On 18 May 2017, Cameron Garnham posted to the bitcoin-dev list [6], urging for
getting a CVE assigned to the perceived vulnerability.

On 24 May 2017, this CVE was created as CVE-2017-9230 [7]. It was simultaneously
published under Bugtraq ID 'BID 98657' at [8].

The justification in the CVE stated that the AsicBoost method

&gt; 'violates the security assumptions of (1) the choice of input, outside
&gt; of the dedicated nonce area, fed into the Proof-of-Work function should
&gt; not change its difficulty to evaluate and (2) every Proof-of-Work
&gt; function execution should be independent.'

It seemed a plausible enough reasoning for the CVE to be assigned. It was
entered in the list of Bitcoin-related CVE's at [9]. Detailed information
on this particular CVE is still missing/incomplete on the wiki page,
a year after the CVE was raised.


# What happened since the CVE was raised

If you've followed along, you've learned that the CVE was raised to
counter the exploitation of the AsicBoost method by miners.

Since then, however, a Core developer, BtcDrak, has been involved in the
founding of a mining company, Halong Mining. Several online sources state
his (part?) ownership of this company.

BtcDrak has put forward a proposal [10] which would enable the use of
AsicBoost within the Bitcoin Core software (the dominant client software
on the BTC network).

This proposal appears to directly contradict the CVE claims of how
AsicBoost violates ""security assumptions"" of Bitcoin, and indeed does
not address how it mitigates them, nor is CVE-2017-9230 referenced in
any of its related documentation.

While the proposal's specification [11] and implementation [12] have not
yet been formally accepted, the situation is that Halong has shipped
mining equipment which is now actively employing AsicBoost [13,14] on
the Bitcoin (BTC) network. There is even a website showing the blocks
where AsicBoost was used [15].


# Conflict of interest

There a clear conflict of interest in the actions of the Core
developer BtcDrak. His actions as a Core developer appear to be
furthering his company's interests and competitive
advantage in the mining industry by exploiting a vulnerability of which
he must have been keenly aware, having participated on the same
bitcoin-dev mailing list where it was discussed.

The CVE was vociferously used to paint Bitmain as culpable for delaying
Segwit (Bitmain was accused of using AsicBoost and blocking Segwit
activation for their own profit motive - claims that
Bitmain has publicly denied strongly and which were never substantiated).

One might have expected a similar outcry against Halong's *proven* and
*announced* use of AsicBoost, but the parties that had previously
condemned Bitmain remained mostly silent. Only an anonymous
non-developer, Cobra-Bitcoin, co-owner of the bitcoin.org domain,
spoke out on the Github pull request in [11], and Core developer Luke-jr
spoke out against the use of the proposal on the Bitcoin network while
consensus had not been reached on it [16].

Subsequent discussion on the bitcoin-dev list on this topic since March
has been minimal and only concerned with technicalities of stratum
protocol changes.


# The bigger elephant in the room

It seems logical that either AsicBoost constitutes an exploitable
weakness, and thus merits a CVE and measures taken to prevent its use
on the Bitcoin network entirely.

Or it is not a problem and the CVE should be invalidated.

The Bitcoin Core project should use its consensus processes to
arrive at a coherent decision.

# Other problems raised by the use of overt AsicBoost

The Halong implementation uses version rolling of the `nversion` bits
of the header. It reserves a subset of those bits for overt AsicBoost.

These bits are no longer available to BIP9, but there was no update
of BIP9 proposed to address this impact.

This is a question of sensible procedures being followed (or not).
The author did not find any review comment mentioning the lack of BIP9
specification update, which suggest a lack of thorough review on a
proposal which dates back several months.

A minor issue is that the Core implementation warns when a
certain proportion of unrecognized version bits are detected.
This behavior can be triggered by the AsicBoost method used on the
network.

personalfinance,"(US-NY) Looking at buying a new car, looking to avoid mistakes","I'm currently looking at purchasing a new car, specifically a 2017 Toyota Prius Prime Advanced. 

Me: 24, earn ~$49,000/year and my only debt is student loans which are about $400 per month and rent that is about the same. I have a trade-in (2010 Toyota Matrix with ~98,000 miles) and around $3,000 to use without eating into my emergency savings. My credit is very good, almost hitting 750. 

The car: 2017, new, plug-in hybrid. The cost is around $35,000 before any incentives or trade-in and including taxes and fees. There's a $5,000 incentive on the car, and I would receive at least $4,500 in tax rebates due to the hybrid nature of the car. 

Why I'm looking at it: I want a car that I can drive comfortably for the next 8-10 years, I'm the second owner on my current car and even though it has life left in it I want an upgrade, thus going for the highest end model of the Prime. My commute to work is also fairly short, less than 10 miles on the highway, and so I should be able to get through most days on just electric charge alone. The cost of electricity isn't a factor yet because my rent includes all utilities. 

By my thinking this brings me to:

$35,000 - $5,000 - ~$6,000= $24,000 for a loan. I don't expect to have an issue with this, but I want to get a reality check from people other than my parents (who are terrible at buying cars) and just make sure I'm making the best choice. I'm not too concerned about the depreciation of the vehicle, as long as the APR on the loan is good since I want to drive the car for so long.

One additional factor is that I expect to join the national guard in the next year, which would eliminate my student loans (all federal) and increase my pay somewhat.",finance

economy,"The Fed has sensibly decided to allow inflation to tick up above its 2% target because it has been below it for so long. With other advanced economies having trouble generating inflation, runaway inflation seems like an unlikely risk.","The Fed policy term which best summarizes the Minutes is “symmetric.” The term was used 11 times in the report. The concept of symmetry is that since inflation has been below the 2% goal for so long, as you can see in the above chart, the Fed should allow the inflation to stay above 2% for a similar amount of time. This is a new thought process by the Fed which is always tinkering with policy. 

The Fed can’t come up with rules that are too stringent because there are always new unforeseen situations. Forgetting about the monetary policy aspect and just looking at the logic of the policy, it makes little sense to aggressively hike rates after the inflation rate gets above the target if that’s a long run goal because it has been below the target for so long.

- I have a salary of $73.6/yr and have gotten decent raises each of the 3 years I've been in my current job
- I contribute 8% of my salary to a Roth 401k to receive my max employer match of 4%
- I have about $48.6k remaining in student loans, down from $78k when I started this job.
- Of those loans, $40k was recently refinanced down to 4.38% from their original 6-7% and the rest is 3.5%; my payment is roughly the same as before because I selected a 5-year term whereas my prior loans had 7+ years left.
- I pay ~$1,200/mo in rent, which is not ideal but still close to average; but it's a very nice place with a good landlord and very close to work, so to me that's worth it
- I was looking to buy a home so my housing costs went toward something that had value, but the required downpayment would have eliminated all of my savings and, perhaps more importantly, although I don't have imminent relocation plans it wouldn't be out of the question to move out-of-area in 2-3 years
- I contribute $150/check to savings, for a total of $3,900/yr--I'm working on building this back up because I recently paid off one of the student loans I didn't consolidate (smallish balance, higher rate than the consolidated loan)
- I have a credit card payment financing my laptop; it has a promotional 24-month 0% APR period and I am making payments to pay it off 10 months earlier than that
- I have another credit card used for my day-to-day to build my credit history, which only *very* rarely will hold a balance across the line between months (e.g. at Christmas) and only in small amounts that get paid the next month.
- I currently maintain one checking account for rent and student loans that gets only as much as is needed to pay those, and a second checking account for all other regular expenses, which is usually just electricity and credit cards.
- I originally overpaid my student loans by enough that my refinanced minimum payment total leaves me with an extra $130/mo compared to what I used to pay. Since the interest rate on these loans is dramatically smaller now, I was thinking of investing it instead as it would probably yield more than I'm paying in interest.
- Regarding the previous point, I don't currently have an IRA, and was trying to decide between a Roth IRA and making more regular contributions to the taxable investment account I already have (which could help with a house downpayment down the line)

Car — 225

Car Insurance — 105

Gas — 60

Gym — 46

Cable/Internet — 37

Utilities — 35

Spotify — 10

I do have a monthly budget surplus, which is intentional for my own piece of mind and a cushion just in case I have any unexpected expenses in any one month. The goal is at the end of the month to use any of the remaining surplus towards more loan payments.

[Student Loan Breakdown Spreadsheet](https://imgur.com/a/PFtrPl7)

**Disclaimer**: I know the Parent Plus Loans are not in my name and therefore not technically my responsibility, but my parents took those loans out so I could pursue my goals; I have gotten to where I wanted to go and it is only fair that I pay them back. 

That being said...I’d like to have my parents refinance/consolidate the Parent Plus loans so I can get lower the payments and interest rates and pay them down more aggressively. I’m doing the research leg work for them and they will go through the actually processes. I don’t plan on refinancing the loans in my name due to their lower interest rates and the possibility I return to school \(for free this time\) and reserving the ability to suspend the interest on some of those loans \(unless anyone has any good suggestions on how consolidating/refinancing\).

2. Does the federal government loan provider \(e.g. FedLoan, Nelnet\) offer consolidation/refinancing, which would allow me to keep the benefits the government provides \(forbearance, deferment, etc.\)?
3. If answer to number 2 is YES, then can all the Parent Plus Loans be consolidated together into one loan even though they are split between parents and also held by different lenders?
4. Are the Parent Plus Loans typically refinanced based on joint income or based solely on the primary loan holder’s income?

personalfinance,"Made a poor financial decision, advice?","Heads up I'm aware that I fucked up pretty badly and I am here looking for some advice to deal with this.

I purchased a car that's too expensive for me. I make about 37K gross a year and I signed on for financing a 15k car with a 15 percent interest rate.

I made the mistake of going to the dealership alone, I wasn't intending to buy, and I went through the process not intending to get approved for a car loan with my credit score.

Well, they made it happen and I stupidly didn't back out, and here I am with a 15K auto loan with high interest at 15&amp;#37;, high payments at 379, and my insurance is skyrocketing to nearly 300 dollars for it.

This happened a day and a half ago. They have a 30 day return policy but its for cars of equal or greater value.

I'm aware that this was a stupid decision in hindsight and I'm probably in over my head. I have been working so hard to build my credit and I may have just doomed myself.

I've done through and cut out as many unnecessary expenses as possible, and I'm shopping for new car insurance at lower rates.

I also have a sum of about 2K coming in soon, should I use that and apply it to the principal of the car, or use it as a cushion for the payments?

I may be stuck with this decision. I'm planning to refinance it after 6 months and hopefully lower my costs.

Help?

Edit: they called me back and said the bank made an error in my favor on my contract and they need me to come in and re sign, and the monthly payments would be lower. This sounds really shady. I told them I would come look it over. If I decline signing, could they with hold my original paperwork? If they genuinely fucked up, does that nullify the contract?

Edit 2: there's a possibility that I may rescind the contract. If they're calling me back this soon, it's likely the loan didn't get approved and they didn't tell me at the time of signing that I was approved or not, just the amount and interest rate. I also have not been contacted by my lender yet. Thank you all for the advice and help!",finance

economy,US Justice Department reportedly opens criminal investigation into bitcoin price manipulation,"The U.S. Department of Justice opened a criminal probe into the possibility that traders are manipulating the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, according to a report from FuninUSA.


The investigation surrounds the practice of spoofing — where an investor places orders that are intended to manipulate the price of an instrument — and flooding the market with fake orders, the report said Thursday, FuninUSA cited four unnamed people familiar with the probe.


Federal prosecutors are also working with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, it added.


The price of bitcoin fell on the news to $7,339, and was down more than 6 percent, according to statistics provided by FuninUSA.

investing,Value vs Growth. Time to switch?,"I don't really trade and just put excess cash I have into my existing positions. This, coupled with the general growth in tech, has meant that my overall portfolio is very lopsided towards tech and growth stocks. 

I know that Growth has out performed Value for a while, but I'm wondering if it would be prudent to re-balance? A very large portion of my net worth is in my portfolio heavily weighted to growth-tech. I think my portfolio weighted average P/E is over 40.

The other concern of switching is the chance that value is if some of the value ETF's are just parks for money while interest rates were low to collect div yields. With rates coming up, dividend stocks are comparatively less attractive and there could be potential outflows?

Any thoughts on what would be prudent?",finance
personalfinance,Should I buy a new car?,"Currently, I make ~$2,946 per month. My take-home income after taxes, health insurance, and IRA contributions is ~$2,000. I’m hourly, so sometimes a bit less, sometimes a bit more. 

My current expenses including housing, gas, insurance, gym membership, school, etc are about $900 total. 

My mom has offered to buy from my current car for $3,000 to replace her old ugly dying minivan from the 1700’s. 

My thought was that I can use the $3,000 from my mom as a down payment on a 2018 Subaru Crosstrek or similar vehicle. I have some connections at the dealership, and I am confident I can get a good deal.

Obstacle: My credit is mid-high 600’s, and I expect an atrocious interest rate. I have no real debt except I have an overdraft protection account that I occasionally pull from, and a credit card that I use for gas and other miscellaneous activities. 

I’ve heard before that an option would be getting an auto loan, and then refinancing to get a better rate down the line. I was planning on the 36 month loan anyway, so I don’t know how possible it would be to refinance, but I don’t know jack about this stuff. Thanks US Public Education System!!

I want a new car for a few reasons. I want to be my car’s first and only owner. I can take care of it, and not have to worry about the way a previous driver may have treated it. Let’s be honest, I also want a fancy car. I understand that this is not an investment, or at least not a very good one. This car will lose a considerable amount of its value the second I step foot in it. 

If my math is correct, this should leave me with a surplus of $400 per month for discretionary spending, savings, etc. 

Is this a terrible idea?

You guys have done a really good job of beating this out of me. I needed that, and thank you for your advice.",finance

investing,Natural Gas,"Anyone else here onto this?  Am I crazy or is this an amazing opportunity?
What I am seeing here is that first, the actual production and supply in the USA is starting to be significanlty restrained.  One source of the restraint is the losses that the drillers have experienced during the past ten years on account of oversupply and low prices.  A second is the increasing cost of money as the Federal Reserve gradually increases interest rates.  A third restraint, probably the most critical right now,  is the result of NIMBY's combining forces with environmentalists to block the construction of new pipelines to carry off the new production which is happening in places like the Marcellus, the Utica, and the Permian.  A fourth, subtle, restraint is public predictions by such agencies as the EIA and others, that natural gas production is going to sharply increase over the next few years like it has been increasing in the past ten years.

So what is actually happening, at least for the past 12 months, is that production in the USA is actually flat.
Meanwhile, on the demand side, total demand continues to increase by 5% to 10% per year.  Sabine Pass started LNG exports last year and Cove Point joined in this past season.  New fertilizer production along the Gulf Coast and also in Iowa are sharply increasing demand.  Coal and Nuclear plants continue to be shut down and although the media, and reddit, keep on blaring daily articles about wind and solar panels, its mostly hot air and the real new demand is falling upon natural gas to take up 95% of the slack.  Also, the predictions for warmer and warmer winters have not, in fact, occurred so just as much natural gas has been needed for heat and electricity in the winter.  On the other hand, so many people have relocated to warmer places like Florida or Arizona or Nevada so that new air conditioning demand is off the chain.

So the result is that, in the USA, demand  for natural gas has increased remarkably but supplies have not.  The current inventories of natural gas, always seasonally lowest at this time of year, are the second lowest since I started watching over 10 years ago.

And to top everything, now everyone is trading in index ETF's instead of individual stocks, I am seeing pure natural gas company stocks plummeting with the price of crude oil right now, even though natural gas spot prices are hitting their yearly highs today.

financialindependence,"Made a few mistakes, ready to move to passive index funds. But have questions!","Hi there my very esteemed and respected FIRE friends.  
I am using a throwaway account, I feel sorry about this, but I hope this won't prevent you from giving me your opinions and valuable input in what I'm about to share with you.  
  
First. Who am I?  
29M IT business-owner (have employees), clients in USA, living a VLCOL Eastern European country.  
My business is unpredictable and I'm a natural pessimist, so maybe things are brighter than I make them look like. For the past year, things have been going really well. I am netting around 15k/month after taxes, and living with 3-3,5k. (dollars). Current NW around 250k. My pessimism is that nothing assures me this will continue like this, it may grow, or it may go down steeply.  
  
My mistake was trying to be an active investor. It did work nicely for some time, but with some recent downturns on some very specific market sectors I was overexposed to, my NW has suffered. Not a great deal, but the thing is that there's not much room for it to recover in a reasonable timeframe, and I'd rather get out of this.  
Instead of telling you how my portfolio is ('was' very soon) I'll tell you that I'll find myself with around 250k in liquid dollars. After taxes.  
I don't own property, rent a place that costs me $450/month and is wonderful, and I could buy it outright for about $80k. Considering it seriously atm.  
  
Your opinion about whether to buy the place I live in, is definitely welcome. But my main question goes more towards the thousand-time-mentioned Vanguard index funds.  
I can't access them directly, not being in the US. I could buy them indirectly, although I'm never sure I'm getting exactly what I want, through my brokerage account in a number of Europeans Banks I have accounts in (Germany, Switzerland -which I want to close for being lavishly expensive without any upside than sounding cool-, and there where I live -not where I'm from- which is small, cheap, and I would rather not bring the big bucks here), and pay a brokerage fee that can go from 0,5 - 1,5%. One time. Long term capital gains are not a thing of my greatest concern to be honest, I can channel this through my own and pay 10% tops, or through my offshore company and make that number a round 0.  
  
1) Should I dump a considerable part of my investable assests (it's all I have!) in a S&amp;P500 fund, just as it is, now?  
2) Do you know if ISHARES S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF - USD from Blackrock is analog to the Vanguard S&amp;P500 fund (VTSAX I believe you always refer to).  
3) What do fellow Europeans do about their emergency found? Nothing here gives even a liquid 1% interest rate, and I'd hate to have 20-30k euros sitting around.  
4) Would you buy the property where I live in outright right now? I can't guarantee its appreciation, but it's a guaranteed sizeable return if I stop paying the rent. And I make every month enough to pay the rent for 2 or 3 years. It bothers me more to have to pay the rent every month than how much it costs.  
5) Should I buy any gold in this portfolio, or nah?  
  
Thanks a lot. And I know that I'm not asking anything revolutionary, but I'd love to hear it from you and apply your advice and critics to my own personal scenario.

EDIT: Maybe I should clarify that FI and RE and paramount for me. And this is why I care about how to invest my assets. I currently have a 70-80% SR putting me under a decade for FIRE, however I believe I would continue until I can FIRE with more than current monthly expenses. Having a family in the future will certainly increase my monthly expenses.",finance

personalfinance,Worth Keeping Money in the Bond Market vs Putting Money in a Goldman Savings Account/CD?,"I'm 27 years old and am lucky to have a brokerage account with about $14,000 in bonds (~10% of total investments).

Does it make sense to keep that amount of money in bonds rather than putting it in a high yield CD with Goldman/Marcus at a 2.2% interest rate?

I don't necessarily foresee the need to liquidate my investments any time soon (I have a 25k rainy day fund and another 120k (in addition to the bonds) in a brokerage account that I could liquidate if all hell breaks loose.

personalfinance,When/Should I refinance?(Car),"I just bought a new car, Honda Fit 2019 sport edition. The Honda dealership gave me an interest rate of 5.29% when asked if there wasn't anything I could do to make it go lower he said he couldn't that it was a flat rate that interest rates been going up all around. The thing is I'm always hearing on the radio 0% for the next five years and things like that for other dealerships (which could be a load of cock and bull but I don't know much about it). As far as my credit goes, it's Immaculate. One late payment in the last 9 years, when they pulled it it was a credit score of 786(credit karma tells me it's 745 so I was surprised). So what I'm asking is was he telling me the truth or was he bullshitting me? And if he was telling the truth who to and when should I refinance and based on my credit what % should I look for. I owe 26,000 on the car, I had negative equity on the car I traded in so that's why it's higher than it should be. Any advice is appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Best time to pay off auto loan to increase credit score?,"Hi all, apologies if this has been asked before but I couldn't find a discussion about it when I went through the sidebar or searched the sub. 

I recently bought my first ""certified pre-owned"" car through a dealership (as opposed to buying from craigslist, which is what I did with my first car). I found a car I wanted, figured out a price range within which I could afford said car, and watched dealerships like a hawk until one within my price range came up for sale. 

Now, I made sure I had enough to buy the car outright and still be alright on bills, expenses, and keep an emergency fund. However, I'd like to build more credit since I'm young (21) and have only had one credit card so far. 

I took a 12-month auto loan with a high interest rate thanks to some late credit payments I made back in college (score is around 680), APR on my loan is 18.33. 

I'm wondering what the best time to pay the loan off entirely is. I would prefer not to spend the extra money on interest, but I'm not sure what the best length of time to keep the loan open would be to help my credit improve. I can pay it off at any time but the dealership worker advised leaving it open for six months or so, just paying early and paying more than the minimum, before paying it off entirely around the six month mark.

ethereum,GET YOUR FUNDS OFF OF COINBASE WHILE YOU STILL CAN!,"TLDR:

- Coinbase closed my account for no reason and stole a seven figure sum from me.
- I contacted phone support several times and they told me to ""just wait"".
- I sent several emails to support which were totally ignored.
- My attorney sent a demand letter via FedEx to Coinbase Inc's official address at 548 Market St #23008, San Francisco, CA 94104 and the package was undeliverable because the address is FAKE!
- My attorney is now going to file complaints with all applicable government agencies, starting with the California and Delaware AG. I will also be suing them in civil court. 

Full Story

This is a warning to GET YOUR FUNDS OFF OF COINBASE!

I've been using Coinbase for about a year and a half to buy and sell BTC and ETH. I never had any issues depositing or withdrawing so I became complacent and left a significant(7 figure) sum of USD on the site. I hadn't made any trades since early this year and hadn't logged in for a while. To my surprise on April 24, 2018 I received an email from Coinbase saying my account was closed for violating the terms. I called in to support several times to find out why my account was closed and also to withdraw the balance on my account. I was told to ""just wait"" and it's now been over a month. They refused my requests to speak to a supervisor, or anyone else who could resolve this. I also sent several emails to support that were totally ignored. Given that I wasn't going to just sit idly by while they stole millions from me I asked for contact information for their legal department. They told me the ONLY way they could be reached was by sending a formal letter to 548 Market St #23008, San Francisco, CA 94104. They said the legal team was not reachable by email or phone.

I had my attorney draft a demand letter and send it via FedEx. It turns out the address is FAKE! It is a papered up building with nobody in it. Here is the google maps street view of the building. 

https://www.google.com/maps/place/548+Market+St,+San+Francisco,+CA+94104/@37.7898734,-122.4007445,3a,75y,327.14h,90t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s3DgN8-j3-imrli45Qi2-rw!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x808580627b5ea1d1:0x60fd99496057cf74!2s548+Market+St,+San+Francisco,+CA+94104!3b1!8m2!3d37.7900465!4d-122.4008744!3m4!1s0x808580627b5ea1d1:0x60fd99496057cf74!8m2!3d37.7900465!4d-122.4008744

It is the one in between Portico and Wells Fargo. As you can see, it's a phony address. The representative at FedEx told us that address receives many packages, but they are unable to deliver. You can verify that this is the ""official"" address of Coinbase from their filings with the State of California below.

https://businesssearch.sos.ca.gov/Document/RetrievePDF?Id=03548456-24110401

My attorney called their agent for service of process and they gave the 548 Market Street address and also a phone # of (415) 275-2890. Nobody answered the phone.

Given that Coinbase is totally unreachable, my only recourse is to file with the relevant government agencies. starting with the Attorney General's of California and Delaware. I will also be suing them in civil court to reclaim my stolen funds.

If Coinbase has also stolen from you please contact me and perhaps we can start a class action. From the looks of the complaints to the Better Business Bureau(1.1 rating), it appears they have done this to many people.

Here's the 30 second breakdown:   
  
In college. Graduating with nursing degree in August. Wife is pregnant, giving birth in 20 days. She quits her job June 3, and we lose her income (2/3 of our entire income). Poor credit card choices leading to debt. I need to make it until my new grad pay kicks in with the new career.

*does not include food because i don't have a good estimate of food costs.   

The longer story:  
  
I am graduating in August. I will likely have placement in the new grad training program (pays the same) sometime near Sept 1st. Wife is having baby June 15. Wife quits her job June 3, all income from her stops.   
   
We have 800 in the savings. My credit card balance assumes all costs related to birth, which we've paid most of at this point.   
  
After I finish the new grad program, and get a little experience, I will likely be able to float to another unit to work a 4th day per week. This overtime will be exhausting but it will bring my income to approximately 4760/month. I will use this boost in income to start paying down the debts that have accumulated throughout school.    
   
Wife will stay home with baby for a while, and hates her current job. She does not want to go back. She wants to finish her degree and get a real career. It's her turn to do school.   
  
Basically, I need to use my crypto account and tiny savings account to make it through until around Sept 1st. **Oh yeah, and financial aid is going to profit me about ~1000 this semester.**   
     
   

Basically, I'll have $4500 cash and somewhere between $1200-1700 per month income to safely make it. 
   
    
**My biggest concerns**:  
1. Bored wife, sitting at home all day, will increase her already wasteful spending.   
2. Baby will have unexpected costs.   
3. Wife wont stick to or agree upon a budget plan. Wife has never experienced hardship or known true struggle.   
4. In the event that I don't find placement in a unit, it could extend the interim period.",finance
personalfinance,My check was amended and the banks don't care,"I gave someone a check for 367 dollars. They requested that I make the check out to their mother because they owed them money. I agreed because why not. A few weeks later the check hits my account and clears out 3367 bucks. 


He said he mailed it to his mother (across state lines) but she never got it. The numbers on the check were modified by adding a 3 and a comma before the amount. The written amount was modified by adding a t before the h and an o before the u. Changing three hundred and sixty seven to three thoundred and sixty seven. The image of the check makes it very easy to see that it was fraudulently amended.


 I called Wells Fargo (my bank) who told me that it was obvious fraud and that they would not  give me a provisional credit for the amount, but  they would go after Charles schwab (the bank that accepted the check) for reimbursement.


I told them that they never should have honored such an obviously fraudulent check, but at the least, at the absolute minimum, they were legally only allowed to honor the amount of 3067. Not 3367. Therefore, I was insisting on an immediate provisional credit until the issue was settled. The transaction put my account heavily into overdraft and I was not only incurring overdraft fees by the minute, but I didn't even have money to buy food for my family.


Upon hearing that, they changed their tune and said that there was no fraud. There was only a miscommunication between banks. The number 3367 was not the legal number and irrelevant (hence no fraudulent activity) and the word thoundred was not an attempt to defraud but only messy handwriting. Therefore, the claim was closed out of fraud and sent to collections. Charles schwab is fighting the adjustment so I need to wait 90 to 120 days to maybe possibly get my money back. Even if I do get it back, it will only be the 3000 not the 367 as that is the legal and valid amount of the transaction. I'm at a complete loss. This is over days and days of fighting and yelling. Multiple people in multiple departments. Visiting a branch and sitting in the managers office for hours. This is a fucking nightmare that someone could steal from me, everyone knows, but no one is doing anything.


Points of interest that matter :
I filled an affidavit of fraudulent activity with WF that dead ended. 


I spoke to the mother, she had several items of mail stolen from her mailbox. She filed a report with the usps and the local police.
My local police told me they can't do anything as the crime happened in NY not here.


I spoke to Charles schwab bank and found out that the check was deposited into an account, not cashed. They won't give me any other information obviously.


I spoke to a federal investigator from usps. He volunteered to give me a letter that said I'm a victim of fraudulent activity and have had my check stolen so that I can take it to Wells Fargo and force them to dispute entire thing and speed the process up. Unfortunately, he went back on what he said and wants to wait into Charles schwab responds to the subpoenas to find out whose account the check went into. It will take  a month or two.


I've Facebooked WF. They told me nothing and were no help beyond wasting my time.
I emailed the board of directors and got no response.
I emailed every dept of WF I could find and got nothing.
I submitted multiple forms online the went no where. Not just WF but with the agencies that oversee banking in USA.


It seems that I might need to just roll over and play dead while getting railed up the butt to the tune of 3k. I would love advice and concrete direction other than ""dude, you should totally sue"".


Thanks for reading this wall of mine!

Edit: I'm not lying, I'm not dumb, I don't think it was the mom, the police won't take a report, I love you all for the advice and will follow through with your suggestions. *thank you*


Edit the 2nd: 


Thank you all for your suggestions. The helpful ones I will carry out right away. It seems that there is likely nothing to do but wait and not be dramatic. I will keep trying to push in a polite manner and hope for a quick resolution. I appreciate the time spent on my post. I hope none of you get your money stolen by something large enough to say ""screw  you, you'll  get it back when I decide you'll get it back"".",finance

personalfinance,"I have a considerable amount of debt, but I am about to receive a hefty bonus that will cover most of my debt. Looking for the best way forward.","The good news:

I am in the US Air Force.  I live in a state that does not tax income.  I will get a $76,000 (approx) reenlistment bonus, before taxes, for my job.  The way the payments to me work: I will receive half of the sum up front (approx $38,000 before taxes), then receive the rest in equal annual installments across the term of my enlistment (4 years). 

Now the bad news:

I have around $26,000 in student loan debt at a 6% interest rate (SCRA).  I also have an auto loan on a 2012 Honda Accord.  I owe around $8000 on that, and it’s a 4.75% interest rate loan.  That is all of my debt, minus a lease on another vehicle.

I am comfortable in my budget, and don’t mind making payments on these loans for a few more years. However, this bonus puts me in a position to make some strides towards setting myself up for the future, but I don’t know how to do that.  My basic understanding of personal finance tells me to pay off the debt from highest interest rate to lowest, and hopefully save some.  I don’t pretend to be a smart man though, so I’m looking for help.

personalfinance,Looking for some PF Guidance Post Graduation,"Hey, PersonalFinance\-

Long time lurker, first time poster to this thread.

I just graduated grad school and am looking to get all of my ducks in a row and to eliminate my debt as quickly, and efficiently, as possible. 

Income: 

Mine\- 68K \(this may go up significantly within the next few months based on current talks with my boss but I’m not going to count my chickens before they hatch\).

Monthly income\- 3K paid bi\-weekly \(I put 25&amp;#37; of my pre\-tax dollars into a 401k\)

Monthly Expenses:

Rent\-$1195

Car\- I pay a total of $293 a month, the actual payment is $193 and $21 of that $193 goes to interest. I bought it new 2 years ago.

Spotify\- $15 \(Family plan\)

Auto Insurance\- $78 monthly

Grocery\- $500 a month

Eating out\- $300 a month

Gas \- $50

Savings\-$100 a month

HSA \(post tax\) \- $100 a month

Misc\-Books, clothes, other \(?\) This is certainly a weak spot and I need to fix it. Typically I pay everything else first and whatever is left is fun stuff.

Debt:

Student Loans\-58K \(I owe 22K of that debt, the rest my parents promised to pay and I plan on holding them to that. Currently they are still in agreement that they will\).

Car\-$4600

I excluded some expenses because my wife pays for the other stuff. This is probably a bit of an oversight. As I’m writing this I’m also putting together a combined spreadsheet of our total expenses and incomes.

My questions are as follows.

1\) How am I doing? What are the gaps and what can I do better? 

2\) Am I right to hold my parents to their agreement? I’m a bit frustrated that they haven’t been paying the undergrad loans while I’ve been in grad school but to me that is on them. I’ve been looking at SoFi. Should I refinance my grad loans to keep what is owed separate and to get a better interest rate? My score is 760 and I currently have a 6&amp;#37; rate. Does it make sense to pay it off as fast as I can? The total monthly payments for the entire 58K would be about $650 over the next 10yrs for a total of 75K.

3\) I plan on paying off my car within the next year or so and plan on driving it for the next 5\-7 years. Does it make any sense at all to sell it and put the positive difference to my student loans and by a cheaper car? I don’t think this makes sense but I’m just offering it as an option in case anyone has input.

4\) I have some one\-off investments from my teens/college days that have grown but I’m not using. Should I sell them to pay\-off my loans? If I sold them would I be able to erase the capital gains tax if I put them towards my student loan debt?

We have almost 3 months of emergency savings \(we definitely have 2 months’ worth\).

* Private loan = $37k @ 5.75% (Variable) 
* Federal loan = $20.5k by Jan 2019 @ 6% (Fixed)

**Plan**

We are already planning on reducing spending and paying the interest on the loans each month so it doesn't capitalize.

After that, we have got ~$1.5k in savings per month. We'd need to achieve of +$2k/month in savings to pay for school entirely. But we have some buffer since we have the option to take out a 3rd federal student loan for a maximum of $20.5k next year. Here are some options I am contemplating:

* 1) Minimize 3rd loan amount by putting all of savings towards tuition

OR

* 2) Take out the max for the 3rd loan 

AND 

* A) Put the remainder towards paying off the private loan after the disbursements
* B) Save the minimum amount for tuition ($16.5k) and start putting more down on the private loan immediately
* C) Save the minimum amount for tuition ($16.5k) and start saving more for retirement (above employer matching)
* D) Mixture of A, B, and C",finance
investing,Mutual fund advice,Me and my wife have saved up a little bit money in our savings account and it’s been sitting there without any return (well if you count %0.001 something interest rate as a return yes there’s some return). I’d like to invest at least some of it into mutual funds and I’m aiming for %15-20 a year return if possible. Since I don’t know much about investing I figured mutual funds are the best option for us as they’re less risky than individual stocks and they’re run by professional managers (i know they’re also human beings but at least they know more than I do). I have a fidelity account and I was thinking of investing into one of their tech or otc mutual funds and both are rated 5 stars by morningstar. A little bit of background in terms of our finances: we don’t have any debt except for my wife’s car payment. What do you think?,finance
personalfinance,"Anyone out there have a large savings account, got fed up with their job, and just quit!?","Hi all
I really hate my job.. and I’m tempted to just quit and take a break from working for a few months, recharge and find something else. 

I have about 25k in savings or my “Efund”
And 9k in my Roth IRA. I have no debt. And my housing costs are minimal. (Under $200 per month) 

What do you say reddit? Am I a fool for this? Part of the reason why I saved up was so that I could take time to find a job that I really enjoy, and not just settle for a paycheck because I need to “pay my bills” is my logic flawed? Am I being careless and childish?",finance

We are selling a home and will be walking away with 80k of equity.  We have owned the home for 8 years and believe because of this there wont be any negative tax implications and we can simply move the money into an investment account.

personalfinance,"24, single, living paycheck to paycheck with poor money-saving history and want to improve my situation. Any advice?","Here’s my current situation..

Annual employment income: ~$18,000 combined.
I work two jobs at a hot spring “resort”, one as a “PT” (~35hrs/wk) receptionist/errand-boy making $11.75/hr paid bi-weekly on the 5th &amp; 20th (hours fluctuate with the seasons as the business is tourist and good-weather oriented). In the summer I’m usually working from 7:30am until 9 or 10-midnight as the only person on shift.
The other job is a 1099 always on-call LMT at the same business, paid bi-weekly at 60% commission of $48-$101/session  +tips, generally $20-50/client. I usually see an average of ~$300/pay-period from this job in fall/winter/early spring. In the summer its possible to be pulling in upwards of about $800-1k per paycheck with at least two clients each day. 
As it stands right now, with the formerly stated job,I work 5-6 days/wk with an average of 1 double shift (7:30am - Midnight). The latter job varies wildly from week to week, but I generally perform massage with my return clients on the days I have off from the office and pick more up throughout the week when I have availability. 

In addition, because time is money, I also volunteer my time at the animal shelter in addition to volunteering my time to clean the massage rooms daily because my boss doesn’t want to pay me anymore to be the massage manager, and decided not to replace me because it’s not cost effective. But I care too much about our clients to not think about the state of those rooms. Anyway, I digress.
Other Income: $195/month EBT
Savings: $0
Checking: $20


Expenses:

Rent: $300/month with utilities included minus internet (aside from mobile hotspot, I don’t have it) and propane (cooking &amp; heating, ~$120/year). I live on the same property that employs me, as well as most other staff, in a recently renovated 70’s camper trailer that is just enough for a single person in temporary housing. To add more eggs to my only basket, if I left this job for a better one, I would lose my housing immediately upon ending my current employment. Because of the high income of the majority local population (gentrification to the MAX) and being geared mostly to tourists, houses and apartments are huge and fancy and standard of living here is very high. It’s rare to find even a tiny room in a shared house with a shared bathroom for less than $600/month, even in the winter months. Only other option for cheaper housing is to enroll in the local college and live in the dorm or student housing, which costs about the same as I’m paying now. 

Gas &amp; Car Insurance combined: $~218/month. Since I live and work on the same property, as well as all my friends, I use my car only two or three days a week, mostly for business related errands and grocery shopping.

Professional Liability Insurance: $60/qtr.

Health Insurance: Free w/ Oregon Health Plan (not to be mistaken as the ACA) and no deductible/co-pay, however, I pay out of pocket for weekly professional mental health services that are out of network with my health plan. My therapist is flexible about compensation and I pay what I can that day, even if it’s nothing, but I try to aim for $50/session.

Other Expenses (estimated and rounded up to show maximum amount I’d spend):
My only dependent is my cat, who I happily spend ~150/month for food, treats, tick&amp;flea prevention/treatment, and litter box supplies altogether (this is a generalized amount of what it costs if I were to get everything she requires all at once. In reality, this amount is staggered throughout the month and at times into the next.. e.g. $100 spent this month could mean next month I might only spend $50). I won’t compromise her health by feeding her cheap food like friskies or kibble from Walmart (there isn’t one anyway). I try to aim for as biologically appropriate as I can afford (maybe this could use some adjusting, keeping in mind my cat is addicted to tuna and has a picky stomach). I currently buy small canned Tiki-Cat (cut in two for first and second meal) and stretch supply of wet food with a small amount of Orijin kibble. All in all, her food supply would generally last about 4-5 weeks if I completely exhausted it before re-stocking; I try not to because it’s a larger one time sum than if I just picked up several cans here and there. 
**Any cat parents who are also feeding biologically appropriate diets on a budget, please chime in about what reasonably priced brands you’d trust with your own health**
—$20/month for Hulu and Amazon Prime (the latter I use for both business and personal use).
—Other job-related expenses: $75/month for laundry (So. Many. Sheets!); $30-60/month for massage oil, depending on amount of weekly appointments booked; $10/month for ad-free music streaming (absolutely necessary for my line of work, because boss wants therapists to pay for all expenses; possibly owing the Gov ~$550 in taxes, but uncertain. 


Debt:

—Auto Title Loan: $95 min. payment, $150/month average payments (Initial loan: $1,144 for engine repairs @ 25% interest for 12months; remaining principle due: $437.70). Total expected payback amount ~$1,500.
— WF Credit Card: limit at $1,500, maxed, unknown current amount due. I haven’t looked at this debt in a long time (5+yrs) and have no clue on its standing.
—Bank overdraft: $600 at unknown interest about 1yr overdue. I was stranded in the middle of the Nevada desert when moving from my home state to Oregon. I was leaving the CU behind, and felt OK with burning that acct and opened a new acct at another CU in my new town. 

Credit Score: abysmal. Probably around 500/550 last I checked about 8 months ago. 

Leftover cash spending habits: 
As mentioned in a reply to a comment referencing the amount of money I spend on myself vs my cat, the ratio doesn’t bother me too much because, really, I’m spending all of that money on myself since my cat is practically an extension of me and I’d rather her live as long as her body will physically allow. She is also recognized as a service animal for severe anxiety and PTSD from early to late childhood abuse and abandonment, so since she helps me out so much, I’d be wrecked with guilt if I fed her something I knew isn’t good for her. Right now, she’s the only companionship I have and her happiness is also my happiness. 
/sweeps off soapbox/ Tell me, would some of you rather feed your kids only crunchy, dry PB&amp;J with fortified, preserved ingredients with doubtable nutritional density for every single meal so that you can save money? Sure, their bellies will be full and they probably wouldn’t know the difference if that’s all they ever ate, but it would be at the expense of health and life-expectancy. Yes, I just compared my cat to being my child..no, I don’t actually see her literally as such, because she’s a cat, but the emotional bond and desire for wellbeing are similar; not to mention the responsibility I have for caring for another life. /steps off soapbox/
As far as her food is concerned, I stick to what I can comfortably and reasonably spend that can actually be considered food. Also, the pet store I buy from (the only one available) has a rewards system where I get discounts and credits towards my checkout price. With that being said, my main expense is food for myself. I spend a larger portion of my remaining income at cheap local mom-n-pop restaurants (religiously excluding McDanger &amp; Associates.) or grocery store delis where I can use my EBT card to supplement; also at the cafe at my work where I get a free meal on a 6+hr shift and 10% discount on food and general merchandise (toiletries, etc). I also I’m not too keen on spending money on theater tickets, concerts,  or brand name items, and I’ll most likely find what I need or want at Goodwill, a yard sale, the free box, or the local “buy nothing” Facebook page.  Sometimes I can even barter my massage trade for goods or services. 


Circumstances:

My family has been well below the poverty line for generations, yet regardless of their slowly bettering positions, none are in any standing to offer financial assistance aside from my mom paying for my phone, because she knows I’d rather go without having one and she’d never hear from me if she didn’t. Also, they all live a thousand miles away and moving back is a huge hell no (if you were a non-Mormon raised in rural Utah, you’ll understand). 
The college town I live in is small and heavily tourist dependent, so PT jobs are seasonal and scarce, and pay is usually at minimum ($10.25).

[I guess I’ll put this part here.. some have brought up the notion of meal plans or having several days to a week of food ready to make all at once. This is a no brainer method for people who have standard sized kitchens which have enough space to store enough food for a whole week of prepared meals (I know it doesn’t really take up that much space, maybe a whole shelf in a basic sized fridge). In my current living arrangement, the unit I live in is originally meant for several day lodging for the spa, which means my kitchen and fridge are sized to only hold enough food for that long. With my current work schedule, there isn’t really much time for frequent shopping and cooking AND cleaning, let alone money for gas to put in my car and drive 20 miles to the grocery store then 20 miles back, which is why I’ve favored eating from the Spa’s Cafe. I do have a small veggie garden that I share with my neighbor, but since it’s spring and still early in the season, not much will come of it yet.] - regardless of this situation, I’m still willing to hear ideas from people who meal plan with limited food storage and limited time, as I can still manage something to accomplish this. Any ideas or tricks appreciated. I’m also unopposed to some nutritionally complete liquid meals. I kinda wish I didn’t have to eat to sustain my life anyway lol. 


My short-term goal is to unlearn poverty-thinking and form strong habits with budgeting and saving so that I can 1) reach $5k savings and min. checking acct. balance of $1k, 2) bite the bullet and pay off all debt, and 3) reach a minimum credit score of 700/750, and 4) become capable of relocating to a larger city with a financial cushion while I settle in. Long-term, I’d like to be financially sound and relatively comfortable by the time I finish my 20’s, and be enrolled in university. 

Thanks for any advice you have, and thanks for taking the time to read if you don’t! Hope this can offer help to others in a similar situation as well. Blessings!

Is it wise to buy now and constantly pump in cash? 

Is it also a possible strategy to buy SPDN, the 1x bear etf during the recession when it comes whilst holding SPY in order to cancel out losses (and gains) before selling SPDN when the market is bull again? 


Edit: I am also toying with the idea of investing some of my 70k School loan for living expenses (which is something that belongs on r/wallstreetbets) Any advice?

personalfinance,Unsubsidized Loan in Repayment- Pay off interest before it compounds or pay off highest rate loan?,"I have read the resources here along with those on the federal loan sites, but I just want to make sure I'm approaching my situation the correct way. I graduated in May, 2017 with unsubsidized federal loans and entered a year long internship program. I qualified for an income based repayment plan that I will need to resubmit information for in November, 2018. Until I resubmit that information, the interest that has accrued over the past year will not capitalize. Once I resubmit, I'm no longer going to qualify for the plan I did for this year and the interest will capitalize. Until I resubmit everything, my monthly loan payment is $95.11 distributed across all four loans, leaving me freedom to apply the rest of the money I put towards my loans however I want.  


Starting in July of this year, my take home paycheck biweekly will be $2930 after accounting for health insurance and taxes taken out. My student loans are: 

* $30,180 + 747 interest at 5.06%

* $30,345 + 897 interest at 5.59%

* $5,003 + 0 interest at 5.96% 

* $29,400 + 798 interest at 5.16%


My monthly living expenses are $600 for rent, $150 for utilities, $600 for boarding my horse (who I've had for 15 years, retrospectively would not recommend this as a sound financial decision to a high schooler, but he's old and retired at this point and I can't in good conscience give him away when he's been so good to and for me for so many years), $75 for his shoes, $200 for food, $150 for miscellaneous expenses, $60 for gas. I include car maintenance and insurance in that miscellaneous along with other random things. Total expenses are: $1835. That leaves me with $4030/month. 


Retirement wise I have a roth IRA with $16,000 in it that I haven't contributed to in years. I have $1100 in a traditional IRA with the company I did my internship with. They match 1/2 of up to 3%, so I've been contributing 3% of my pay this year. 


Questions: 

* Should I keep aggressively paying at the highest interest loan first? And let the interest compound on the other ones in November? 

* My plan was to apply for the 30 year fixed rate payment plan in November, but obviously to pay them as fast as  possible. 

* My job doesn't offer a 401k until I've been there for a year. Unfortunately I'm not sure that I will be here any longer than a year due to a planned move for my fiance's career. I plan on maxing out contributions to either the roth IRA or starting a traditional IRA if that would make more sense at this point. But what can I do after that since I don't have a 401K I can contribute to? Or should the focus all be on getting rid of those loans.
 
* We'd like to start saving for a house soon. Looking at $150,000 range, so 20% down would be 30K, my portion would be 20K based on the way we split according to income. How can I go about saving for that in a financially sound way. 

* Emergency fund: after all the moving expenses we're about to have, it will be 0. I know this is not ideal but my fiance just had a large number of health expenses/time off work and I have been making an intern salary for this year. I plan on replacing this over the next 6 months as well. Where should this money live? We both have credit cards that can carry a fairly high balance (but they get paid off every month) that we can put things on while waiting to pull emergency fund money out of some other spot if it takes a few days but will earn some interest in that spot.",finance

personalfinance,Student Loans Pay Down Question - Focusing on Subsidized vs Unsubsidized Loans,"Hey everyone, I recently finished getting a master's and now I'm planning for my repayment.  I still have some subsidized loans left over from my undergrad totaling $20,556.84 which is spread into the following five loans:

* (A) $2,488.85 @ 5.6% fixed

* (B) $3,295.40 @ 4.5% fixed

* (C) $4,233.63 @ 3.4% fixed

* (D) $5,262,69 @ 3.4% fixed

* (E) $5,276.27 @ 3.86% fixed

While my grad school Unsubsidized loans total $47,562.09 and are divided into three loans:

* (F) $14,661.04 @ 5.31% fixed

* (G) $19,564.30 @ 5.31% fixed

* (H) $13,336.75 @ 6.0% fixed

Al of these include current accrued interest.  

My question is, if I've got $10k - $12K (About 50% - 60% of my current savings) I can throw at them right now, which would be more advantageous to pay down immediately.  My gut says pay down loan H as much as i can b/c it's the biggest interest rate.  But also paying Loan G down b/c it has a higher principal albeit at a lower rate.  But then there's also the Subsidized loans, A, B, &amp; C that I can knock out right now although they aren't gathering interest right now either. 

Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance!",finance
Ripple,IMF Deputy Managing Director Tao Zhang confirms: Central banks testing distributed ledger technology to make cross-border payments more efficient,"On May 8th, The IMF (International Monetary Fund)  Deputy Managing Director Tao Zhang hold a speech on Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank Conference. 


Topic: Digitization of Money and Finance: Challenges and Opportunities


Full speech is available here: http://www.imf.org/en/news/articles/2018/05/08/sp050818-digitization-of-money-and-finance-challenges-and-opportunities


He went through the folloging steps:


* First, I will discuss how financial services may be transformed by the adoption of financial technology;

* Second, I will examine how crypto-assets rise may pose challenges to financial integrity and stability;

* Third, how central banks and regulators can mitigate potential stability risks without impeding innovation;

* And finally, I will highlight the work the IMF is doing to help its 189 member countries address these challenges.


He made references to useful services:

*""Some useful technology is being developed to improve market efficiency. For example, services have slashed from days to minutes the time it takes for cross-border payments to reach destinations. These include relatively small firms like BitPesa in Africa and BitOasis in the Middle East and such well-known companies as Western Union and Moneygram.""*


He gives the answer on how regulators and central banks should respond?

* First, regulators need to complement their focus on entities with increasing attention to activities. This responds to the reality that an increasingly diverse group of firms and market platforms are providing financial services.

* Second, governance needs to be strengthened. Rules and standards will need to be developed to ensure the integrity of data, algorithms, and platforms—in other words, to ensure that they operate in a manner that does not expose consumers or the financial system to undue risk.

* Third, policy options could be considered to support open networks, and licensing policies could be adjusted to help foster competition.

* Fourth, legal principles need to be modernized. Maintaining trust in financial services may also require the development of new legal frameworks to clarify rights and obligations within the new financial landscape.

They already begun!

He confirms:

*""In fact, a group of central banks is actively experimenting with the use of digital currencies and distributed ledger technology with the aim of making cross-border payments more efficient.""*",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"I have an extra $2k I want to put down towards either of two loans, but I don’t know which one","I have a 7k student loan at 4.25% and several fed loans at 27k total for about same average rate. I recently co-signed on a mortgage to help my mother buy her place. (Our agreement is that she is paying the mortgage). It’s 72k at 4.625%. I now have this money I was planning on pushing against the 7k loan since it accounts for half of my student loan interest! But this 72k mortage is something I am very willing to help my mother with; (+ I’d get it back if she moves). Anybody has any advice on what I should do?



EDIT: title should really read ‘either of a loan or a mortgage’",finance
personalfinance,"PayPal ""lost"" the money I sent and can't find the transaction","To make this as short as possible:

I had a $200 PayPal Credit in my account. I transferred $95 of it to my sister via the PayPal friends and family/gift feature. A hold was placed on the transaction, which I thought was odd because I regularly transfer money to my sister and it has never been ""held"" before.

About a week and half later, the transaction ""went through"", except my sister never received the money. We checked and double checked her transaction history, and it shows the transaction for $95, but her balance remains at $2\- the amount she had sitting in there beforehand.

We called PayPal on her behalf and they said they couldn't do anything on her end, and to call back with my account details. I did that, and the rep took a look at our situation.

She seemed genuinely puzzled and said she can see the transaction, but is unable to pull up any details about it. She stated that she never saw this happen before, and asked me to send in screenshots of the transaction to [service@paypal.com](/). I did that, she said she received them, and she then stated that she would have ""a team"" investigate the situation and they would get back to me within 72 hours.

Well, 4 days passed and no one got back to me. I called again and got a different rep. I explained the situation again, and he said he would look into it. This time, the rep could NOT find the transaction, even after giving him the transaction ID. At first he tried telling me that there was nothing he could do, but I told him that was unacceptable. He then went to go talk to a supervisor, and when he came back he said to start a claim through the Resolution Center on the PayPal Website.

I hung up, and went to do that. I select the transaction \(weird that I can see it perfectly fine but they can't\) and go to start a claim... and get an error message ""Sorry\- your last action could not be completed.""

I am livid right now. The $95 itself isn't a huge deal, but it is absolutely unacceptable that my money just \*poofed\* into nothingness and the people over at PayPal can't figure out what happened.

TL;DR: The money I sent to my sister never arrived. Despite having proof of the transaction, PayPal said they couldn't see it and isn't being helpful. I was told to submit a claim, but I cannot do that due to an error message. Is there anything I can do, anywhere I can go, anyone I can contact to have someone actually help me and get my money back?

Thank you in advance.

Edit: Thank you everyone who responded! I'm going to contact the CFPB and see if I can get this thing resolved.",finance
personalfinance,Getting state income tax information (employers will not provide W-2s),"Ok.  To keep the story short, I was paid income from employers in both Georgia and Alabama in the year 2017.   All 4 of my employers have not provided W\-2s yet after multiple attempts at contacting them, some friendly letters from the IRS, and nearly $100 in postage expenses \(registered mail gets expensive quickly\).    

  
I was able to obtain information regarding federal tax and gross wages for 3 of the employers \(the 4th never reported withheld taxes apparently?\) by retrieving a transcript from the IRS website.

personalfinance,dumbass 18 year old looking for advice,"I'm 18. I could go to college for 4 years for 60,000. That's after scholarships and federal loans. I could also go into the Air Force, take community college classes for free, learn to be an aerospace engineer, and get paid for my time there. However it's the military so my life would be indebted to them for like 6 years afterwards.

I want my future to be as free as possible. I really want an education right now, but I also want to get out of the house just as much. After I recieve an education I want the possibility to do anything, including not working. I have an idea of backpacking all over the U.S, or something like that, but if I was 60k in debt I feel like just taking a chill for 5 years screws me. I also don't want to have to worry about all that debt in general. It seems super constricting to me.

Truth be told I really like the idea of a college experience. The education would probably be better and I would have way more opportunities to try more things than in the air force. Especially now when after all these years I'm starting to actually develop healthy hobbies and maybe there are others to find at university. Also there will probably be way more girls at university than Air Force.

It seems like even though I'd be basically signing my life over to the military, in the long term (which isn't even that long) I'd be giving myself way more freedom. I haven't really looked into the drafting thing all that much, but logically thinking I doubt I'd ever see combat. 1 it doesn't make sense to me that they'd draft me at all because of where the future of combat is headed, and 2 my knowledge as an engineer would probably be put towards fixing engines instead of fighting.

My parents also have a decent chunk of change that could pay for a decent portion of university, but I really don't want to accept that for personal reasons.

I am also an eagle scout so I would start out at a higher pay grade if I went into the air force.

Also if I did go into the air force I believe there are some services to help pay for college (as in not community college) after I get out. So maybe I could also have a late college experience depending on how much financial aid I got.",finance

financialindependence,Guilt over spending on travel while working towards FIRE,"28, single, no kids, no house, no debt, own my car. Doing pretty well for a 28 year old at a net worth of $150k after paying off 35k student loans and buying a car (should be almost 200k NW by EOY) with my one area for real savings being about 300 a month in food costs (I have a passion for restaurants/being a foodie that is just part of what makes me happy). 

Income thus far: 50k salary from June '12 after graduating until Sept. '14. Made 60k a year until March '17. Made 70k in 2017, should make close to 85k this year. Hope to make 100k when I'm 30 and have a successful 30-50 career and FIRE in my early 50s at worst.

Anyways, most of my friends and family around my age are always doing lots of cool things and traveling and spending what appears to be a lot of what they make, and I feel guilty following suit and spending money on travel. I'm caught between being responsible/somewhat minimalist and the pressure to live a little now while I can (although I don't really plan on a family any time soon if at all so I don't know if I feel that much pressure from a time perspective). I live in Phoenix and will be visiting LA, San Fran, Portland, Seattle, and my family in Boston this summer (and Boston again in fall after having already gone to Boston in March. I'll probably end up having spent 2.5-3k (mostly flights, some lodging, food, and Ubers) on all this traveling this year and I feel terrible about it, let alone to consider the idea of a very expensive flight out of the country as so many people seem to do without a second thought.

Context: 
I am mid 20s, making $22/hour (~$45,000/year), living in an area with one of the highest costs of living in the U.S.

The yearly premium difference would be $200 (favoring the HSA).
The deductible difference is $1,600 (favoring the PPO).
The out of pocket maximum difference is $1,000 (favoring the PPO).

I have an auto loan of ~$11,000 at 2.8%
I have student loans of ~$8,000 at ~3.6%

I live by myself with just my dog in a really nice (and gigantic) under priced apt for my location (NJ). After 2 degrees, and working as a bartender for the entirety of my 20's I'm ready to get myself financially stabilized and look towards the future.

**Income**:  $33.80/hr with bi-weekly paychecks - this will be going up to $37.80/hr when I switch to evenings in about 3 weeks.  

**Assets**: a few different stocks totaling about $250 that I'm in for the long haul with.

**Crypto**: Thank god for bitcoin, I had owned a small handful that paid for almost all of my 2^nd degree.  Except I was forced by school to sell about 3 or 4 months before it skyrocketed to 20k, but it was sell or get kicked out of my A-BSN program for non-payment.  I currently have about $500-600 spread between 
Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple.

Acorns: $216.83 - set to aggressive, $10 monthly and regular roundups so every uber trip (more coming) and everything I basically do now is adding some spare change to that.

**Checking acct**: $3,973.60 

**Monthly Bills**: 

Rent: $1,195.42 - I'm 13 minutes from work, walking distance to the gym and shopping and just in a really nice area with great neighbors - I do plan on moving but while my rent is this cheap (yes for this area and what I have) I'm more than ok staying here.

Health Insurance $110.53 - until my work benefits kick in.

Internet - $25 - I have a firestick which gets me everything I need TV wise.

Gas/Electric - $40 - should be going up to $70-90 now in the summer.

Food - ~$300 - rough estimate

Dog - Insurance $56, food between $25-50 depending on how much he stays with my dad (he spends a lot of time at my dads due to the size of his property)

Uber: This is my biggest expense costing between $125-150 a WEEK without any surcharge days.  I also do get rides home on occasion.  

Dates/going out - I have a GF and we go out once a week so maybe another $300 a month.

CC#1 - $5456.81 @ 31.40% - minimum payment is $145

CC#2 - $1613.14 @ 15.40% - $37.00

CC#3 - $972.27 @24.49%- I have 1 recurring payment on here which is my gym for me and my buddy ($90) but am gonna switch that to my debit card this week.  minimum payment $28.00

Sister: $1,500 -  restaurant I previously worked in was shut down 2 weeks before I started my new job and than it took 3 weeks for my 1^st paycheck to come through and I needed rent and CC bill money she hooked it up.

College 2: degree I'm using - $18k - thats for the last 2 semesters so I could finish up, not a loan or anything but they want it paid off in 12 months from my first payment which I'll be doing on the 31^st of $500.

For those reading this thinking I’m privileged, just know that my mom is a 67 year old factory worker making about $18 an hour working the graveyard shift.

My situation: I just landed a permanent role with an annual salary of $55,000 at the beginning of this year. I have two credit cards, one has an owed balance of ~$1,850 @ ~19% and the other has an owed balance of ~$450 @ ~15%. I took out a personal loan last weekend of $4,500 @ 9.5% in hopes of purchasing a used car (older than 10 years so don’t qualify for auto loan). The car I was going to purchase turned out to be a lemon so I walked away. I have the $4,500 sitting in my savings account. I also have a student loan of ~$5,600 @ 9.31% that I took out last year for a coding boot camp. I also have about $30,000 in student loans from university that are currently on deferment until next March.


My original goal is to pay off my credit cards, the personal loan ($4,500), and the student loan ($5,600) before my larger student loans ($30,000) exit deferment. Im not sure what the best course of action is but here is what I’m currently thinking. Pay off the personal loan with the untouched loan money sitting in my savings. Pay off both of my credit cards and the code school student loan with a portion of the cash my mom gifted me, which will leave me with about $7,100 towards a car. I could either try to find a reliable car for $7,100 or I could pair it with an auto loan of about $4,000 with a much lower interest rate of about 4-5%.



Let me know if this sounds like a good plan or if there is a better way of of going about this. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,I'm 2 grand in debt,"This is my first time posting here so I'm sorry if i don't know the formatting rules.

As the title says I'm not officially 2 grand in debt. I'm in desperate need of some advice at the least. Some background: I was backing out of my driveway and I didn't see that my family friend had parked their car in the driveway 5 minutes before I tried to leave. Since I park closer the side of the house on a gravel path, I didn't see it trying to back out. I hit the passenger side door, dented it and messed up the paint job pretty bad. That was last week, this week I'm told I have to pay what could be over 2 grand for repairs. The family friend that I hit is absolutely furious at me, and wants it pretty badly. The issue, I'm a 16 year old high school student working an overstaffed minimum wage job and I barely get 2, 6 hour shifts a week. It's going to take months of time to pay him back and I can't find any other jobs that want a 16 yo student. I'm stuck in a hole and I need advice. (I also lost my computer because my parents are threatening to sell it because of this).


My parents refuse to give me any financial help and I'm not so great on money, having only 800$ total in my bank account.


At this point litterally any financial advice helps, I'm not sure I can dig myself deeper in debt.


EDIT 1: So I talked to my dad, he said the deductible from the insurance company is at least 1 grand, and could be more because of my previous accident. He wants me to get a second job to pay it off. I managed to get a few more shifts but my boss is saying the hours are stretched too thin as is and they can't afford to give me any more. Insurance is out and I have to pay the full 2 grand out of pocket. Thanks everyone for the advice but insurance was forced out of the picture.",finance

personalfinance,[Netherlands] how to best avoid paying savings account tax?,"Hey guys, so I have around 90k€ in my bank account which I got as a gift from my parents. The thing is that I have to pay around 800€ yearly for this amount just because I have it in my bank account (Box 3 income tax), while interest rate in a bank is around 0.05%, which is almost nothing.

I am not comfortable making investments in stocks or similar stuff because I know nothing about that, however I'm planning to buy a house here. The thing is that housing market is extremely bad now with demand being way over the current supply. So I'm still searching for over  2 years now, while losing money at the same time.

Also the way to this tax works is that the amount of taxes I pay for money over 75k is much bigger that the rest, therefore I'd like to invest those 15k somewhere to potentially cut my taxes in half, whilst still keeping rest to buy a house when needed.

Does anyone know of some safe investment in Netherlands which is not taxed for income at all? Not sure if something like that exists. Or what would be your best advice?

hardware,The 2019 console,"Just a quick write\-up what a late 2019 console could contain. All parts and techniques must be available in the first half of 2019 to make it into the console.

* **The chip:** There are two interessting developments for a 2019 SoC. The first is 7nm, which enables a 70&amp;#37; area reduction compared to 16FF\+ \([Source](https://www.anandtech.com/show/12677/tsmc-kicks-off-volume-production-of-7nm-chips)\). A double size gpu \(80 compute units, 25&amp;#37; larger than Vega64\) and a 8\-core Zen cluster could easily become a possiblity. The second one is less likely, but multi chip modules could become a thing for a 2019 console. You could manufacture the CPU and GPU seperatly and connect them through the Infinity Bridge, cutting costs. 
* **The CPU:** Zen 2 launches early 2019, and since console builders are closely working with AMD this new architecture could be integrated. CPU\-power is holding a lot of games and PC\-ports back right now.
* **The GPU:** Between 72 and 96 compute units is possible \(12,5&amp;#37; to 50&amp;#37; more than Vega64\) with the Navi architecture. But even this amount of power with Vega should be great.
* **The display:** HDMI 2.1 enables 4k with 10\-bit color up to 120Hz with no compression at all \(so 4:4:4 chroma\). Also, a virtual reality headset with resolution of 2160x2160 per eye, 10\-bit color at 150Hz can be fed from HDMI 2.1. \([Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/7afow1/hdmi_21_will_allow_a_vr_headset_to_run_with_dual/)\)
* **Storage:** SSD's are approaching 0,20 per GB, so a 256GB\-cache SSD will add only €50 to the console, a reasonable price for super fast game loading. The most used games could be dynamicly loaded on the SSD, in addition to a 1 or 2 TB hard drive.
* **Connections:** Bluetooth 5.0 for audio and controllers, 802.11ax \(draft\) for fast wireless and maybe even 10GbE or multi\-gigabit ethernet for fast downloads and in\-home game streaming.",technology
investing,Ask HN: Anyone have a personal long term investment strategy based on futurism?,"Starting to get interested in investing I don't really feel comfortable following the traditional ""put it in indexes"" advice.

I've read Graham and Malkiel generally really agreed with their philosophies, but I think they are targeted at a macro environment of US hegemony and more or less stable growth. My problem is that I see these trends changing in a few important ways over the following let's say 2 decades:

1) I think the era of the dollar as a bully reserve currency is coming to an end. I think the ability of the US to influence and profit at the expense of global markets is going to somewhat decrease while China takes some of that power (already happening to some significant degree)and possibly supercedes us. If Europe gets it's shit together I think they have the same potential. I think US markets take for granted that we run the world and it's going to hurt us when we have to start fighting on even or even lower ground.

2) I think US markets are due for a crash as prices keep flying up yet I don't see real value being created and I think we've exhausted a lot of the tools (QE, traditional monetary policy) that have buffered us against bad outcomes in the past meaning the next crash could be severe. (I understand this is borderline flame baiting and I don't fault people who disagree but I do believe this)

I understand the futility of trying to time things but's it's hard to convince myself to dump money into something I don't really believe in.

3) The moves towards sustainable energy and away from fossil fuels. Also related changes in transportation and infrastructure.

4) A general belief that access to cheap technology will benefit developing countries over the long term

Basically I don't expect everyone or even many people to agree with me on some of these points but I haven't really had any success in finding people interested in discussing these ideas.",finance
personalfinance,Need an opinion on decreasing debt,"So my wife and I found out were pregnant and need to cut costs and decrease payments as much as possible. My payments are killing me \(my own fault I know\). We brown bag it for work and decreased eating out only once ever two weeks. 

My car loan is killing me at $465 a month

I have a personal loan for $220 a month 

Several credit cards totaling $200 a month and all are about maxed with a total of $5100. These are my 3 biggest expenses. My credit score is 620 with perfect payment history. 0 derogatory remarks and high total accounts \(which is good\). My credit age average is only 2 years and hard inquiries is only 4. My credit utilization is what hurts at 59&amp;#37;. I want to refinance but my credit is not good enough to do that. So, I was thinking about a personal loan through OneMain even though the interest rate is high \(28&amp;#37;\). My thinking behind this is that my interest rate is the same on my credit cards as it would be through the loan \(28&amp;#37;\). But, if I take that debt on my credit cards and move it to a personal loan \(while keeping the cards open\) and a month or two later go to my credit union and refinance the personal loan at a much lower rate about 11&amp;#37; on the safe side. So basically I would be refinancing my new personal loan that I took out for the credit cards at a much lower rate. 

In theory this sounds like it would work. My debt would be moved out of the credit utilization to a personal loan and my score should go way up in a few months. And with my score up and and utilization down I ""should"" be able to refinance. However, if I cant get it refinanced, is it really hurting me because of the interest rate on my credit cards and the loan would still be the same at 28&amp;#37;. My monthly payment would go down regardless by $50 a month which helps some. 

My big question after I just explained this is, do you think this would work? I would obviously try to refinance the car as well.",finance

personalfinance,When side hustle income fluctuates greatly or is hard to predict...How to allocate income to achieve greater security and/or also avoid getting hammered by taxes?,"Hi all, I would appreciate your advice on how to handle my next steps toward increased financial security.  My situation - 38, single, no kids.  No debt except car and mortgage (and the regular monthly bills of course, utilities etc.)  I pay things using a credit card and pay it off every month.  The rewards on that cc are equivalent to 1 tank of gas a month, (It’s a credit union cc) so not much, but it’s something.

$11,700 remaining on a 2013 Subaru Impreza which I think I could drive for another 5 yrs at least. Interest rate @2.49% Monthly payment 254.

I bought my 1st home, a condo, in 2016 for 210,000, on a 30 year fixed, @ 4.1%. It's worth about 240ish now. Including HOA fee that monthly payment is 1800.   In a year I hope to get the pmi dropped off = about 80 bucks a month.

My main, regular full time job is 64000. At that job we only get cost of living/inflation raises.  However they have a generous retirement matching at 10%.  I always get the match, sometimes I put in more.  My current 401k balance is 141,000, and of my contributions so far this year, I have put in 2150.00  Since I am single and will probably remain so, (long story) I am concerned about getting that beefed up.

However my emergency fund is only at 1700.00   

Here is where it gets complicated....I have a side hustle that I anticipate earning 12000 by end of this year.  However it's possible that I could be let go from that at any time in the next few months.  But they have been telling me that since 2015 and its not happened….So I could also see them keeping me in it for the next 2 years or something. But for this year, I think 12000 is a safe assumption.

I just landed a 2nd side hustle that the income from is going to be harder to predict until I spend some time in it.  I’ve calculated that by end of this year I could earn anywhere from 2000 to 17000 from it.  If I end up getting the high end, I want to do all I can to not get hammered on taxes.  I used the IRS calculator, and I could end up owing 3500 in federal taxes at end of the year, just from this second hustle (if I get the high end). I’ve always gotten a federal tax refund or owed a minimal amount, so it would kill me to pay that much, when I could possibly give it to myself in a 401k.   Since the year is almost half over, should I greatly increase my 401k contributions?   

Of course, there is always the chance I’ll end up earning the low end on that second hustle….. and if I make big contributions to my 401k now, maybe I’ll find out I won’t have needed to, and that’s cash I could have used toward the car or emergency fund.  UGH.  HELP ME.   (By the way, I know this is a “good problem” to have…..I am definitely cognizant of that) Thank you so much for your advice.",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan Repayment (~5.8K left) or Roth IRA contributions for the rest of year,"Doing my best to follow the prime directive and making some good career moves I've been able to crush 40k worth of student loan debt to about 5.8k over the course of 2 years. Right now I'm wondering if I should deviate from the prime directive and not prioritize my debt.

At 5.8k I have a 6.55% interest rate. My plan for a while has been to dump about 1.2k a month into my debt payment. That'd get me paid off around September. At this rate I'd be paying $92 interest on my remaining balance.

However, I am wondering now if it makes more sense to me to only pay the minimum $140/mo on my loans and put the remaining ~1K a month I normally spent on debt towards my Roth IRA instead until I max out for the year?

From what I can tell this will cost me an extra 100-150 bucks in interest, but it makes more sense to max out my Roth IRA for the year. Does that logic seem sound to you kind folks?

My mother then began using a hedge fund manager who has now raised my stock value to ~$240,000 in nearly 2 years.

personalfinance,Advice needed: Received two really good job offers. How to decide between the two?,"Friday morning, I received a job offer from two companies. I have until Tuesday to make a decision, however the decision process has turned out to be more agonizing than I thought it would be.

Both positions' salaries are in the mid 40k range.

Both have respectable health and retirement plans.

Both have advancement opportunities and have tuition reimbursement. They are really large US corporations.

Company A: Is a sales job; relocation is a pretty much guaranteed eventuality; but has a set M-F schedule with most weekends and all federal holidays off.

Company B: Is a factory job; no need to relocate since job is tied to factory; but has crazy rotating hours at first but settles down once you've been working there for about a year; pay starts 10k/yr lower in the low-mid 30k, which increases to the mid-high 40k range after 18 months of good performance.

I complete 2 phone and 1 in-person interviews with Company A. They hint towards wanting me ""on their team"" after the final interview. Within the same time frame, I complete 1 phone and 1 in person interview with Company B. They too are excited about ""moving forward.""

I was open and honest with both parties and informed them that I was ""interviewing with other companies and I wanted to see it through so that I could make a fully informed decision.""

Thursday afternoon, I emailed HR at Company B to request they let me know as soon as possible if I was still being considered. They call me first thing in the morning the next day to give me a verbal offer.

Company A calls me the same morning and also gives me a verbal offer. In addition to this, because they knew I was considering other options, they offered to increase my salary somewhat (more than 2k, but less than 5k).

To be honest, I'm having a heck of a time choosing between them. I initially had my heart set on Company B because I wanted a nice stable factory job that was close to home. Although, the longer I think about it, I feel that I would be leaving a major financial opportunity behind if I don't choose Company A. I'd have to leave my house, and customer interaction all day which isn't my favorite thing but can perform if needed. Those two reasons alone are why I haven't already jumped on the opportunity.

Admittedly, I have no factory experience to compare it against, however I have always been fascinated with food science and food technology (Company B is a food plant). Just watching the machinery and the product being manufactured is amazing to me. My father worked as a QC manager at food plants for 20 years so I guess a lot of that remains in the back of my mind. To be sure, it is a sentimental reason, but there it is nonetheless. My desire is to use their tuition assistance program to earn a degree in dairy science and move up into management.

Should I go with my gut with this and choose Company B? My wife mentioned that the fact that I didn't pounce on the higher starting salary of Company A should be a pretty big indication that I'm not ready to finalize the hiring process with them. I think she may be right.

**TLDR:** Which one should I choose?

* Company A: Higher salary (high 40k), but not very interested in sales, and would have to relocate.
* Company B: Lower salary (mid 30k), but much more interested in long term career in food science.",finance

personalfinance,Refinancing an auto loan,"Hello all, 

About a year and a half ago, I purchased my first ""new"" vehicle (2012 Toyota Tacoma).  I actually found it online being sold out of an Audi dealership in the Wynnewood, PA area.  The listing price was about $20,000, and I was able to put $5000 down, so I ended up financing the rest through an auto loan.  

My parents came with me when I purchased the truck, because they happened to be in the area at the time, and it was also my first time buying on my own, so it was good to have them there since they've ""been through it"".  I asked them whether or not I should get the loan through the dealership, and they said yes because that's what they always do. Long story short, I financed through the dealership at 5.8%. Monthly payments are about $290, so it's within budget for me. 

Now, I have a good credit standing (750+).  I do have student loans, etc, however all of my accounts are in good standing.  I get letters in the mail often about refinancing my auto loan.  For some reason, I always just toss these letters, and I think it's simply out of ignorance.  I've never refinanced a loan before.  But, I feel that since I have good credit standing, I could refinance at a lower interest rate and still probably pay it off early.  

So, my question is: Is there any down side to refinancing?  I feel like dealerships won't go out of their way to help you, but lowering my interest by 2-3% just seems to good to be true.

personalfinance,"At the start of May I assessed my debt. High interest credit cards, student loans, and owing family money all add up to about 50k. I took action, here is what I did. Feedback Welcome.","Hello Personal Finance,

I am a late 20's millennial who enjoys the finer things in life, like craft beer and keeping my 17 year old Subaru Outback running. I was very happy trudging my way through life slowly paying down my debts and avoiding an assessment of just how drastically I had sunk my way into the pit of misery. Well, I got a decent job at the beginning of the year, \(My last job I was literally losing money working there given my expenses and debt interest\), and decided to take a look at just how bad my finances were.

Spoiler alert, they were bad. I had accumulated 30k in student loans over the course of a long and arduous undergraduate degree, 13,000 in credit card debt over 4 credit cards with APR's all above 20&amp;#37;, and even owed my mom and family over 2,000 dollars that they paid to help me out with various things.

Now, I didn't seek out any help, I wouldn't be a stubborn debt ridden guy stuck working on an oil rig in rural Texas if I actually was mature enough to talk to people about things. I instead did some scant internet research and decided that going FURTHER into debt was the solution to my problems!

I did several things.

1. I created an excel spreadsheet with all my debt listed on it. The starting debt, the interest rate on that debt, and a way to update it monthly. This really allowed me to see how bad my situation was, with the 20&amp;#37;\+ APR's on my credit cards I was paying them an absurd amount to do basically nothing.
2. I took out a personal loan. My credit score is actually pretty good for how shit my financials are. I think I had about 4,000 dollars in my checking account at the time, but a credit score of 677 according to equifax. I was about to get a 13,000 dollar loan at an 11&amp;#37; APR, which halved my interest payments and reduced the amount I was paying monthly for my credit cards. I did this with a company called Upstart, that takes pity on college educated duds like myself.
3. I took out 0&amp;#37; interest rate balance transfer credit cards, now this is a bit of a controversial move, but I wanted to give myself a financial buffer just in case I lost my job or had to pay for something unexpected. Unfortunately I was only able to get a 500 dollar limit on the first one I opened \(Chase Slate\), which I wouldn't have opened if I knew it was going to be that low. I called them to increase the credit but they declined to do it. I then got a 3000 dollar limit with Discover and a 14 month 0&amp;#37; balance transfer rate. So I moved 2975 dollars of credit card debt onto those two cards, which will allow me to keep that money in the mean time, and slowly pay them off over the next year interest free.
4. I used the personal loan to pay off most of the remaining credit card debt, I know I should just pay it all off, but I left a couple hundred on the books so that I could get the satisfaction of snowballing it into oblivion rather than feeling like I just entered a cheat code.
5. As for my student loans I entered into a low payment plan that is based on my income, which gives me a very low monthly payment compared to the standard rates. I just have to update it every year, and if I manage to hang onto it for about 20 years it might just go poof, but who knows with that stuff.
6. I called my mom and told her I would sending her a monthly payment of about 50 bucks to begin addressing the money she lent me. She was happy, she hadn't really expected to be paid back, but I want to do it for myself.

At this point I have increased my checking account balance to about 9,500 dollars, repaid most of my credit card debt, the remaining debt is on 0&amp;#37; interest cards, and converted the remaining balance into a lower interest single loan payment. I am sure that my credit score took a nice ding with all this, but considering it will all be consolidated to a short time period and lead to a greater credit limit to debt ratio, this might end up helping in the long run.

Anyways, that's what I did, I think the most fun I had was making the excel spreadsheet. I can enter all my payments and it updates my current debt. I can also input my paychecks and any additional credit card charges to see where my money is going. I am confident this will lead to a better more financially sound person by the end of this process. I hope to return with good things to say in a year or so, we will see!",finance
personalfinance,Financial aid repealed after medical withdrawal resulting in huge debt,"First four paragraphs are just explaining the background of why I owe this debt and why I don’t think it’s right, but for this specific subreddit I am just trying to figure out how to manage the debt if I am unable to successfully dispute it. Just skip to the last paragraph for my main questions. 

U.S.

I am a 21 year old college student and I am $47,000 in debt. In my freshman year of college at a private university \(huge mistake\), I was faced with some extremely troubling family related issues as well as my own struggles with depression and anxiety. During my second semester I was diagnosed with PTSD resulting from long\-term abuse/trauma. With the help of a mental health professional at the university, we came to the conclusion that the best option for me was to medically withdraw from classes that semester so that I could work on coping with my depression, anxiety, and PTSD as well as the family related issues I mentioned above. After meeting a few times with a caseworker in the dean of students office, my leave was approved and I planned on returning next semester.  

This is where things get tricky. So I returned to the university in the Fall and was not made aware that I would be paying the full tuition out of pocket because I had not submitted a financial aid appeal form in time. I was only told that I needed to submit a financial aid appeal when I was already back taking classes. The deadline was in May, which had not been mentioned at any point, and I submitted the appeal probably sometime in October for that semester as well as the 2017 semesters and was assured that everything would be fine. My financial aid appeal was approved but only for 2017, not the remainder of 2016 because it was too late. Not once was I informed of the devastating financial consequences that would ensue if I were to register and attend classes that following semester. I was never advised to speak with a school financial advisor before making the decision to take a leave and continue at the university, which I believe should be mandatory considering the circumstances and the amount of money at stake. Perhaps it should have been obvious that there would be gross financial consequences as a result of taking a medical leave, but being a first generation college student has made navigating this issue alone extremely confusing and difficult especially with little to no help from the university and my mental health struggles.

The university then proceeded to disallow me from registering for classes and demanded the money be paid straight away. They were unwilling to work out a reasonable payment plan with me and has moved the debt into collections. Anytime I have attempted to receive clarity on why I was not informed of the consequences before being approved to take the leave and registering for the fall semester, I am met with hostility, defensiveness, failure to accept any responsibility whatsoever, or just plain avoidance. Before the debt was moved into collections, I tried to set up a meeting with the man who oversees the financial department and ultimately moved the debt into collections, but he refused to even answer my phone calls let alone meet with me. He only responded to maybe two of emails with no helpful information. I am baffled by the lack of professionalism I have encountered during this process and am terrified of what the future holds. My credit is now at risk of being destroyed and my chances of obtaining a higher education are ruined. 

I tried doing some research to see if I legally had to be informed of these consequences prior to having the leave approved and returning from the leave. I didn’t find much information, but it is stated on the federal aid website that students “should” be informed of all consequences \(hard numbers discussed, financial aid appeals, returning after the leave, etc…\) of medically withdrawing either before making the decision to withdraw or at least before returning. I feel like I have exhausted all options, I’ve spoken with staff in the dean of students office and have attempted to resolve things with the financial department but to no avail. I am going to try contacting the assistant to the provost dean who is supposed to deal with “high level requests/issues” as a last resort.

If anyone is more knowledgable on the legal side of this I would love to get some more info on whether or not there is any way to successfully dispute this or if I am just screwed because of my own negligence. And does anyone know if I can retroactively apply my federal aid I received for the following year and didn’t use to that past semester? Obviously I would have never returned to the university if I had been fully informed about paying the full tuition out of pocket and it just seems fishy that the university has been so avoidant and unhelpful, especially considering my specific situation. They have not been able to provide me with any proof that I was properly informed before making a life altering decision at just 19. Also, if there is no way to dispute these charges, how should I go about managing this huge debt? I have attempted to get private loans to cover it but I have not been approved, even with a cosigner.

In a dilemma, I am starting a franchise business and my fiancee is spoting me 170,000. Now we don't plan on getting married for another 4 years. The issue is how do we not get screwed by the IRS tax wise. If it's considered a gift and over 13,000 \(which it obviously is\) I have to pay a federal gift tax on it and if it's a loan greater than 100,000 \(which it obviously is\) then imputed interest or market rate interest will occur. I have no idea how to go about this without beign taxed which I think is beyond silly since she will be my future wife. 

Which is the cheapest option for me and is there an option where I don't have to pay any tax on her spotting me 170k?

MachineLearning,[D] Help Stabilizing GAN,"You may remember a hobby project I posted about here previously that used a GAN to generate a terrain map based on a simple user supplied input image \( [https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/7dwj1q/p\_fun\_project\_mspaint\_to\_terrain\_map\_with\_gan/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/7dwj1q/p_fun_project_mspaint_to_terrain_map_with_gan/) \). Over the past month or so I've found some spare time to return to this project and attempt something much harder but also much more useful. The terrain maps are fun but only really useful as nice images to look at and not much more. My new goal is to generate something useful in the 3D world by creating height and texture maps. Height maps are grayscale images that use pixel intensity to encode geographic altitude and are often used to store the topographic data of 3D landscapes. Texture maps are images that hold the coloring of the terrain. Height maps are fine because elevation data for the Earth is freely available but texture maps don't exist \(at least not in the way that I want them\) so I'm left with my original terrain map images.

Of course that's a problem because the images I'm trying to generate are not the same as the images in my training set. The solution is that using the height map I can calculate the shadows and then apply them to the texture map to recreate the terrain map. This calculation represents a bunch of trigonometry \(essentially calculating the angle between a line and a plane in 3D space as derived from pixel values\) and even after I've simplified and approximated this calculation a bunch it's still not a nice thing to push gradients back through. The result is really unstable training.

I started with vanilla GAN but unsurprisingly this barely lasted a few epochs before collapsing. Next was vanilla WGAN which did better but not all that much. WGAN\-GP was better again but still eventually collapsed. I then stumbled on this paper \( [https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09367](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09367) \) and it provided the most stable training by far. Image quality was also way better but after about 4 days of continuous training it also collapsed \(millions of images\). Training the discriminator faster than the generator simply led to the discriminator becoming too good and collapse.

In addition to trying different metrics I also tried different tweaks to the architecture. A combination of leaky\-relu and normal relu in the generator provide the best results \(elu was ok, selu wasn't very good, swish was really bad\). Selu provides good results in the discriminator without any normalization \(at least it seemed better then relu and elu with normalization although the discriminator isn't all that deep at about 9 layers\). For normalization in the generator I'm currently using the pixel normalization described in the Progressive Growing of GANs paper although I don't like the concept of this and I'll probably switch back to standard batch normalization. Changing from normal convolutions to a series of dilated convolutions in the generator was a big improvement. I've tried other things here and there but I can't really recall them right now.

My current architecture looks like this:

[https://i.imgur.com/NXdajT4.png](https://i.imgur.com/NXdajT4.png)

The generator is composed of residual blocks, each with a series of dilated convolutions followed by a strided convolution to downscale. Feature maps are pulled from the end of each residual block, put through a 1x1 convolution to reduce the number of channels and then upscaled using nearest neighbor. All of these feature maps are then concatenated into a big block. This goes through a few more residual blocks to reduce the number of channels before a few transposed convolutions to upscale the image. The original input image is concatenated back in toward the end of the generator to help with training. The generator outputs a 4 channel image \(3 value texture map \+ 1 value height map\). These are used to create the terrain map as described above.

The discriminator works fairly similarly. The generated height and terrain maps are concatenated with the input image map and fed to the discriminator. The combined image block is passed through strided convolution layers to downscale. At regular intervals, feature maps are pulled out through a 1x1 convolution to collapse to a single feature map. These maps are upscaled back to 512x512 with nearest neighbor and concatenated. The mean value is calculated for each pixel \(this creates a great visualization to assess the discriminator during training\) and then the overall image mean is used for the loss function. L1 loss is also added to the loss function.

So I'm looking for any suggestions on what else I can try to help improve training stability. Links to papers or discussions are great, code samples are also really helpful. Let me know if you have any questions.",technology

My passion in life is learning new languages, experiencing new cultures, and generally engaging with the global landscape. I am an American who has lived off a small salary from a slew of random jobs in America and the Middle East. After a few years of deliberation, I have decided to up my quality of life and gain some technical skills that can allow me to work a job I actually care about. Right now I just have an undergrad in theology, not particularly useful in the field I want to get into. 

I applied and got accepted to a grad school in France. Tuition is cheaper there and it has the added bonus of allowing me to live in a place I want to live in. It is not on the FAFSA list of approved schools abroad however. That means I can't pay for it with student loans. My question is\- what is the best way to pay for it? I am confident I can find a job in France but not enough to pay for bills and tuition, perhaps not even a monthly payment on a personal loan. The program is only a year and a half.

My idea right now is to pay tuition with a cc that has 0&amp;#37; apr for 18 months. Then when the time comes, pay off the cc debt with a personal loan with a lower interest rate. This sets me up with a grace period where I don't have to make payments I can't afford then get the advantage of a lower interest rate than that of the cc. By that time, I should have enough saved/ should have a good enough job to make the payments. 

What do you all think of this idea? Am I missing something? Is this a terrible idea? Is there a better way to do it? Please let me know any advice you might have. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Student Loan - Head Under Water,"Feel free to skip the background part at the top, it is more just me venting about the situation anyway. Post became wicked long, just skip to ""**Problem""** if you don't want to read my bitching.

**BACKGROUND:**

I could really use some guidance for the situation I just found myself in \(totally self to blame\). So I graduated from a private university in around June of last year. When I had graduated, I believed I had about 65,000 dollars of debt. This is obviously a daunting amount, and I should have taken the time to perhaps better understand the reality of that amount of debt. I guess I grew up in a wealthy area, no one else was worrying about it; and I figured the loans would be high, but low in interest rate, since that is what I had always heard. In hindsight, it is an extremely obvious oversight for myself to not review these loans and not act as my own adviser. 

Fast forward to today, paying off the student loans \(at insane interest rates of 8&amp;#37;, 9&amp;#37;, and 10.5&amp;#37;\). I've landed a cushy insurance job, earning about $61k \(with great benefits\), which makes the monthly student loan payments of $1,000 a month difficult but not impossible. These rates were planned to be consolidated and hopefully lowered this month.

Just the other day, my landlord sent my girlfriend and I a notice that their company intends to renovate our apartment on September 1st \(the day of our lease end\). They also offered to accommodate our transition to the next apartment. 

We currently live in Cambridge, MA \- and since it's difficult to find new housing on short notice, we immediately sent out emails, reviewed zillow, and went and looked at a few apartments nearby our current one. Part of the difficulty of moving is having to cough up all the money to be able to move. It costs first month rent, last month rent, a security deposit, and sometimes a brokers fee \(a place that costs $2k a month would therefore be $6\-8k of a down payment, or $3\-4k for me and the other half to my girlfriend, depending on if it had all four of those fees or just three of them.\)

**PROBLEM:**

Part of the process is to forward a copy of your credit score to the landlord. After having just received my credit score \(not having checked in several months\). I discovered 7 accounts through some creditor, Dept. of Education/Nelnet, that I had previously not known about. Since none of these monthly fees have been paid \(since march for some reason?\), my credit score was at about 510. These accounts total $25,707, all overdue by 90 to 120 days, with a total due of $1,977.92 and a past due amount of $1,695.36. These accounts are set up to be an expected monthly fee of about $220

Additionally: need about $3k to be able to afford a new apartment.

 **Adding it all together:**

My balance sits at $2,700 with an additional expected $1,600 \(paycheck\) on June 1st. **Total:** $4,300

On June 1st, I will owe $1,000 \(student loan\), $950 \(rent\)\(possibly times two since my current landlord didn't cash the previous check\), $1,695.36 \(overdue other student loan\), about $3,000 to move out. For a **total of:** $6,645 \- $7,595 \(with last months check\).

**Total Student Debt:** about \`\`\`\`$85,000

**Questions:**

How on earth do I dig myself out of this whole. I already feel like I can't *eat* any less than I do, I need some support system to help me. Is it possible to get these overdue payments removed from my credit score? Will I be able to consolidate my other student loans \(loaned from a different **entity Sallie Mae**, totaling 60k\), separately through my bank since I've made all payments on time? Can I receive an extension on the payments to loans I recently discovered \(25k\)?

I'm going to need to increase my income to be able to afford these new student loans\- Should I just look into a more profitable field than being an analyst at an insurance company? I'm coming up on one year of working at my current job, so the demand to have a promotion / raise is an option.

What should I do tomorrow?

What should I do by next week?

What should I do by the end of June?

What should I do by next year?

I know I could save by putting a pause on my riding for the next couple of years, but honestly it's such a stress relief that I have budgeted for it and accepted that it may extend my time in debt. Mental health has to be in your budget too, right?

Questions:

* Should we be looking at [non-USAA bank options](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/banks_and_credit_unions)? I know that some online banks allow deposits at any NYCE location.

* Should we do USAA but also have a nominal ""deposit only"" account with someone else and transfer the cash from there into the USAA account?

* Should we just deal with getting money orders and depositing them that way?

Thanks so much everyone!

EDIT: Decided to go with USAA + Schwab, and pay Chase Freedom card in cash if I have a stack of cash to deposit. We intend to use USAA as our primary checking &amp; savings, and Schwab has braches nearby where I can deposit large checks or get a cashier's check. I do a lot of international travel, so Schwab's ATM fee refund and no int'l charge policy will help with that. Will probably transfer money between USAA and Schwab via mobile deposit.

I read through USAA's new account terms, and they say that they may impose greater hold times etc. on accounts less than 30 days old. So we'll hang on to our BoA account for at least the next 30 days to let the USAA account season.

Sometime before the end of the year, we'll also open a Navy Federal account, because they seem to have great credit options. Both Schwab and NFCU perform hard credit pulls when you open an account, so we'd like to space those out.

I've Googled and tried every single one I can find and none of them will match what I'm being given by my student loan companies when I input the values I have.  Also, many use ""Loan Period in Years"" instead of ""Loan Period in Months"".  The term in months would be helpful to get closer to exact numbers.

Based on my payoff dates I can calculate the number of months left (I'm also given the number of payments I have left), I know my current balance, my interest rate, my payment amount, and the total amount I'm going to pay with interest.  Everything I've found tries to calculate the payment based on my balance/interest rate/term, and what they calculate always differs from what I'm actually paying.

I'm looking for something that lets me input everything I have (including my actual payment amount) and shows the time till payoff (which should match what my loan company says) and allows me to put any extra I pay every month and see the overall effect on the loan.

fundera.com has an amortization schedule that is the closest I can find to what I'm looking for, in format at least, except they try to calculate my payment based on the input numbers, and the payment much lower than what I actually pay, and it's asking for the loan term in years, not months.

personalfinance,Buying vs renting in the Bay Area: A look at some real numbers,"First post here, hopefully I don't break any rules... There are constant discussions going into renting vs buying, but most of it deals in theory. I wanted to share my personal experience with this topic, from the perspective of someone living in the Bay Area, and get feedback from the sub in case I made some wrong calculations in here.

&amp;nbsp;

The general perception seems to be that 
a) index investing and home investing are about equal in terms of returns / attractiveness, but as a commenter pointed out on the /financialindependence subreddit today, the answer is nuanced as it depends heavily on location:  https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8mny4i/what_is_with_the_hate_of_real_estate_on_this/
b) cash flow is generally the key consideration I see when comparing renting vs buying, or at least is what is typically modeled financially. 
I'm here to present some information based on my personal experience about those 2 topics today.

&amp;nbsp;

I bought a single family home in San Francisco in October 2016, after renting in a rent-controlled apartment for the 2 prior years. Prior to this, I had been of the mind that I wasn't giving up much by renting, but when I ran the numbers... boy was I wrong. So I bought a house instead! 


**Monthly housing expenditures**

Renting situation:

|Category| $|
|----------|----------|
|Rent| -$3,200|
|Utilities| -$150 |
|Insurance| Uninsured |
|Total monthly cashflow| -$3,350 |

&amp;nbsp;

Buying a house in the Sunset (4BR, 2BA):

|Category| $|
|----------|----------|
|Price| $1,325,000|
|Down payment| $260,000 (20%) |
|Interest rate| 3.25% 30yr fixed (Got in at a great time!) |
|Monthly mortgage| -$4,635|
|Insurance, Tax, Utilities| -$2,077|
|Tax deduction on interest| $1,300 |
|Rental income from downstairs in-law| $1,400|
|Total monthly cashflow| -$4,012|

&amp;nbsp;

As you can see, with the benefit from tax deductions and renting a room, it ends up not being *too* different, even in a place like the Bay Area where the rent to price ratio favours renting.

&amp;nbsp;

**Income through investing**


I had to put down 260,000 for the house (plus some closing costs), which would have otherwise gone into some of the hottest years of the stock market, but buying still yielded substantially higher returns. Most of the reason here is due to the impact of leverage, but these (real) numbers really show the scale of this.


Here's how it has shaped up after 19 months:


||Buying|Renting|
|----------|----------|----------|
|Money invested|$260,000|$260,000|
|Expected yearly appreciation| 14% (avg last 4 yrs was 18%) | 20% |
|Actual yearly appreciation | 14% | 25% (NASDAQ index) |
|Appreciation $ after 19 months|$305,000|$112,917|
|Plus Principle acquired|$34,084|$0|
|Taxes / closing costs|-$81,500 (5% closing cost)|-$27,439 (federal + CA tax)|
|Net gain|$257,584|$85,478|
|% return in 19 months|100%|33%|
|% annualized returns|55%|20%|


Buying turned out to be a way better financial decision for me. And I'd argue that it will likely pull away even further from stocks after a few more years of appreciation. If the housing market slows, I'd likely explore refinancing to purchase properties in higher growth areas.

&amp;nbsp;

I've been keeping an eye out for purchasing investment properties as a result. After spending time modeling various property scenarios, my realization is that appreciation can be a much more significant wealth generator. It's a bit puzzling to me that so many investment property spreadsheets only account for rental income vs appreciation. I'd love to hear from you guys on what your thoughts are on my analysis - is there something I'm missing?

&amp;nbsp;

***EDIT:*** Some great comments. Adding in a few takeways on how to improve the model here:

* Account for rental income tax

* Tax deduction I have is probably around right, but it actually includes property tax deductions also. This is impacted in 2018 onwards thanks to tax changes. From what I could tell from tax calculators, my loss in deductions is made up for by lower tax rates in general, so it evens out.

* Maintenance costs should be included too.

Assuming roughly $1000 for rental income tax, and maintenance per month (is that too low/high?), that brings the cashflow to being -$1,700 worse than renting, which is about $20k per year. This would have cost me around $5000 of stock appreciation per year, assuming 25% yearly returns. I'll have to update my model to see the impact, which back of the napkin suggests it would boost returns in the rental scenario from 33% to 40-45% over 19 months. (Likely on the lower end, given there's the question of taxes on stock appreciation, the fact that this money would not be invested once a year at the beginning of each year, etc).

&amp;nbsp;

I think it would be really interesting to run some numbers to see what I'd have to believe about home appreciation and stock appreciation to believe that stocks would have won out for me. This would be a fairer way to compare the two scenarios in the ""what if there's a recession"" argument, as a recession would hit both stocks and home values.",finance
financialindependence,Buying vs Renting: My bay area experience by the numbers,"Cross posted in /r/personalfinance

First post here, hopefully I don't break any rules... There are constant discussions going into renting vs buying, but most of it deals in theory. I wanted to share my personal experience with this topic, from the perspective of someone living in the Bay Area, and get feedback from the sub in case I made some wrong calculations in here.

&amp;nbsp;

The general perception seems to be that 
a) index investing and home investing are about equal in terms of returns / attractiveness, but as a commenter pointed out on the /r/financialindependence subreddit today, the answer is nuanced as it depends heavily on location:  https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8mny4i/what_is_with_the_hate_of_real_estate_on_this/
b) cash flow is generally the key consideration I see when comparing renting vs buying, or at least is what is typically modeled financially. 
I'm here to present some information based on my personal experience about those 2 topics today.

&amp;nbsp;

I bought a single family home in San Francisco in October 2016, after renting in a rent-controlled apartment for the 2 prior years. Prior to this, I had been of the mind that I wasn't giving up much by renting, but when I ran the numbers... boy was I wrong. So I bought a house instead! 


**Monthly housing expenditures**

Renting situation:

|Category| $|
|----------|----------|
|Rent| -$3,200|
|Utilities| -$150 |
|Insurance| Uninsured |
|Total monthly cashflow| -$3,350 |

&amp;nbsp;

Buying a house in the Sunset (4BR, 2BA):

|Category| $|
|----------|----------|
|Price| $1,325,000|
|Down payment| $260,000 (20%) |
|Interest rate| 3.25% 30yr fixed (Got in at a great time!) |
|Monthly mortgage| -$4,635|
|Insurance, Tax, Utilities| -$2,077|
|Tax deduction on interest| $1,300 |
|Rental income from downstairs in-law| $1,400|
|Total monthly cashflow| -$4,012|

&amp;nbsp;

As you can see, with the benefit from tax deductions and renting a room, it ends up not being *too* different, even in a place like the Bay Area where the rent to price ratio favours renting.

&amp;nbsp;

**Income through investing**


I had to put down 260,000 for the house (plus some closing costs), which would have otherwise gone into some of the hottest years of the stock market, but buying still yielded substantially higher returns. Most of the reason here is due to the impact of leverage, but these (real) numbers really show the scale of this.


Here's how it has shaped up after 19 months:


||Buying|Renting|
|----------|----------|----------|
|Money invested|$260,000|$260,000|
|Expected yearly appreciation| 14% (avg last 4 yrs was 18%) | 20% |
|Actual yearly appreciation | 14% | 25% (NASDAQ index) |
|Appreciation $ after 19 months|$305,000|$112,917|
|Plus Principle acquired|$34,084|$0|
|Taxes / closing costs|-$81,500 (5% closing cost)|-$27,439 (federal + CA tax)|
|Net gain|$257,584|$85,478|
|% return in 19 months|100%|33%|
|% annualized returns|55%|20%|


Buying turned out to be a way better financial decision for me. And I'd argue that it will likely pull away even further from stocks after a few more years of appreciation. If the housing market slows, I'd likely explore refinancing to purchase properties in higher growth areas.

personalfinance,"Credit card interest payments, I think I've been unintentionally avoiding them for 3 years.","How do i keep avoiding them?

I've had a Wells Fargo college card for 3 years now and it recently got automatically upgraded to a platinum card, and i noticed 2 interest payments on my credit card, this month and last month i originally thought they were from the new upgraded card because i haven't had an interest payment on the college credit card for about 2 years now.

i have done some digging and research in my statement history and this subs post on credit cards and it seems i have somehow been avoiding a majority of the interest payments on my card until recently(well past the 0% APR offer), the upgrade to the platinum card had nothing to do with these 2 interest charges because the first one came a week or 2 before the card upgraded, in fact from what I've just learned about the card i should be getting an additional 16 months 0% APR after the upgrade.

i have somehow been avoiding interest payments on my credit card but i don't know how I've been doing it, i have used my card a lot and i have always had a balance on it, I've made payments to keep it below 30% usage to grow my score but i have always had a balance and from what i have learned about credit cards the interest is based on the balance.

side note do you get the intro offers on upgrades?

TL'DR - i haven't paid interest rates on my credit card for 2 years up until last month, well past the 6 month 0% APR offer, i have always had a balance of 100 - 400 dollars but never above 30%, and i have used it every month extensively. how have i been avoiding monthly payments until now?",finance

Since she went directly into grad school from undergrad, this is the first instance of her having to pay back her student loans.

I'm currently helping her put together a budget based on her monthly income and how she should best approach paying back her loans.  I've also told her to consider looking into loan consolidation as it might benefit her in the long term. The only downside is the fact that I'm not at all with the detailed logistics of how companies like SoFi work, so I was hoping to get some insight here.

Anyway, her starting salary will be 36k and outside of food, train passes, and some minor medical expenses, she won't have any major expenses since she'll be living at home with her parents. Up until October she is planning on paying $1100 back per month and then ~$1300 per month after that

Her current loan breakout is as follows:

After reading the Wiki and basing her payback method off of my own student loan repayment, I'm assuming that after her minimum monthly payments are paid, she should funnel the remainder of the $1100 into the 20k Sallie Mae loan due to high principal + interest rates and then just follow the avalanche method.

The job hunt was very difficult despite a decent (3.1) GPA and research experience. I ended up taking a job in a sector tangentially related to my degree making $60,000.

I've been pre-approved for a 5.1% interest rate for the private loans which I plan on finalizing within the week.

I'm also pretty positive I will get a promotion in October/November that will up my pay to $70,000-75,000. Which I plan on putting all of the net increase into my loans.

I have created a monthly budget to ensure I can pay at least the minimum amounts due on my loans where I should have an extra $500 to attempt to snowball my loans. 

The thing I'm having the most difficulty with is budgeting too much/feeling like it's not enough ""play money"" per month as I live in a very large city and my co-workers/friends are always wanting to go out. I'm also worried about my car as I just reached 102,000 miles and I feel like at any moment it's going to die on me. I want to purchase a used truck but know how much that will hurt me budget wise. 

The loans really feel like they're hanging over my head, and I've recently been reading a lot into FIRE and don't want to work into my 70's. I'd love some critiques/advice on the budget I've created. Utilizing the Debt Calculator in the side bar I don't think I'll have my loans payed off until I'm 30 (currently 23). I've built two budgets below which will show purchasing a used car vs not. The only thing is I can probably get $3,000 for my car now, but I'm worried that if/when it does break down I will no longer be able to utilize that money for a down payment on a more reliable vehicle.

Essentially I'm worried that my car will crap out and I won't be recovering any value from it. Also, I live in Houston and the roads are torturous on my car. Alignment is always going to shit no matter what I do.

Last bit of information that's pertinent is that we have performance based bonuses at work and I'm on track to hit all of them totaling ~$5,000 a year, which I plan on supplementing my emergency fund with as well as paying off loans once I reach approximately $6,000 in emergency fund. I get free catered lunches at work until they finish the cafe on the first floor at which point I'll get a $10/day credit to cover lunch expenses so that's a nice ~$2500 perk.

I'd greatly appreciate any pointers on how to improve this budget/get this weight off my shoulders more quickly.

Forex,Consumption Model for Algo,"I am creating a model that accounts for consumption using [two\-period consumption model](http://digitaleconomist.org/tpc_4020.html). I know the push and pull indicators that would move the R in the graph, but how would I best go about putting it together?

Things to consider:

\-If you take the delta between oil prices and divide it by the delta between income you get a ratio that can help identify if the consumer is going to have more or less purchasing power in the future. This would help identify if the R^(f) should increase or decrease on my model.

\-CPI data is flawed so I am thinking about using another model similar to the one Eric Weinstein discusses. I can't find a link that has a layman's summary of Gauge Theory, Yang\-Mills Theory and other econophysics theory sorry :\(  I still need to run a model to find out if this is more or less accurate than our [current method of finding CPI data](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumerpriceindex.asp). Accurate CPI data would help determine inflation which I can use the [Taylor Rule](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taylorsrule.asp) to estimate interest rates.

\-Energy is the lions share of [CPI data](https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category.htm) so if oil goes up you can expect CPI data to go up. I'm not sure if gas stations buy gas using futures and then price them to consumers using spot prices? That would make sense and then I can get a prediction using future oil prices. The closer to the futures expiration period the more accurate the numbers.

\-Employment numbers can effect consumption as well so I'm thinking about waiting until NFP every month before I run my model. \(disposable income\) \- \(autonomous income\) = \(remaining income\) Should I use the delta of Remaining Income into my model?

\-The time periods of each factor need to be the same. I'm not sure if I can use [fractal energy](https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/cycle-trading-weekend-report-preview/2016/04/18) with different future time frames to find long term trade opportunities. I still have a lot of tinkering to do honestly.

I'm thinking about setting up a rating system that uses a weighted value for each factors and tries to estimate if consumption will increase or decrease in the future. Consumption is 2/3rds of GDP and the other 1/3 is very easy to calculate so if I can master this bit I hope I can create an accurate fundamentals model for trading. If I know market direction then all I need to do is create a algo that uses breakouts to trade. Anyone find flaws in my model so far?

personalfinance,Looking for advice on preparing for my upcoming private student loans,"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Hey, everyone. I am a 19-year-old majoring in CS. I went to community college for two years and will be transferring to a 4-year university this fall. It seems that my offered financial aid—excluding the PLUS loan—will not be able to pay for the rest of my college year. It seems that my parents will not be helping me pay anything for college. Understandable, since we are relatively poor in terms of California (major cities, of course). The plan is to graduate in 2 years but an extra quarter (3 months) may be necessary.

&amp;nbsp;

The cost of attendance breakdown is:
     
      Books and Supplies --&gt; $1,363.00

      Room and Board --&gt; $12,424.00
   
      Personal --&gt; $1,770.00

      Transportation --&gt; $1,442.00

      Tuition --&gt; $15,514.09
       
      Total --&gt; $32,513.09

&amp;nbsp;

My financial aid for that school year will be:

       Grant --&gt; $12,630.00 

       Federal Direct PLUS - Optional --&gt; $10,630.00		

       Federal Direct Subsidized Loan to meet need --&gt; $5,111.00		

       Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan - Optional --&gt; $2,389.00

&amp;nbsp;

1.) The grant is $3,000 short of covering my tuition, which could be made up by taking out the subsidized loan. This leaves me with $2111 of the subsidized loan. &amp;nbsp;

2.) The cost of room and board is not fixed. I am living off-campus and I believe I will be paying $800 per month in rent. This is not including utilities + internet. If anyone could give me a guesstimation on that, please do so, because I have no clue. I live in California and the cost of living high, so bringing that $800 monthly rent down is unlikely. 

3.) Private loan or PLUS loan? My parents are in favor of a private loan since it'll be in my name but I could try to convince them to do a PLUS loan if there are any major advantages from it than a private loan. 

4.) I will have $19,883 left in terms of cost of attendance after using the grant. After borrowing the maximum amount of the federal subsidized and unsubsidized loans, I will have a remaining amount of $12,383.

5.) I have no idea what to think from here. I will most likely be getting a part-time job, however, I am unsure of how much I will actually make. I'm not going to work as much as I can since finishing school strongly is my first priority. Obviously, the remaining amount will need to be covered with either private loans or the PLUS loan. Can someone please pick it up from here? I mostly want to know an estimation of the total amount (not solely interest) I will owe for the private loans if I borrow $12,383. Let's assume 10 year loan term and 11.875% interest rate—though I am unsure if Sallie Mae rates will be fixed at that or will continue to increase. Looking for a guesstimation on this one. 

6.) It is more than likely that I will not be receiving any good financial aid (i.e. no grants) for the following school year. My parents made a few G's too much which will make me ineligible for the grant. This was not my plan since I told my parents to work over-time less—they did not listen. So, I could be potentially borrowing 32K the following school year.

personalfinance,Where should I put my emergency fund?,"I have always been taught to hold 4-6months of living expenses in case of emergency.

I always held that cash in a savings account in a bank, since that way it was immediately accessible. Lately I’ve been reading more about investing and it caused me to realize that given a ~2.5% inflation rate and an interest rate of probably...0.1% or so, that money is wearing away.

I’ve held this money for 3 years and it has done nothing for me. I want to be smarter about it. Where should I put it?

1) higher interest savings account.
This will probably yield 1.5% or so, which is still lower than inflation. Not ideal.

This will yield possibly more than inflation and keep my money from slowly disappearing. But in bad times, it could also mean losing a bunch of money, or watching my emergency money disappear just when I need it most, or being forced to pull out money when it wouldn’t be smart to.

3) stacked CDs
This will yield an ok amount, be safe, and ensure I always have some money in case of emergencies. But it also means I won’t be able to access it all at once, in case something goes terribly wrong.

4) other ideas?

Here is my dilemma. I'm 35 and  have been paying on this house for 11 years now.  I refinanced a couple of years ago to a 20 year loan and have a great interest rate. I will be on track to pay it off in my early 50s. 

I currently pay about $870 a month with taxes and insurance. I'm not unhappy with my current house (it's in a good area and a nice neighborhood), but I would like to have an extra bed room for my home office and a garage. Buying a new home with those features will cost me at least 300,000. Affording it is not an issue, but I would now be paying off a house in my late 60s.  (A bigger house would also increase utilities, taxes, insurance, etc..)

Is it a smart move to stay in my current house, use the equity to add a garage or an extra room so that I can pay off my loan in my early 50s and head toward retirement with a paid off house or should I sell while the market is hot?  I know the practical answer is stay. :) Just wanted to guage others opinions.",finance

Thankfully, I will be able to live with my parents for one year rent-free. As a result, I can save/invest/pay off loans as much as I want for that first year.

I do not know how to balance it all and was hoping to get suggestions of what is the best long term position I should take to balance my first-year budget. Ideally, I would like to be debt free by the time I move out but I am open to other plans if it isn't the wisest choice.

I currently hold about 4k in private student loans and 40k in federal loans. I was thinking of using the sign-on bonus to pay off my private loans as the interest on it is too high (7.75% fixed, non-subsidized). The grace period on my federal loans will end on January 2019 and all interests are fixed.

personalfinance,"Thoughts on selling my house, renting for a bit, then buying a new house?","A little context: 
-I'm currently working in a training capacity that will last about 2.5 more years.
-My place of work is about 45 miles (about 1 hour) away from where I presently live. 
-We bought the house about 8 years ago for $170,000.
-Current comparable properties have sold between $260k and $290k.
-We have about $8,000 in various types of bad debt (medical, personal, and a little CC). We have a budget in place to whittle this down.
-We currently have about one and a half months worth of expenses saved for emergencies.

What I'm wondering is what wisdom you can shed on my potential plan:
-Sell the house in what I feel is a bubble market. 
-Move the family into a rental house that's much closer to work.
-Rent until I finish training in about 2.5 years, at which point I will be reassigned to an unknown location of work. 
-At that point (hopefully on a downward swing) buy a more permanent house. 

From the research I've done I would expect my living expenses to stay largely the same, except that rent would probably be a $200- $300 more per month. 

Why I feel like this is a good idea:
-Save myself around 90 minutes of commuting 5 days a week for 2.5 years.
-Housing is crazy expensive right now. My house is very much a ""starter"" house, and if I was starting in it today it would be a bit of a stretch to afford it (and I'm not making minimum wage). This makes me wonder how much higher prices can practically go (famous last words I'm sure).
-Interest rates are on the rise, and if the economy continues to grow then rates will probably keep growing too. Since my starter house is approaching a prohibitively expensive point, if rates go up the price should have to come down. I would expect this to be the case elsewhere when we are looking for a more permanent house. 
-I could take the $100k- $140k I would net from selling, rat hole it away, and have a substantial down payment for our future house.

If any of you can provide some wisdom, or criticism of my potential plan, it would be very much appreciated.",finance

Bitcoin,Thoughts?,"**Credit inflation is good: it produces artificial prosperity through artificial demand.**

**Credit deflation is bad: it produces a collapse in demand and high unemployment.**

The higher the debt levels are the worse the proceding credit deflation is. Also known as a depression.

**Price inflation is bad: cost of living constantly increases leading to a lower standard of living.**

**Price deflation is good: consumer prices falling leads to a higher standard of living, a reward for becoming more innovative and efficient at producing goods over time.**

Central bank manipulated interest rates cause artifical credit expansion. So free market interest rates that rise and fall along with demand for loans would prevent excessive credit creation, making catastrophic credit deflation a non issue.

Money printed out of nothing causes price inflation, so sound money would allow stable prices and slight price deflation. The more innovative we are as a society the more the cost of living falls which is a great thing and the way the world should work.

Solution = bitcoin + interest rates set by the free market in aggregate.

&gt; ...take a look at this question—which only 45 percent of people around the world got right:

&gt; Q. Do you think the following statement is true or false? “Buying a single company stock usually provides a safer return than a stock mutual fund.” 

&gt; Sixteen percent of people got it wrong. “Do not know” was chosen by 38 percent. In the U.S., 46 percent of workers got it right. Good for you, America—though Germany beat you handily. (The answer, in case you were wondering, is false.)

&gt; It was an inflation question that had the highest percentage of wrong answers, however. More than 20 percent of workers didn’t grasp how higher inflation hurts their buying power.

&gt; Across the board, though, workers didn’t seem to recognize the huge impact that basic changes in the labor force, technology and the climate will probably have on their retirement plans, said Catherine Collinson, president of the nonprofit Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies and executive director of the Aegon Center for Longevity and Retirement.

&gt; Many workers may well be in denial about how long they can actually work. The survey found workers generally plan to retire around age 65. “The sobering reality is that 39 percent of retirees globally retired sooner than planned,” according to the report. “Of those, 30 percent stopped working earlier than they had planned for reasons of ill health, and 26 percent due to unemployment/job loss.”

TL;DR: A large portion of people don't know how to prepare for retirement.

The article also shows a picture of the 3 question survey, including one that asks about inflation: *""Imagine that the interest rate on your savings account was 1 percent per year and inflation was 2 percent per year. After 1 year, how much would you be able to buy with the money in this account?"".*",finance

This morning I got laid off from my job. I used to make $75,000.00 a year as a Mechanical Engineer for a mid size oil service company.

I signed an "" At\- will"" employment contract, basically they gave me no reason as why I was laid off...I think it was not performance related, just a poor relationship with my direct supervisor. Every other manager was happy with my work. I had to block mysupervisor on LinkedIn, as she would look at my profile every week...and she followed me to my car once, yelled at me and asked why I was leaving, I had only gone to get my glasses from my car. Enough about that.

I'm a single female, living in Houston, TX. My family is in another country, and some relatives in the Austin TX area.

When I started last year in July, I decided to not contribute to retirement at this company as I wanted to get out of debt. I started with $92K in debt. I've paid off 2 credit cards, one student loan and most of my car.

I've managed to decrease my rent, my interest rates on my debt, and my car insurance. My rent went $1,320 to $917 starting April 2018, moved closer to work, saved time and gas.

Car insurance went from $250 to $180...once I moved my rate was gonna increase so I negotiated better rates elsewhere. I reduced the rate on one of my credit cards from 25&amp;#37; to 18&amp;#37;, still high but lower than before. I felt like I was doing the right things, and I just got fired and have little to no back up plans. I also stopped saving entirely, every extra cent was going either to school, or towards debt.

I used to make $4,690.00 a month, after taxes and deductions.

I cashed out the retirement money I had from a previous employer to pay off my credit card debt. Paid a hefty penalty when I did my taxes. So far, I've reached out to my network, updated my LinkedIn profile, started looking at jobs and saving the ones I have the skills and experience for, I will apply later today. I will file for unemployment also, and get some medical insurance, not COBRA.

I plan on doing UBER to make some money until I find another high paying job. The city I live in, you can make around $500 to $1500 just working weekends. Full time....I hope to make more than that.

personalfinance,Use savings to pay off loans instead of continuing toward PSLF?,"I'm thinking this question has an obvious answer, but I don't want to be missing something with a big decision.

I have $24,139 in student loans (eta: 6.55% interest) from grad school and I've been working toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness since January, 2014.  All of my loans are with FedLoan, I've been doing my employment certification and paying on income-based plans and the current estimate is that I'll be done in January, 2024.  

My payments recently went up significantly due to a job change and although I can afford them ($279 a month, which I know is peanuts compared to what some people are expected to pay), I've been looking at some numbers and I think I may have made a mistake going this route in the first place.  I've already paid in over $10k, mostly in interest, and I figured out that if my payments stay exactly at this number until I'm eligible for forgiveness, I'd end up paying about another $20k, so about 30k total.

Here's the other piece - I have about $22k in inheritance money that my mom put aside for me when my grandma passed in the mid-90s.  It's been sitting in a CD accruing not much interest, and I want to do something better with it.  The obvious thing would be to pay off my loans.  It would be about $34k total to pay them off now (between the balance and the amount I've already paid), so slightly more than I would end up paying if I stick with PSLF, but probably worth it to be debt-free (and that's if my payments stay exactly the same).  I've always thought of this money as being for a down payment on a house, but I also know that my ability to save for major expenses right now is impacted by my loan payments.

Is there anything more worthwhile I could be doing with this money as far as investment, or should I go ahead and get rid of the loans for good?

personalfinance,Taking Out a Loan To Manage Cash Flow?,"So in October I will be moving out of my Mom's house into an apartment with my girlfriend. I don't make great money but it's enough to move out. By the time I move out i should have 10k\-12k in my savings and enough in my checking for monthly expenses. I have 9k left in student loans and about 1k on a credit card, and my credit score is 756 I understand that moving out is very expensive and since I don't make great money i was thinking about taking out a secured savings loan. I work at a bank so i would get a good interest rate \(around 4&amp;#37;\). I just want to be able to still contribute to my Roth IRA, save money, pay off student loans and have disposable income. If anyone can share their opinion or have any alternative suggestions it would be greatly appreciated. If you need anymore information about my finances let me know. I know I'm not the greatest at explaining everything in detail.

P.S I know there is always the option of not moving out but my relationship is at the point where it is necessary that we take the next step.",finance
gaming,"Detroit: Becoming Human, my first review.","**Detroit: Become*Human** 

&amp;nbsp;

After handing over my credit card to the helpful GameStop employee, I was given a receipt for the purchase of my newly anticipated game, Detroit: Become Human. The only problem was that the game didn’t come out for another two weeks.  I left the store in a bit of confusion that day because I’m not usually one to pre-order a game. After getting home I decided to start watching trailers and read opinions online to help ease my mood and justify the $60.00 I just coughed up for a game I have never played. I got the call from my friend that the game was available for early pickup, my Friday at work just became an extremely long but exciting day. Once work ended, I raced over to GameStop to pick the game up and drove straight home right after. 

&amp;nbsp;

Once home, I opened the game and gently let my PS4 PRO suck the disk into the console. While the game started to download, I made it a point to get some comfy clothes on and get myself situated. Wife Happy? Check. Baby bathed and fed? Check. Cats given some attention? Check. All that was left was to wait for the game to download and I would be in a weekend filled with wonder and excitement. About an hour later I was able to start up the game. 

&amp;nbsp;


In the beginning of the game, I was in control of Connor, A new type of police android created to help hunt down deviants (deviants are androids who are essentially deviating from their programmed behavior). Once the game started I was already mesmerized by the details as well as the graphics in the first 5 minutes. The first encounter I had in the game was with the deviant android and the human girl it had taken hostage. During this mission, it is critical you save the life of the human by making good decisions. After perusing through the apartment looking for evidence, I was able to head outside to the confrontation with the deviant and child. Through my decision making I was able to talk the android into letting the girl go, but after promising no harm to the android, a team of snipers ended up taking him out. This grim ending to the android is what told me I am in for a ride of emotion and serious decision making. 

&amp;nbsp;
	

   We are also introduced to two more main characters, Markus and Kara. Kara is a housekeeper android and Markus is a caretaker android. All these characters stories intertwine and each one is dealing with a problem, and that problem is consciousness. While playing this game, seeing how the androids were treated really got to me. I know it is mentioned in the game itself, but an African American character named Rose who helps androids mentions that the same injustices were done to her people and therefore she helps androids when she can. This was kind of my first reaction, I know its only a video game, but I imagine the hate androids were getting in this game closely lined up with the hate that minorities are dealing with and watching it unfold as a character in the game made me really uncomfortable. 

&amp;nbsp;
	

  During my gameplay there were a few intense scenes that literally had my heart pumping. For instance, there are a few missions where you must make quick decisions on what to say and you just know the outcome can’t be good if you mess up. One scene in particular was when [Kara was being smuggled and had to stay with Rose. A police officer comes to the door and you have Rose’s son freaking out, Alice and Luther upstairs, and a mess of androids in the next room.](/spoiler) Having to deal with all of this on a time limit, and then having to deal with the police officer in the house looking around made me extremely tense. I have never played a game that made me feel this way before, and I loved it.

&amp;nbsp;


  In the end, the game took me about 14 hours to complete. I was able to keep everyone alive except for Luther. I made mostly decisions that I would have made in my real life as well, and I’m pretty sure this is why I had the outcome that I did.  I would give this game a 10/10 and would also recommend anyone on the edge of a decision whether to buy or not to pull the trigger if you have the money. I apologize for any grammar and spelling mistakes as this is my first review I have ever typed up. Thanks for reading.

I am renting it through a property manager for a 10% cut at $1,350/month netting me $1,215. Mortgage payment just bumped to $1,236/month because of taxes and such. Zillow value is $187,772 (I know its probably high), USAA says $175,000. 

Background, I am in the military and have been for 14 years come Thursday. I want to do 30 years but that is a long shot. Worst case scenario, I am out in 6 years with a military retirement of $2,312.50 before taxes. Retirement accounts aside because I can't obviously draw for a long time (I am 32). I will definitely get another job out of the military but I am not sure what. Therefore I don't really want to include mysterious income.  

Basically, I am looking for some smart advice on this. Do I keep it and just keep losing the few bucks a month (the market dictates that's what I can get) or unload it? The house is in decent shape but it was built in 2010 and it is going to need things eventually. I have good savings but not one I want to drain on upgrades and repairs if they come up. What am I missing? I am just afraid of both sides of the coin. I keep it and risk all the future invested money in the property, or I unload it and risk losing all of the income come 2040.

personalfinance,"Buying a new car tomorrow, starting to get stressed out","I am a recent college graduate (3 weeks ago) buying a brand new car tomorrow. It hasn’t hit me yet but now that tomorrow is the day, I’m starting to get worried that I haven’t approached this the right way. I plan on buying a 2018 Honda Civic EX, and my uncle is putting down $5,000 for me as a graduation gift. I can accept the monthly payment of about $300, but don’t want to spend much more. When I originally went to the dealership, they tried to tell me that I would be paying “x” amount exactly each month, but they wouldn’t tell me the interest rate, even though that monthly number apparently included the interest. I found this odd. I’m going in the morning to a bank to get numbers before I go to the dealership after to close.

1) I have an account with suntrust, checking and savings, and no other account. Never had a credit card. My uncle has great credit and said he would co-sign to get a better rate. The dealership said the rate wouldn’t be different, but should I bring this up at the bank tomorrow?
2) How can I know how much I will spend on car insurance each month? Can I get an estimate online?
3) anything else I should know from anyone who is experienced at negotiating/buying new cars. I want to get the lowest possible price for the car.
4) Should I threaten to walk by going to another Honda dealer or a different company like Toyota?

Banking,About saving money in a bank,"Hi,
first of all I need to say that I'm not from the US, so I don't know the banking language so well, but I have nowhere else to ask...

So, I saved some money and decided that it would be good to put it in a savings account (term savings account?) which I can't access for 6 months and then I withdraw more money than I put before, and the difference depends on the interest.

Now, I looked up some banks and most of them have an interest rate of 0.8%, 0.15% etc. But only one bank offers 3.6% for 6 months. Obviously this sounds much better but what's the catch?

example:
I put 1000eur in a bank today
6 months later I have 1018eur
(3.6 / 100 * 1000eur) / 2 (because it's 6mo, not 12)
equals 18eur...

personalfinance,"New job making $95k, looking for strategy to pay down ~$50k in debt and start retirement savings","Hello PF, I am a long time lurker of this subreddit and first time poster.  My brief story is that I was living abroad and running my own small business.  Eventually, the business couldn't support my living costs, I incurred some credit card debt, and moved back home.  During this time I started learning how to code and eventually got into a coding bootcamp (intensive 3 month training course).  

My plan before starting was to use some existing credit cards I had open to do a promotional 0% APR balance transfer for 12 months and get a job before the interest payments started up again.  However, it took about 6 months longer than planned to get a job, and those interest payments are back and I would like to pay them all off as soon as possible. 

My new job is making $95k as a software engineer in the Bay Area.  My living costs are around ~$1500 a month due to many meals eaten at the company and living with roommates.  

My debt is as follows:

* ~25k loan at 19% APR 
* ~9k cc at 17%
* ~6k cc at 16%
* ~7k loan at 10%
* ~5k cc at 0% (until August before interest starts again)

What is the optimal way to pay down the debt?  Is it better to tackle the higher interest rates first and continue from there?  I don't like debt at all, so I can see the ""relief"" of paying down the smaller debts first.  But I also enjoy the feeling of ""min-maxing"" and doing the most optimal solution.

My next question is how to start contributing to the company 401k.  I don't have any retirement savings, but I do have a $2k emergency fund.  There is a 4% match in the 401k, but I don't believe I can start contributing to it for another couple of months since I just started.  Is it best to contribute the maximum matched amount as soon as possible?  How does that play in to my strategy of paying down my debt?  Thanks in advance for any advice.",finance

I am a long-time lurker and crypto enthusiast (bought my first BTC in 2014, never got rich but I wasn't really interested much in wealth, what got me in was the tech). I am a software engineer and created my startup 1 year ago in France with some traction starting to appear (we won a big national contest here, backed by the French public investment bank). Of course I am in debt ; )

I follow the crypto communities and trends now, albeit not so closely anymore. I was at Vivatech in Paris last week and got a nice Vechain coin (the goodie) from the Vechain team. They were exposing at LVMH :)

Some bad news struck me a year ago when I learned I have an incurable autoimmune disease, /r/ankylosingspondylitis . It's basically super painful and only symptoms are treated. I've had growing pains for 4 years, so it's good to put a name on it and I am coming at peace with it, I will not yield.

To cut to the chase : I am bit annoyed of the slowness of

1. Medical research
2. Awareness about AS and other devastating autoimmune diseases

I still have the will and energy (plus pills and biologic treatments) to be an entrepreneur, but for how long ?

I want to help and get involved in raising funds and awareness to fight those PITA diseases. One of those affect someone you know.

I think cryptocurrency has a lot of potential for that, and that's where I would like your feebdack.

I would like to get  your opinion about :

- Creating a French foundation / nonprofit association to fight auto immune diseases as a first step. Go international with contacts later on.
- Raise funds with crypto (I'm just targeting reasonable amounts, very far from what some ICOs raise)
- Make absolutely sure those funds cannot be diverted by any party or entity other that the nonprofit, except for paying decent salaries to full-time employees
- Set up a system with total transparency about how those funds are used, and why not how some decisions of the association may be taken by those who contribute regularly

I have no time to code these things, but I'd like to become one of the public figures showing that it's both possible to fight these diseases and lead a life filled with hope &amp; entepreneurship.

I know some people in big nonprofits and they hate the lack of transparency and the bureaucracy it has become to move forward. We could show them how they could easily be ""disrupted"" too. 

So what do you guys think ? Can we make a change ? Is it a bad idea ? Do you know some similar ideas / existing solutions ?  What would be the challenges, what would be the easy stuff ?
 
Thank you so much for reading and for your help.

personalfinance,Another Study Finds that Keeping Up with the Joneses is a Thing that Leads to Bankruptcy,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-29/keeping-up-with-the-joneses-neighbors-of-lottery-winners-are-more-likely-to-go-bankrupt

Focus on yourself. Check out The Millionaire Next Door and Get Rich Slowly — most people get rich because they save rather than spend. This is what happens when you spend to keep up appearances:

&gt;As if you needed proof that trying to keep up with the Joneses isn’t a good idea, here it is: Close neighbors of lottery winners in Canada tended to spend more on conspicuous goods, put more money into speculative investments such as stocks, borrow more money—and eventually declare bankruptcy.

&gt;“The larger the dollar magnitude of a lottery prize of one individual in a very small neighborhood, the more subsequent bankruptcies there will be from other individuals in that neighborhood,” says the latest version of a working paper from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia by Sumit Agarwal of Georgetown University, Vyacheslav Mikhed of the Philadelphia Fed, and Barry Scholnick of the University of Alberta. It’s titled: “Does the Relative Income of Peers Cause Financial Distress? Evidence from Lottery Winners and Neighboring Bankruptcies.”

&gt;An earlier version of their paper got a flurry of publicity in 2016 by presenting evidence from bankruptcy filings that neighbors were trying to keep up with the lottery winner in their midst. A telltale sign was that they raised spending on things that everyone in the neighborhood could see, such as cars, but not on indoor items like furniture. 

&gt;The new version adds some important insights, co-author Mikhed explained in an email. One is that neighbors who filed for bankruptcy tended to have more of their assets in high-risk investments such as stocks vs. low-risk ones like insurance and cash. That’s consistent with the theory that they were hoping to make a killing in the market and even things up with the lottery winner. Another new finding: Neighbors of lottery winners tended to borrow more, compared with Canadians who weren’t neighbors of lottery winners. 

&gt;The researchers focused on small lottery winnings, ranging from C$1,000 to C$150,000 (roughly $800 to $120,000). One reason for the focus on small winners was that winners of bigger jackpots tended to move out of their neighborhoods. A second was that winners of small prizes were more likely to keep their good luck a secret. The researchers theorized that people might not amp up their own spending so much if they knew that a lottery prize was the reason for their neighbor’s sudden prosperity.
&gt;The economists collected data on 7,337 lottery prizes from an unnamed Canadian province, dating from 2004 to 2014. They narrowed their search to the effects on neighbors within areas that share six-digit postal codes, which have a median of just 13 households. They found that a prize equal to the median annual income (C$29,000) tended to raise the bankruptcy rate of the neighbors by 6.6 percent.

&gt;One heartening sign: There was no evidence that the people who filed for bankruptcy were especially likely to list gambling as a cause of their financial distress. That indicates that they weren’t superstitiously buying more lottery tickets in hopes that the neighbor’s good luck would rub off on them.

&gt;Previous research had shown that neighbors of lottery winners spent more on conspicuous consumption. Theoretically, though, they could have done so in ways that didn’t jeopardize their financial health—say, by working more to increase their incomes. The new study shows that neighbors—some of them, anyway—did indeed imperil their financial health to keep up with the Joneses.",finance
personalfinance,Confusion over adding P60 information to self assessment tax return (UK),"Hi all, 

I'm having some trouble completing my 17/18 tax return. I became permanent in my organisation in Novemer 2017, so this is my final self assessment tax return. I have input my earnings up to 31st October, and then, as the form prompts, put my gross pay and tax paid in for the remainder of the year. 

The amount it estimates is CONSIDERABLY higher than I was expecting, and doesn't seem to make any sense to me at all. If I remove the P60 information from my self\-assessment, the amount owed is halfed and looks much more realistic based on my earnings. Looking on HMRC's system, they already have my pay/tax information from my P60 in the system, so should I submit my tax return without including this?

Something that allows people to safely loan out their money while reducing default risk in a way where the interest rate is set by the free market.

2) some form of recurring payment or direct debit mechanism. An automated way to send someone a pre-determined amount of bitcoin automatically on pre-set date.

personalfinance,Finally have my feet under me financially and need advice on how to tackle my debt ($52k),"I graduated from college 1.5 years ago and I’ve got a solid job making $96k a year. I have $52k dollars in student loans I need to pay off. My minimum payment is $830/month, with interest rate around 4.5%. I pay $1000/month in rent, $360/month on car+insurance. Those are really my only hard recurring costs. I’ve saved up about $10k in cash and I have $5k in my 401k. I’m splitting 6% into a Roth and traditional. 

My main question with this post is what’s the best way to approach paying off the $52k. I’ve read Dave Ramsey’s total money makeover which I didn’t totally agree with. He suggests keeping $1k in cash which I don’t think is smart. For example I had a knee surgery this year I didn’t expect and had to pay ~$5k over the course of a month or two. I would have been quite screwed with only $1k in reserve. But at this point I have $10k which is a pretty comfortable floor. 

My thoughts are to live comfortably, spending freely as I please, and any money I have left over each month, spend towards my student loans and maintain a $10k balance month to month. Is that a good plan? Has anybody else had a similar situation and have advice? I don’t want to live like a complete pauper, I’d like to take advantage of having a decent salary while I can before I get a family and all that good stuff, but I’d also like to pay these down as quickly as I can.

https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8k10ve/attacking_debt_1_year_goal/

Posted 2 weeks ago about a plan to attack debt.  Looking at my situation probably going to keep my car, considered selling it but deciding to keep it since the interest rate is low.

I am trying to decide whether or not to pay off my debt immediately and up front or put money off for quarterly taxes and reduce what I can put towards debt.

Income :

8000 a month until September.

8750 a month Sept - Jan

9450 a month Jan - May

Possibly getting a 5-10% bonus somewhere around the holiday.

My question revolves around taxes and debts. My consumer debt is roughly 18,000-19,000 in loans and cc debt that is average 19.4% interest.

Expenses roughly 3500.

Have budgeted to put away 25% ($2000) a month away towards quarterly taxes since I heard there was a penalty.  The penalty though I just read is around 3%.  I am wondering if I should put that $2000 directly towards the debt for these next few months, skip filing for June/September since I just started this 1099 job, and attack my debt with $4500-5000 a month for the next 5 months then start saving for taxes come Nov/Dec. My income will be increasing so I can use that extra bump to put it all towards my taxes.

Does that seem like a smart move or should I just pay estimated quarterly taxes for these upcoming months?",finance

personalfinance,My girlfriends identity was stolen by her mom and used to open 2 fraudulent credit cards,"My GF’s mom has been stealing money from her ever since she got her first job at 14. She’d take extra for insurance, and use her paycheck as a cushion for her own finances. This (among many other things) has been happening basically non stop for the past 5 years. Another fact to note: her mom has an obsession with credit cards and has used them to pay off debts, other credit cards, and to buy more things than she can afford. There’s a family dynamic that ties into this as well that I can’t fully explain because I don’t know all of the details. (What I do know is that her mom’s credit is ruined completely by various collections, late rent payments, and awful repayment history.) All of this started coming to a head 2 years ago. My GF (had just turned 18) had no credit to purchase a vehicle, so her parents urged her to open a card to start building her credit so that she could qualify for an auto loan in the future. Her dad co-signed on the vehicle and the credit card against her wishes. Over that next year her mom memorized her credit card #, CVV code, and exp. date. She used my GF’s card CONSTANTLY. She’d regularly max it out (it was a $1000 limit) and make promises to pay it back. She used it for literally most purchases she made. Once we started dating it became blatantly obvious to me that her mom was using her for money. My GF finally got fed up with it and told her mom that she was closing the card so that she couldn’t use it anymore because she didn’t want her credit ruined. Her mom quietly complied. So we went to the credit union a week later to close the card and to open one with a small limit at a different credit union that my GF does all of her banking through. (Her mom has no access to her main account anymore) we closed the card with no problems, but when we went to open the new card at the other bank, they pulled her credit and showed us the credit report. This is when our hearts really dropped. Her mom had fraudulently opened 2 other cards (one was a 2500 limit, one was 500) and tried to open 3 others under my GF’s identity. The $2500 limit was maxed out , and there was $260 on the other one. This is a huge blow to us in what has already been a stressful year.

personalfinance,What is the safest way to invest some money without high risk or micromanaging?,"When I read questions and advice here, and in other areas, i often see mention that it is unwise to let your regular savings account get too big, or put too much money towards paying off your house, because that money would get you a much higher return ""on the market"". I've even seen mention of percentages. \(as in ""dont pay off your house if you have a 4&amp;#37; rate, because on the market you will get a \~7&amp;#37; return\)

Can somebody explain to me what that means? is that just referring to stocks? That advice and percentage implies this is a guaranteed return, but stocks seem inherently risky if you dont know what you are doing, and plenty of people get no return. Not as fool proof as just paying your house down early. Help me out.

My wife and I earn about $73k a year together. Our only debt is our house \(owe about 254k\). Interest rate is 4.25&amp;#37;. payment is 1500 a month. I budget our expenses carefully, and include basically any possible expense as if it were a guaranteed expense, so we dont get caught off guard. I also budget a few hundred dollars for savings, so it cant get spent.  After all the expenses, we have about a 1k per month excess. currently i pay an extra $300 or $600 towards the house every month, and then put the rest in savings. Should i be putting that $\~600 in ""the market""?

personalfinance,Putting Money from Adjusted Tax Exemptions into Savings.,"**Situation:** My wife and I both work salary jobs and file jointly. I claim 2 Federal / 0 State exemptions on my W4, she claims 0 / 0. Georgia is delaying some refunds up to 90 days or more. Surprise: we are due a refund and still haven't received it. We're not particularly thrilled with having had to pay our federal owed amount immediately, but the state can hold onto what we're owed, interest free.

**Our NotAnAccountant Idea:** We know, and budget with, what we're taking home currently. We want to up our W4 Allowances, each, to 2/2. The extra amount we received would be funneled into an out\-of\-sight\-out\-of\-mind joint savings account. We'd then use that money at the end of the year to pay our tax bill.

She's gung\-ho about it, I'm always in need of hearing and evaluating all sides. My biggest hesitation is the obvious risk of having that extra money being there for the taking.

personalfinance,Out of a job for 10 years. I want to get back on track. (Long Story),"I am not exactly in the best mental state so please forgive me I do not have my life together. This is a Throw Away account.

I'm 39, Transgender and live in the US, with my parents.

I went to a Tech college in September of 1998 and ended up quitting halfway due to the poor resources the school provided and wanting a different career path.

I worked at a pizza place for 4 years and then in 2003 my best friend's wife died. I moved to his home for a month trying to help him get his life back on track. While there I figured out that I was Transgender.

Made some big changes and I was finally starting to feel better about myself and then I met a girl. I've always been attracted to women even though I felt I should be one myself. I told her I was transgender and she still wanted to stay with me. I started taking Testosterone Blockers and Estrogen and we moved away to another state together. 

I went back to my tech roots and started working at a pretty big tech company and she, at a Cell Phone company. 

My school bills were finally starting to get paid.

I bought a car against my wishes because my truck died. She started cheating on me with someone and told me she didn't want to be with another woman. 

I found out she cheated and we talked about it. I told her I would stop my transition to female so we stayed together.

Tensions rose and we eventually broke up a year later. I was pretty devastated and moved back home with my parents.

I got a job at home delivering car parts again. I was fired from my job.

The car I bought was repossessed less than a year after I bought it because I no longer had a job. I haven't heard a word from the company since October of 2007 so I'm not sure where I stand with these people.

I stopped paying all of my bills due to lack of income.

I started working online making almost nothing, it was enough to buy some food and pay one of my parents bills. I saved up enough to buy a car for $2000 from a used car dealership. 

I was making enough to pay the insurance, food, hormones and began taking therapy.

I started running the online business my friend hired me at and money started flowing more freely. I was making close to minimum wage at the job and then the boss took back over and business tanked again.

I ended up leaving in 2011 because the pay dried up to less than $15 a week. 

I changed my name and gender markers on my identification. I have yet to change my birth certificate. 

In 2007 I owed: 

* $300 to Washington Mutual on a credit card. 
* $1800 federal school loan
* $2100 to the school itself
* I had my car repoed and they never sent me a bill after that.

Since then. 

* I stopped receiving collection mail from the Washington Mutual card.

* The Federal School loan went to collections and I haven't heard from them in years.

* The $2100 I owed they ended up taking me to court and I apparently now owe them $6000.

* Still haven't heard anything from the Repo'd car.

I recently got State ran Medical and am getting hormones again and having my blood tested regularly.

Early this year I injured my foot and my doctor can't seem to figure out what is wrong with it. I've gained a lot of weight without being able to lose it because my foot starts hurting pretty badly when I exercise.

In 5 days I'm starting therapy again.

I'm afraid that I will lose my insurance if I start working and won't be able to get hormones and or any surgeries/procedures I want to get done.

My parents fight about me constantly. I'm not working so I try to contribute by doing everyone's dishes and keeping the house clean. 

I'm extremely depressed and afraid to go out of the house alone. We live in one of the poorest counties in the country and it can be pretty podunk around here.

I'm hopeful that therapy will help me figure things out.

However financially I have no idea what to do. I know anything that had to do with school loans I'll have to pay off.

I don't have any records. I don't even know how to check on the current state of all the things I owe. 

I changed my name and didn't report it to any credit companies or companies I owe money to. But since I don't have any records I don't even know who I would tell anymore.

When I do start getting money again my #1 priority is to get rid of any and all debt and then build up my credit.

After years and years of climbing up my career ladder, I have finally landed a job that is paying me enough for me not to feel like i'm constantly trying to swim to the surface to gasp for air every paycheck. I was presented with my W4 and while I didn't think I did anything different than before, I went ahead and filled it out. What's odd is, the allowance field on the withholding cert \(Field 5\) ultimately calculated out to 18. This seemed really weird. Here's my family's stats

**Pay = 56k\-66k range \(shhhh it's a lot for me\)**

personalfinance,Quick question on calculating the rate of return on paying out a home mortgage.,"First time poster here so I hope I'm doing this right.

This might seem simple to you guys, but as I go into the home purchasing process I want to make sure all of my ducks are in a row. Should I be using both the appreciation of the home itself, and the shrinking of the principal against the interest rate when calculating RoI?

So for example if a home is appreciating 4% per year, and my interest rate is 5% of the principal, wouldn't investing more into the principal be a 9% rate of return while the loan is active(4% - -5% = 4% + 5% = 9%)?

I know this is overly simplistic, but to me it seems like once you've decided to take out a loan, you are going to have a hard time beating the rate of return of paying it off as soon as possible. I have a feeling I might not be properly calculating the compound interest side of things, so I was wondering if the financial gurus here could help me understand what my money is doing for me when I invest in a home vs something like stocks and bonds.

personalfinance,[Advice Needed] What's the best way to put $2k a month towards school loans if interest accrues everyday?,"Hey everyone,

  
My girlfriend is looking to put an extra $2k a month to wipe out her private loans. The interest is about 10&amp;#37; and her standard monthly payment is $173 a month.

I told her to find out if the $2k extra will go straight to the principal payment. Well she got an email today and found out the interest accrues everyday. Here's the message she got when she asked: 

&gt;Unfortunately, that is one option that you cannot request. The interest on your student loan account is calculated using the simple interest formula, meaning interest accrues daily, based on your current principal balance and interest rate. Your payments are applied first to satisfy the outstanding accrued interest, and any remaining amount of your payment is then applied to the principal balance.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;Since interest accrues daily, there is always interest outstanding. Sending more than the monthly payment amount every 30 days will reduce your principal balance faster. This may result in your loan being paid in full prior to the expected payoff date. Sending payments more than 30 days apart will result in additional interest outstanding.

I assume paying $2k after she pays her bill is still the right move to make here? Or should she just pay $2,173 every time her bill is due?

personalfinance,Am I exempt from the W-4 with my first internship?,"I have an ~9 week internship this summer. I am a student at university for the other parts of the year and this will be the first time I've held a job that actually paid a significant amount of money. I am 19 and have never dealt with anything in this realm ever before.

Before I start the job, I'm required to fill out a couple forms, one of which is the W-4. It's prefaced with a section ""Exemption from withholding"".

My question is, am I exempt from withholding?

I'm trying to walk through this myself but want to make sure I'm not missing anything. 

I am exempt if ""For 2017 you had a right to a refund of all federal income tax withheld because you had no tax liability, and for 2018 you expect a refund of all federal income tax withheld because you expect to have no tax liability.""

So I'm pretty sure that I had no tax liability in 2017 (assuming I'm read this link correctly https://www.irs.gov/faqs/estimated-tax/penalty-questions/penalty-questions) because I never touched a single form last year and had nothing to do with taxes.

But the thing is, how do I know if I have tax liability for 2018? Because if I have no tax liability for 2018, then that means I didn't file an income tax return or my 2018 total tax is zero, but don't I need to know my total tax this year (which hasn't even happened) to determine if I have tax liability? 

It seems circular to me so I'm not sure if I can claim exemption or if I will need to fill out the entire form.

EDIT: Also for reference, my parents can claim me as their dependent (and I'm pretty sure they already do) and using the W-4 withholding calculator, my total 2018 anticipated income tax is 0$ but I don't think I did everything correctly so I'm too sure on that number.",finance

*You may buy up to five extra vacation days each Calendar Year.

*One day of purchased vacation is equal to your biweekly scheduled hours \(as of the open enrollment salary “freeze date”\) divided by 10. For example, if you are scheduled to work four 10\-hour days per week for a total of 80 hours biweekly, one day of purchased vacation will be paid to you as 1/10 of 80 hours, or 8 hours, rather than as one 10\-hour day.*

So my question is, how do others get such lower interest rates? We have no bankruptcies, two credit cards with approximately $30k limits that we pay off every month. Is there something else we can do to get lower interest rates? Is there something we’re missing? 

Please let me know if any other information would be helpful.",finance
personalfinance,I found out newer employees are getting reimbursed car mileage to and from work but I’m only getting reimbursed one way. What do I do?,"I live in Fresno California and I also work for a company where its office is located in Fresno. I get paid minimum wage and I get reimbursed for using my vehicle to transport clients or for driving out of town. I work with the developmentally disabled and the guy I take care of lives out of town 40 miles away. I’ve been working 8 hour shifts 32-40 hours a week every week since at least May of last year. When my manager first sent me to this location they told me I would be paid gas mileage at a rate of $0.50 a mile. I asked if they paid both ways or one way. She quickly told me the company only pays one way. 

Today I was training my co-worker who also comes from Fresno. I don’t know how the subject got to pay but she mentioned she got paid both ways. It turns out they pay her 40 miles to work and 40 miles back home. I thought they only paid workers both ways if they are normally scheduled in town and are only covering a shift for a day. But she told me she’s been paid both ways for over 6 months and that she works 3-5 shifts a week at my location. It also turns out another staff member that comes out here gets paid both ways. I feel cheated and disrespected as anyone would feel and I have no idea what to do. The three of us all drive out of Fresno and do the exact same job for minimum wage. I’ve been working out of town 6 months longer than them and the entire time they’ve been getting paid both ways. I don’t think this is a new rule I think they just wanted to cheat me or they were playing ignorance. If I was actually supposed to be paid out of town and back I don’t know if they will back pay me the miles or if they will tell me I accepted the miles I was given and I’m screwed. I’m sorry for everything being scattered or if what I wrote comes out confusing I’m just completely stressed out. I haven’t spoken to them yet either I plan on doing that Friday I just don’t know where to begin. 

Update: I spoke with my manger today and her supervisor happen to be there. Turns out my manager was in the wrong the entire time and now my coworkers are responsible for the reimbursement. Wish I had better news but now I know that this company will do anything to collect checks from these disabled people. My clients house has been understaffed severely for almost a year now so I guess she was desperate enough to lie to them and she’s was hoping she could get them off the schedule before anyone found out, or she’s just playing ignorance and will say they were supposed to put one way. Either way it seems the issue now is what can my coworkers do to protect themselves from the mistake of my manager.

personalfinance,Mortgage rate question,"Hi guys, thanks in advance for any insight you can provide. 

Long story short: I put in an offer on a house on April 12th, it was accepted the next day, April 13th. I sent the contract to the loan officer I was working with. He had quoted me a 4.5% interest rate that week, and locked me into that rate once I sent him the contract. The contract included that I would be closing on Monday, June 4th (the sellers picked the date). 

They've been very difficult to get ahold of and very slow during this whole process, but I digress. Last week, he asks me if they needed to push the closing back to next month (June) because my rate was going to expire on May 31st. I say yes because my closing is June 4th like I told him in April. He assured me that it was no problem, he'd extend the rate lock for me (no mention of fee, etc.). 

I get my closing disclosure yesterday morning, everything looks good, I sign it. I get another email tonight, asking me to sign another closing disclosure. I look it over and this disclosure includes a lock extension fee of $674! I'm shocked and confused about where this arbitrary number came from. My rate only needed to be extended by 2 business days. Plus I went on their website again to get a ""free quote"" and today's rate is lower than what I am locked into and being charged for. 

I emailed and left him a voicemail, but I wanted to get some input from you guys. Am I going to have to pay $674?! Where did this amount come from?! Can I just lock into a new rate (which is lower than mine anyway) so I don't have to pay this? I don't want this to delay my closing in any way. 

Thanks for your help.",finance

personalfinance,401K vs not doing it,"Before anyone says not saving towards your 401K is dumb -- hear me out. I do not have a lot of knowledge on how 401K works and how it would be better vs just saving on my own. I am a very frugal person and I personally think having money on hand (emergency fund) before I contribute so much or all my money to 401K. I know so many people contribute to it but my mindset is at this point. Why contribute so much now (I'm 21) when from now until I am 30, I would need to have money for possible car, house, kids, money for them, etc etc rather than if I put money away, I would need to take out loans for them. Am I making sense?

Here is what I do know...
-401K lets me put money in without paying taxes UNTIL when I retire, I would have to pay taxes on money that I take out.... so doesn't that defeat the purpose of not paying taxes before retirement?
-I know it reduces my taxable income, but how? And when it does, how much would I be saving?
-I have been told feds take 25%, correct?
-And then states take out a percentage, what is IN state tax?

OKAY so here is my main question. I am a newly professional. First full-time job coming up. I make 56,000 a year. Don't own any property, vehicles, etc etc. I do plan on getting health and dental insurance through my company. I am declaring ""2"" on my withholdings. Originally, I was gonna only put 2% towards 401K and just save money on my own. I need someone to help me do that math... I want to have a sufficient amount on hand at all times in case of EMERGENCY and for when I need to make big purchases (I rather not take out loans and pay towards interest). 

Someone please help me and I hope everything I wrote made sense. What would be my SAVINGS be on hand if I didn't contribute towards 401K or if I just contributed a small amount vs if I contributed 10% or 12% towards 401K?",finance

personalfinance,"Doing pretty good but want to do more [buy SPY/REIT, buy rental property, or do nothing different]?","Hello,

I'm 33 years, been struggling to get to where I am, but situation is finally ""clean slate"" both health \(lost some weight, feeling relaxed about the future\), relationships and employment. Unfortunately getting too comfortable makes me lazy, so I want to get back to my old hustling self, taking action and all that. I make 100\-110K a year, likely to increase a bit before retirement, $150k invested between retirement and non\-retirement accounts, paid off reliable car that should last 10\+ years, and a paid off condo worth about $95k that I can't rent out per the HOA. I've been watching a lot of Dave Ramsey and BiggerPocket podcasts lately, would like to set myself up to provide for my new family, building legacy wealth and all that. Ideally, paying college tuition should be pocket change for me, 20 years from now. 

Wonder if ya'll would provide input on what I consider to be my possible scenarios: 

\(A\) Get HELOC on the condo, pay $4\-500 out of my own pocket for the loan. Use the HELOC funds as down payment to finance real estate investments in duplexes, fourplexes or 8plexes. A fourplex around where I live would require $30\-40k down, and cash flow about $250/month.  If I buy two, I'll cashflow $500, but spend $650 a month servicing the HELOC. 

\(B\) Sell the condo, buy a duplex \($20k down\), live in one side rent the other, and buy two additional fourplexes \(60k down\). Essentially the same as above, at 7\-8cap\-rate, it'll be $80k invested \($15k leftover\) for $500 monthly cashflow, but without the HELOC debt servicing. The overall rate of return over 20\-year period should exceed 16&amp;#37;, yielding $680k at a 20\-year exit. 

\(C\) The least attractive option, but still possibly better than the 2\-3&amp;#37; annual appreciation in real estate, but an option I consider just so I won't feel like my $95k condo money is sitting idly tied up not earning any returns... I could HELOC maybe $70k on the condo at 5.5&amp;#37; interest rate, pay $740/month, invest it all in REIT or SPY earning 10\-13&amp;#37;. In ten years  the HELOC will be paid off out of my own pocket, and after 20 years, the investment should be worth $470k. 

\(D\) Sell the condo, become a renter, invest the $87k I'll net, it'll be worth $580k after 20 years, but I'll be paying market rate rent for the rest of my life.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Comparing Crypto to the Sports Cards Market.,"How come no one ever compares Crypto to the sports cards market?   I'm not sure about other countries, but in the US in the late 90s, the Sports cards market was out of control, 

People are hooked comparing it to the dot com boom.  

The non believers compare it to pogs, spinners, tulips, and all types of nonsensical markets, but no one compares it to sports cards. 

At one point , sports cards were worth more than the US stock market.  It was ridiculously ridiculous.    Crypto however hasn't even reached that level of Shillness yet.  There was a sports cards shop everywhere. Literally. 

It even pumped harder after that once they introduced PSA graded. 

Cards that were graded based on quality and condition that used to get sealed into hard air tight plastic cases.   If you owned a 10 it would pump the value of the card sometimes 10,000%.    

New Sports cards brands were popping up every week starting at stupendous amounts of money per pack. Sometimes $200 a pack, 

How do you just print new cards , shill the crap out of them, and they are instantly worth millions??     Speculative much? Lol. 

This is the same thing that happens in crypto.   Sure we got some cryptos with real use cases, real teams etc etc, but for the most part...there's a whole bunch of shit garbage new coins stuffed into the space every week. 

- *ICO SOLD OUT*
- *Partnerships*
- *look at our lead dev...he's a god. This is why this shit is now worth $2 each*

- *P.S. we forgot to mention the project isnt expected to complete until 2021*


Just printed shit, after print shit....

Just like sports cards!   Some crypto have even went as far as acting like how the contents of sports card packs acted.    Take XtraBytes for example "" limited giveaways of XFUEL"" just like ""limited cards printed .... 1 in 100 packs gives you a special glowing shiney card"". 


But.. But.  When sports cards tanked...it really tanked. Some lost 99.99% of their value. 

Crypto hasn't tanked fuly yet. BTC is up 500% from April 2017.  

Crypto is at least sometimes the same as the Sports cards market

investing,US dollar value - collapse/depression- Inflation vs deflation,"At the start of the 2008 financial crisis circa early March, the US dollar increased in value and continued so until about late 2008/early 2009 when the Fed started buying mortgage-backed securities etc. After that the dollar declined and remained volatile for 2-3 years before rising again. According to Dent, the dollar was the safe haven asset during the initial tumultuous period, however Schiff argues it rose on account of the fact it was already at an historic low and was due for a correction regardless.

After 9-11 the dollar went up in value sharply (probably related but not sure) but then at the start of 2002, as the dot com bubble burst and the stockmarket collapsed, the dollar was crushed and lost 25% of its value in a year and continued to decline 40%+ until its lowest point in 2008 before the financial crisis.  

So how can Dent argue the dollar will be the safe haven asset in the next collapse/depression when it wasn't in 2002 and arguably wasn't in 2008? What am I missing?",finance

personalfinance,Looking for second thoughts on next steps in life to achieve goal.,"Alright folks,  gotta a fair bit of options here and things to talk about. Figured I'd throw them up for second opinions. I definitely do not claim to have any thing figured out to the extent I probably should, otherwise I wouldn't be here I suppose.  Anyway, lets jump in.

**Where I am and what I've got:**

I'm a journeyman electrician in Atlanta. Hourly pay is $31.65 typically but right now I'm working as a foreman and making $34.79 for 59 hours a week for the next year. I get paid by the week so on my original pay scale thats about $850 a week in net pay for 40 hours. Current pay and hours is right at $1,500 a week. Once this job completes there is reason to believe I'll get to keep the position and pay raise if it goes as it has for most, just back to a normal 40 hour week for the most part. 

Currently I have $30k in my checkings account as I was getting ready to buy a house. My actual savings account has just accumulated from a ""keep the change"" type deal. Has about $3k in it. My union/company vangaurd account just got started a few years ago and is up to about $11k. If i'm honest here, I don't know a lot about it, how to use it or if I'm capable of adding to it. I did have Vangaurd manage it though and get it set up for more risk while it didn't have a lot in it. Would love some tips or pointers here if you've got em.

**Current expenses**

I've been fortunate to not have to rent or forced into a home purchase while my pay has been going up a decent amount over the last 7 years. So yeah, none of that. 

My car will be paid off in December but for the moment, payments are $366 a month. I have a company truck and gas card now so I hardly ever get to drive it. 

Not married and no kids. I have a gf of 3 years who'll be moving with me, should I buy a house.

Student loans! Alright, I've been admittedly pretty dumb with this but it seemed like my only option at the time and I've yet to start digging out. I have roughly $30k in student loans to conquer. When I started out and was making $10 an hour, there just didn't seem any way to make a dent on these loans and also save for a car, and at the time, I thought a house as well. I went with income based repayment but now I make enough so the IBR is up to around $300 a month. I let my parents handle signing up for the loans when I was young and to me, they're kinda weird. There are around 15 loans of $2k with varying rates between 5&amp;#37; and 6&amp;#37; and they're a mix between federal and private. No doubt there are some moves to be made here so I'd love to hear some options and experiences.

Other than that, just phone bill, internet bill, insurance, groceries, union dues. Normal items. Minus gas, I suppose.

**Where I want to go**

In the last month I've been house shopping. I had everything figured out as far as expenses for what I wanted.. I thought. Was going for maybe a $180k or less house, between $15k and $18k down payment. Had the loan a few steps away from pre approval and had saw a couple houses with my realtor. My real wish was to be close to water as I love to fish and be out in the woods but I knew that was out of my price range.

Then, we had memorial day weekend. I went with my gf to a family friends lake house. They purchased the land when they were younger and just slowly built it up over time. First just a camper. Then some storage buildings. Then slowly built their 2nd house. It isn't anything super extravagant, but it let them be where they wanted to be and seems to give them a lot of satisfaction and joy, which I understand and would feel as well. It really got me inspired and wanting to try my hand at the same.

Now with that in mind, I've started to consider buying a much more modest house and potentially trying to get a small plot of unrestricted, undeveloped lake land in the future. I would still like to buy a house this year if possible. Its not a necessity though. My family does have an extra acre and half they offered to let me build a house on but from what I understood, its not cost effective to build your own home right now and also, I just wanted move a little closer towards the city to lessen the commute. 

As far as building my main house, or the lake property, I have some brick and block masons in my family that would gladly help with the foundation. Gf's family has framers who have voiced their willingness to help. Obviously I'm an electrician and have electrician friends but we're not residential. Would need to see if somebody would allow us to work along side them since we can't pull the permit for that. Anyways, just trying to say I have help potential help and cost cutting available if we went that route.

**Summary of goals**

Buy a house in the near future

Be able to get some lake land and develop it over time.

Pay off student loans.

Figure out Vangaurd and investment possibilities.

personalfinance,Paycheck shortage,"I work for Kroger making $9.20 an hour. I recently received my first paycheck which I noticed was unusually small for the hours I worked. I worked 16 hours this pay period making $9.20 an hour. I love in Virginia and have been told taxes are 10%. So according to what I calculated I should’ve made $137.42 but I only got $67.42, what should I do and is my math right or did I leave something out?

Kroger doesn’t give me a pay stub at all
I’ve calculated federal income tax and I make less than $14,000 a year so my income tax is around 10% for federal and some said 3-5% for state. So either way im still being shorted like $50. I don’t belong to a union and don’t have any other expenses such as Medicare. I’m on my parents insurance for everything so nothing else comes out of my paycheck besides state and federal. Like I said I don’t get a pay stub because Kroger has poor management

personalfinance,Mystery student loan increase.,"Today I was checking my credit score and noticed I took a hit for my student loans, apparently my federal loan amount increased by $698. 

On my end: No payments have been missed or late, payment amount did not secretly increase and is currently at $257/mo, originally owed $1957 but now owe $2655.

I called my loan company for information and they said they have nothing on their end to show if a balance has increased like I say, so no way to tell if this is accurate or not. 

Is this normal? Am I missing some understanding here and if not what can I do?

personalfinance,UPDATE: I'm a victim of credit card fraud. Scammers had merchandise shipped to me so the bank says the charge is valid.,"[Original Post](https://reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8m1do8/im_a_victim_of_credit_card_fraud_scammers_had/)

Someone suggested e-mailing an executive at the bank and that was spot on. I got responses over the weekend. First that they were looking into it, then a message apologizing for the experience saying that I'll be credited and someone from his team will follow up with me. 

In the meantime the chargeback response documents came in the mail. The text on the supporting documents is tiny and mostly illegible. The envelope they arrived in has a handwritten address, so I don't think this can be attributed to an unsupervised print queue that was machine stuffed. I can make out that the gist of PayPal's response is that the items were shipped to my address. 

I did get a call from the executive office this morning. The rep was polite and apologetic. She said that it doesn't look like the fraud team did the normal followup that is expected in a case like this. She said that the credits issued are permanent, and I will not be re-billed. They also refunded the annual fee. I mentioned that the docs I received in the mail weren't legible. She brought them up and said that they just say the items were shipped to me, and it shouldn't have been considered reason enough to re-bill since they already knew that. 

I asked what to do with the shoes. She said I could try to work out a return with PayPal, but regardless of the outcome, I won't be billed. I will still probably file a CFPB complaint against PayPal since they have been impossible to deal with.",finance

personalfinance,Wife as co-signer on student loan refi,"My wife and I are exploring refinancing the student loans that our parents are carrying on our behalf into our own names. We both have about $45k, and are planning on refinancing into a single $90k loan. Doing so will drastically reduce both the interest rate and the total monthly payment for this debt.

What I'm struggling with is whether or not to add my wife as co-signer on the loan. My credit is sufficient to be approved for the loan without a co-signer, and the ""Co-signer impact"" statement from Sofi shows that it will make no difference to the rate or payments to have a co-signer. The reason we *do* want to add her is partly a matter of principle - this debt belongs to both of us, so we should both be responsible - but also because we think having another credit account in good standing will be good for her credit (the only thing she is dinged for is having too little credit in her name).

So what does r/personalfinance think? Our current disposition is to go ahead and add her. Is that a stupid idea?",finance

personalfinance,Screwed the pooch on first car purchase,"So after months of going back and forward, I finally came to buying a car from a dealer. Not necessarily a new one but a modern one and one that would require financing because I really didn’t have all the dough to just pay up front. 

Here are some numbers for y’all:

The car was tagged at $9,797.00 and I put an extended warranty on the car that lasts 72,000m/7 years, whichever comes first (I was told later on that was overkill but he understood why I would given my last cars problems) Total after dealership fees and taxes came out to some $12,500.

My APR is at 9.08% despite me having near excellent credit but I’ll get back to that in just a second. 
Finally, my total cost of the car is at $19,500 or so (closer to the $20,000 mark) 

At this point you may be asking yourself, “Dude , why would you go through with this?” Well, I jumped the gun I suppose. I was excited. I worked hard for this and the car is sooooooo nice. When all these papers and numbers were thrown at me, I was overwhelmed and maybe trusted the finance guy a bit too much. He asked me how much am I willing to pay a month and I told him in the $200-300 range and I now know he went on the lower end to maximize interest rates. 

So just to explain fully what went on...

$9,797.00 - car’s tagged price
$12,500.00 - after fees and taxes 

$4,500 - down payment I placed
$215 - what my monthly payment is going to look like 
9.08% - APR 

Total sale cost after 72 months being ~ $19,500
After I put my down payment, I was given an invoice that said I owed $7,500 left on payments. 

Now with all that said, I don’t know how to proceed with payments. I’m not aware if I have a fee for paying off early. I had mentioned it to the guy who financed it and he never said anything about a fee only that I should wait a year or two so I can establish credit. I REALLY like the car but it is NOT worth $20k. 
So I come here to seek advice on what I should do. Should I just pay off the rest in one straight shot?

personalfinance,"Auto Loans, Credit Scores, and Local Credit Unions","Hi All,

It's often mentioned around here that local credit unions can get you a better deal, or work with you on certain financial products. but how much wiggle room do they really have? Can they get you a loan, even if your credit score is bad and if so, what you you need to show them to make that happen?

-------------------------

For some context, this is the situation I'm trying to puzzle my way out of:

I am a recent immigrant to the USA, I moved in April last year, got my social security number in June 2017 and my green card in October 2017. However as of today, I still do not have a credit score. I've been added to my wife's credit card as of December 2017, and I just opened my own secured card through OpenSky who guarantee users a score in 6 months. I'm hoping in 8\-10 months, that I will have an okay score, as I would like to buy an expensive car then \(which I can more than afford\) and finance it.

I'm looking to buy a $65k Truck putting at least $20k down over a 60 month term. Would any of the following pieces of information \(with proof\) help my case:

* Fully paid off house valued at $180k
* Fully paid off second car valued at $15\-18k
* HOA payment record of $560 a month for 2 years \- all on time
* Internet and TV bill payment record of $120 for 2 years \- all on time
* Electric bill payment record of $200 a month for 2 years \- all on time
* Early repayment of 2 loans taken out in the UK before I moved and being paid off in full 2 and 4 years early \(15k and 25k\)
* Proof of funds showing I can make a $20k downpayment
* Combined income of my wife and I of $80k \($65k and $25k\)
* Current debt to income ratio of 0 and expecting a debt to income ratio after the loan of around 30&amp;#37;
* Would entertain loans with interest rates of 6\-8&amp;#37; if needed

For reference, the truck I'm looking to buy is a new Ford F150 Raptor. These trucks hold value well and will likely never be worth less than the loan amount \(since there will be a $20k downpayment\)",finance

personalfinance,"Best Way to Manage Cash Flow in a sudden relocation, mortgage &amp; downpayments","I have accepted an offer to relocate for work that will involve selling my home and buying several states away. Our timeline on this process is extremely tight so I'm looking for advice on how it typically works with a few options available to us. 

The Situation: 
We expect to sell our current home and obtain approx $125k in equity that we will use as a down payment on our new home. The relocation offer from work includes all associated moving costs including the moving &amp; supplies itself, taxes, realtor fees, legal fees, surveying etc. So I'm assuming the will be no net cost to us during this process. But there will be a lag between cash transactions and when I'm being reimbursed through work (submitting receipts) and through the release of escrow via our sale. 

Our Financial Situation:
We have perfect credit (thanks PF), no CC debt, about $15k in misc. loans (all have interest rates &lt;1.5% so we weren't rushing to pay them down), but also little cash on hand. We were in the process of fattening up our emergency fund when this plopped into our laps, so we only have roughly $10k in liquid cash. 

What should I do?
I'm thinking it would be necessary to increase our cash reserves up to around $30k -$40k to manage down payments, and liquidity with regards to moving and other other expenses. I'm fortunate in that I have immediate family I could ask for cash and it would be freely given without the usual ""never lend to family"" type situations. However, I know banks have extra paperwork associated with sudden cash injections from outside sources during mortgage closings. Is this the type of situation in which taking a loan from my 401k would be easier? It looks like 401(k) loans have around 4-5% interest rates and that I wouldn't have an issue drawing ~$30-40k from it. Since it's my money already do the banks have onerous paperwork associated with taking out that loan around mortgage time? I would then refund the loaned money to my 401k after I'm fully closed on my account.",finance

I've never really thought about a savings plan before this as I worked fairly part time in retail and other sectors while I was a student, and focused more on my academics. Having lurked PF and PFC for a while, I know that redditors can provide some useful insight, so if you have the time to read this long ass plan i appreciate you.

**WARNING: LOTS OF WORDS AND THINKING OUT LOUD BELOW**

---

&amp;nbsp;


For my starting point I followed the [coveted flow chart that was made for Canadians over at PFC](http://i.imgur.com/zlGnuDO.png)

**Account balances** 

	Savings account (with Tangerine): 11500$ 
	TFSA (with CIBC): ~1100$ 
	RRSP (with CIBC): ~1100$ 
	Debt: 0$
My income annually is 68k gross which comes out to about ~1700$/biweekly with deductions (CPP, EI, INCTAX).


**Total cheque:** 
~3400$ monthly


&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;

**Step 0: Budget, reduce, set goals** 

Monthly expenses 

I am lucky enough to still live at home, so my expenses are slashed tremendously. My parents are complete saints and have advised me to stay at home as long as it takes to get on my feet (ergo such a minor food bill). 

	Gym - 40$/month
	Phone - 80$/month
	Food - 100$/month
	Gas - 280$/month
	Insurance - 150$/month
Total: 650$ 

**Leftover cheque:** 2750$ 

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;



**Step 1: Build emergency fund in HISA** 

I've read 6 months of expenses is standard, however I only have a low monthly expense because I still live with my parents, therefore I'm going to play it safe and do a bit more. 

	Emergency fund: 7000$
	Saving account balance: 4500$

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;


**Step 4: Contribute to TFSA (or RRSP?)** 

Suggests minimum 15% of pre-tax income: 10,200$/yr, 850$/mo, 425$/biweekly OR more


	
However, I think I should contribute more here as I have plenty of room leftover as I stopped contirbuting a few months after signing up due to being a poor highschool student. But for now assume 850/month

	TFSA amount already contributed: 1000$ 
	Room for contribution
			2011: 4000
			2012: 5000
			2013: 5500
			2014: 5500
			2015: 10000
			2016: 5500
			2017: 5500
			2018: 5500
	Total: 45500$

**Leftover cheque:** 1900$

&amp;nbsp;

---

&amp;nbsp;


**Step 6: Save for medium (1-5 year) term goal** 

Mine is to be able to buy a house with money from my average interest savings account (1.1% at tangerine). 

I'll base this on an average price of 500k$ CAD where I’m located.

Assuming I'll need a down payment of 10-25% (50-125k, mortgage of 450-375k). 

However, I have 4500 already in my savings account, ergo 46-121k is needed. Now depending how ambitious I am i've calculated that in order to buy 

		In 1 year: saving between 1916-5041$/month lel IMPOSSIBLE
		2 years: saving between 958-2521$/month
		3 years:479-1260$/month
		4 years:239-630$/month
		5 years:120-315$/month
Which then leaves my cheque looking like

		1 year: nothing $ minus some
		2 year: 942-nothing $ minus some
		3 year: 1421-640$
		4 year: 1661-1270$
		5 year: 1780-1585$

Looking at a 2 year horizon because I would like to get out sooner than later, I’ll assume that I’ll save somewhere around 1200$/month for this in my savings account (and ignore the interest it would accrue in 2 years)

**Leftover cheque:** 700$

---

&amp;nbsp;



**Investment planning**

Now for the juicy goods where I tend to get pretty lost, my favorite thing! 

&amp;nbsp;

This is where I need to decide between TFSA/RRSP, however regardless, I am taking a moderately aggressive and audacious approach to saving for retirement, because tbh I haven’t a clue what my annual expenditures would be at age 55, and retiring at 55 is pretty ambitious. I’m leaning towards TFSA so I don’t get taxed at 55 on the money I take out and, like everyone else, I think I will be *super duper successful* at 55 and wouldn’t hate avoiding getting taxed at that bracket on the withdraw. In any case, I would rather be aggressive now than fall behind later. 

&amp;nbsp;

Investing for: Retirement (Age 55), if I live until 85, thats 30 years of retirement 

Time horizon: 30 years from age 25

[The use of a quick compound interest calculator](http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm) indicates that IF my investments grow 5% annually with the following parameters: 

		Initial principle: 5500$  

	// Assuming I only contribute 5500 this year into my tfsa, which if i followed my
	850$/month saving rule I would save 10.2k, but for simplicity I’ll assume 5500 
	
		Additional principle: 5500$  

	// Maxing out TFSA contribution every year assuming we don’t get a dope increase to 10,000 again 

		Years to grow: 30 

		Interest rate: 5% (staying conservative) 

		Future investment balance: 407,455$

Lets guess I’ll need an average of 35,000$/year, meaning I need 1,050,000$ to retire 

	1,050,000$ - 407,455$ = 642,545$ by age 55 

Which comes out to an additional monthly savings/earnings of 1784.8$ if i slyly ignore my incoming mortgage payments

&amp;nbsp;

This could come from a separate RRSP investment once I have maxed out my TFSA fully and get to the 5500$ max point. CPP also kicks in at age 65 (or sooner, but correct me if i’m wrong, I think I take penalty percentages for that?)

&amp;nbsp;

For now, I will say that I will put away an additional 500$/month into my savings account, and it will gain 1.1% interest over the 30 years. Using that same calculator that 500/month will turn into 214,914$, meaning I only need 427,631$ from other investments, or an additional monthly savings/earnings of 1188$. 

&amp;nbsp;

That 1188$ is something that I will deal with later but just indicates to me that it would be suuuper  cool to make more money per month.

&amp;nbsp;

**Leftover cheque:** 200$ for fun (looks like I won’t be having much fun)

&amp;nbsp;

**TFSA/RRSP Investment Strategy**

&amp;nbsp;

Risk tolerance (1-10, 10 being high): 7.5

I find that I am decently okay with risk. I have dipped my toes into crypto and have watched the volatility but have not necessarily fallen into many traps. The quick and easy would be @ a risk tolerance of about 7.5/10 I am going to just assume that about 75% in equities/25% bonds could suffice as an ideal ratio. 

&amp;nbsp;

From what I’ve read, broad markets are the best ETFs to buy, I enjoy CCP and the ‘lazy/passive’ approach to investing therefore why not follow CCP advice as well as Bogle’s advice to **hold** ETF’s. Also have been thinking about the implications of the balanced tangerine index fund, as it is practically the same as VGRO, but instead of ETFs + brokerages, it just uses index mutuals through Tangerine. This may may make my life easier in the long run (please correct me if i’m wrong).

Cons: Highest MER

***TLDR;*** 

My questions are: 

1. Roast my plan, have i missed anything/not fully grasped certain concepts? 

1. In terms of what account I should be using for this retirement investment strategy, I am confused as to why I would want to use an RRSP over a TFSA, given that I imagine I would be in a larger tax bracket prior to retiring at 55, and have to pay on it coming out at that time? TFSA&gt;RRSP when i am only 25 years old and have loads of contribution room? 

1.  I also want to purchase a house in 1-3 years, should I cool it on my retirement investments and focus more on a savings account (1.1% at tangerine) for that purchase even though my TFSA isn’t maxed out? 

1. Which fund/asset allocation strategy do you think works best for me in this situation? Is there an option I’ve missed? 
1. I believe Vanguard will be around for a long time, but is there any disadvantage to putting all my eggs in one ETF providers basket?
1. Do you love this shit? 

1. Are you high right now?
1. Do you ever get nervous?
1. Are you single?
1. I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?",finance
personalfinance,Fair interest rate?,"Hello. 

I am investing/loaning 13k dollars to a dear friend for his business to be paid back over a year or two. 

So my question is What would be a fair interest rate for a 13 thousand dollar loan to be paid back over a year? Or what would a reasonable rate be for two years?",finance
personalfinance,Is TSP and FERS the same money?,"I work for the federal government.  On my ""myPay"" account it lists in box 13 ""FERS"".  I have a little over $8k in there and they add about $130 a pay period.  I have a TSP with a 10% contribution that has a little over $17k in there.  I find that information on the tsp.gov website.  Are they different monies or is the FERS amount part of the TSP money I have?

I looked up what FERS was and it says TSP is part of FERS, which has me confused.",finance
personalfinance,Advice on the Cup Game w/ Debt,"I have about $8k in credit card debt that I am trying to pay off, but the interest rate is now at almost 20%.  At this point I am paying $150 to $200 a month but getting nowhere.  I am looking for a 0% balance transfer option so I can make some headway.  Does anyone know of a decent route to go or have a better suggestion on how to make some headway on this debt?  Any help is greatly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Debt decision time for car,"Hello all! I am looking for some advice on what to do about my aging car. I will try to give as much info to be helpful as possible. I currently have been driving my 1999 Jeep since I was 16 and now it needing alot of maintenance costs ( brakes, no A.C., no heat, and tires). It really isn't worth much and kinda getting uncomfortable to drive. I want to know if I could afford to get a good used car, probably around $12,000, but I am scared about going into more debt. 

I have $20k in student loan debt, with interests ranging from 3.76% to 4.66%, all are Federal subsidized loans. My fiancee has $3k in student loans but has just graduated college. I make about $33k a year after taxes, 401k, and insurance. She makes about $50k take home a year. I have a down payment avaliable of $5,500. Our monthly expenses all included are about $4,250 a month, that includes savings and loan repayment. We are worried we cannot afford to take on this new debt so I am seeking advice from this community. Thank you all for your help and I apologize for the wall of text.",finance
personalfinance,Possible to finance car with bad credit? Want a car in 6k-8k range and will put down 4-5k.,"So, I wanted to know if it's possible to finance a car with bad credit. 
I want a car that's either 6-8k. I can put down 4 or 5k. But I would like to finance the rest. Is this possible? Can I do this with a not so high interest rate if I put 4-5k as a downpayment? Or is it simply not possible? I do not want to pay cash.

The reason my credit is bad is because I just opened my first card this year. I opened a secured card with only $200. I make my payments on time each month. But I had no idea I wasn't supposed to use the whole card. I thought as long as I paid off my card in full each time, then I would be fine. But apparently I'm only supposed to use less than half of it. 

Anyway, I would like to know what my options are.",finance
personalfinance,Paying off student loans: with my income or with savings?,"I just graduated and i have about $18,000 in federal loan debt, with about a 5% interest rate.

I would say I have about $500 a month of my paycheck that may be spent at my discretion, after all of my bills and necessities are paid

I have around $10,000 in a mutual fund that has been doing quite well (i think the rate of return is near 25%)

my question is, should i liquidate my mutual fund and use it to pay off a majority of my loan, which leaves me without any emergency fund but saves me quite a bit in interest, or should i make monthly payments from my income while letting my mutual fund grow (or potentially shrink)?",finance
personalfinance,How do I set myself up for success?,"I have about 150k in student loans. 107k in federal at 5.8% the rest in private at 5.2% I also have a car loan for 18k at 2.4%. Through a program I am getting about 90k paid for on the 107k of federal loans in three increments throughout three years. The first payment was made today 🙌🏼. After the three years I’ll have about 20k in federal (I’m assuming I haven’t done the interest math). I am also eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. I contribute 10% of my salary into a retirement plan. The only “investing” I do is through the Acorns app. I am able to save $1300 a month and currently have 10k in a savings account. 

What would be the best way to tackle my debt? My end goal is to not owe anything to anyone until I decide to buy a home. Should I not pay off my federal and just go for the PSLF? But I’m not sure if I will be able to keep my federal job. Should I pay the private loan first?  Or should I invest the 1300 a month and pay off the loans in a lump sum?",finance
personalfinance,Is it possible to pay off a loan too fast?,"... So I was browsing r/personalfinance and I read about some people having 0&amp;#37; interest on long\-term loans due to their great credit.  Someone said, ""If you pay that off ahead of time, you are literally losing money!""  


Which makes me wonder about one of my balance transfers; I was underwater on my current car loan \(which was something like 15&amp;#37;?  I forget, but it was high due to my Credit Score being something like 500\) so I did a balance transfer of the remaining balance to a credit card; at present that has .99&amp;#37; APR but will spike to 29.99&amp;#37; \(or thereabout\) in April.  I would think we'd want to pay off all before April, but I have other high interest bills due now.  I'm currently focusing on the high interest debt first, debating whether to attack the mid\-range interest debt after that or focus on knocking out the car loan.  


I suspect they're talking about only a scenario where:

1. You have 0&amp;#37; for a vast majority of the life of the loan
2. There's no ""retroactive"" application of interest and a deadline where if you don't pay off x amount, that retroactive interest is applied
3. Any late\-life interest rate increase isn't dramatically larger than interest on other loans.",finance
personalfinance,Understanding Variable Interest Rate Risk (student loan refinancing),"I'm currently trying to refinance student loans \(26k, average 5.5&amp;#37;\) and am seeing preliminary offers of about .75&amp;#37; difference between Variable and Fixed loans \(variable being lower\). Specifically, the best \(preliminary, pre\-hard pull\) offer I've seen has been 3.97 variable vs 4.67 fixed for a 5 year repayment. 

My apologies if this information is somewhere obvious\-\-in research I'm seeing a lot of specific recommendations for individuals, but I'm interested in learning how to actually determine this information day\-to\-day. How much of a difference would you want to see before choosing variable? Just how much could the rate change over 5 years?",finance
personalfinance,"Seeking Advice - New Career, Huge Pay increase; but in debt, no savings.","Hello! 

So i'm going to make this short... I have a bachelor's degree in an IT\-related field \+ 5 years of experience in data analytics environments. I recently transferred to a new division in my company and got a large raise in the process. I've gotten paid 4 times so far \(bi\-weekly\).  I'm 26 years old, male, and individual financial info below:

* Base Income:      $95,500.00 / year
* Bonus/Other:      $35,000.00 / year        

**Total: $135,500.00**

**Assets:**

* Checking Accounts: **$3,000.00**
* Robo\-Advisor Invest Acct: **$7000**
* Crypto Currencies: \(orig. $2,250\) currently: **$1250.00** \(\-$1000\)
* Pension\\401k \(dont see relevance at moment\)

**TOTAL ASSETS: ROUGHLY = $12,250.00 \(\-$7000 cant be touched yet\) = $5,250.00**

**DEBT**:  

* Credit Cards:
   * CC 1 \(consolidated BT\):     **$5,500 @ 0\% APR until 7/1/2019**
   * CC 2 \(consolidated BT\):     **$4,700 @ 4.99\% APR until 3/1/2019**
   * CC 3 \(mix of 8\):                   **$1,000 \- 2,500 @ 9.5\% \- 20.49\% APR** \(this is revolving spending/bills\)
* Car loan:
   * *MAKE* FINANCIAL:               **$10,667.22 @ 2.90\% APR \(7 year term ending in 2023\)**
* Student Loans:
   * ONESERVICEER:                  **$19,422 @ 3\-7\% APR**

**Debts \(Liabilities\): ROUGHLY = $42,000.00 @ 6.67 \%** ***Average*** **APR**

I was thinking about taking out a debt consolidation loan. I feel like it would benefit the best but I have heard mixed things. I know my interest rates don't seem very high for my credit card debt \(if it was higher I would definitely consolidate my debt\). The loan would be about **$45,000 @ 3.89\% APR**

I like this idea because then I can chip away at everything at once. I can literally just put all money toward 1 debt channel. Or should I do it this way: Pay off smallest debts first in full and keep going... Or: Pay off highest interest debts first? 

Forgot to mention,

 **Monthly Income** \(After Tax/Deductions\): \~ **$6,700**

RENT \- $500

CAR PMT \- $250

CELL \- $100

Other \- $750

Total after monthly expenses: \`= 6,700 \- 1,600 = **$5,100**

Credit Score: 780

So it seems i'm finally coming close to financial freedom. I know the best thing to do is to pay off my debts first but should I be putting nothing toward investments until its all paid? 

At this stage in my life i'm starting to get a huge interest in investing for the future. So with all this extra income is making me question how I should manage it.

Please share any feedback or suggestions. I know the most common suggestion will probably be to put every extra penny toward my debt \- for good reason. It just hurts to do lol... I want to invest and pay off my debt at the same time \-\- is this something common?",finance
