personalfinance,Refinancing Stress,"Hello,

I received a quote for refinancing on my house. The email says the terms and interest rate (3.5%) are locked in and the offer will expire in two months. When I sign the agreement we then have the appraiser determine the value (probably within a week of signing). 

I would like the house to appraise for as high as possible so I plan on making several improvements over the next 5-6 weeks. After the improvements I will sign and schedule the appraisal. 

Am I in danger of having the quote/offer revoked because I wait 5-6 weeks even though I'm still within the terms? My construction guy is being a huge pain and rushing me to get everything done in the next 1-2 weeks. He's saying to not trust the quote terms and skip doing a portions of renovations to get appraised asap. Thoughts?",finance
personalfinance,Medical Billing seems fraudulent,"I hope this is a valid place to post this to seek some advice.  I've seen others advise OPs about bank fraud and steps they can take.  If it is not the proper place, I apologize.

I went to a clinical in September for a sore throat and paid my in network co-pay as I had two or three other times in 2019.  In December, they sent me a bill and charged it as out of network.  I called and explained to them that when I went in September, the NP asked me for my insurance and said I owed my regular co-pay and that was what I paid.  Three months later they came back wanting $140 additional  because they decided they are billing it as out of network even though every provider they have through my insurance is in network and all my other visits are in network.

I explained to them in January the same issue.  This has not changed.  At this point I filed a fraud complaint with the Federal Trade Commission as they continue to do this.  I also informed the provider  of this as I refuse to pay $140 extra because they are billing it incorrectly.

The alternative of it being a mistake is intentional fraud.  I don't get how they can come back months later and change a bill incorrectly and then expect me to pay it.

What else can I do to straighten this out?  Is there a governing body other than the FTC?

Thanks for any advice.",finance

personalfinance,Question on filing taxes,"This year I got a 1099-MISC Income Form. My employer gives me this because they pay for about 75% of my truck payment each month.

After doing the federal portion of my taxes, it calculated that i owed about $2,000. I immediately logged off out of frustration. I then asked my managers for a copy of a paystub from the last working week of 2019. They dodged it the first 2 times. I believe they said they “couldn’t access them” and asked why i needed it. I felt like a bourdon so i didn’t wanna press it, but the entire interaction felt uneasy and partially shady. Then, right before the shutdown we had an employee meeting  and i made sure i wasn’t leaving without a copy of my last paystub (from 2019). I got my paystub and the wages, tips, etc for the year, was almost $12k LESS than what was on my w2. 

We get all credit card tips “loaded” on a debit card kinda thing and there’s an app that shows monthly statements. After adding every monthly deposit up, i came to a number very similar to what was on the last paystub of 2019. 

I owed on my taxes last year (2018/same employer), so i expected owing but not this much. Also, I looked up my wages from 2018 and they were similar to the number i found on my paystub/after calculating my monthly “card loads.”

I know there’s something wrong here but I’m not sure what it is exactly. My mom is urging me to contact my boss and ask him why the wages are substantially different but I wanted to ask the internet first on how i should proceed. Thank you all. Stay safe out there",finance

personalfinance,Student loan options,"Hello, trying to get information to help a friend out. Their current situation is that they are currently graduating grad school with about $280k in federal graduate student loans. The person lives in a high cost of living area and can only pay off ~$100-$500 in student loans in the short term (1-2 years) until they get a newer job in the future that may pay them more (maybe up to $1.5k). 

1. My question is what best strategy does this person have? What loan payment plans can they qualify for or do?

2. Is it cheaper in the long run to pay as little as possible now, wait for the loans to be forgiven and pay off the tax bomb? Is there a calculator available that will show hypotheticals of if average payment is $100, total will be $XXX,XXX = total paid over 2 years + (.37)Forgiven. 

2a. Is it better to invest in the long run? Hypothetically if the person would get an inheritance of 100k and invest that / use that as last resort emergency fund or just throw it all in the student loan and have no investments + emergency fund

3. Can you theoretically call the loan people and set your payments to like $1/month and still get loans forgiven? What is this payment plan called?

4. Can you get 100% of the payment to go towards chipping away at the principal?

5. What are the downsides of carrying this loan for the future years? I.e ability to get car loans, mortgages, etc?",finance

investing,How to Value Stock in a Time of COVID-19 (ELI5 Edition),"So, there have a raging debate recently between bulls and bear.

I would like to offer my explanation in regard to this. Since this is r/investing , i assume most of you guys have basic understanding in regard to FCF Valuation. But in case you don't know, it is pretty popular subject if you want to go deep down into fundamental investing. Some popular resources i would like to recommend is [Aswath Damodaran](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/), [Valuation by McKinsey](https://www.amazon.com/Valuation-Measuring-Managing-Value-Companies/dp/0470424656). Basically in FCF Valuation, you make an estimation in regard of future cash flow a company can generate in the future and discount it to the present time to arrive at the value of the business right now.

Since this is ELI5, i will not go into too much details. This is heavily dumbed down scenario, but i think it is enough to give you understanding.

Let's assume a **hypothetical company**. It is a good business with no debt, it has no risk of bankcruptcy in the near future.

Revenue = $1.000.000

Variable cost = 40% (this is the cost that incurred everytime you make a sale. Example : sales commision, product cost, delivery, etc.)

Fixed sot = $400.000 (this is the cost that incurred whether you make a sales or not. Example = Rent expense, salary, fixed assets depreciation, etc).

Net income = $200.000

The Value of the business is $2.000.000 (you can assume this is the market price, if someone actually want to buy the company).

For simplicity sake, we assume the net income is fully on cash-basis, so the net income also represent the free cash flow for the business. 

Assume that because of COVID-19, the revenue in 2020 will be down by as much as 50% and in 2021 will be down by 25%. It will go back to normal in 2022, so the terminal value or going forward it will go back to pre-covid value of $2.000.000

 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 |
:--|:--:|:--:|--: |
Revenue | 500,000 | 750,000 | - |
Variable Cost| -200,000 | - 300,000 | - |
Gross Margin| 300,000 | 450,000 | - |
Fixed cost | -400,000 | -400,000 | - |
Net Income | -100,000 | 50,000 | - |
Terminal Value | - | - | 2,000,000 |
Discount factor* | 0.9090 | 0.8264 | 0.7513 |
Present Value | -90,909 | 41,332 | 1,502,629 |

*I use 10% Cost of capital. It is calculated simply by dividing 1/cost of capital^n . In this case 1/10%. This is pretty high as you might see, [a lot of business has lower cost of capital](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar). And lower cost of capital will result in higher present value.

If we sum all the present value (Net income/terminal value discounted into the present), it will arrive at $1,453,042, compared to previous value of $2,000,000. A 27% decrease in value, significant but arguably much more modest than many people would imagine.

Of course this is just hypothetical. But i would like to believe that my assumption is quite conservative. Like with the 10% cost of capital (even after the fed slash rate), or long U-shaped recovery. But if you try the FCF Valuation (the actual one, not this dumbed down version), you will see that the value will not go down as far as some bears like to believe. 

==========
**What we can take from this.**

Yes, time is bad and many good business will record very low or in fact negatives income this year. But this is not as doom and gloom as many people wanted to believe.

We see company like Adidas, Disney, Yum Brands penalized quite a bit because COVID, around the range of 25%-40%, depending on the timeline you are looking at, which is actually quite fair in regards to their future performances.

I knew at this point people have enough with priced-in, but yeah, the current price did in fact have priced in the COVID issue in their prices.

Just because a lot of unemployment and low revenue this year doesn't mean the value of the business will go down by as much as 50% or even lower. That's not how it works in regards to Value of a Business. 

Imagine if you have a good family business. This year will be rough, but you and your family have enough to keep everything a float. Some random investor comes in and said ""whew, bad times eh? Can i buy your business for 40% of its market price?""

If i were him, i will show them the exit door right away. Why would i sell it if i expect the business will recover in 2 years.

But actually there is a lot of stock right now facing this condition. Their stock are heavily penalized, and it is your job to find them and if you right, reaping the capital gain from them.

In regards to myself, two weeks ago I'm at 25% stock, 75% cash. But last weeks i decide to shift gear and move to 75% stock and 25% cash (I have to thanks [Howard Marks](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/howard-marks-memos) for this). I left 25% just in case that I am wrong and market will drive even lower than this.",finance
personalfinance,Rescind accepted job offer?,"I started applying with this company in February. Did a couple interviews. I ended up getting an offer a few weeks ago after a couple months of delays because of covid-19. I have not yet put in a two week notice at my current job because we were waiting for a background check to clear. A lot has happened in the last few months with the coronavirus and in addition to that, I very recently found out my wife and I are expecting our first baby (which wasn’t that planned but we are very happy and excited). 

On the surface it seems great, a 15% raise, more exciting job and career growth. But my wife and I decided that it is more important that I’m able to take parental leave off when the baby comes (which is better at my current job) and that this economic climate is just not a great time to take a new job and be the newest guy on the totem pole. This place is mostly federally funded and it just makes me worried with everything that’s going on with corona causing me to be concerned about potential layoffs and such. When it comes down to it I am making decent money now at a state union job where I have seniority over a few people and now that I am going to be supporting a family, my family has to come first. I can always try to go for a new job in a year or two. 

I guess my plan is, as awful as I feel about it to give both the HR and the person who would be my boss a call and explain how I’m not comfortable with taking anew job with Corona going on and a baby on the way. Maybe throw in there that I want to be able to take a couple of months of leg for parental leave. Let them know obviously that I appreciate everything they have done. 

I figure the situation sucks either way but calling them is a bit more professional... I guess I’m just looking for validation, I hope I’m doing the right thing for my family and that they will understand.",finance

personalfinance,What currency to use for saving money,"I live in third world country highly dependent on crude oil and other natural resources, and local currency is very unstable and had 3-4 events of devaluation in last 10 years. Because of this all imports are expensive and almost all things such as cars, technology etc rise in prices extremely fast. 

I am going and make enough money to live in decent conditions, of course I am not able to earn enough for a car or a house at the moment but hoping to earn at some point. I am receiving my salary in local currency and currently storing any leftovers in two savings accounts one in local currency and one in USD. 

Savings accounts in local currency have high interest rates, almost 11%, however, paired with inflation rate around 9-10% I do not know whether it is worth it. All foreign currency savings accounts have fixed rate of 1$ so I am literally getting pennies from that, but I hope it will be more secure this way. 

I have watched and read many resources on investing, savings accounts etc, but most of them focus on American and European economy, and depreciation of the currency is never really considered due to their economies being so stable and advanced. 

I am fairly new to personal finance and do not know what is the best position to gain highest rewards from my situation. What would you suggest me to do? Should I go ahead and exchange all my money to local currency or keep it all in foreign currency, due to the risk of them depreciating over time.

personalfinance,Is an MBA worth it for me?,"Hey!

I'm 24 years old and I am currently working in the Bay Area. I'm making around $200k and bonuses and  equity. I studied computer science in university, and I am currently working as a Software Engineer. I have been thinking about what's next in life. That question makes me wonder whether an MBA is worth it. Currently I'm debt free.

If I go for an MBA I can see the following costs

1. Not having my current income(salary+equity) plus raises for 2 years. Accounting for raises, bonuses and equity, I'm putting this at $500k
2. Will be taking on debt in order to do an MBA. $200k and the interest rate that goes with the loan. How much would that be?

I'll have living costs regardless of me doing an MBA or not. By the time I join I will have enough saved to take care of living expenses. I also wouldn't have to take a full loan and could possibly get by with a $100k loan if I use a good chunk of my savings and investments.

Opportunities

1. If I do an MBA I'd go for a product management or something in the financial markets. Wonder how much these people make on average after University
2. Internships / Work could probably help me make some money while doing an MBA. I could possibly freelance if I have the time.
3. Get to live a college life again.

Questions

1. In my case when will an MBA start paying off?
2. Is it even worth it?

financial,Credit Card Question,"Good morning from NC!

A little backstory to explain the question (which may be simple to answer).  
All my life I was raised with the fact that credit cards are evil. So my parents never allowed me to get one. I moved out when I was 18 and had 0 credit. My car broke down, so getting a new one was difficult, but finally did when I was 19. That built my credit for about 8 months, then I finally applied for a credit card. I've never been late on a credit card payment, car payment, or really any payment. I now have a FICO of 749 and CreditWise score of 709 after about a year and a half of having a credit line (my car) and almost a year of having a credit card. I'm 20M now, 21 next month. 

I recently became a member of Navy Federal, and they have some options for really good credit cards. Two reasons why I haven't been able to grow my credit (as told to me by my credit report) is the age of my credit lines are too low, and also the amount is too low. 

That being said; is it a good idea to apply for a new credit card with a higher line of credit? This will add to my credit amount, but I feel might impact the age of the credit lines. I tried asking my dad, but he told me that he made bad decisions with credit cards and doesn't feel comfortable giving me advice (which I respect that he was straightforward and truthful).

My current credit card gave me a $200 increase ($500 total) and will not increase my amount for another 6mo.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I'm new to credit lines but very financially responsible. My credit score is slow in moving up (CreditWise 709 and FICO 749) because low credit limits and young credit history. If I apply for a card with a higher line, is that worth the hit for a young credit card?",finance

investing,Stocks Are Recovering While the Economy Collapses. That Makes More Sense Than You'd Think.,"Companies that are seen as especially vulnerable, such as retail stores spread across malls, are seeing stock declines of 50% and have only recovered marginally since March 23.

On the flip side, clear beneficiaries of the current upheaval are doing well. 

So while markets are not moving on real-time economic fundamentals, they are moving on reasonable judgements of fundamentals going forward

The Fed, for instance, is committed to purchasing hundreds of billions of dollars of municipal bonds at favorable rates, which will mean that cash-strapped state governments should be able to retain teachers and policemen and programs

The Fed also is about to lend another $500 billion to Main Street businesses, which is coming too late to avoid the pain of the last month but will still matter greatly to the ability of companies to move forward and eventually rehire. The most visible effect of the money in motion now is the stock market, but that will be not the sole beneficiary as more Fed money flows to states and Main Street.

personalfinance,15/1 ARM vs 30 yr conventional. Pitfalls I am missing?,"I'm in the process of purchasing my first house, after about 2 decades of living in rentals. The property is within my budget and gross salary recommendations (Approx 400k price, I make around 185k as a physician). My only significant debt is my med school loans, which are at around 300 a month.

I have two competing mortgage products, and as this is my first purchase I want to make sure I'm not falling into any unseen traps.

The first offer is through chase, which is a conventional fixed rate mortgage with 10% down and a rate of 3.5%. I would pay PMI of around 800 dollars a year until I hit 20% equity. There is no pre payment penalty. I can drop my rate to 3.25 if I ""buy"" points for around 2300. 

The second is through a smaller community bank offering a 15/1 ARM, fixed at 3.6 % for 15 years then floats to an index for the following 15 years. This one has no PMI, and they will do 100% financing, no money down. 

On initial glace the conventional appears better, as its a lower rate and fixed at 30 yrs. However, I am leaning towards the ARM for a few reasons:

1. 10 percent down (40K) isn't all of my cash available, but it is a huge chunk of my liquid assets. There would be a window for at least a couple months where if I were to get laid off I would have to pull money out of retirement accounts and take penalties (or sell off stocks which have been cratered). 

2. 40 k upfront is a lot of money just to ""buy"" a 0.1 reduction in my interest rate.

3. I plan to overpay my mortgage by about 1K every month, so by the time I hit 15 years I will have much less than 50% of the loan outstanding.

4. I don't really see myself staying at this property for the next 15 years, if I had to put a number it would be &lt; 7-10. 

It is in an area that would be relatively easy to rent out so I would consider keeping it as a rental property. (It is a modern townhouse in a desirable part of my city). 

I understand that if I were to keep the property for more than 15 yrs without refinancing or paying off the mortgage the ARM loan would be much worse. But I really do like the idea of having that extra 40k available right now. My job is, AFAIK, secure and the medical group I work for is exceptionally well run and financially stable but these are interesting times. 

What am I missing?

personalfinance,"Employer is asking about what I'm making on unemployment right now (laid off), is it fair to feel uncomfortable sharing? (US-IL)","I work as a kitchen manager at a large-ish independent restaurant, or at least I did before the pandemic. My state is still locked down until June, which I'm fine with because I'm making more on unemployment with the federal stimulus than I was working 45-50 hour weeks.

The owner of the restaurant, who I interacted with a decent amount before the lockdown, texted me out of the blue yesterday asking what my unemployment benefit amount is. I haven't responded yet and I'm not entirely sure I want to because something about the question gives me a bad gut feeling. I fear he's either trying to reopen, which could take me off unemployment and leave me working half my regular hours for a pittance, or downsize, potentially leaving me out of a job in June.

Is it reasonable for me to not share with him? What could he need that info for, is there a situation where it somehow works out in my favor?",finance

personalfinance,Protecting against inflation,"In light of all financial impacts involving covid-19 and the federal government's consideration of releasing more stimulus packages for the general public, protecting the money I have saved up against inflation has become a primary concern for me. Being based in the US, I've done some (albeit not enough) research to see what I can do about this, so I come to you guys for further advice and suggestions.

Some background:
  - 29 year's old 
  - about $50k in checking account
  - No debt

So far I've learned about the following options:

 - I-Bonds: These seem like a solid, low risk option to invest my money in. Looks like I can only spend about $10,000 on these every calendar year. Also, not sure if I can get the money I exchanged for the bond whenever I please or if I have to wait a fixed amount of time before doing so.

 - TIPS: I believe these work like I-Bonds meaning they're meant to protect against inflation and yield either no or little interest. I'm not entirely sure what the exact differences with I-Bonds are, if they also have a $10k investment limit and if it's worth investing money in both TIPS and I-Bonds as it may not be too diversified.

 - Gold: By this I mean buying physical gold and storing it at home to avoid storage fees. I've read a few Reddit threads where users have advised against this, but some don't seem to state why exactly. I always thought the value of gold climbed with inflation so any money you invested in physical gold would retain it's worth and you could ultimately sell the gold at inflated prices. I've heard that there's a premium attached to purchasing physical gold, but I'm not exactly sure. I also don't know if there's a limit to how much gold you can purchase in a single transaction.

Excuse me for potentially being ill-informed on the above. I'm hoping you guys can help fill in some of the gaps and maybe provide more useful information to help me shield my savings from inflation as much as possible. Thank you in advance!",finance

Thankfully my parents forced me to get a job at the end of the summer last year. Over the year I’ve managed to save ~5500. 

Basically when I turn 18 I plan on 
1) changing my savings to citi bank, keeping like 1500 in there (for computer for college, new phone, sudden car repairs etc)
2) opening a checking account with Bank of America (they have offices near where I live now and will next year for college) 
3) set up a credit card and buy a new phone on an installment plan to build my credit score
4) set up a Roth IRA with fidelity (or vanguard?) and put in maybe 1000-2000 from day one 
5) set up and etf on a separate account and put the rest of my savings into s&amp;p 500. 

So basically, **my questions are** how much should I put into a Roth IRA since I won’t be able to touch it? How should I divide up the amount in the Roth IRA? 

Where do I go about setting up a separate etf where I can take out money if I need it? What do I invest in there, just the s&amp;p 500? Should I look into investing in Exxon?

investing,"PSA: The fed is not ""pumping and dumping,"" stop spreading misinformation","The fed is increasing money supply by buying government bonds, but this is not a pump scheme or something that will cause a crash in the market in 6 months - this is an increase in money supply, meaning this is simply new money that is being added into the current supply.

&amp;#x200B;

Stop talking about ""fed pumping"" as if we're going to crash down to SPY 150. The fed isn't buying stocks or options, they're buying bonds from banks, which increases the amount of cash that is currently in existence in the economy, meaning that if there's more cash now, that cash is still going to be here in 6 months, 6 years, or 6 decades.

Should I just act like student loan interest wasn't paused and continue gung-ho into my student debt?

stocks,The risks of over-diversifying? Large caps king?,"Admittedly, I've typically managed my Roth IRA aggressively. Relatively speaking, I allocate 30% of my portfolio to an S&amp;P 500 fund (VOO), 30% to a small cap value fund (VBR), 20% to a REIT (VNQ), and 20% to an emerging markets fund (VWO). Looking at the economics of our current recession, however, I'm  rethinking my strategy, opting to weight exclusively towards large cap US value, large cap international value, and tech.  I guess I wasn't much of a Boglehead before, the idea of capturing the entire market, but now I'm even less inclined to be so.

I'm also less inclined to want to re-balance towards under performing funds. This moment feels like one in which sectors fundamentally collapse, in a way that's unprecedented, and then re-consolidate around a select few survivors in distressed industries, that then persist as large caps themselves, or become even larger than before. This seems apparent with U.S. oil, commercial real estate, retail, auto industry, many consumer discretionary stocks, etc. Though the fed has pursued unprecedented action to buy debt and extend credit, this does not prevent companies from buckling. Given the over-leveraged nature of U.S. companies before this fiasco, many companies are going to have a tough time meeting their debt obligations given that thousands of businesses and corporations are bringing in less money than a corner lemonade stand. In the next 6 months, it feels to me that there's to be a wave of bankruptcies the like that we've never seen before.

So my question is, how worthwhile is diversification in this environment? How worthwhile is re-balancing? I get that the idea is to re-balance, and then weight to under-performing sectors/industries with the hope that you're buying in at a better price. However, for me, small cap, mid cap, commercial real estate, and oil indices will have a crawl of a recovery after this thing, given that so many companies will go under.

Are large caps king in this environment? How are you all making sense of this?

I was thinking of doing the 25-year graduated plan so I am paying the least amount for the first 2 years and then every 2 years after the amount I owe increases. I was planning on either using the money I save with each payment to either put into my IRA or put it all to repaying the higher interest rate loan. At some point in the future, I plan on refinancing my loans for a lower interest rate when the monthly payments increase to the point of almost being the same as a refinanced loan repayment plan. 

Would it be better to put the extra money I save by not paying in the standard repayment monthly plan into my IRA or just put it all in the higher interest loan and have it paid off faster? Having to make loan payments for 25 years doesn't bother me. I just want to do a more economically smart decision.",finance

personalfinance,NAVIENT Ripoff - Undisclosed fees,"I got COVID stimulus money and thought I would use it to pay off some of my debts.  I took a look at my car loan (19 months left, 4.5 %, $3000 balance) or my student loans that have been consolidated and under two loans with NAVIENT.  Both student loans have the same rate and months remaining, so I'll just combine the principle remaining.  Principle balance: $2,729.89, Interest Rate: 4.375, Remaining Months: 39.

So, I was trying to determine which I should pay off by determining how much interest I would be paying on each loan, so I put both in Excel to create the amortization schedule.   Car loan monthly payment, amount toward principal, and interest was very close to what the lender indicated.  NAVIENT, a whole different story, and the reason for this post.  Excel's PMT function lets me know that my NAVIENT loan payments should be approx $79.30 per month for the next 39 months.  PROBLEM, NAVIENT says my payment is $226/mo, and that is what I have been paying for YEARS!

Paying $226/month I should have the loan paid off in 12 months, not 3 years, RIGHT?!  The numbers weren't adding up!

I called NAVIENT, and from what I could get from them, my $226/mo payment has been divided like this for the next payment (and similarly for all other payments)

INTEREST: $10.74  
PRINCIPLE: $67.55  
FEES: $146.70

Yep, that is right, $146.70/mo in fees every month that isn't listed on any of my monthly bills.  I asked how much in interest and fees I would be paying if I stayed with the current schedule of 39 months, and he said over $8,000!

As the Principal is reduced, and the interest is reduced, they just increase the fees to keep the monthly payment at $226 for the next 39 months.  That is INSANE - but apparently part of the original loan terms.

I wrote NAVIENT a check for $2,729.89 to get out of this crazy scheme.",finance
personalfinance,Backdoor Roth IRA confusion,"I've been reading about this but still have some questions... Here is my situation:

- I don't have a Traditional IRA set up (I do have a 401k and a Roth IRA), so I don't have to worry about the pro-rata rule
- My income is high enough that I can't contribute to a Roth IRA (perhaps implied by the fact that I'm asking about backdoor Roth)

Here is my understanding of the process for making a backdoor Roth IRA contribution. My main uncertainties are bolded:

- open a Traditional IRA and make a contribution, up to the 2020 max of $6000
- fill out [Form 8606](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/f8606--2017.pdf). **This is so that I won't be taxed on my Trad IRA basis during the conversion to Roth? Because if I tried to convert my Trad IRA but it was at least partially funded with deductible contributions, I would incur a tax because of the pro-rata rule?**
- don't invest the money in anything in my Traditional IRA so that I won't be taxed on any gains when I make the conversion to a Roth; after a minimal amount of time, convert 100% of the account to my Roth. Done
- \*note on the above step: I know there is some debate on how long to wait before converting to Roth. I have seen discussions about this and in those conversations I see people describe investing the money in their Traditional IRA and waiting for a while, then eventually converting it to Roth. **Why not convert the Traditional IRA right away and then make those investments in the Roth, to avoid paying taxes on the gains during the conversion?** Or is there no tax advantage to this strategy, and instead they have other reasons (such as concerns about Step Transaction Doctrine, the IRS deciding to count the series of &lt;contribute to Traditional IRA, convert to Roth&gt; as a single excess Roth contribution)? Also, **why do some people suggest converting Trad-&gt;ROTH asap specifically to avoid gains - where would those gains come from if I haven't invested in anything? Is it because some accounts automatically put the funds into a money market or something like that?**

My confusion with the first question is made worse by [Pitfall 4 here](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-why-you-may-want-to-reconsider-doing-that-backdoor-roth-ira-conversion-2019-04-17) - it says
&gt; Pitfall 4: Don’t forget to calculate the payback period for a conversion. **A taxpayer in the 35% federal income tax bracket who converts $12,000 into a Roth incurs $4,200 in federal taxes.** 

Where is this coming from?? Wouldn't they only incur full taxes if the converted $12,000 was from a Trad IRA funded exclusively with deductible contributions?

Another confusion with Form 8606 is that in [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6vo16d/backdoor_roth_ira_with_schwab/dm22gar/) different [places](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/backdoor-roth-ira-tutorial/) I see people saying ""you fill out Form 8606 to avoid being taxed twice"". What is the ""twice"" referring to? I don't want my basis to be taxed during the conversion (it won't be because it's from a nondeductible contribution and this is what the form is for), but what's the second tax that's being referred to here?

personalfinance,Help understanding change in taxes with salary increase,"Hi all! I'm hoping that I can review some changes on my paycheck with you all to see if this makes sense to you and I'm also hoping to get some advice on whether I should take any action and change my filing status from 'single' to 'married' as I got married earlier this year.

So here goes: I live in VA and I was making $82,760 per year (bi-weekly) earlier this year. I was putting 11 percent in my 401K (about $349.67) and spending an additional $65.15 on deductions minus $755.86 in federal and state taxes, bringing in about $2,012.41 in my paycheck every two weeks.

I recently received a raise and my salary went up to $90,000 per year (bi-weekly) or $3,466.34	gross in each check. I am now putting 5.5 percent in my 401K (about $207.69) and 5.5 percent in a 401k ROTH ($173.08) and spending an additional $65.67 on deductions minus $895.52 in federal and state taxes, bringing in about $2,124.38 in my paycheck every two weeks.

Doesn't it seem like a lot more is going to taxes each week? The increase on a bi-weekly basis seems small for me. Is this because I also went from 401k to (401k and 401k ROTH at the same time)? Any insight/advice would be appreciated. 

Additionally, if I were to switch from single to married, I'd be bringing in more take home, my concern is that my wife and I make very similar amounts per year and I am worried that we will be penalized for this, so any insight on that would be appreciated as well.

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Bought a used car in CT- turned out to be crap and now not sure what to do.,"Bought a 2009 VW Tiguan private sale in CT last week from a man who worked at his dad’s auto repair shop. Prior to purchasing the vehicle, I had checked with the seller that he was able to provide me a bill of sale, odometer statement, and a CLEAN title upon purchase- to all of which he said yes, not a problem. Upon arrival to pick up the car, he presented me with a piece of yellow paper with CT DMV letterhead that he said was basically was in lieu of a title. The guy said they had gotten the car via a mechanic’s lien and the original owner did not produce a title, but that this would suffice for registration in Massachusetts even though it said on the top “this form is only valid for transfer of ownership in the state of Connecticut.” However, I figured that since they claimed that this was a common occurrence and standard paperwork, I agreed and purchased the vehicle, despite the seller having been dishonest about this prior (Yes, I’m clearly stupid.) 

So now I drive it home to MA (about 2 hrs) and notice that once parked in my driveway, it started leaking oil (not sure how much it was realistically leaking since it was raining). I immediately texted the seller a photo and asked what could possibly be wrong. He claimed it may be antifreeze (great mechanic), and I told him I’d get it checked out on Monday when my mechanic could see me. Monday morning comes, I dropped my car off and proceeded to the RMV while they diagnosed my car. Long story short, the RMV told me my title equivalent was useless and they couldn’t do anything for me given my current paperwork. I left relatively defeated and proceeded back to the mechanic shop to hear the news. My mechanic confirmed it was oil leaking, and the source of the leak was from a cylinder head placed on the engine recently, and said that it was likely placed there to cover up other issues. Additionally, said that it was throwing several misfire codes. 
At this rate I was more than fed up and decided to text the seller saying that it just was not working out with this vehicle and wanted my money back per CT lemon laws. As expected, he told me my mechanic was lying to me to get money out of me, they didn’t know foreign auto, it was nothing more than a “simple oil leak” that he was happy to fix for me, that document was nothing short of valid and the RMV was wrong, blah blah blah. Oh, and that under no circumstances was I getting my money back bc the car was in perfect condition. 
Fast forward 2 days, I took the car to a VW specialist for a more in depth diagnosis. Guy deemed the car’s vacuum pump was the source of the leak and that the cylinder head was poorly installed and that gaskets were reused, no sealant was used on them, and that there were 2 leaks coming from it- one worse than the other. Also needed new balljoints. Total damage was quoted at $1600. Figured with this new information and having done more research on my inability to register the vehicle in my state, I proceeded to call the seller’s father (whose name is on the half-ass title, as the owner of the auto repair shop). Got nowhere with him either and now I’m stuck with a car that leaks oil and isn’t able to be registered in my state.

I guess I just want to know if anybody has any advice as to where to go from here. I’m suspicious that the car might have an active lien on it since they can’t produce a title, and therefore considered calling that city’s police department and filing a complaint against them. Also wanted to file a complain with the AG’s office and the BBB, but both are closed due to COVID. Any advice on the car or the legitimacy of that half-assed title are welcome.

*Upon further investigation, realized that CT lemon laws don’t seem to apply to me given the age of the vehicle.",finance
investing,Does The Fed cutting interest rates cut both ways?,"So I had a little bit of an aha moment looking back at previous crashes, and reading news articles from 2008 and 2009. This may have been obvious to most of you guys, but it wasn't immediately to me.

So The Fed is cutting interest rates and doing QE to encourage lending and trying to maintain liquidity in the credit market. This drives down the yeilds on basically everything. There was been a pretty consistent downward trend in 10Y Treasuries since 2001 (maybe even earlier?).

10Y Treasuries had 5% yields when folks were experiencing the 2008 crash. Am I right in assuming that investors back then may have been more likely to rebalance their portfolios into safer assets because yields were still semi attractive, over just holding cash or equities? Would that temper volatility at all?

In low yeild environments are people encouraged to just switch back and forth between equities and cash, trying to time the markets? Have crashes over time become more steep and violent because of this?",finance

personalfinance,The supposed benefits of an HSA do not add up,"I've had this discussion with numerous people in different financial situations, and have run the numbers for myself many times, and each time it just doesn't make sense. The ""triple tax advantage"" of using an HSA as a retirement savings vehicle seems like a meme. Let me explain;

In order to qualify for an HSA, you first need to enroll in a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP). These frequently have deductibles and/or total out of pocket expenses of up to $8000. IIRC I think the $8000 value is set by some federal law

This means that you are already gambling your health for $8000 a year that you won't e.g. get into a car accident. For context, pre-insurance costs for even basic accidents can (balloon to amounts like this quickly)[https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/ambulance-trips-can-leave-you-with-surprising--and-very-expensive--bills/2017/11/17/6be9280e-c313-11e7-84bc-5e285c7f4512_story.html]. So you're basically guaranteed that if you get into a single accident, you'll hit your max out of pocket and have to spend $8000, completely negating all the benefit of the HSA contribution. 

Then you've got the monthly premium which is often helpfully subsidized by employers. Most regular HMO, PPO, etc plans appear to cost $40-150/month, while HDHP if offered can be free or as low as $5/month, though I've seen them as high as $150/month (same as the HMO). $150 * 12 = $1800 a year

Then there's the cost of medical care. Obviously HSA + HDHP is oriented towards people who don't use their health insurance. But a yearly physical will be about $120 for your primary care doctor, then similar for both the eye doctor and dentist. So a basic level of preventative care is gonna be $360/year if you choose to indulge. If you have prescriptions, then forget about HDHP completely; my monthly RX cost $350 before insurance, $10 after. Then what about a walk-in clinic if you get food poisoning from eating too much cheap street food? Another $50-150. You get the idea.

Then you've got to actually contribute to the HSA. Maybe your employer puts some money in. But regardless the personal contribution limit is $3500/year, $7000 for married couples IIRC. This means that you need to subtract $3500 from your gross income to get the max benefit from the HSA. 

So all together you're looking at saving $19,000 401k + $5,500 IRA + $3,500 HSA = $28,000/year. 

The median household income for 2018 was about $64,000 (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States). So that's a massive 43% savings rate.

So what kind of people are going to be able to save this much? Pretty much only young, single, child-free, high salary Americans. For context, I make a decent salary and have a high~ish rate of savings and for me still it's not guaranteed that I'll be able to make out both 401k and IRA in a given year. The type of person who can max 401k, IRA, and HSA is going to have an income level far higher than the average American. Some examples with ballpark ""high"" salary numbers for 35% and 28% savings rates;

https://dqydj.com/income-percentile-by-age-calculator/

- age 25, $80,000: 93rd percentile

- age 25, $100,000: 96th percentile

- age 30 (likely to start having kids), $80,000 : 86th percentile
 
- age 30, $100,000: 92nd percentile

- age 35, $80,000:  76th percentile

- age 35, $100,000: 84th percentile

So overall, we are looking at a very very small fraction of Americans. Yet the the finance advice you see here and elsewhere in the internet seems to act like this is a perfectly viable solution. 

Personally, anecdotally, I've never met a single person who was able to use these plans. Every time I run through this kind of calculation I end up at the same conclusion, that HSA is effectively a finance meme, similarly associated with and often seen promoted by the FIRE meme as well. We are talking about something that can only be utilized by less than 10 percent of Americans. This is a joke, and there is real harm in convincing people to sign up for HDHP that likely won't provide sufficient coverage for them in case an accident, which is very likely in America where most people drive cars daily.",finance

However, with my wife's car being paid off and that free up some funds, We have been seriously considering trading in the truck (which should have ~5000 in equity) to purchase a new (or slightly used) vehicle that would better suit transporting a child (or children as the future may dictate) likely another SUV of some sort.

# **April’s jobs report showing millions out of work looms large in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/01/aprils-jobs-report-showing-millions-out-of-work-looms-large-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Investors will focus on the slow reopening of the economy in the coming week, as Friday’s dismal April employment report is expect to paint a frightening picture of the most rapid job losses in history.
*****
&gt; The unemployment rate is expected to jump from 4.4% to over 16.1% in April, the highest level since 1939, according to Dow Jones. Job losses are estimated to total 22 million, slightly below the entire number of jobs that were recovered since the Great Recession.
*****
&gt; Strategists said the market will likely be able to look past the terrible jobs number as it has done with most bad data, showing the results of a sudden and unprecedented shutdown of the economy.
*****
&gt; “I think people are too gloomy about the unemployment situation. I think they think the unemployment rate is going to rise through the summer,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont. “I think the unemployment rate probably peaks in May.”
*****
&gt; Earnings season continues with dozens more companies reporting first-quarter results and talking about the impact of the virus and shutdowns on their businesses. So far, earnings appear to be down 12.7% in the first quarter, based on actual reports and estimates, according to Refinitiv. A diverse group of companies report, including Walt Disney, General Motors, CVS Health and Bristol-Myers Squibb.
*****
&gt; But investors are watching the restarting of the economy, now underway at some level in many states. “If they go well that’s a good thing, but if in a week or two, you start to see some bad virus numbers, that’ll be a blow to confidence,” said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo.
*****
&gt; # Best April in years
Stocks started May with a sharp decline Friday, after a 12.7% gain in the S&amp;P 500 in April, its best month since 1987.
*****
&gt; Sam Stovall, CFRA chief investment strategist, said the market had been looking forward to the latest extension of fiscal stimulus, approved by Congress, and comments from the Fed, which reaffirmed after its meeting Wednesday that it will do whatever is needed to help the economy. “Now there’s not that much to look forward to,” he said, adding the market would react negatively to any resurgence in the coronavirus outbreak.
*****
&gt; “We had a very nice April, the best April since 1938. May is sort of a ho-hum month,” said Stovall. “It’s in the bottom half in terms of average price change, slightly below average in terms of frequency of an advance. … Just looking at last year, May tends to digest April’s gains.” The S&amp;P 500′s April gain was its best for the month in 82 years.
*****
&gt; # Virus economy
Economists and market strategists have been tracking the progress of the virus state by state, watching hospitalization rates, new cases and recoveries for clues on how quickly the economy might be able to restart. The economy is expected to have plunged into a deep recession in the second quarter, contracting by 35% or more, after a 4.8% decline in the first quarter.
*****
&gt; Stanley said he expects the unemployment rate to be a better-than-consensus 11.6% in April before it rises again in May. “This is all a stab in the dark,” he said.
*****
&gt; “I think it’s not going to come down as quickly as it went up,” said Stanley. “But I do think you’re going to see steady improvement. I think you’re going to see millions of people brought back into the payrolls for several months in succession. I think we can get out of the double digits [unemployment] by the end of the summer.”
*****
&gt; Some workers are expected to return to their company payrolls as a result of the small business-focused Paycheck Protection Program, which encourages companies to keep workers on their payroll and bring back those who were cut. But that may not show up until May or June as a factor in the jobs data, Stanley said.
*****
&gt; Millions more are expected to have filed for unemployment claims in the week ending May 2, on top of the 30 million who filed in the previous six weeks. Economists say with such big unprecedented numbers, it is difficult to predict the unemployment rate since some people may have been temporarily unemployed and expect to return to work.
*****
&gt; But regardless, the number could be a shocker even though the market has shrugged off the big numbers of jobless claims and focused instead on the virus curve flattening.
*****
&gt; “I think it could spook people,” said Schumacher. “In the markets, we’ve been watching the weekly claims, but everybody knows what unemployment is.”
*****
&gt; Stanley said he is also watching Tuesday’s ISM nonmanufacturing data, a look at the services sector during April. A cross section of March data shows it was the services sector that took the biggest hit in the shutdowns, and it’s unclear how quickly it can recover.
*****
&gt; “There are people who will go and do things as soon as they’re allowed to, and there are people who are going to stay home for a month or two longer,” he said. “I do think expecting we’re going to pack 100,000 people into a football stadium in September is way too optimistic.”
*****
&gt; Stanley said some of the steep drop in consumer spending in March was the result of consumers stopping spending on health care, including elective surgery. That actually is an area that can bounce back quickly once the health care system is up and running for non virus related treatments.

&gt; # A new 20-year bond
The Treasury could announce its new 20-year bond on Wednesday, when it discloses its quarterly refunding requirements, Schumacher said. He expects about $21 billion of the new 20-year to be issued in the second quarter.
*****
&gt; The amount of Treasury debt is expected to grow in the second quarter to help fund the growing deficit, made bigger by the trillions the government is spending to combat the virus.
*****
&gt; “The supply announcement we think is significant because you’re going to see large auction increases, not just for one month but set in motion for many months to come,” said Schumacher. He expects Treasury to announce $330 billion in notes and bonds in the refunding for the second quarter, up from $240 billion in the first quarter.
*****
&gt; Treasury bill issuance is expected at $1.9 trillion in the second quarter but Schumacher expects that to fall to $260 billion in the third quarter. The bills were used to give the Treasury cash to pay for emergency programs and more of that debt will move to long term debt.

# US Manufacturing Sector Has Entered a Deep Recession

&gt; It is a foregone conclusion that the US economy has entered recession, led by the consumer, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the US economy based on gross domestic product (GDP). The collapse of consumer spending was evident in March personal consumption expenditures data released on Wednesday that showed a record 7.5% month-over-month drop in consumer outlays. It would have been worse if we weren’t stocking our refrigerators and pantries.

&gt; The manufacturing sector is also contracting sharply, not surprisingly given the business shutdowns that began in March. Investors had a glimpse of the extent of the hit to manufacturing in the business investment component of first quarter GDP, which revealed a sharp 8.6% annualized decline, durable goods orders for March, which fell 14.4%, and Markit’s preliminary Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing in April that came in at 36.9, a level consistent with a severe recession.

&gt; Today’s Institute for Supply Management (ISM) PMI for manufacturing—the so-called official PMI—provided more evidence of the depth of the manufacturing downturn. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the headline index fell 7.6 points to 41.5, better than Bloomberg’s consensus forecast of 36, but a level consistent with prior recessions.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ISM-Chart.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; But that’s the good news. Peeling back the onion in this report reveals that the headline number was inflated by the supplier deliveries component. Normally, lengthening supplier delivery times reflect strong demand, which prevents suppliers from keeping up. However, in this environment, it reflects supply chain disruptions from lockdowns around the world related to COVID-19.

&gt; The new orders and employment components of the report, which both fell more than 15 points to around 27, are better indicators of where manufacturing activity in the US is right now. The new orders number just missed the December 2008 level of 25.9, while the employment component hit its lowest level since 1949, putting the slump into proper perspective.

&gt; “The more forward-looking components of the ISM report clearly indicate the manufacturing sector is in the midst of one of the sharpest contractions ever,” said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “Given the close relationship between manufacturing activity and corporate profits, the 25% cut to S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates for 2020 that we’ve seen since March 1 is probably not enough.”

&gt; The ISM report points to a sharp upcoming drop in capital investment and a huge hit to earnings in the second quarter—potentially down 40% year over year (FactSet consensus is calling for a 38% year-over-year decline in S&amp;P 500 earnings).

&gt; Looking ahead, while the economic impact of the global lockdowns has been severe, we continue to be reassured by developing plans to reopen the economy, progress toward treatments and vaccines, and the resolve of Americans to get through this. We continue to expect a very strong rebound in manufacturing and the broad economy later this year.

# Global Central Banks All In

&gt; The Federal Reserve (Fed), the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) all met in the last week and while the show of power was minimal compared to recent weeks, they collectively reasserted their resolve to do whatever is necessary to support the global economy through the COVID-19 economic crisis. Rates are being held about as low as they can go, significant new programs to enhance market liquidity and support lending are in place, and, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, asset purchases have accelerated. In fact, with April not yet completed, central bank assets have risen over $3 trillion, the biggest two-month jump on record.

&gt; “The central bank response to COVID-19 has been fast, effective, and built to impress,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “And the market is seeing it. It’s no coincidence that the market bottomed the day after the Fed rolled out a wide range of new programs addressing key areas of market and economic disruption.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Blog-Chart-20-04-30.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Overview of Recent Central Bank Activity

&gt; The Fed concluded its most recent two-day meeting on Wednesday, April 29. Prior to the meeting the Fed had expanded its program supporting municipalities by lowering the minimum size of the city or county to qualify. The Fed left its target rate unchanged at 0 – 0.25%. Through its policy statement and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments, the Fed signaled that it is unlikely to remove its extraordinary policy support anytime soon, and we believe the Fed may hold its policy rate near zero into 2022. Asset purchases are currently open-ended and have expanded to include investment-grade and high-yield corporate exchange-traded funds.

&gt; The BOJ met on Monday, April 27 and announced that it would lift its cap on buying government bonds, making purchases open ended, and triple the size of its corporate bond commercial debt purchases.

&gt; The ECB met on Thursday, April 30 and announced new refinancing operations and that it would ease conditions on long-term loans to banks, encouraging banks to increase lending.

&gt; With interest rates near zero, all major central banks have been expanding their economic support through new programs and increased asset purchases. Central bank are showing that in a time of crisis, their policy response is not limited to setting policy rates or even bond purchases. The expanded activity has all but eliminated the idea that the central banks are out of ammunition, both now and looking forward. There will come a time when these programs will end, balance sheets will unwind, and rates will rise. But until that time, central banks have shown that even prudent support in a time of economic distress is only limited by their imagination, keeping the old investing maxim “Don’t fight the Fed” alive even in an age of zero rates.

# Typical May Trading: A Month of Transition with Negative Predisposition

&gt; Once again it is that time of the year where we increasingly see and hear “Sell in May.” But when exactly in May is the “best” time to sell? Based upon the last 21 years of data, the best time could be early in May. The month has opened well, on average, recently with strength on the first trading day and on the second trading day for the most part. Afterwards, DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all tend to drift sideways to lower until around May’s sixteenth trading day or so. It is on this day the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 begin to rally to finish the month. Beware though, this late-May rally typically fizzles before it can exceed the highs reached earlier in the month.

# This is Still an Election Year

&gt; We have all been rather preoccupied with the coronavirus pandemic, market volatility and our individual situation. Meanwhile there is still a U.S. Presidential Election taking place this year. And folks are beginning to wonder what the next political alignment might be and the ramifications that alignment has had on the market historically.

&gt; Six possible political alignments exist in Washington: Republican President with a Republican congress, Democratic congress or split Congress; and a Democratic President with a Democratic Congress, Republican Congress or split Congress. Data presented in the chart below begin in 1949 with the first full presidential term following WWII.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dce5f19dd2ccfc16a4e0795dd5a11f68/8033867962439c40-45/s500x750/8543ffd66d568035ffa681a3d72b861c8f84b996.jpg))**

&gt; Election years are traditionally up years. Incumbent administrations shamelessly attempt to massage the economy so voters will keep them in power. But sometimes overpowering events occur and the market crumbles, usually resulting in a change of political control.

&gt; Republicans won in 1920 (DJIA -32.9%) as the post-war economy contracted and President Wilson ailed. The Democrats came back during the 1932 (-23.1%) Depression when the Dow hit its lowest level of the 20th century. A world at war and the fall of France jolted the market in 1940 (-12.7%), but Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term. Cold War confrontations and Truman’s historic upset of Dewey held markets down through the end of 1948 (-2.1%). Recently the Great Recession and bear market of 2008 (-33.8%) helped put Obama and the Democrats back in the White House.

# 10-Day Advance/Decline Lines Running Hot

&gt; The gains in the first half of the week lifted every sector but two—Utilities and Financials—above their 50-DMAs. Meanwhile, Health Care had even touched overbought territory (over 1 standard deviation above its 50-day) earlier in the week, making it the first sector to be overbought since late February.

&gt; When it comes to another measure we monitor, the 10-day advance/decline line, conditions are more broadly appearing overbought. The 10-day advance/decline line measures the average number of daily advancers minus decliners in an index or sector over the last 10 trading days. Very high readings suggest that things have gotten extended in the very near term and downside mean reversion can be expected. Very low reading suggest the opposite.

&gt; The 10-day A/D lines for sectors have been pretty strong recently indicating broad participation in the rally, but this has led these readings to become elevated indicating conditions may be running a bit too hot in the near term. Outside of the defensive sectors like Consumer Staples, Utilities, and Real Estate, every sector's 10-day A/D line has been in overbought territory at some point over the past week. The same can also be said for the 10-day A/D line for the S&amp;P 500. We'd note, though, that while A/D lines are extended, they're not at extreme levels seen at other points over the past year.

solar,DIY Solar Air Pump,"Hello,

My goal for this project is to power a single air pump with a single solar panel with little to no other electrical components. This system only has to run while the sun's out so I don't think there should be any need for a battery. I'm assuming the air pump will need to be DC direct drive but will it need any additional transformer/etc. to ensure proper function? Also, will the pump need to be rated to function at variable voltages, so when the sun starts to go down, obviously the pump will start to loose power but will still operate until there is no longer power being fed to it? What does the solar panel need to be rated to best compliment the air pumps electrical needs, so if both the air pump and solar panel are rated for 12V, does the solar panel need to be rated for a certain wattage to best match the current needed by the pump? And lastly, does this system need any kind of controller to ensure the right amount of power is being fed into the pump during times of high or low power generation. Any and all suggestions are appreciated and let me know if there's any questions about this system. Thanks!",energy

Recently I accpeted a job offer from a gorvernment contractor. I've filled out an **SF-85 ""Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions""** form, as well as a **Declaration for Federal Employment** form.

The job offer letter declared:

***""Your employment is congingent upon obtaining a security clerance or favorable National Agency Check Inquiry (NACI).....failure to obtain and maintain final security clearance or NACI will result in the termination of your employment"".***

So this company is having me start work way before my investigation even begins, and I heard that these investigations can take up to several months to complete. Having said all of that, I have two questions:

1. Assuming a worst case scenario that i dont receive the clerance, will I be ""terminated"" as in ""FIRED""?? I dont want to have this on my employment record!! Can anyone clarify?
2. In the past, I quit two jobs without giving them a two week notice. There wasnt any drama or any kind of issues with the employers, but i quit for personal reasons. Will not giving a two week notice affect my odds of getting clearance?",finance

With the remaining ~$5k can we refinance and possibly get a lower rate? Is it worth it at that point? My payment is roughly 300$ a month, so that would have our payoff just over a year vs the six I had taken the note on for. 

Any guidance is much appreciated. We are not studied in the arts of finance, so this is uncharted waters for this young couple.",finance

personalfinance,Should I put my student loans on Auto-Pay?,"Hey r/personalfinance,

I owe about $33k in total from several individual student loans that I received throughout college, each at varying interest rates. All of these loans are managed by the same servicer. So, the servicer just gives me an amount to pay per month based on my repayment plan, and I pay it. I have no idea what fraction of each payment I make goes toward each of the individual loans that comprise my total balance. 

If I'm able to, I'd like to use the ""avalanche"" method, wherein I pay off the individual loans with highest interest rates first. However, I also have the option of enrolling in auto-pay. According to the website, if I enroll in auto-pay, they'll reduce my interest rate by 0.25%. I assume that reduction would apply to each individual loan's interest rate, but I also get the feeling that they will allocate payments in such a way that maximizes the time it takes to pay off the higher interest loans.

My question to you all is: Will I end up paying less in interest by enrolling in auto-pay and letting them choose how much to pay toward each individual loan, or by sticking to the avalanche method and forgoing a 0.25% reduction in interest rate?",finance

Upfront Mortgage Insurance/Funding Fee: 0.50%

Upfront Mortgage Insurance/Funding Fee: $1,578.15

Here are my questions:

My credit score is 733 and my wife's is 755. He wants to run a credit check. Will the credit check hurt our scores? I also reached out to Costco and was provided with two quotes with similar rates and they want me to submit a loan application. So, three different lenders checking our credit. I assume all three will impact our credit scores negatively? I don't think we'll need any credit any time soon for anything else, so it likely won't matter.

Are these fees totaling $6,078 high? I believe the $1,578.15 is the VA funding fee.

Is it safe to assume the APR is 3.25% (2.75% interest + 0.50% mortgage insurance/funding fee).

Would it hurt to take LoanDepot's offer to a local Credit Union? Really just thinking about our credit scores.

We have $8k in credit card debt that will be paid off by August. Would it be beneficial to pay it off first before I try to refinance?

Bull charge headfirst into red flags, and bear hibernate.  Here we are in the weekend of the first week of May, people's businesses are folding, renters demanding rent breaks, landlords sweating over insolvency and heart attacks just lost top spot in killer diseases to the most contagious virus any of us have ever seen in our lives; but none of this matter.

The market *did break.* Just because people jumped in to short too early and have been getting roughed up 'Fighting the Fed' it does not change anything.  This spectacular 'Unprecedented' rally has not went up any more than historic bull traps.  The spiral of reduced wages &gt; reduced spending &gt; reduced business profits &gt; reduced wages (Loop) is still spinning. '[BRR BRR big big](https://imgur.com/a/S1T7IQQ)' is not improving real  GDP.

&amp;#x200B;

People think the market is not making sense, or not doing what it'd do if it was going to crash. This is not true. It's only not doing what you think it should do based upon what the news is telling you.  Once we'd seen the drop  of March what was to be expected was a bounce from the low and a [strong rally up to about 25,000  on the Dow peppered with positive news events.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/16/dow-jones-enters-end-of-denial-stage-and-start-of-the-bull-trap/)  All  of us who know how to trade have been waiting for that.

The market crash is going to be brutal. The second leg of the move will be bigger than the first one.  The low of the next drop can be under 50% from the high, and all the reasons people say that can't happen they said for the 2019 low breaking in  January, 2020.   A time when a 0.5% drop was considered buying the dip.

What has taken weeks to go up will take hours to come down.  [A headline will come from no-where](https://www.reddit.com/user/2020sbear/comments/gatjxp/whatever_it_is_will_be_on_the_news/) and everything you think you know one day means nothing tomorrow.

I've done a lot of work on this trade.  How a trend fails and reverses is something I know a lot about. Whatever you do as an occupation and hobby - I know as much about this as you do about that. This is both my job and passion.  [I'm betting a lot of money on it,](https://www.reddit.com/user/2020sbear/comments/gbq6eu/big_short_end_of_day_3/) and I got my money by being really good at betting money in markets.

I think the market is setting up to wipe people out.  Your warning sign of this is going to be the arrival of bad news in the coming week and a fall down to break the low of March. Around this time the news may seem to get better - but this will be your final chance to get out at a cheap loss (and yes, I consider a March low exit cheap relative to what June can bring).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not saying my forecasts are perfect. They are not, but they really have been good enough to do sensationally well during 2020. I've been short from feb. Long during early April and built up a short in the 24,000 - 25,000 Dow range.   I'll paste below a walk through of analysis and trades to this point.

\---

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The US indices have been [forming a bubble](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/02/29/formingbubbles/) over the last 50 years. In 2000 and 2008 we seen the early 'Bear trap' sections of the bubble and then in the following decade we seen enthusiasm become greed and greed become delusion. The 30% gain in the S&amp;P500 through the year 2019 was the final stages of this bubble.

Here is a post describing us being in the ['Delusion' stage of the bubble in January of 2020](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPX/KY1p7aZa-50-Years-Could-End-in-Tears-for-US-Indices/).

The pop of this bubble and the following bear market will not be a nice fast one like the crashes of 2000 and 2008, it will be a more drawn out affair where prices drop far lower. The crash of the 2020's will be more like the crash of the 1930's depression. See the analysis [leading to this conclusion here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/01/us-indices-bubble-in-style-reflecting-the-great-depression-of-1930/)

In the months of January and February major US indices traded into the zone where a bubble template would be looking for the top to be made. Read about how this method has [worked in previous crashes here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/05/how-technical-analysis-has-signalled-previous-stock-market-highs-and-now-again-in-2020/) First forecasts in late January were mostly stopped out. There were losing signals on the Dow [around 29,300](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/RGkn3RjW-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Support-Levels-in-the-Week-Ahead/) and some in [February at 28,900](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/xWSFpsRi-Selling-Dow-28-900/). Individual stocks shorts done poorly, One exception was the Vanguard dividends index VYM. This did make it's high on the [exact price first posted.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/VYM/BlWd0mFm-Popular-Vanguard-Has-High-Exposure-to-Bad-Market-Conditions/)

Individual stocks picks done particularly poorly in January. TSLA almost doubled from the first [shorting price of 510.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/TSLA/FOs1PP5d-Tesla-Could-Breakdown-Soon/) Some did a bit better. [Like shorting T at 39.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/T/IUgQyy8k-AT-T-Vulnerable-Debt-Cash-Flow-Leaks/)

Later in February more sell signals were generated as price traded briefly over important resistance levels. If price broke back under these it would suggest market weakness. These were [170 on VTI](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/VTI/IPRCTQh9-VTI-Enters-the-Stubborn-Stage-of-a-Possible-Reversal/) and [29,000 on the Dow.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/LiV4pmmH-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Downside-Break-Possible/) Once these levels were broken the bear market began. In the following days a signal for a [30% drop on the Dow Jones came](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/Cd6Il3np-Next-Series-of-Falls-Can-Take-Dow-Down-10-000-Points/) (and was successful).

Individual stock picks did much better in February. High prices were signalled in [MSFT](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/MSFT/LWCMh0jH-Microsoft-Setting-Up-For-Hard-Landing/), [BRK](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/BRK.A/bHDf6D7j-Buffet-s-the-King-of-the-Bag-Holders/), [SPCE](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPCE/uFAroqOi-SPCE-and-Gravity/), [GOOG](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/GOOG/m56g98mU-Weekly-Bearish-Butterfly-Pattern/). A high on [AMZN was called](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/AMZN/b4DOD5dy-The-Amazon-Bubble/), but price later traded higher. The best signal generated was a buy on the [TVIX from 34 to 800.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/TVIX/ts9VcIlG-TVIX-Long-Term-Trend-Line-Break/)

In the month of March , 2020, the bubble popped. Most risk based assets and indices crashed over 30%. First analysis post said to [wait for a bounce to sell into](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/nVbfBVXn-Dow-Bounces-Like-a-Brick-While-Making-Big-Breakout/), but this was updated before the market opened to say prices could fall [8% and then 30% in March.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/01/30-dow-jones-drop/) At this point the TradingView account was suspended. Only one account is allowed, and this was set up specifically for a 2020's bear market. So no further posts or updates were made there.

On the 3rd of March came the first signal to [look for the down move entering somewhere in the 16,000 - 18,000 area](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/16/dow-jones-enters-end-of-denial-stage-and-start-of-the-bull-trap/) on the Dow Jones. Followed by a post on the 16th of March saying [we're entering into the bull trap.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/31/optimism-in-the-air-as-end-of-bull-trap-approaches/) The low on the Dow would be made around 18,250 on the 23rd of March. From here a rally began which has made a current high of 24,500.

April of 2020 has been the bull trap month. Some losing signals have been generated in the later couple weeks of April. A few calls on the top of the bull trap have been made. Prices have not went substantially higher, they've just not dropped. A forecast on the [17th of April marks the current high](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/16/17th-april-2020-the-bull-trap-completes/), but it looks like price can trade a bit higher. A post on the 19th of April calls for a crash in the S&amp;P500 to [1,600 within the next 5 - 10 weeks](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/19/19th-of-april-here-comes-an-attitude-readjustment/).

Today is the 25th of April. Over the last two weeks forecasts of a big drop starting have been inaccurate. I very strongly suspect this is akin to the sell signals generated in late January and early February. It's the right idea, but it's just the wrong time.

personalfinance,Need financial advice for a largish sum of money I will be getting soon.,"I will be getting roughly $20,000 before the end of the year through my dads estate who passed away.

We also have around $10,000 in savings already. 

I either want to 

1.) save the money for house in the near future

2.) pay off the car loan ( currently owe $19,000 at 2.90%) $350 a month

3.) pay off student loan ( currently owe $18,000 at 3.74%) $150 a month

personalfinance,Haven't received Federal Refunds - been two months.,"Hi. I filed my federal and state taxes through Turbotax in early Feburary. Because this was my first year using them, I was unable to file electronically (or something like that it's been a while), so I printed everything and mailed it. I received my state return weeks ago through direct deposit as I had set up on Turbotax. It's now May 2nd and I still haven't gotten my federal refund, though. It's been like 10 weeks. I have tried to use their online Where's my Refund tool but it does not find any results. I have tried to call their refund hotline but due to the pandemic there is nobody to pick up. I tried calling the basic IRS support line but had the same results. I can not find an email anywhere to contact the IRS that way. 

All information, including bank account details, were exactly the same as on my state return, as I used Turbotax. I already got my state refund so I don't see why they would have trouble finding where to send the Federal one. I don't understand why I haven't gotten it and I don't know how to contact them in these times.

economy,Privatized Stimulus: Proposal for Post-Pandemic Economic Recovery,"**Hypothesis:**

If industries that grew profits or were insulated by the effects of the pandemic directly invest into back into the economy through direct charitable grants, subsidized loans, or other forms of support, a more favorable outcome both long and short term will be achieved both by donors and recipients of funding.

**Assumptions:**

* Industries who gained or were insulated from the effects of the pandemic did so on the heels of a healthy economy, but the long term impacts of economic downturn pose significant threats to short and long term profits.
* The threat of ""worst case scenarios"" in economic downturn not only include losing consumer buying power, investor confidence, but also devalued property and other assets.
* It is possible the profits ""lost"" or ""tied up"" in charitable giving and subsidized loans will be far less than what would be loss in a long term economic downturn by orders of magnitude.
* Inevitability of ""Invisible Threats"".  Industries know their supply chains well, but the interdependent nature of a free market economy suggests seemingly unrelated factors in the economy will have a direct impact on each other.  In other words, even though your supply chain is in good condition right now does not ensure you won't be blindsided by economic consequences that weren't considered a factor.
* Taking no action will put more pressure on the need for government bailouts and other programs to stimulate the economy, which threaten severe long term impacts due to inflation.  This triggers a chain reaction that poses a significant threats not only to the economy but to the society as a whole.
* The effects of global economic downturn are far reaching.  As larger segments of the population fall into poverty the consequences include, increase of deaths from suicide and addiction, regional instability/civil unrest, regional or even global military conflict.  While some effects may be unavoidable, softening the blow of potential worst case scenarios could literally save millions of lives and have a profound impact on future generations.

**Methods**:

* **Implementation of Grant &amp; Loan Programs both direct from large corporations as well as partnering with other organizations who have efficient and effective ways to distributing funds to businesses that need it the most.**  Starting with sectors that most directly impact your industry and moving outward towards industries that indirectly impact.  This funding would be used to rapidly stimulate companies with a healthy track record of profitability to give them the ability to recover without taking on significant debts or having to downsize dramatically.  This would include subsidizing low or zero interest rate loans as a means to help companies while having the ability to recover some of the funding.
* For small to medium sized companies, there is a major incentive to invest in local and regional economies.  These companies individually may not have the means or resources to make large investments all at once, let alone have the resources necessary to run a grant/loan program.  This issue can be addressed by lowering the barrier of entry by partnering with organizations and platforms that are effective means of collecting and distributing funds.  **Microfunding presents a great solution for this as the compounding impact of small/medium sized businesses providing funding in a centralized and easy to use platform opens up the opportunity to funnel large amounts of revenue to stimulate local communities, regions, and specific industries.**

personalfinance,My personal finance situation and need some advice!,"Hi, I'm in my early 30's, single, a woman (if that matters). I entered my career late in life, but currently enjoy my job very much. Here's a breakdown of my personal finance information:

\- I make about 75k a year in a city that has a very high cost of living.

\- I have about 60k in student loans (grad school only), at 3.5% interest rate, refinanced.

\- I have no other debt.

\- I have about 15k in savings, not invested. Just for emergency.

\- I have a 401k through my employer, but since I entered the workforce late in life, there isn't too much in there. They match 50% of my contribution up to 2% of eligible pay.

\- My expenses are low-medium. My car is paid off, I split rent with a friend in a condo; I pay $1,100/month. I have normal expenses, e.g. utilities, car insurance, phone bill, foods, occasional entertainment, etc. I also help out my parents financially here and there.

Some other details: I am not willing to move because all my family, roots, friends, and all professional connections are in this city. I actually think it will be counter-productive to move to a nobody-land just to save living cost. The type of career I am in does not facilitate a jump in salary via job-hopping; unless I go into management, my income will grow very slowly and steadily in accordance with years of experience in the job. 

Question:

Most advice I'm reading online is that I should first tackle my student loans aggressively. So this is what I have done for the last few years after I graduated from grad school. I'd first pay all my bills and then pour as much as I can into student loans each month. Outside of the 15k savings I have, I am not saving more or investing in anything other than 401k. 

Is there anything you would do differently? I guess my question is... I'm relatively comfortable where I am, but am wondering if I should be doing anything differently knowing that I eventually want a family, a home, etc. Would appreciate any input!",finance

personalfinance,Taxes on foreign income as a greencard holder,"So, I'm a greencard holder and as such, like US citizens, I am required to pay taxes on any foreign income. Now, there is this concept of 'double taxation'. I am using TurboTax to do my taxes. However, this year when entering income from dividends &amp; sales of stock that I hold in an account in Europe, it reduces my federal refund by about $400 and my state refund by about $700. I roughly have $5,700 in foreign income ($2,000 from stock sales, $3,700 in dividends). I paid $1300 in foreign taxes on this. I declared the dividends as qualified dividends and recorded the stock sales (fall under long-term gains). However, I don't get it this massive reduction in my refunds. I also find it incredibly difficult to understand on TurboTax how to file a foreign tax credit. The one they give me is only $670 or so, even though I paid almost double that in taxes already.

personalfinance,Need help with some refinance math,"We are in the process of refinancing our mortgage to pay off a 2nd mortgage and some credit card debt.

In the initial conversation with the mortgage broker on 4/7/2020:

Mortgage: $510,400

Interest Rate: 3.25%

Points: 1.125

Cost of points: $5,742

using this info I calculated an interest rate of 3.5313%

&amp;#x200B;

In the initial loan estimate we received on 4/8/2020 (after credit pull):

Mortgage: $510,400

Interest Rate: 3.25%

Points: 1.375

Cost of points: $7,018

Lender credit: $1,250

which I equate to an interest rate of 3.5784%

&amp;#x200B;

In the final loan estimate for the rate lock on 5/1/2020:

Mortgage: $510,400

Interest Rate: 3.25%

Points: 1.5

Cost of points: $7,656

calculated interest rate: 3.625%

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

between 4/8 and 5/1, it looks like interest rates have dropped between 1 and 2 basis points, however, my calculated interest rate went up close to 10 basis points.  The lender credit was not something that I had negotiated for, I was surprised to see it, and then curious about why it was dropped (I actually didn't know prior to this that it was priced into the interest rate). I haven't spoken to the mortgage broker since before we got the rate lock, and will talk to him next week.  So here are my questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Is my calculation of the interest rate based on the points correct (1 point = .25% interest rate costing 1% of the loan amount, same with lender credits)

2) If so, is it odd that my interest rate would have moved up 10 basis points (or 5 basis points after they had already pulled my credit) vs a 1-2 basis point drop in the overall mortgage rates

3) The 3.625% rate seems like the market rate for refinancing, so I just can't tell if my objection is that the initial rate was lower, but it seems like a fair deal objectively.

4) I have not shopped around but started working with my existing mortgage company, I'm assuming that should be my next step.  I paid for an appraisal, anyone know if I can use that appraisal instead of paying for another when shopping around.",finance

I am required to be out on my own in the next 3 months. That's a given. I do not have monetary support from others (family/friends) incoming now short of being allowed to stay in their house for free and will have zero help of any kind when I am on my own in 3 months.

I would like some help on deciding what to do with student loan debt.

I have $11,747 in direct subsidized stafford loans. This balance was issued to me in three chunks: $747 that will have a 3.5% interest rate, $5500 that will have a 4.6% rate, and $5500 at a 5% rate. 

I have no other debt of any kind. I have no credit cards. I had a credit card on a student checking account several years ago that I never, not even once, used and eventually closed. I do not have recurrent payments for my phone (pay as you go) and have only paid one 6 month increment of car insurance. I do not believe I have engaged in any other credit building monetary activity that I am aware of existing.

I currently have $13,000 in my bank account and my stimulus $1200 has not yet arrived. I am employed part-time and do not expect to be making more than $1500 per month reliably for the next 6 months. My degree is not able to easily provide me with income greater than working at a grocery store would, as my current living area does not have job openings for my degree (BS in Teaching English as a Second Language) within an hour of where I can be living and I will need time to find a way to use it.

My original plan was to take the debt the last two years of my education in case something happened and I needed the money in my bank account. If I still had the full amount when I graduated, I intended to pay off my debt in full so as to have no strings attached to myself beyond what I needed to eat/have a roof/etc. However, I have since been counseled that having debt is good because credit building... which I have very little to none of...

What options should I consider here? Should I pay off my debt and have $3,000 and a car to my name? Should I pay off part of the debt - maybe get one or both of the higher interest rate loans gone specifically through the lender and just keep the tiny one at 3.6% and pay it off slowly to build credit?  Should I keep all of the debt and expect I'll need $13,000+whatever income I can scrounge up to survive for the next year?

personalfinance,Using brokerage margin against T-Bills to finance a home purchase,"Today margin rates at some brokerages are [below 2% APR](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=46376&amp;p=m). Lets assume a taxable brokerage account at [interactive brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/) that has a net portfolio value of $500k with $450K of it allocated to diversified equities and $50k allocated to 3-6 month U.S. treasury bills. 

The [margin requirement on 3-6 month T-bills is 1% of the value](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=26666). The $50k in t-bills therefore can be used to borrow up to $5 million on margin. 

If someone wants to purchase a house for $500k, one option seems to be borrowing the $500k from the margin brokerage account which would only use 10% of the max margin on the t-bills. The current rate for such an account is 1.15% but let us assume 1.5% to account for market changes. **At 1.5% the annual interest expense on the account would be $7,500.**

Let us also assume that in the current low rate environment, the T-bills will effectively return 0%. **If the $450k in equities only returned 2% a year that would be a gain of $9,000 in the first year**, enough to cover the $7,500 in interest expense. 

In reality, the equity portion should return 7-10% a year overtime and far exceed in the interest expense drag. Furthermore, the homeowner would continue to contribute interest + principle payments to the brokerage account instead of the mortgage which reduces the interest expense drag on the portfolio.

Let's compare this with taking a traditional mortgage. A 10-year mortgage from [better.co](https://better.co)m shows a rate of 2.91% today. Assuming 20% down, one would first have to sell close to $65k-$75K in securities to also cover the taxable event that selling $50k in securities would generate from raising the $100k to cover the down payment.  It would create a monthly payment of $3,925 and have interest payments totaling $61,522 over the 10 years. **A true cost of \~$80,000 with the taxable event selling the securities creates.**

**If one instead contributes the $3,925 a month to the brokerage account and manages a 6% annualized return over the 10 years, that would compound into an additional $620,815.** 

Other benefits of using margin borrowing is not having to go through a long loan approval process with a bank and being able to get a better deal on the home purchase by making a ""cash"" offer.

Now let us examine the risks in the margin strategy. 

There is **interest rate risk** in which case the interest expense goes up. The first thing that would counter act this is the t-bills that are being rolled over into would have higher yields and start to generate interest income to help offset the new higher interest expense. Longer term bond yields and preferred securities would also become more attractive with higher yields and can have some of the equity portfolio allocated to it in order to generate a higher more stable portfolio return. Still there is a chance the interest expenses will simply rise way above what is tenable.

There is also **margin call risk**. While the current rule is 1% margin on t-bills, the rule can be changed. The brokerage firm also has discretion as to when you are required to increase the equity in your margin account. Some firms will attempt to contact you to tell you additional equity is required, but they're not obligated to do so. How likely is this move by a broker like interactive brokers?

Finally, perhaps I am misunderstanding the how margin works with T-bills, in which case a proper explanation is welcome.

In short, it seems this is a strategy that even with the risks maybe worth pursing. This is something I am personally considering doing in the next year and welcome comments pointing out what I have missed and what the blind spots in such a strategy are.

stocks,Where the market is headed and why...plus virus update,"I'll reiterate these are just my opinions, but all of the numbers or stats I mention are correct from sources like WSJ, Bloomberg, NYT etc. plus individual research.

The virus:

As Im sure you've seen recently there has been a lot of media coverage on Remdesivir, the first possible therapeutic for COVID. I have seen various different claims to how effective it is, from Gilead the maker to obscure media outlets like STAT which originally reported it was very effective at wiping out the virus. The WHO leaked the results of a study from China last week that claimed there was no statistical significance between patients who were given a regimen of the drug, and those who werent. This study was double-blind, and had a control group, but was smallish with only I believe around 100 participants. The WHO then pulled this article from their site shortly after it went up. Days later, the official report from China was released the morning of the GDP drop of the month of March which came in at -4.8%, the biggest drop since 2009.  

Funnily enough, that same morning both the GDP report and the small China study were released for Remdesivir, Gilead came out saying that a study in the US patients given the drug resulted in a drop of hospitalization time from 14 days to 11 days, with ~50% of patients improving who had severe results. This covered up the China story quickly. The market jumped 3% and it was blasted on all media outlets that this was the first therapeutic. The flaw in this study was there was no control group, so in my opinion it is nearly impossible to measure how succesful the drug was. It was also not coincidence that this news dropped the same day as the official China study came out. I remain skeptical at how good this drug will turn out to be, but there are much larger studies set to be released in the coming weeks. There are also over 200 different therapies and vaccine trials going on worldwide. Without getting too far into detail, Bill Gates sees 7-10 vaccine trials as being very hopeful with a timeframe of 9-18 months. I personally believe it will be by the end of the year we have a good vaccine option or therapeutic with 90% + effectiveness that will only be available for emergency use. Gates sees the logistics of making billions of drug doses safely as the larger challenge, and that taking longer than expected because it's literally never been done. 

In terms of the latest research about mortality and contagion, it seems that the R-naught (how many people you spread the virus to once you are infected) is much higher than anticipated. Bill Gates seems to think it's around 5. So for every one person who gets it, you give it to 5 people if left unmitigated. Obviously an exponential curve. The reason its so difficult to contain is because how much of a ""viral load"" you are exposed to determines how symptomatic you are, and how sick you get- for the most part. There are reports of people having very high loads and not being symptomatic. Again a reason why its so difficult to track. Social distancing has reduced this R-naught in nearly every state to below 1 or to about 0.8 in most places, which is maintained the virus would eventually fizzle out slowly. Unfortunately, the minute restrictions are lifted the number will rise possibly to above 1 and you will see cases start to climb exponentially again. A great website that illustrates this I've linked here: https://rt.live/

Mortality is tricky because it is so biased on age. It seems that the mortality rate on average will be much lower than the ~5% current US statistics report. This is because the denominator for the calculation is likely between 10-50 times larger depending on location than reported cases. An antibody study for NY saw that around 20% of the population has had the virus already. My guess is places where outbreaks are bad the numbers are much higher than reported, and places where numbers are low the reported cases are much more accurate. In all likelihood we will never know the actual number. The death rate for young healthy people without underlying conditions is about 0. The death rate for anyone around 40 without underlying conditions is close to 0, and anyone above 40 with underlying conditions it is pretty dangerous to risk going out. About 95% of the cases are considered ""mild"", but mild cases are like the worst flu you've ever had, and the symptoms last for weeks. Also new reports suggest not only does this ravage the lungs, but it can also cause permanent heart and brain damage for unknown reasons. People have reported upticks in seizures after getting the virus. All in all not great. 

I believe we are past the biggest peak of cases if things continue as they have been, but opening up will cause there to be more peaks to come. Probably we will have limited opening and closing of much of the economy all over the country at different points until we have herd immunity or a breakthrough in medicine. The best visual I've seen is a sinusoidal wave that has lower peak to troughs as time goes on. The Y axis being new cases, the X being time. The one anomaly that gives me hope is Sweden which has not locked down but it seems slowly gained/gaining herd immunity. A more likely scenario for the US is Singapore, which is now undergoing strict lockdowns after an initial first wave- they are in the second. What I see is indisputable at this point is we won't ever go back to a complete normal until a vaccine or a 95% + therapeutic. 

The economy

The last email I sent on March 22nd I mentioned now was the first time I'd buy into the market since the peak for certain companies based on how steep the drop was. By sheer luck, it was the day before the market bottomed on March 23rd. If you had bought some of the stocks that I suggested on the day of the email (which not even I did all of them) most of the companies are up around ~50% with some like Chipotle and some of the hotel and cruise stocks up about ~100% since just 5 weeks ago. Now, I believe we are on the other side of where we were, which is absurdly overbought. Let me explain why. 

As I mentioned last time, there were multiple enormous stimulus packages that were released during the past five weeks. The fed successfully backstopped the credit and equity markets from completely collapsing, which would have happened if they didn't flood an unprecedented amount of liquidity into both markets. 

On a daily basis for the past few weeks the fed has bought around $70 billion of credit, more than entire months of the last few years. They have slowly waned off of this ridiculous buying, but what it did besides stabalize markets is completely disconnect market fundamentals from prices. This is why we have seen an over 60% retracement of the initial drop in the stock market the past month. I believe this is now over, and I am taking a leap to say the peak of the rally was last Thursday. I could be wrong, but from a technical perspective a number of indicators say Thursday might've been it. I am suggesting if you are in stocks that have had a significant updraft since the lows of the past few weeks, I would sell into strength. Despite the unprecedented measures of monetary and fiscal stimulus brought on by the government, and the media headlines of the 'new bull market', the government can only support, not supplant consumer demand. 

Estimates of corporate earnings continue to rocket downwards, and the most recent GDP estimate for Q2 is between 30-40% decline. This is not on an annualized basis, but then you need to consider the rebound which is why the market has recovered so much- all hope that the recovery will be V shaped. I believe the recovery wont be nearly as fast as the market has priced in, which is a V. Trump seems to be on this side which has promoted what I consider false hope in many. Even if there is a relatively fast medical breakthrough, 30 million people are now unemployed, with the actual number likely 20% or more higher than 30 million. This means that every single job since the financial crisis' peak unemployment is now gone. 30 million people is 18% of the labor force. Many of these jobs might be temporary layoffs, but the labor participation rate has been declining since the 90s. And with the government's generous $600 a week unemployment check plus state unemployment, anyone making less than $15 an hour would be making less working than sitting at home. In other words, the government is incentivizing companies to lay off workers. These benefits will likely go into 2021, greatly slowing the economic recovery. Also, most small restaurants and consumer businesses cannot sustainably be open at 25% capacity. It is more economically viable to stay closed with no expenses other than rent and utilities than be open paying employees more than $15 an hour at 1/4 capacity with 1/4 tips. 

The market 

We have retraced and bounced off of the 61% level, an important level many people trade on. We also broke the uptrend from the past few weeks, and were trading on ever thinning volume. Additionally, Buffet's favorite market indicator tracking market-cap/GDP is at an all-time high. The market is also extremely top heavy, meaning 5 companies make up more than 20% of the total S&amp;P market cap. Commodities are also tanking, with oil below 20$ a barrel, hitting -40 last week for a day. The last time all of these conditions were in place while the market ticked every higher on hope was the 2001 internet bubble. This is where it gets interesting, if you werent already riveted by this rambling mess of an email. 

During the market crash, 7/10 retail market participants (us) didnt motify their positions at all. Of the 3 that did, the vast majority actually added stocks, only 16% sold them. One of the key indicators of a market bottom is capitulation, when everyone thinks it'll never end. The market bottoms when there is no one else left to sell. 16% selling doesn't sound like capitulation to me. 

Looking at fundamentals, the forward-12 months earnings for the aggregate S&amp;P has been falling precipitously over the past few weeks with the consensus is around $125 a share, a 30% drop from pre-coronavirus levels. This is how much earnings dropped in 2008, and I think this drop will be worse overall so in my opinion it is a conservative estimate. Multiplying that by the average P/E ratio of the past 50 years you get 2,100 for the S&amp;P. Multiplying it by a more realistic number you get 1800. We are trading at ~2850 as of close Friday. This would give an implied P/E forward looking ratio of ~23, the second highest in history after the 2001 bubble. I don't think we will hit 1800 as of now because of what the fed has done, but it isn't out of the question. Many highly regarded investors like Scott Minerd, Jeff Gundlach, and Ray Dalio agree. Minerd sees a worst-case of 1500 for the S&amp;P. 

In summay, I believe we are at the peak of a long term debt cycle. I believe the levels of debt accumulated during this crisis will inhibit investment from consumers and corporations for years to come. 40% of Americans couldn't afford an unexpected expense of $400 without taking on debt before this crisis- during the longest economic expansion in US history. Over the past decade the recovery was the slowest ever since WWII, and the interest rates never got above 2.5% historically very very low, which begs the question why was it so slow? This will change consumer behavior like the Great Depression did, hopefully for the better. But the enormous government responses globally will also fundamentally change how the world operates. Printing money at billions a week is not sustainable, and inflation will occur at some point. For now, the dollar is in such high demand we are likely to see a sustained period of delation, which further hurts an economic recovery and investment. Why would you hire a new employee now if it will cost you less in the future- deflation. I know this sounds doom and gloom, but it's not meant to be. Buffet had his annual meeting today and said America will get through this, and I totally agree. It's just I believe this is a 9/11 or great depression type event that will change our behavior in ways that we don't know yet. Honestly, in the long run probably positively. But from a growth perspective and from the market, it does offer an opportunity. 

I hope this didn't bore you to death. It was part from a paper I'm writing and part something I have fun doing. The attached pic shows the grey box as my best guess of where I think the market is going. I could be totally wrong, but if I am I’m going to question everything I know about finance because that’ll prove money grows on trees. Then again Tesla is the second most valuable car company in the world worth $150 billion and its stock is up 70% for the year, and it had income of $16 million the last quarter- so maybe money does grow on trees. Again feel free to offer any thoughts.

TLDR: The market is headed to 2100-1800 and we reached the peak of the rally last week.",finance

personalfinance,"RSU, tax, box 14, Shares withheld to cover tax, and an empty 1099-Div from Etrade","I think I crammed all the right terms in. There are lots of examples of RSUs and tax implications but I'm really just not following it enough to understand why I don't see anything on my 1099s.

When I look at my W-2 from my employer, I see a special notice in box 14- RSU- $1600. When I look at Etrade I can get individual tax 'statements' from both vestings, which shows payments made for federal, SS, Medicare, NY/S, etc. The leftover 'cash' is (says deposited along with my check.

When I look at my tax information from Etrade, there is nothing on any form indicating these stocks exist- just a 1099-DIV showing dividends.

What I'm trying to understand is what exactly I need to put into my tax (software)- there's not an option for RSU- but it seems that everything has already been squared on paper.

So do I put the RSU in box 14 as 'other'? And how do I account for not having any paperwork on the sale from Etrade?

personalfinance,22 years old. Just received a sizable monetary gift and I'm unsure how to best use it.,"(Outside of the amount received, which is CAD, everything else is in USD). So I’ve been reading up on the subreddit, but would love an personal advice.

So about me. I’m 22, Canadian &amp; American and my grandmother on my Canadian side just gave me $100,000 CAD. I am currently in grad school and am taking out federal loans to do so. It’s not an even split, but all in all it will be around $78,000 in debt split close to half being 6% and the other halve being just over 7% interest. This of course does not start until next year once I graduate and at which point I will be making money on my own.

The way I look at it is that I can try and wait out the conversion rate and invest it in the meantime, or I can convert it now and use it towards my school payments - it won’t cover it all, but it will be close. After paying off part of the loans I will have nothing left. Of course, if my investment returns are more than interest on my loans I’m coming out ahead.

The way I look at it is this. At 22 it will take me awhile before I have this much money to invest. Going forward it could really pay off. I can invest now, and then max out retirement funds which will reward me well in the long run. However, I still have my loans to pay off.

As far as I’m aware, I can live ignorant to the fact that I have it while it grows. As of a handful of days ago I planned to pay off my loans and everything in that nature traditionally. Would love to hear any thoughts on the matter.",finance
personalfinance,Expecting a Large Payout...how to handle?!,"Hi Guys-

Firstly, I hope everyone is staying safe, sane and well! Long story short, I’m receiving a large fee from a client and the amount is roughly 155k-162k, I’m expecting the amount to hit my account tomorrow. I work in a commission based business but am doing pretty well for myself as of late. I however do receive a small salary of roughly 40k, and is guaranteed income. 

I graduated college 2 years ago and firstly wanted to ask for advice on what I should do with this hard earned money. Here’s a snapshot of my debt along with expenses. I also have a S Corp which allows me to use tax advantages through business expenses, need to talk to my CPA to find out what’s allowed. I also need a new car cause my old one is a POS and I have ran it into the ground. I’m thinking of purchasing a used BMW or Audi, (should I try financing or purchase it outright? ) 

FYI. I live with my mom, don’t have to pay rent, or expenses other than cell phone, going out, kickboxing gym, food, etc. My credit score is in the process of rebuilding and is sitting at low 600s hoping to bring it to 700s.

Total Debt: ~50K 
&gt;$3K Outstanding Car Loan...(car is broken and make minimum payments of approximately $220/month) 
&gt;$60.00 Credit Card Debt...Outstanding with 1,000 credit limit (should I ask for a credit increase?) 
&gt;$41,562 Student Loan...through FedLoan 0% interest cause of CV-19 til September
&gt;$5,200 Student Loan Debt...through my University 0% Interest cause of CV-19 til September. 


How should I tackle my debt? I’m hoping that we realize that Student Loan Debt is a massive issue and it gets forgiven but I doubt that happens...I’d like to invest in stock market as now I could get attractive returns (long term), start a business...regardless this is one fee of many to come and this is a good problem to have but wanted to get your opinions and  thoughts as to how I should approach my debts (should I stretch out my student loan payments, wait for 2020 elections, buy a cheap car not a used BMW or Audi, etc.).

worldpolitics,The fall of the USSR will cause the fall of the US,"During the Cold War the US and the USSR were trapped in a fierce competition to show the world who had the best model. Nor the competition nor the measurement were explicit. 
The most explicit measurements were -military might (arms race)
-technological advancements (space race)
-physical prowess (Olympics)
Others measures were present and debated in other countries but are now forgotten 
-the population’s well-being
-the population’s wealth 

After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the dislocation of the USSR - the race ended - and one model (capitalism) was declared the winner.
The US has been - since then - racing backwards. And the world unwillingly has followed. 

Communism - imperfect as it was - did have one huge success - to keep pre 1990 capitalism in check. To compete with it the US (and other countries) had to invest in their countries and their people. Pre 1990s US created regulations such as the  birth of the EPA - to bring Americans clean air and water. Social redistribution programs such as Medicare to provide compassion for the elderly. And invested massively in state driven research - that brought wonders like the moon landing - internet - and even... the iPhone.

As of 1990 - the model was no longer challenged. There was no longer another alternative so it no longer needed to be reinvented - it no longer needed to provide better wealth and/or living conditions for all. All that stayed was the idea that the economic model alone won the Cold War. When what actually won the Cold War was the sustainability of that model. And it was sustainable because people believed in it - it gave society confidence there would be a better tomorrow for them and their children(a trust that was lost in the USSR - and that is lost today in the US). 
Since 1990 - the belief around the economic model has been amplified to a point where a significant portion of the world believe « the free market will bring us constant advances ». And the US dogma around it has pushed other countries to play by those rules to not get suffocated by US trade regulations (the best example being the Cuban embargo - what risk does Cuba pose today for the US other than ideological ?). 

Why did the pre-1990 model create such confidence? And why does the current system create so little?
I would argue that federal investments were responsible for a lot of that confidence. The ability for the governments to guide the free market (EPA-FDA etc) so that the population felt comfortable in how they live and how they consume - the scientific programs that led to great advances brought pride - the  social programs (Medicare - Medicare - social security) brought a sense of safety in old age. 
There have been no new program in the last 30 years. Only a reduction of the existing ones.
It isn’t always a bad thing to reduce government action in certain spheres - but it is important to keep a balance - to keep driving investments (in science and people) and to keep regulating as fast as the market evolves so that people suffer as little as possible. The role of government is to ensure stability and safety. Rolling back programs alone does not fill that role.",finance
personalfinance,Aggressive student loan repayment vs hybrid/investing,"Recently, I refinanced my sizable student loans ($150k), taking interest from 6.5% to 3.9% in a 10yr payoff term. 

Fairly high/stable joint household income ($350k/yr). Maxing 401k with employer match and a 529 contribution. Living in a high cost city. 

This leaves about $10k net per month after expenses (rent, childcare, minimum loan payments, etc). 

I currently have it split $5k as additional loan payment and $5k going to taxable brokerage index fund. At this rate, the loan should be paid off in about 2yrs, with a decent amount invested during this time. 

Should I be making even more aggressive loan repayments just to mentally wipe that debt out sooner? Or is the 3.9% a “manageable” interest rate to be a little more patient with it? I know the Dave Ramsey school of thought, but thought I’d get some feedback. Thanks!",finance

I know rates are lower than last year, and keep declining as the future is uncertain. When/if the fed raises rates again, I would assume it reasonable to expect that banks will raise their APYs with some lag time. Will the APYs on an account automatically rise back up?  Or would one need to reapply/negotiate back to the increased rates, a la refinancing? As the rates have been automatically lowered, I would assume that the opposite would hopefully be true, too.

Since this is non-ideal, I'm currently planning on moving the bulk of that fund into a HYSA - likely Ally.  I realize that some other banks and credit unions have marginally higher rates, but 1) it's far better than what I have now, 2) eking out an extra 0.1-0.2% isn't a high priority now, and 3) I value Ally's reputation.  I would also prefer a HYSA over a laddered CD, mostly for extra liquidity.

&gt;The investor questioned whether people would fly as much in the next two  or three years as they did last year. Even if 70% or 80% of the airline  business returns, he said, the carriers could end up with ""too many  planes.""

[Investopedia on the Annual Meeting and Buffet](https://www.investopedia.com/5-takeaways-from-the-2020-berkshire-hathaway-annual-meeting-4843875)

&gt;Indeed, if one could pick a time and place to be born, Buffett believes  that the best choice would be in America today. ""This is an  extraordinarily young country"" at 231 years (since the 1789 inauguration  of George Washington as president), Buffett stated, ""but what we have  accomplished is miraculous."" He later asserted, ""Never bet against  America.""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Warren Buffet said not to bet against the USA. He and his company have sold all of their stacks in the airline industry due to decreased business, decreased globalization, fundamental change in the world economy and a belief that airlines have too many planes. 

He says not to bet against the U.S. economy, talks of uncertainty concerning negative interest rates, supports the Fed's response and brings to the forefront the good value of the S&amp;P 500.

&amp;#x200B;

He says oil drilling, most likely, will decrease and not be profitable. I personally know little of the true economics behind peak oil, the oil industry and OPEC/""the oligopoly"" and its effects on the equities markets and economics in general. I know over supply, the ""new oil industry"", over supply, decreased demand, uncertain oil future predictions, etc. have made in the short run revenue/profit/bankruptcies/""lost"" for many oil companies across the world. Truly a single quarter can make or break a company and this current oil situation is evident of that. I shorted Exxon, Chevron, and other companies with negative prospects etc. IMO oil is like any other commodity - Gold, Iron, Silver, porkbellies, etc. With no drilling I think equities concerning oil is outside the framework of traditional trading of commodities because commodities and equities are moderately related. The companies that can control the market (oil supply,  demand, storage, production, sales, logistics etc.) will come out on top in IMO. Opinions?

I should have it all paid off once I apply my last big payment when the 0% interest rate on federal student loans ends in September. After that, I'll have $28k left in relatively low interest federal student loans (4.375% but I am enrolled in autopay so it's effectively 4.125%). My original plan was to keep at it putting all my extra money (besides my emergency fund) at paying this down until I'm free and clear, but I am reconsidering if this is the right thing to do given the lower interest rate.

I've read a few sources that say you should pay off anything above 4% ASAP, but have seen 6% from other sources. Am I better off funneling all of my excess earnings to pay the remaining loans off or should I pay the standard monthly payment from now on and allocate extra earnings toward other goals (investing, bolstering emergency fund, etc.)?

\- FB ecosystem

This is the stock that i believe is invested in the right places and has a path forward in the global market. I work as a React developer in fintech and I greatly enjoy their technology. The reason I stopped using snapchat was because I couldn't use it on low connection in Mexico, but Instagram worked marvelously. I use Whatsapp to stay in touch with my family in mexico and Facebook to stay in touch with my mom. There's something extremely powerful about that in my opinion.

They're conservative with their push and development of camera  and VR technology which is wise in my opinion give the many opportunities that exist in that space. They're pushing along with fintech in India, again with small business through Whatsapp. And they provide a suite of customer services for small business and entrepeneurs.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Microsoft

I think they will have a great run during the cloud era of software development. Their acquiring of Github AND NPM goes to show how in touch they are with developer servicing.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Paypal

Paypal has a marvelous history and is a battle tested pioneer in the fintech space. I see them repeating their previous successes by acquiring Honey. I work with Honey in the fintech space and now I'm understanding that Paypal has an auto coupon scraper on my Amazon purchases while my Visa ones don't. This is the forward thinking I love from Paypal despite not being as flashy as Square.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Disney

Disney is quintessential american entertainment. I believe their deep roots in American culture and the entertainment industry will provide a solid bedrock for them for the generations to come.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Waste Management

Sanitation and environmental, like internet connection technology, are about the same when it comes to market penetration. It is a scarcity. Sanitation is a critical part of any society's development and wellbeing. I think WM will be there to benefit from increased urbanization and industriousness from technology and wealth growth.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Kansas City Southern

I'm Mexican and my family are avocado farmers. I believe in the future prospects of Mexico and its relationship with its neighbors. Mexico is a bustling nation and many youth are international students that carry degrees. This is a far cry from having military policing streets in rural neighborhoods decades ago. Kansas city southern is part of the supply chain that connects Mexico to main industrious Mexican states like Monterrey, Jalisco, and Michaocan. I like rail in this regard because it's a lot of weight in one operation of heavy materials. So Canadians that use Mexican mining will also benefit from this railroad.

\- Nintendo

I believe in the future of gaming as a market and if I were to take a shot at who would be the most stable, I would vote for Nintendo. Like Facebook, they approach the family unit and grow generationally. I love their curveball approach to gaming and I think that creativity, along with it's customers trust, will be something I can hold onto for a long time versus companies that have a history of developing games like Call of Duty or World of Warcraft. Nintendo can take different forms: in the living room, at sweaty tournaments, online, mobile, on your phone, on a TV, in the movies, etc.

If their pork products are great then I am ALL in because Chicken products are by far the easiest thing to replicate. I'm extremely excited about this product.

\- Visa

They make a ton of money on transactions. I saw them hiring for blockchain development so it leads me to believe that they're adapting.

\- Square

I work in the fintech space and I like their modest approach to financial services. Their acquiring of a bank charter is actually incredibly important due to all the procurement and legal processes that go behind being a fintech company (abiding by federal security laws, etc). The one reason I like Chase banking is because I enjoy their app. I see Square as a competitor to Chase, surprisingly.

\- Apple

Apple designs its products with customer service in mind. I think the future of education technology will likely go to Apple because of this. Their screens and cameras are wonderful and I can see them pioneering computer vision products because of this. They are THE American Tech company.

\- TMobile

Aggressive as hell and grew to be a large player through savvy moves across time. Their customer service is a highlight for me.

\- JPM

Customer service for banking is unmatched IMO. If any legacy banker will make it across changes, I believe Chase is doing what it takes to adapt and think forward.

\- Planet Fitness

$10 gyms, clean, and casual enough for the general population. You can't beat $10 gym membership when you're broke as fuck. I've been a heavy lifter before and still used Planet fitness in my transitions across states and whatnot. I need to look at their numbers more closely.

\- Volkwagen

I trust Europe and Japan to take EVs more seriously. I don't know who will seriously come close to competing with Tesla in the long run but they'll have to.

\- Panasonic

Panasonic, much like AMD, did not immediately reflect the value of what they have produced. AMD did not explode inline with bitcoin or cheaper GPU consumption, in the same way Panasonic did not reflect a massive spike in price after speculation in Tesla grew. They're an important arm to the EV market that spreads across many players ranging from Tesla to Toyota to big tech.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Lyft

I think Lyft's focus on customer service and regional clientele will pay off against Uber, who is growing too quickly and spreading thin. Lyft will benefit from the development of computer vision and Big tech's interest in automanufacturing.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Crypto (Bitcoin or XRP)

I like crypto as a technology as a software engineer. I see the value in a faster process for procuring and exchanging legal tender that does not have to go through the bottleneck of the ACH process or through legal issues like the PATRIOT ACT or the Bank Secrecy Act. It still fundamentally respects those laws without the frustrations of banking service bottlenecks.  I think the halvening protocol has an interesting affect on Bitcoin and supply and the market that it's trying to generate.

stocks,Is QE (Quantitative Easing) still possible? The end of an economic era?,"Quantitative easing or QE, is the new tool for central banks since 2008 crisis to regulate the market.

[For those who needs a heads up on QE: it is the principal mechanism of creating currency to keep the boat afloat. The fed, (or the domestic central bank) will buy assets on the market with fresh created money to investments funds to relieve them from it. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing .]

   Intro part :
QE is the way things worked for the past decade. It helped banks keeping healthy assets after subprime crisis, it drove the stock market up for 12 years. At the cost of a slight and good inflation. It has been used massively lately to prevent occidental economic collapse (up to $6,13 trillion created by the fed for the USA). I know that a lot of you talked about « the coronavirus Dip » and did not understand why the stock market did not dive, this is why.

    Question part :
Now let us imagine that the current coronavirus situation will create an inflation. Central banks will not be allowed to use QE if the inflation is too high. IMO above 4% (annual month to month growth rate) is smelling bad.
The minute the fed, or EU CBE, will announce they cannot use QE because of inflation, this is where panic will strike.
In an attempt to anticipate, could we discuss the possibility of this and the sustainability of the QE  mechanism paradigm?

personalfinance,Refinance main residence at 15 or 30 with future rental option,"My wife and I are trying to figure out if it makes sense for us to refinance the house to a 15 year mortgage, or keep current mortgage, or go with a new 30 year mortgage.

We purchased a home 2.5 years ago in an upcoming area (Raleigh, NC) with an interest rate of 3.8% over 30 years, we’ve seen some good appreciation already with the area being redeveloped and continuing to (House value is at $520k). All in, our monthly payment is $2420. We’ve been shopping rates locally and have found rates as low as 2.8 with closing costs of approximately $3k or less. We have good job security at the moment, especially with my wife taking on a new job that has a 2 year guarantee that exceeds 300k/year for the next 2 year.

The house was purchased as an investment partially where our goal is to hold and rent. Refinancing to 15 years will make it difficult to rent this house out in, let’s say in 5 years, if we decide to buy another house because it will more than likely be at above market for rental. The current rental rates are closer to $2-2.2k/month for a house like ours….if we refi, we will be looking at closer to $3k a month in mortgage...this could change but that's my biggest hesitation at the moment.

In case anyone needs more detail, we do max our 401k’s, have 1 year of emergency savings, as well as mutual funds. No other debt outside of our main residence.

Alternatively, we could refinance at the 30 year with a rate that’s probably closer to 3.3%, 3k in closing costs, and a new mortgage that is closer to $2,100 a month, effectively lowering our mortgage payment making it an easier rental, as well as reducing our overall interest paid over the long run.

personalfinance,Starting with $10K toward 10-year savings/investment plan to buy DC-area home,"In short, this is another ""what to do with $10K?"" post. 

I got a minor promotion and raise recently then made a long term plan to purchase a home in the DC suburbs (Northern Virginia--Fairfax/Arlington).  I'm basically starting from scratch toward that goal.  I'm a married parent, in my late-30's, and the salaried breadwinner of the family.   Some stats:

Salary: ~$80K (~$90K overseas)
Student loan debt: $11K (&gt;half which could be paid by SLRP next year)
Credit card debt: $0 (&gt;$50K combined limits, FWIW)
Rent/mortgage: $0
Retirement: $120K (TSP contribution rate at 10% for the last several years, going to increase very soon to get close to max)
Monthly expenses: ~$1200
Savings/Emergency Fund: $8K 

My job in the current environment is stable.  I work for the Federal government, and most of my work is overseas.  I just paid off my car that I'll use for the rest of my time at my current overseas post and I'll sell it for maybe $8K.  We did a fair amount of travel, hosting guests, and dining out/entertainment, so before about a month ago my emergency fund was basically $0.  My stimulus check and entire last paycheck went to savings/emergency.

With everything locked down, I can save a lot more.  Even as things open up later, it shouldn't be hard to save half of my take home with the plan in place.  

At some point in the third quarter, I'm looking at opening a low-cost online brokerage account (like Vanguard) and investing in, say, and S&amp;P 500 tracker index fund.  I did some quick numbers, and if I start with $10K and add $1000/mo for ten years with 6% expected annual growth, it gets me into decent down payment territory in my target HCOL area.  Naturally, probably several years before that, I'll take the money out of stocks and maybe put it in fixed income.  

I just wanted to get a sense of whether this makes sense and if others have input.  I'm jittery about when to jump into the S&amp;P 500 buy and hold set up, but nobody can really predict the true bottom.  

Additional info, I don't have family ties to NoVa/DC area, but I will need to do some headquarters work there.  I can potentially stay overseas for ten years then come back and buy.  Also, my salary will go up every year, and if I do a high hardship/danger post (Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq), I'll be able to save at a significantly higher rate.",finance

personalfinance,Federal Perkins loan - Perplexing situation,"Good morning Reddit,

There is a problem that has recently come to my attention and I'd like some advice or just to hear if someone has been in a similar situation before:

I've been out of school for 10 years now.  (Since 2010) I had originally defaulted on my federal student loans a few years after that.  I ignored my debt up until about 4 years ago and I called to get everything consolidated and on an income driven repayment plan through fedloan.  After getting everything out of default, my credit started to improve.  My score after 4 years is now in the 800s.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to my problem; I've recently been contacted by a debt collection agency named ""Williams and Fudge"" based out of South Carolina.  The representative I spoke to informed me that I owe $3000 on a $1500 federal perkins loan that had, ""fell through the cracks"" and that they were managing it for my university.  I checked my account on the fsa website ([studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.gov)) and that perkins loan is now there. (It hasn't been on my account until this month)  It says this loan has been in default since 2011...this is where questions start to arise:

Why have I never been contacted about this debt since 2011? My information on record has been up to date for years.

How has this defaulted debt never shown on any credit report since 2011? I thought federal student loans aren't subject to the SoL and never fall off even after 7 years?

If this debt truly ""fell through the cracks"" after all these years, why am I responsible for paying double the original amount in additional interest and service fees that have been tacked on from Williams and Fudge?

&amp;#x200B;

\*Edit:

Going back through on my student loan history and talking to my parents, I had a total of 4 loans. (3 stafford loans and 1 perkins) My parents had taken care of the perkins loan with a lump sum payment to the university in 2011.  When I consolidated 4 years ago, fedloan consolidated my remaining stafford loans, said that was all I had and that I should be in good standing as long as I continue to make on time payments.

I think the university has an error on their end and is now trying to collect on a debt that has already been paid.  Maybe that's why they thought it ""fell through the cracks"".   I don't know what to do if this is the case.  How would I prove that now?  Like i stated, I've been out of school for 10 years.  I've taken care of all my past debt. (or so I was told until now)  I doubt my parents still have paperwork on a debt that was taken care of 9 years ago...I've worked too hard fixing my credit just to have something like this screw it up again...",finance

The checks came to her name and home address.

I mentioned this to my accountant, and he said it sounded like someone may be using her SSN to file taxes. He told us to go to the IRS site and pull tax transcripts for last 2 years. 

When we tried that, first you have to create an account. It asked us a few basic questions to verify identity. The first was how much her mortgage payment with xxxx bank was, we picked ""none of the above"" since she had no mortgage. The next two questions we could answer correctly, one was around her federal student loan for college. It let us proceed. It then asked us a few basic questions like name and DOB and SSN, but also asks for last year filed taxes (which she never did, of course, having no official income). The site then says unable to match/verify information.

I tried to call the IRS, but they had a recording that said go screw, we're swamped. So we went online to the identity theft IRS site and filled out a form to submit the info, providing name and email. But I am not confident that will even be seen or addressed.

Not sure what else to do. She initially deposited the $99 check after I said she could (since I know if that is recalled I can easily repay it). I thought it perhaps had to do with her student loans or something, but I doubt that is the case.",finance

I'm starting medical school this fall. My cost-of-attendance is going to be $44,626. I can take $40,500 on an unsubsidized loan and up to $20,958 on a Federal Direct loan. My school's financial aid office projects that those interest rates will be around 3.5% and 4.5% respectively due to the economic contractions. My savings are around $8,000 and I have no debt. 

My question is, what should I do with my little pile of cash savings? 

My instinct is to hold onto it because it's actual cash, not debt. However, would it be financially wiser to use some (or even all) of the cash to lower my loans (esp. the higher interest Federal Direct) and then 'pay myself back' at the end of the school year with loan money? I'd essentially skip out on 9 months of interest that way, but then I'd no longer have any amount of money that wasn't just debt.

I know it's in part to a shift in the distribution of industrial sectors being represented in the major indices. There's been a large shift toward tech and tele com, with a reduction in typical high yield sectors. However, that doesn't explain how we remain at near record levels even as these large cap companies have reported terrible Q1 earnings, and are most likely going to report their worst earnings in history for Q2, yet major indices are only down ~10% YTD.",finance

personalfinance,*Long Post* New to investing. Am I on the right track?,"* Long post but I’ve been having a hard time finding guidance for someone in my position. Just for some background I am 25 years old and since February 2020 I've been trying to learn about investing so I can be financially secure in the future. I have no family/friends with any experience so all of my knowledge so far has been through personal research. I've read The Intelligent Investor and dozens of online resources (Bogleheads guide, Investopedia, etc.). 

* I served 5 years in the military and was medically discharged in 2019. I have been unemployed since then. I currently receive $2,951.30 in disability pay from the VA but I am unable to work due to my disabilities. Our monthly expenses are approximately $1,000. I have $23k between checking/savings and I am considering moving $10k to an online savings account with Marcus by Goldman Sachs (1.55% APY seems like a good way for my money to just sit) which would still leave me with more than 6 months of living expenses. 3 CD's with $33k, and an M1 Finance taxable investment account with $1,600.

* I'm married (she's 23) but luckily we share the same mentality when it comes to finances. Without going into specifics she cannot work currently but possibly in another 2-3 years she can begin doing free lance cosmetology and make a little extra hear and there. My wife and I both have free healthcare for life, my dental is free and hers is very cheap. We currently live with family in a paid off house and because it has proven to be very mutually beneficial we will be staying indefinitely. We'll be receiving the house upon death and property tax will be 0% due to my States disabled veteran benefits. I should be receiving $3,227.92 from the VA but 10% is automatically deducted until 2033 to repay disability severance pay. I have permanent disability status and the pay increases about 1% every year. I don't care to beat the market. My goal is to generate enough wealth so that if I die at 60 or older my wife can withdraw on average $10k annually (more or less depending on the market). Again, without getting into the particulars, if I live for 9 more years my wife will be receiving around $1,000 a month, so an average of $10k seems adequate.

* We've begun investing $500 bi-weekly since March 1st. My portfolio is 80% VTI, 20% VXUS and I will possibly add a bond fund in 20-25 years. I plan on reinvesting all dividends and dollar cost averaging through all ups and downs of the market for the next 30 years, if not longer. My reasoning is that because I have disability pay for life and it's more than enough to cover my cost of living expenses, I'm okay with the fluctuations I'll inevitably see. As long as I see my money grow and it can be utilized if need be in 30 years.

* I also have a traditional Thrift Savings Plan with $5,700 but am unable to contribute because I don't have earned income and I'm no longer a federal employee. My plan is to avoid early withdrawal fees and roll it over to a Roth IRA with M1 Finance. I'm choosing M1 because they charge no commission fees, offer fractional shares, easy to navigate app, and it allows me to easily view both my investment portfolios. The plan for my Roth IRA is 60% VTI, 20% VXUS, 10% VTV, 10% VIG. This is where I'm a little more unsure what to do but my thought process is that because I want safe growth VTI and VXUS provide that. But since Roth IRAs don't tax dividends it would be a good idea to incorporate additional funds with higher div yields and possibly bonds in the future as I've heard they generate higher dividends but I need to do more research.

* I'm still on the fence about opening a Roth IRA since having future earned income can't be guaranteed. And because of this I've considered a second taxable investment account but I'm unsure if that could offer any significant benefit. Anyway, I'd like to know if there's anything I might be unaware of and any possibly advice would be appreciated.

tl;dr I'm 25. New investor with unusual lifestyle. Please give advice/tips",finance

With all of the memes and jokes about ""money printing"" going around, and the news about the federal reserve possibly buying corporate bonds, I think it's very easy to develop a distorted view of what's going on at the federal reserve. Just from social media, you may be inclined to believe the federal reserve is ramping up it's rate of ""Money creation""- I've seen that sentiment reflected heavily on this subreddit. But that sentiment conflicts with the stats.

At the start of the pandemic panic in the states, The federal reserve was Buying $75 Billion in treasuries per day.

As you can see from the link above, this has been significantly wound down throughout April. By mid April they were down to $30 Billion per day, and now, they're only planning to buy $8 Billion in treasuries per day.",finance
personalfinance,Paying for portion of grad school out of pocket - my cash is stashed in several accounts. In what order/priority would you draw down these sources of savings?,"As title says, through a fortunate hodgepodge combination of scholarships, savings, and my ability to live with my parents during my grad school program starting this fall, I will cover the entire cost of the degree without taking out a student loan, which has been my goal for the last few years. However, my personal capital  is kind of all over the place, aka stashed in several types of accounts, and I wanted to make sure I have my head on straight about how I should prioritize drawing down these sources so I don't accidentally kick myself in the arse later on interest rates, market yields, taxes, and other considerations down the road. For reference I am 28, starting this fall and will graduate in May 2022 at age 30. 

Here's what I am thinking (in order of how I would draw):

1. Scholarship - covers tuition and school fees (insurance, etc) and so I expect will be disbursed timely as needed and won't really need to/be able to control or manage this particular aspect
2. Spend the money saved (bulk of my savings) in a high interest online savings account - I will plan to use this cash to cover all of my living, travel, etc expenses for two years, and if it does run out or there is some emergency expense, it will likely at least last until end of 2021 or early 2022. Opportunity cost: dwindling interest collections (currently \~1.5%) as I draw down the money
3. Liquidate taxable brokerage account, currently 100% invested in an equity broad market ETF. Opportunity cost: market returns now are obviously a bit sh\*t but potential upside in the future makes me want to clamp down on these holdings for as long as possible

I also plan to just sit on the funds I have contributed over the years to my employer 401k and HSA accounts, but would welcome any advice on if I should convert/transfer these to other accounts or leave as-is. 

Am I missing anything or is this a sound plan? Thank you in advance, r/personalfinance gurus!",finance

personalfinance,Taking on new debt at a lower APR than existing debt,"I think I know the answer to my own question here, but would love a second opinion on my scenario so TYIA to anyone who replies!

I am purchasing a vehicle and expect to be getting a 2.99% APR. I have a sizable portion of the vehicle cost in available cash for a downpayment. My wife and I also carry student loan debt varying from 3.4-6.3%. My credit union does not have a minimum down payment for used vehicle loans, i.e. I can finance the entire amount. The only (temporary) wrench in the calculation is that the student loans are currently at 0% interest rate due to COVID-19.

My question is: does it make more sense mathematically to finance the entire vehicle amount and use the down payment cash to pay down/off the higher interest debt? Like a pseudo-refinance? In either situation, the monthly payments are reasonable for us. My only concern is possibly being ""underwater"" on the vehicle in case of an accident, but we do have an emergency savings that could cover that gap should it occur.",finance

personalfinance,Home mortgage refinance question,"Hi all. So I’m trying to refinance my house right now, and I’m not sure which is the best option. 

My home appraised for $35,000 more than I purchased it for (yay!). So I have the option between a cash-out refinance, and a rate and term refinance.

Here are the estimated terms provided to me by my lender:

1. Cash Out: 3.75% APR, $21,275 cash back to me after closing costs, $3165 monthly payment, 80% LTV
2. Rate and Term: 4.25% APR, $5,000 cash back to me after closing costs, $3196 monthly payment, 76% LTV

In the cash out refinance, my loan amount is also $32,000 higher.

Which of these is right for me? Am I essentially sacrificing $32,000 of homeowner’s equity later for $16,000 in additional cash back now? Does the .5% lower interest rate factor in some way, and does it depend on when I plan to move/sell the house?

personalfinance,Should I be paying off last year's student loan or should I be saving for next year's tuition?,"I would first like to apologize if the answer to my question should be obvious, no one in my family is very financially knowledgable so I've been trying to learn more. I also want to clarify that I already have an emergency savings fund.

Last year, I took out a $20k student loan at a very high (fixed) interest rate. This was a big mistake, and I am planning on transferring universities so that I can take out a smaller loan next year. However I was recently given a $1k check and I am also searching for a full time job for the summer. I was wondering if I should be allocating this money towards paying off my loan, or if I should be saving this money to pay for my tuition for next year so that I can be taking out a smaller loan. For example lets say I make $4k over the next two months. Next year I would only have to take out a $10k loan instead of a $14k loan if I used this money to pay for tuition. Alternatively, I could make a $4k payment on the loan I already have. Or maybe I could put 2k towards tuition and 2k towards the loan? I'm really lost at what to do here even though I feel like the answer should be simple. Again, sorry if this is a dumb question!",finance

Every 1% till 11% gets an additional .2% till it’s at 11% matched with 4%. Also if I do max this out then should I put savings to Roth IRA and max it all out at once or should I make a half payment now and then a Roth payment with every paycheck for the rest of the year. Finally for investing is there single stocks I should invest in or just pick an index fund and let it ride.

-third option is putting most of my savings into my student loan as it is a guaranteed 6% and there might be further recession this year. I would not want to make this decision till September as my loans are not accruing interest till then.

personalfinance,Looking for advice on personal finance and whether to pay off student loans or wait for forgiveness.,"I will try to include everything relevant, but I'm sure I'll miss a few things as I feel my situation is a little complex and not common.

I am married. I'm 33 and my wife is 32. We own our own business (it's a small office) as Chiropractors. We don't have any employees and work with a very small overhead compared to most in order to save as much as possible. We are both about 4-5 years out of school and paid off my debt entirely last year. It's important to note that I had a moderate savings before entering school and made the poor choice not to use any of it for school. I took out loans for everything. The school made it very easy to take out loans and I didn't know what the future would hold. I couldn't bear to deplete the savings I'd accumulated for 15 years for half of the total tuition. In the end, I am the only one at fault and it was my decision. However, last year we decided to take all of my savings and some business revenue and pay my entire loan off. 

We currently have 275k in student loan debt on my wife's side. She carried loans from undergraduate school as well. Her interest rate is paused right now due to the Pandemic, but it's at an average of 6.2% and compounds daily when active. This is absurd to me (almost $[50](https://50.day)/day in interest). She is currently on the PAYE program, but we shift almost all the income to me now because I am no longer on the hook for any student loan payment and repayment isn't based on income. We also file married, but separately, which allows her to claim only her income and have her repayment be hardly anything, if not $0.

We have wanted to pay into her loan and knock it out, but with 15-16 years left until loan forgiveness under the IDR program PAYE, even at a 50% tax bracket, if the loan is forgiven and considered taxable income, our tax bomb would still be less that what is currently owed, let alone what would be payed off if we kept trying to knock it out over time. If we paid nothing into the loan for the next 15 years, the total would be around 540k. Even if we paid 50% of that in taxes, it would still be less than the total of 275k right now. Tax brackets could also be lower than 50%.

I have entertained multiple scenarios and would love to hear if anyone has had similar experiences or have  suggestions on the best course of action for our situation.

&amp;#x200B;

1. We continue to file taxes married, but separately, for the remaining 15 years on PAYE and save up to pay for a potential tax bomb. It's also possible we may not be taxed on the forgiven amount. That's 15 years of ""wait and see,"" which I hate.
2. Take out a second mortgage on our grandparents house (their house is worth at least 3 x the amount remaining on our loan and is paid off). This would give us a lower interest rate,  allowing us to pay off the government student loan. Although, we're still paying on this amount with no forgiveness, and with interest. Subsequently, we could file married and take advantage of those standard deductions we don't get filing married, but separately.
3. Ask to borrow money from family and pay them back with no interest. We don't even know if this is a possibility and if anyone has this much money to loan us. But, this would allow us to start filing taxes as married, rid us of interest, and claim all standard deductions saving us some money in the long term. However, $275k is likely still more than what a tax bomb would be on this loan at the end of this forgiveness.

We currently have 50k in emergency savings and last year made about 150k combined. We have no kids and live well below our means. This would likely be a different story, but since the Corona Virus hit, we have seen a 50-60% decline in our business making the future uncertain. Especially without a specific time frame to work with and if/when things will go back to normal.

Given the above information, what do you think would be the best way to go about our student loan debt? I just really hate having this loan hanging over our heads and dealing with the stress and hassle of dancing around taxes, and having to re-certify my wife's student loan repayment status every year.

personalfinance,Should I pay off my CC debt with the extra UI payments I'm receiving?,"I have $1,500 CC debt with Capital One. The interest rate is 27%. I've been making the minimum payments on it for months, but my credit score is still pretty low because of past collections I'm paying right now. (a $600 CC debt and a $2,100 college tuition debt).

Before the whole pandemic, I was working two jobs and started using Dave Ramsey's snowball method. I'd paid off a medical debt, and was going to tackle the collections debt next before my CC. But because of the pandemic, my collections has halted payments (I was furloughed from both jobs) until further notice. My CC has not, and even if they did it would still be accruing interest.

I've been getting UI since the end of March and, with the CARES Act in place, I'm able to put $1,500 into my savings every time they pay me. I know this will run out and won't last forever, and I'm afraid for my job security, so I've been saving as much of it as I can.

I have an emergency savings of $9,500. $4,500 of that is a student loan (still in college), but the rest is from me. I'm EXTREMELY tempted to pay off my $1,500 CC debt and be done with that monthly payment, but I'm also pretty nervous to let go of any of that money.

personalfinance,Credit Score hit by Chrysler Capital and they refuse to fix mistake.,"I wanted to take advantage of lower interest rates and refinance my mortgage and was surprised to see my credit score knocked me out of the range of eligibility. This was strange to me bc I have not missed any payments for my loans in several years. 

I noticed the one hit was from Chrysler Capital. I went to check my account and see that when I co-signed my wife’s lease, the very first payment was considered late. I actually made the payment on time- and for whatever reason...they sent the funds back to my bank without informing me. I remember an agent calling me and letting me know that the payment had never gone through, so I went back in and made it again. Their website even shows the dates of my original payment, their returned payment, and my second attempt. 

Anyway- I disputed this with credit bureaus and they said I’d have to dispute it with Chrysler Capital. I called Chrysler Capital and they said I’d have to submit a dispute with any additional supporting documents to their Credit Department PO Box. 

I sent a letter explaining the situation, screenshots of my account transaction history from their website, a copy of my credit score prior to this incident, payment history, etc. 

Today I received a letter from Chrysler saying they received my correspondence and that they are unable to process my dispute to remove negative information as an act of “Goodwill.”

They then say in the letter “if you want to submit a dispute with additional information- send us a letter” with all the information I had originally sent. 

What are my options here? This hit on my credit score has prevented me from taking other steps in my life.",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage Refinance - Is this a good offer?,"Good evening PF!

I am 11 years into a 30-year mortgage at 4.875%.  I have around $187000 remaining.

After inspecting a number of posts here, I decided to research refinance options this past weekend.  I managed to find an offer of 2.625% on my remaining balance for a 15-year term.

Closing costs including discount points total around $6500 which I plan to pay out of pocket.  After a number of upgrades, we do not anticipate ever leaving this house barring any unforeseen life events.

At an initial glance, this appears to make financial sense to me.  My payment would drop roughly $50/month while removing 4 years of payments.  Part of me is curious whether I should roll the closing costs into the balance since the interest rate is so low.  Perhaps get a larger return on the money or just keep it for emergency.

Thoughts?  What am I missing? 

Many thanks!!",finance

personalfinance,First time homebuyer purchasing a house for parents,"I have found myself in a position where I will need to be paying some of my parents rent moving forward. I am thinking that it is a smart idea to purchase them a house rather than continuing to pay a portion of their rent. They will realistically live there for 10 more years. It is a place I could consider living in the future as well. The area is decently rentable too so I could rent it out after they have passed. I live about 3 hours away and in a different state. 

My concern is that I will get a high interest rate as a first time home buyer that is purchasing a house and not living in it. All other aspect of getting the mortgage would be good. \~175k income, &gt;750 credit score, assumed purchase price \~275k. Any advice on how to handle the home with taxes?

personalfinance,15 vs 30 year mortgage. Why would I do a 15 year?,"I've just turned 30 and my fiancé and I have decided to buy a house. We're very lucky to have great jobs that pay well (combined pretax income of 160,000) and we have a 50% down payment on a 440,000 house. Everyone we talk to keeps telling us to get a 15 year loan because ""it's the smart thing to do"" 

However, with the rates as low as they are I can't figure out why we (or anyone) wouldn't just go with a 30 year loan for 2 reasons. 

1. we pay down the principle of the 30 year loan at the 15 year rate. The total cost would not be that much different than the 15 year loan and we would have a safety net if we lost our jobs for any reason (or wanted to rent out the home) it would be easier to cover the mortgage cost without refinancing. 

or 

2. with a 3.2 interest rate part of me doesn't understand why I wouldn't just invest the cash I would have put into the house into other investment opportunities. I'm still pretty young and my investments over the last 8 years have given me a much better rate of return than 3.2

Bitcoin,Bitfinex asks the courts to facilitate the return of $800 million frozen in Crypto Capital accounts.,"The Bitfinex cryptographic exchange has approached federal courts in Colorado, Arizona and Georgia to help it obtain information from banks regarding Crypto Capital's processing service.  The service accounts in the four countries were frozen along with $800 million in Bitfinex client assets, CoinDesk reports.

In 2019, the exchange asked the court to question the former head of TCA Bancorp, who was supposed to have information about the transactions of Crypto Capital.  Then her request was granted.  Now the exchange wants to get information from the banks in order to untangle the scheme of moving assets and then use this data to recover them.  Usually banks don't disclose that information without a court order.

According to Bitfinex, Crypto Capital has allocated its assets to multiple accounts in various jurisdictions, including Europe and the United States.  Only in the US, she says, did Crypto Capital have accounts with SunTrust, Bank of America, Bank of Colorado, Citibank, Enterprise Bank &amp; Trust, HSBC, Stearns Bank, Wells Fargo, TD Bank and US Bank.

""As we have stated before, Bitfinex is a victim of fraud and claims rights to funds taken from Crypto Capital through legal mechanisms in various countries,"" said Bitfinex's General Counsel Stuart Hegner.

Bitfinex began using the services of Crypto Capital because the banks began to refuse to work with cryptographic companies, she writes in court.  Crypto Capital president Ivan Manuel Molina Lee was arrested in Poland in October 2019 on charges of involvement in an international criminal group engaged in money laundering ""from illegal sources"", including ""money of the Colombian drug cartel through the exchange of cryptovalut.  In the accounts in Polish banks were frozen $335 million of Bitfinex fiat reserves, and in Portugal - another $218 million, the company said.

Bitfinex and its sister company Tether became defendants in a New York City prosecutor's office hearing because of the measures they took to recover the loss.  For this purpose, Tether extended a loan to Bitfinex from its own reserves, which were used to secure the USDT stelecoin.  Tether denies the violation and continues to issue USDT.  In the last 40 days alone, the capitalization of the stablecoin has increased by $2 bln and has already approached $8 bln.",cryptocurrency

economy,Warren Buffett and the Stock Market Crash,"Warren Buffett made headlines recently after his recent [virtual Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69rm13iUUgE).

Buffett sold of all his shares in the major US airlines, and Berkshire announced a record quarterly net loss of nearly $50BN. Berkshire *had* held sizeable positions (around 10%) in the major US airlines.

As well as this, Buffett also allowed Berkshire's cash stake to rise to a record $137.3BN from $128BN at the end of 2019.

Clearly, as he is selling at a significant loss, Buffett believes that there is further pain ahead for the airlines. 

The GOAT is not one to fall for the sunk cost fallacy...

Moreover, his cash position indicates that he doesn't believe that we have reached the stock market bottom yet, although he wouldn't give specifics.

Others however are more explicitly bearish.

The numbers are certainly [not looking good](https://fortune.com/2020/03/20/recession-us-gdp-negative-growth-q2-predictions/)...

&amp;#x200B;

**TRUTH 1/2:**

[1640 CEOs left their posts in 2019](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/2019-had-the-most-ceo-departures-on-record-with-more-than-1600.html), the highest year on record since tracking began in 2002.

For context, there were 1484 exits in *2008* when the country was embroiled in the financial crisis.

This trend has continued in 2020, [in January a record 219 CEOs left their posts](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/12/rapid-ceo-turnover-continues-with-a-record-number-of-top-executives-departing-in-january.html), the highest month on record.

The economy was going to crash anyway. It was inevitable.

However, they were afraid of massive protests against corporate greed, massive social unrest, etc so they needed a diversion that would provide an excuse.

People will think the crash was solely due to the virus and not the numerous fundamental economic and structural issues at play.

To highlight just a few: we've had the [yield curve inversion](https://www.businessinsider.de/international/yield-curve-inversion-explained-what-it-is-what-it-means-2019-8/?r=US&amp;IR=T), the [repo madness](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-08/repo-blowup-was-fueled-by-big-banks-and-hedge-funds-bis-says), the [record corporate debt](https://www.businessinsider.de/international/us-corporate-debt-10-trillion-record-percentage-economy-expert-warnings-2019-12/?r=US&amp;IR=T), and [corporations being the main source of demand for equities via stock buybacks](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/business/stock-market-buybacks.html) which enrich executives that hit certain earnings per share targets.

Last year billionaire Peter Thiel, who was part of the notorious Paypal Mafia, [spoke on the dangers of American Exceptionalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JRyy2MM-rI). He argues that this has made America ""exceptionally un-self-critical""

Warren Buffett concluded in his virtual meeting: ""Never bet against America""

In other words, never bet against the military industrial complex to enforce American superiority and the power of the dollar as the de facto unit of exchange globally.

&amp;#x200B;

**TRUTH 2/2:**

As smart contracts pioneer Nick Szabo has stated:

""Buffett's wealth can be measured less in present cash than in the future cash from the Fed he is right up there at the front of the Cantillon line to get.""

[The Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs) essentially refers to the fact that fiat printing itself increases inequality. 

On a more general note, it is important to remember that, despite his gentle image, Buffett is ruthless in his craft. 

A [New York magazine profile from 1991](https://books.google.de/books?id=veTPZA9TWxsC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=1991+new+york+magazine+warren+buffett+Warren+looks+like+a+teddy+bear,+but+mentally+is+he+ever+tough&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OT8xAOp_-y&amp;sig=ACfU3U2s1_9PvAvkaw4w5BSh0l1KgG1yhA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjtvP2__ZzpAhUG3aQKHfcYA1kQ6AEwFXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=1991%20new%20york%20magazine%20warren%20buffett%20Warren%20looks%20like%20a%20teddy%20bear%2C%20but%20mentally%20is%20he%20ever%20tough&amp;f=false) stated: 

""Though he appears homey and guileless and cultivates a hayseed image, Buffett can be iron-fisted.""

According to a senior Salomon trader: ""Warren looks like a teddy bear, but mentally is he ever tough.""

Yes, Buffett has dropped numerous gems throughout the years, but ultimately his responsibility is to Berkshire Hathaway and his own, sizeable, bags.

Overall, it would be foolish to overlook Buffett's current cash position.

When everything is dirt cheap and we do eventually hit the bottom, he will be flush with cash and ready to aggressively sweep up bargains. 

At the moment, it is clear that he believes these bargains are not present, and therefore it would be wise to consider the fact that we may have further downside in store...

Even if state gov'ts are well capitalized, some are issued by counties and backed by property taxes.  Using CMF as an example ""State Tax-Backed"" bonds form only ~30% of the portfolio.

Pair that with gov't likely issuing newer bonds to fund increased expenses brought on by Covid*, I don't see a case to hold muni bonds for the time being.  They've recovered a lot since the Fed provided the backstop.

Then this Roth 401k will be worth $4.05m  after 40 years of saving, I’ll have contributed $760,000 and paid $243,200 in taxes to max the account.

Suppose when I retire, my cost of living is lower and I only need $40k/year. With the Roth I can take that money tax free, but with the traditional I’d be in the 22% federal tax bracket, and would have to pay 22% of $4.05m = $891,000 if I were to eventually drain the account before I die. Even the 12% bracket would cost me $486,000, far more than my $243,000 paid in tax on initial contributions.

In short, it seems the benefit of compounding interest and then tax free withdrawals from the Roth far outweighs the traditional’s pretax. What am I missing, why would I ever want traditional?

EDIT: and there it is, thank you everyone. I forgot to account for the progressive tax brackets and the fact that I’d also be investing the extra money I saved in my paycheck by using pretax.",finance

personalfinance,Federal Loan Refinance,"Hey everyone.  I know people say to be wary of refinancing federal loans because you lose benefits if you do.

So I just finished my bachelors in nursing after getting my associates.  My school deferment ends next month.  I am refinancing a Discover loan which has a payoff balance of $6,896.03.  The interest is 11% which is insane but expected since it's a private loan.

I am approved on Laurel Road for 3.75%.  My question is should I refinance these federal loans along with it.  They are through UHEAA and due to the loan class they are not eligible for the no payment, no accrued interest until the end of September.  My payoff for these loans would be $22,919.44.  They have an average interest rate of 6.62 (one loan with 6% and three with 6.8%).

So my real question is should I refinance these with the private Discover loans?  They only benefits I can see being lost are certain discharges that I will not qualify for in seven years (length of Laurel Road loan).  I do realize there is a chance that after the nation gets back to normal some loan forgiveness from nurses may happen.",finance

investing,[AAL] American Airlines' risk of bankruptcy.,"So I bought a handful of AAL stocks in this recent low because it's pretty close to all time low. Also it's less than fifth of the price of all time high. All relevant news headlines are negative which I assume is making this stock tank even more making this a potentially really profitable investment in the long term when things ease down.

Obviously the risk is bankruptcy. Compared to Southwest or Delta their fundamentals are pretty shit. High debt burden, low profit margins. They're burning over 50 million in cash a day.

They got the biggest loan and a grant from the government in the recent aid. And they're the biggest airline with over 100k employees (also with America in their name lol) which makes me think the fed will help them if shits hits the fan and they become really close to bankruptcy. I know they declared bankruptcy before but I believe this time government intervention is more likely due to the damage being caused by the corona.

I've also been considering selling my current stakes in them and just buying Southwest or Delta which seem to have much better financials and fundamentals to survive this crisis, but potentially less % gains post recovery.

investing,"Aside from some speculation, I actually think the market is being fairly rational","There are a lot of people saying that the market should be going down right now. I used to be one of them, but I've backed out of that hypothesis. Now, I think the market is pretty well priced (aside from a few speculative cases). Here are my thoughts on that.

1. The companies with the biggest exposure to COVID-19 have already gone down in price. Airlines, cruise companies, hotels, casinos, oil etc. 
2. The companies that are going up in price mostly have good balance sheets or corporate debt options to cover 6+ months of operating expenses. Big oil companies are probably the best suited to weather this storm as they always carry a lot of cash to weather low oil price storms. 
3. Most companies without direct exposure to COVID-19 have a smaller market cap today than they did 3 months ago. Indicating an already expected lower cash flow for the foreseeable future due to recession. Q2-Q4 earnings will be trash, and that is mostly expected.
4. The affects of the virus and economic impact of a second wave has mostly been priced in to stock prices. Just because we get bad news about another wave or that we'll be in recession isn't going to affect stock prices much.
5. The initial affects and expected secondary effects of the recession have mostly been priced in. We all know there will be big layoffs in the coming months. 
6. Financial systems have been stabilized by the fed so the risk of financial institutions going belly up is pretty low. 

I know we hate to say it's all ""priced in"", but I can't find a good example a slow recovery isn't priced in. It seems like most stocks are expecting a slow 2020 with a pickup in 2021. That, to me, seems pretty reasonable. A early 2021 vaccine isn't guaranteed, but I don't think it's unreasonable to assume that we'll have news (either successful or indications that a vaccine is very close) for a vaccine late this year. Even if a vaccine hasn't been produced, we'll be looking at herd immunity in a few key areas. 

Some thing that may not be priced in right now, but are not guaranteed to happen (hence expecting them to happen is speculation).

1. An exceptionally long (2+ years) time before a vaccine is discovered. 
2. A very short immunity after being infected (only 1 year of immunity before getting reinfected). 
3. Second wave in China. 
4. A particularly brutal second wave in the USA.
5. Financial system collapse.
6. Particularly extensive depression heavily affecting large companies.
7. A swing left in politics hitting the cash value of big businesses. Biggest effect could be a halt in M&amp;A or serious anti-trust laws breaking up FAANG companies. 
8. Mid-Long term fossil fuel demand collapse.
9. Bankruptcies of publicly traded companies. I think this will cause the next bear market, but it's months away. There is still runway for companies with shitty balance sheets. And who's to say the fed won't step in to buy up shitty of shit junk bonds. 

In other words, most of the obvious stuff has been priced in.

With all that said, there is definitely quite a bit of speculation going on. Tesla and Amazon are the two biggest examples. Their stock price right now is expecting them to make 5-10x their current revenue. It's not inconceivable, but IMO it's very bullish on a 5 year timescale. Another example, USO seems to be bought up by retail investors pushing up oil prices speculating that oil demand will return this summer (and there won't be a second wave crashing prices again). If that's the case, we'll see the price of oil collapse again when the June contracts expire. 

So I don't expect a bull or bear market in the coming months. More of a sideways market.",finance

- I’m very fortunate to have certain job stability through December. In 2021, I could be unemployed in a fairly competitive field.
- My private loan balance is at $14k with a 9.795% interest rate that I won’t have to start paying on until August

Sorry if this is the wrong sub. I don't know where else to go. 

I last used my credit card on Sunday. When I went to make a purchase today, I realized my card was gone and I went to the app to lock it. I saw a pending charge for Walmart made yesterday. After I locked it, I got notifications that transactions for a gas station and McDonald's (both down the street) were declined. Someone clearly has my card and it's not just lost under the seat of my car or anything.

I called Capitol One earlier and the wait time was over one hour. My call got dropped and I decided to call back later. I've called 7 times in the past 30 minutes because my call keeps getting dropped a few minutes into my wait (which is 2+ hours now.)

I understand that the call center must be busy and minimally staffed due to COVID-19 and I'm willing to wait hours to speak to someone about getting a card replacement but it's seemingly impossible. The first time I called, I was given the option to have them call me back. When I selected it, the music was still playing like I was still on hold.

solar,Tesla solar/power wall questions,"Been looking at solar and leaning towards a local company but boy is Tesla cheap.

I don’t lose power much but like to have the backup and while
One power wall is enough the second one through Tesla only seems to add 4K and since MD has a 30 % battery storage credit on top
of Fed seems silly to remove the second one. 
At this point peak and non peak are not very different so arbitrage with the battery probably does not make sense. 
So here are my few questions.

2. I heard Tesla will use better panels if you ask. 
3. Do they use string inverters, should

personalfinance,"I am trying to be smart about buying a car, but I'm also VERY eager to do so.","Basically what the title says. I am trying to find the right time to buy a car and to determine what factors make a smart decision. I have been trying to be smart and savvy with finances and feel as though I've been doing well all things considered. On the other hand, I have been putting it off since 2017 and I am very eager to have some freedom. I also can't help but look at my spending on my commutes over the past three years and think about the dent I could have made in a car loan. Final note before I get into details, I am a first time poster and have been agonizing over how to format this to effectively communicate my current situation and my questions. Basically, I apologize if this isn't the appropriate format.

*A lot of these factors are drastically different in COVID vs. not COVID so I'm am going to do my best to delineate.* 

Reasons for wanting a car:
1. Pre-COVID, I spent an average of $20/day (excluding tips) to commute via Lyft to work. This totals to about $400/month just to get to work, not including weekend and evening plans although those are few and far between. 
2. I travel out of state to visit family twice a year. This totals between $250-$600 each trip. I am a teacher, so I have to fly during peak seasons. I would 110% make the drive if I could. 
3. I will have to travel for family health reasons this summer, likely in July, and I am hesitant to fly. Obviously, nobody knows what the world will look like in 2 months, but part of my situation nonetheless. 
4. I am a 25 year old woman who wants the freedom to go to the beach or the mountains every once in a while. This point is clearly not financial as the others, but certainly weighs heavily on ny decisions. As I said, I have been putting this off for 3 years at this point and it's definitely weighing on me. I am eager, but I don't want it to be my downfall into debt. 

Current accounts:
Checking (post rent)-- $1,121
Savings-- $9,825 (I paid a large sum off my student debts last year, so I am slowly regaining my savings)
Monthly income-- ~$3,400 (I am paid 11 months out of the year, so some of my savings goes toward the additional month)

Current Monthly Spending:
Student loans-- minimum $147, typically more (see later note)
Rent-- $2300 (typically my rent is $550, however my boyfriend is temporarily laid off due to COVID. He is guaranteed a job when the business can reopen. We also had roommates move out beginning of April, so we are still on the hunt for that, but again COVID).
Utilities-- ~$40
Commute-- $400
Groceries-- ~$200
Miscellaneous (eating out, school supplies, etc)-- $250

TOTAL remaining pre COVID: $1,813, of this I put $1000 into savings and put more toward student loans depending on how much is left. 

TOTAL remaining during COVID: $463-$713 depending on need for miscellaneous budget. Significantly less eating out, school supplies, and events have really altered my need to tap into my $250 set aside for this.

I am looking at used vehicles around $14,500. In my head it makes the most sense to put a hefty amount into the down payment, so I was looking at options if I paid $6,500 up front. I was recommended a website by 3 reliable friends on seperate occasions. The interest rate if I finance through them is 8% (due to my ""young"" but decent credit of 679). With that math and including taxes/fees, I would have monthly payments of $257 for 48 months. That seems doable to me. I am also aware that insurance, repairs, and gas is stacked onto that, so for 2 years, I may be paying slightly more than I am right now on travel, however after 2 years I will have a gently used car paid off. 


Basically my question is:

How dumb is it to purchase a car with my current situation? 
     1a. If you surprise me and answer ""you sound stable enough to take this step despite the current climate!"", is the price point I'm looking at good? What about the loan percentage, 8% seems decent based on my VERY minimal research from banks. Do you have other recommendations?
     1b. If you do not surprise me by answering ""dear god woman, please wait to do this"", what do I wait for? When is a good time to take this step? Less COVID? More savings? What is my ""magic number""?

I'm happy to provide more info where needed. I really appreciate any guidance on this, even if it's as simple as ""try this subreddit instead!"" I hope you're all staying healthy!",finance

personalfinance,How much extra should I pay towards my student loan when I need to move out soon?,"I graduated from college in May 2018.  My student loan total was $27,943.00 at graduation. I have since paid $3190.00 bringing the total to only $26,266.67 with a fixed interest rate of 4.375%.  It seems at this rate, it will literally take forever at a $175 minimum.  I have paid over the minimum when I had extra money each month. It is important to note this is my only debt. 

I just started a new job in February. Gross is 45k a year and am getting paid biweekly. The take home pay, after taxes, is approximately $1350. Net/year after taxes = $32.4k. Overtime has occurred on multiple occasions so far, but I would not call it frequent.  

&amp;#x200B;

**I have $13,600 in the bank divided up as follows:**

5000 in Emergency Fund (halted saving)

1500 for vacation in summer 2021 (halted saving)

4400 for a house down payment account (+$1150/month)

2700 in an engagement ring account (saving complete)

&amp;#x200B;

**Expenses**

I still live rent-free at my parent's house, but will be moving out sometime before next June. Since I am living rent-free and know I will need to move out next year, I started saving away a ""mortgage payment"" of $1150 per month a few months ago and have deposited extra funds when there are any available (tax refund, stimulus check, overtime). My parent is moving to a smaller home far away. I will be moving in with my girlfriend.

I have a 2007 SUV that I am responsible for maintenance and gas, as I am still on my parents insurance company which I use as my daily driver. 

My credit card bill is paid in full monthly, which covers all recurring payments/bills, including gas (\~$250-$325).

My dog's expenses come to \~$135/mo (insurance, food, grooming, treats).

Food expenses come to about $250.

**$2700 income - $1150 home savings - $325 credit card - $135 dog - $250 food = $440 left over each pay check ($880/month)**

&amp;#x200B;

My question is how aggressive should I pay back my student loans knowing I will need a down payment in \~12 months?  I'm not sure if it makes more sense to drag out the minimum right now and save more for a home.

Any help would be appreciated as I don't know exactly what is best for my situation.",finance
personalfinance,401K w/ Mostly High Expense Ratios,"Hi all, I've been doing a bunch of reading on here recently and I've been inspired to take my retirement savings more seriously (recently setup a proper e-fund and roth IRAs for my wife and myself).  

Initially I had 100% of my 401k allocations in the 2055 retirement fund (I'm late 20s) but after doing some reading and understanding the expense ratios, it seemed that going with 90% in the Fidelity 500 Index and 10% in the Loomis Bond (lowest expense ratio bond option) might be a better bet.  

Is it worth it to just eat the higher expense ratio of the retirement fund (0.72%) and go all in on that or does the two-fund portfolio I mentioned above make sense to stick with?  Below are my 401k offerings.

personalfinance,Is buying a house right now a good idea? (Massachusetts),"My wife and I started house hunting about a month ago. Here are some facts about our current situation.

* $61,000 in Savings
* Searching for a 250K - 290K House
* Central Mass
* Currently living with family, monthly expenses are extremely low.
* Salary 70K
* Work in Healthcare with an extremely stable job.

We started house hunting about a month ago, the Realtor we selected to work exclusively with for the next few months said that he saw the market going ""side ways"". Our price bracket usually has a contract/pending on the house within a week of posting if the house is any good.

We are nervous about continuing our search due to the possible tanking of the market as the year goes on.

The easy answer is wait, as we are not under pressure to leave our current situation, but then I am worried about the interest rates rising. I want to take advantage of the 3% - 3.5% rates and worry that if we sit on our hands we'll have a house for the same price as we would now in a year, but with a 5% interest rate.

Any advice appreciated, is buying a house wise right now?

personalfinance,Deciding how to move forward,"Trying to decide how I move forward financially. I have 3 debts beside my home loan. Those are a student loan with about $9800 left at 5.5% interest rate, one car loan with about $3k left at 1.9%, and another car loan with $9300 at 2%. The student loan was a 15 year loan that I have about 6 years left on. Until recently I never really had extra money to pay more than the minimum payment. For the last 6 or so months I've been putting in about $750 into my company sponsored 401k. I would need to put in about $200 to receive the company match. When I checked the 401k about a week or so ago I saw something about an \~5.98% annual rate of return and a 9.7% cumulative. I'd love to get some of these debts off of me as my family is getting ready to buy a new house. I would love to believe that I'll have enough equity in my current home to be able to at least get the small car loan paid off when we sell in the next few weeks. What I'm not sure of is if I should stop contributing as much to the 401k to knock out the student loan. Adding the $550 to the current $150 payment would have it paid off in about 15 months. That just seems like a long time to not be investing that money into my 401k, though. Especially if the 401k is actually making that rate or return.

personalfinance,How can I get my mom's mortgage off of a hard money loan and into a 30-year loan if she has terrible credit?,"My mom told me she needed to take a ""hard money"" loan (i.e. a balloon loan with 10-12% interest rates, with interest-only payments) for her house a few years ago, and that she couldn't get a traditional 30-year refinance because of her poor credit (low 500s).    Right now, she's struggling to meet the bill and the lender has already said they're not giving any extensions, etc. -- if she doesn't pay there's going to be a foreclosure notice within days.  Even worse, she's not eligible for any of the Covid-19 related mortgage relief stuff that has passed or likely any of the new stuff that will pass because it's not a regular government-backed loan. 

She's asked me for help with other areas of her finances, but I think this is the biggest thing to address.  I doubt she's correct that it's impossible for her to refinance to a traditional loan -- she's pretty fatalistic and I've never heard that it's *impossible* to get a traditional 30-year refinance if you have at least *some* equity in the house.  However, the hard-money mortgage is a bit of a touchy subject since I've criticized it before when she took it out, so if I suggest refinancing I need to know what I'm talking about.   But honestly, I don't know what I""m talking about.  Her explanation that it was somehow ""impossible"" for her to get a 30-year loan from the beginning  just doesn't make sense.   I do know that her previous home with my dad was foreclosed on in early 2016, so that may have to do with it, and also the fact that they're still married, and haven't filed taxes in years.  

Right now I honestly have no clue if banks are even giving out new loans, period, let alone to somebody with her credit score.  I think she has anywhere from 0-30% equity, but I'm pretty sure she's at least not negative (even with the recent hit to home prices so far with Covid-19).  

Is a 30-year mortgage possible?  If so, anything I should know for my mom's particular situation?  And is is true that she's just categorically ineligible for some reason?  Thanks in advance!",finance

personalfinance,Larger downpayment vs. borrowing full mortgage approval amount and investing the difference,"I am looking to be a first-time homeowner, soonish. I'm getting mortgage advise left and right and I'm having trouble discerning what is the optimal course of action. 

One one hand, I'm being told to put as much down for the downpayment as I can afford. Which would be well over 30% for the houses in my price range. 

On the other hand, I'm being advised to pay the 20% minimum downpayment (which I will do regardless) and then accept the full amount I am preapproved to borrow from a lender. I am supposed to then, invest the difference at a higher interest rate than my mortgage. 

I plan to put no more than 35K down at approx. 3.5% for a 30 yr mortgage. My annual income is just shy of 50K. I want to keep my monthly costs down so that I am able to prepay a little bit every month. 

I am not averse to diversifying my portfolio by investing in things other than real estate, but can I really offset the extra I'm paying in interest by accepting the full amount I'm preapproved to borrow? Paying more towards the downpayment and borrowing less seems like a better and safer way to keep my monthly costs down and prepay a little each month. I hope my question here makes sense.

personalfinance,Should I put more money towards a car for work or student loans in forbearance?,"I'm starting a new job and will be getting a used car at the end of June. I plan to take out an 18k car loan and I have good credit so interest should be below 5%. I also have a federal stafford student loan totalling 19k that is currently in forbearance until November of this year.

My question is: would it be smarter to put money towards saving for a down payment on the car and then car payments while my student loans are in forbearance or make minimum payments on the car and focus on student loans instead?

Edit: Thanks for all the replies so far. For those saying I should get a cheaper car, that is good advice. Looking back I realized that my car loan estimate is inaccurate. 18k would be the cost before my down payment. I currently have enough for a down payment of 3k, so the actual loan will be closer to 15k. To give some further information: I'm planning on getting a used 2016 Honda Civic. I wanted a car with lower miles, bluetooth/android auto, active safety features (traffic is thick and crazy here), and great gas mileage. I have no debt beyond the student loan currently.

science,Why do viruses often come from bats? A discussion with your friendly neighborhood virologist,"**Hello /r/Science! I’m** ***/u/\_Shibboleth\_*** **and I’m a Virologist/Immunologist.**

The 4.5 years I spent getting a PhD were dedicated to studying antibody responses against emerging viruses like Ebola and Marburg. So you can imagine how much time I’ve spent thinking about bats. 

Here’s some answers about why they always seem to be the culprit when it comes to outbreaks.

---

# Q: Why is it always bats? (that harbor dangerous viruses that spill over into humans)

# A: It's complicated.

**TL;DR - Bats are a perfect storm of: genetic proximity to humans (as fellow mammals), keystone species interacting with many others in the environment (including via respiratory secretions and blood-transmission), great immune systems for spreading dangerous viruses, flight, social structure, hibernation, etc.**

---

You may not be fully aware, but unless your head has been stuffed in the sand, you've probably heard, at some point, that X virus ""***lives in bats***."" It's been said about: **Rabies, Hendra/Nipah, Ebola, Chikungunya, Rift Valley Fever, St. Louis Encephalitis, and yes, SARS, MERS**, and, now probably **SARS-CoV-2** (with the addition of another intermediate species?)

[Bats really do harbor more viruses than other species groups](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/06/bats-really-do-harbor-more-dangerous-viruses-other-species)!

**But why? Why is it always bats?** The answer lies in the unique niche bats fill in our ecosystem.

# Bats are not that far off from humans genetically speaking

They're placental mammals that give birth to live young, that are [about as related to us (distance-wise) as dogs](https://www.researchgate.net/deref/http%3A%2F%2Fdx.doi.org%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.0030002?_sg%5B0%5D=5-_-2_pgWIhDr6YQfI8RQIcqJrXoSs-GlPcy1oj31o-lwx93Pqr2XNO5gRdpjh8RlWuimjxHEuIxQAzZUsOaC2v-Jg.4ZxtM1n7PdeIguwFA_xY00LN0cqRu784dZOaF6gdx3I7e7d3ReGdPq-cF2UejDf7cwWIv8yDiL4Q3eOetfyk6w). Which means **\~84% of our genomes are identical to bat genomes**. Just slightly less related to us than, say, mice or rats (\~85%).

*(this estimate is based upon associations in phylogeny. Yes I know bats are a huge group, but it's useful to estimate at this level right now.)*

Why does this matter? **Well, genetic relatedness isn't just a fun fancy % number. It also means that all the proteins on the surface of our cells are similar as well.**

For example, [**SARS-CoV-2 is thought to enter our cells using the ACE2 receptor**](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6485/1444) (*which is a lil protein that plays a role in regulating blood pressure on the outside of cells in our lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines*). [**The ACE2 between humans and bats is about 80.5% similar**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20567988/) (*this link is to a paper using bat ACE2 to figure out viral entry. I just plugged the bat ACE2 and human ACE2 into [protein blast](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE=Proteins) to get that 80.5% number*).

To give you an idea of what that means for a virus that's crossing species barriers, CD4 ([the protein HIV uses to get into T cells](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18383039/)) is about 98% similar between [chimpanzees](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/8/3229) and humans. HIV likely had a much easier time than SARS-CoV-2 of jumping onto our ship, but SARS-CoV-2 also has a trick up its sleeve: [an extremely promiscuous viral entry protein](https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/from-bats-to-human-lungs-the-evolution-of-a-coronavirus).

These viruses use their entry protein and bind to the target receptor to enter cells. The more similar the target protein is between species, the easier it will be for viruses to jump ship from their former hosts and join us on a not-so-fun adventure.

Another aspect of this is that **there are just so many dang bats**. There are roughly [1,300 bat species](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/group/bats/) making up [20-25% of all mammals](https://www.csu.edu/cerc/researchreports/documents/BatsActivityGuide.pdf). So the chances of getting a virus from a bat? Pretty good from the get go. *If you had to pick a mammalian species at random, there's a pretty good chance it's gonna be a rodent or a bat.*

# Bats are in a perfect place to serve as a nexus connecting a bunch of different species together and transmitting viruses

Various bat species do all or some of:

* [**Drink the blood of other animals**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_bat) ([*and are in turn fed on by mosquitos*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6466281/))

* [**Eat moths, gnats, flies, and mosquitos**](https://news.wisc.edu/study-bolsters-bats-reputation-as-mosquito-devourers/) that have fed on live or dead animals
* [**Help to pollinate**](https://ucanr.edu/sites/PollenNation/Meet_The_Pollinators/Bats) and spread seeds for a zillion different important plants
* [**Shit on cave floors, producing precious guano**](https://eos.org/articles/how-bat-breath-and-guano-can-change-the-shapes-of-caves) that is used by fungi and bacteria

* [**Bats are also food**](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20170118-monstrous-spiders-and-centipedes-that-prey-on-large-animals) for hawks, weasels, and even arthropods like spiders and centipedes. And yes, even humans eat bats.

**All of this means two things:**

1. **bats are getting and giving viruses from all of these different activities**. Every time they drink the blood of another animal or eat a mosquito that has done the same, they get some of that species' viruses. And when they urinate on fruit that we eat, or if we directly eat bats, we get those viruses as well.
2. **Bats are, like it or not, an extremely crucial part of the ecosystem that cannot be eliminated.** So their viruses are also here to stay. **The best thing we can do is pass laws that make it illegal to eat, farm, and sell bats and other wild zoonotic animals**, so that we can reduce our risk of contracting their viruses. We can also pass laws protecting their ecological niche, so that they stay in the forest, and we stay in the city!

# The bat immune system is well tuned to fight and harbor viruses

[Their immune systems are actually hyper-reactive](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/bats-immune-system-viruses-ebola-marburg-people), getting rid of viruses from their own cells extremely well. This is probably an adaptation that results from the second point: if you encounter a ton of different viruses, then you also have to avoid getting sick yourself.

*This sounds counter-intuitive, right? Why would an animal with an extremely good immune system be a good vector to give us (and other animals) its viruses?*

Well, the theory goes that [**bats act as a sort of ""training school""**](https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/why-bats-are-breeding-grounds-for-deadly-diseases-like-ebola-and-sars) **where viruses are educated against robust mammalian immune responses**, and learn to [adapt and control the usual mechanisms that mammalian cells use to fight back](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00026/full#h6).

The second aspect of this is that [**bat immune systems***](https://massivesci.com/articles/bat-immune-systems-ncov-sars-nipah-mers-ebola-coronavirus/) allow for [background replication of viruses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6410205/) **at a low level, all the time, as a strategy to prevent symptomatic disease**. It's a trade-off, and one that bats have executed perfectly.

It just happens to mean that **when we get a virus from bats, oh man can it cause some damage**.

*I do have to say this one is mostly theory and inference, and there isn't amazingly good evidence to support it*. *But it's very likely that bat immune systems are different from our own, given [the overall divergence of their immune system genes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29253856/) in relation [to our own and those of other mammals](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7025585/).*

My opinion (*which echoes most ecologists*) is that [it's more about the position that bats hold in the environment](https://www.intechopen.com/books/bats/bats-bat-borne-viruses-and-environmental-changes), their behaviors, their longevity, and their sheer numbers. In general zoonotic transmission is a roulette, and bats have the most positions (*and the most advantageous positions*) on that wheel.

I think this idea has picked up so much steam because molecular biologists often find ways to use what they know about the micro world to explain phenomena in the macro world. It’s honestly probably counterproductive, since most things are quite a bit more complex than we realize while looking at their analogues in Petri dishes.

That being said, I also think ecologists often underestimate what is possible to figure out in a Petri dish, and undervalue the impact of a robustly well-controlled interventional experiment. But that's a conversation for another day.

# Bats can FLY!

This allows them to travel long distances, meet and interact with many different animals, hunt and be hunted, and survive to tell the tale. **Meaning they also survive to pass on their virus.**

---

# Bats are unusually long lived!

[**Many bat species live longer than 25 years**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12882342). On the curve of ""body size and metabolism"" vs ""lifespan"" [bats are a massive over-performer](https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/06/why-do-bats-have-such-bizarrely-long-lifespans/). The closely related foxes, for example, live on average 2-5 years in the wild.

This is probably interrelated with all the other factors listed. Bats can fly, so they live longer; bats live longer, so they can spread slowly growing virus infections better. This combination of long lifespan and persistent viral infection means that bats may, more often, keep viruses around long enough to pass them onto other vertebrates (like us!).

# Their social structure and hibernation behaviors

These characteristics are uniquely positioned to help them harbor a number of different viruses.

[Bats roost](https://www.bats.org.uk/about-bats/where-do-bats-live/bat-roosts/what-is-a-roost), meaning they hole up inside the roofs of caves and hibernate together for long periods of time (on the order of months), passing viruses amongst the colony in close isolation. [**The Mexican free-tailed bat, for example, packs \~300 bats/ft\^2 in cave systems**](https://tpwd.texas.gov/education/resources/keep-texas-wild/hanging-around-with-bats/a-year-in-the-life-of-a-mexican-free-tailed-bat) **like** [**Carlsbad caverns**](https://www.sunset.com/travel/carlsbad-confidential-the-bats) **in the southwestern United States.**

The complex social hierarchy of bats also likely plays a role. [**Bats exist in so-called ""micropopulations"" that have different migratory patterns**](https://www.researchgate.net/deref/http%3A%2F%2Fdx.doi.org%2F10.3906%2Fzoo-1508-56?_sg%5B0%5D=JXKzPLHkT5oojZLpKNaB1nsVgJvPk2x0CU3PgN5cO1SQ7hgTmkp0pZjIt6V7g-D_hnmZDJsDvmnZhNBdBsOvW2z-wQ.7zu_Efac5ALLeW8HlJfQISFbNLHoF6T0YXBun1ynaj1X1OeiAUt7geHm5s7BVbeto9mvEXWZ9VSn1Nbcfj_WkA). [They interweave and interact and combine and separate](https://www.researchgate.net/deref/http%3A%2F%2Fdx.doi.org%2F10.1134%2FS1062359014010105?_sg%5B0%5D=bMEntzSErKfgn7qaU7I16nuG74WfvYoY0vmRuuNnUYyo5yT8PLByWYocJ_8fq3oqwJ4MvHD_RXcoa6d1SubJCAoU5Q.EicnSr6EFfAwP2tWm6NSriLyNnbmCTcT-jztT9C18MZkDl42G8G-1anfVhFShDRYXMQaZPXPbN5iKBr4oH5Pug) in a dizzying mix of complex social networks among different ""micropopulations.""

A given virus may have the chance to interact with hundreds of thousands or millions of different individual bats in a short period of time as a result. This also means that viruses with different life cycles (short, long, persistent, with flare-ups, etc) can always find what they need to survive, since different bat groupings have different habits.

**And** [**this may partially explain how outbreaks of certain viruses happen according to seasonality**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3121824/). If you're a virus and your bat micropopulation of choice is around and out to play, it's more likely you will get a chance to jump around to different species.

# Echolocation may also play a role

Bats echolocate, and it involves the intense production of powerful sound waves, which are also perfect for disseminating lots of small virus-containing respiratory droplets across long distances! ([1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1539106/) [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4551426))

# Finally, a note on viral ecology in general:

**If you read this post, and think bats are the only ones out there with viruses, then I have failed.**

The reality is that **every species out there, from the tiniest stink bug to the massive elephant, likely has millions of different viruses infecting it all the time!** If you take [a drop (mL) of seawater, it contains \~10 million bacteriophages](https://hmr.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1007/BF01983537).

**In our genome, there are** [**remnants and scars and evidence of millions of retroviruses that once infected us**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous_retrovirus)**.** Greater than 8% of our genome is made up of these ""endogenous retroviruses,"" most of which don't make any RNA or proteins or anything like that. They just sit there. **They've truly won the war for remembrance**.

That's what viruses do, **they try and stick around for as long as possible**. *And, in a sense, these endogenous retroviruses have won*. They live with us, and get to stick around as long as we survive in one form or another.

**The vast vast majority of viruses are inert, asymptomatic, and cause no notable disease**. **It is only the very tip of the iceberg, the smallest tiny % of viruses, that cause disease and make us bleed out various orifices**. **Viral disease, in terms of all viruses, is the exception, not the rule. It's an accident.** **We are an accidental host for most of these ""zoonotic"" viruses.**

Viruses are everywhere, and it is only the unique and interesting aspects of bats noted above that mean we are forced to deal with their viruses more than other species.

(**Dengue, like most viruses, follows this idea**. The vast majority of people are asymptomatic. Pathogenicity and disease are the exception, not the rule. But that doesn't mean they don't cause damage to society and to lots of people! They do!)

[From: https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1038\/s41577-019-0123-x \(https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/KcuutRz.png\)](https://preview.redd.it/3dr6pt3e3nt41.png?width=2124&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6df2a3f92293bd8a900a7cd689304963cd7bac02)

**The last thing I want to reiterate at the end of this post is something I said earlier:**

*Bats are a keystone species!*

**A keystone species is one that, when you remove it, the system falls apart. Much like [the  keystone](https://images.app.goo.gl/HNZKSAGdWGzYns9HA) in an arched entryway.**

 Removing bats from the Earth would likely kill many more millions of humans than CoVID-19 or Ebola ever could.


**We rely on the plants they pollinate for the food we eat and for the air we breathe.**  **We rely on them for pest control and for population control.** **And, in turn, they serve as good for other crucial species.**


**Bat populations keep mosquitos like** ***Aedes*** **and** ***Anopheles*** **species in check.** *Aedes Aegypti*  kills many more millions than CoVID-19 by spreading dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, Zika, and other viruses. *Anopheles* females spread malaria, one of the most deadly diseases in human history. **Without bats, these mosquitoes could overgrow to unknown and unpredictable levels, and the diseases they transmit could spread even further, like wildfire, decimating the earth's human population.**  

In terms of pure biomass and impacts...*to remove 20% of mammals on the Earth*... That could be absolutely devastating! Possibly world-ending on its own.

We need bats.

We also don't know what would replace the niche that bats hold in the Earth's ecosystem. And whether or not *that* animal or animals would be worse or better for human zoonotic infections. 


**We need bats. We just don't need them to be close enough to human society that we contract their viruses so easily.**  


Other people have actually done this calculation. And they agree with me:  

(**[1](https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/esr/v8/n1-2/p93-115/) [2](https://www.theday.com/article/20100421/NWS01/304219877) [3](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/what-is-killing-the-bats-16824335/) [4](https://news.cgtn.com/news/2020-02-08/Bats-may-carry-virus-should-we-kill-them-all--NUxmfimhCU/index.html) [5](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2019/03/endangered-bats-killed-in-mauritius/) [6](https://fokt.pw/ecosystemservicesprovided.pdf) [7](https://peerj.com/articles/2249/?utm_source=TrendMD&amp;utm_campaign=PeerJ_TrendMD_1&amp;utm_medium=TrendMD) [8](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Justin_Welbergen/publication/270160641_The_impacts_of_extreme_events_on_biodiversity_-_lessons_from_die-offs_in_flying-foxes/links/54a197c40cf267bdb902c319.pdf) [9](http://kops.uni-konstanz.de/handle/123456789/35007)**)

**Deforestation, climate change, the bushmeat trade, and the trafficking of animals for alternative medicine are what is to blame for this mess. Not bats.**

investing,Thoughts on CLO over the course of this recession?,"I'm starting to like reviewing Mayra Rodriguez Valladares articles over the past year or so on CLO.

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/mayrarodriguezvalladares/2019/06/11/non-banks-are-the-largest-holders-of-collateralized-loan-obligations-globally/#100c67296e95](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mayrarodriguezvalladares/2019/06/11/non-banks-are-the-largest-holders-of-collateralized-loan-obligations-globally/#100c67296e95)

&gt; I wrote the SEC asking for CLO data of publicly traded companies. I received a prompt response. “The SEC does not track how much public companies hold in CLOs.  That is not a required line item disclosure so we are not able to track it based on a company’s SEC filings.”

I'm more and more convinced CLO (lower tranches at the very least) are going to explode over the course of this recession. Seems to be a hidden danger if it's left off SEC filings, and the credit swamp is flooding wider by the day.

I don't see how they won't fail as S&amp;P downgrades roll, hedge funds see the risk and sell exposure, bond ETF sell the downgraded funds to buy investment grade, yields on junk bonds start to rise, and these companies finally croak and die when they really can't refinance any more.

How far do you think the Fed is really going to wade into this shit? Isn't it too risky for them?

Thoughts?",finance
personalfinance,I am an airline pilot. How should I plan for potentially being furloughed in the near(ish) future?,"I created this account to see if I could get some valuable advice. I am an airline pilot in the US and it is blatantly obvious that no one is flying and no one will be flying much for the foreseeable future (and I don't blame you guys). You can read all about it, but the CARES money pretty much requires the airlines to pay their employees and not lay anyone off....until September 30th (and pay that money back at a very low interest rate).

I am very early in my career and in terms of seniority, I am in the bottom 1,100 of pilots. If things don't make a drastic turnaround by the end of summer, I could potentially be facing a furlough. 

Here's my deal...

I paid off nearly 35k of my student loans this past year (2019) and since then had been going hard at them until March hit and everything started getting scary. 

**I have 10.3k of a Private student loan at 4.25% w/ a $789/mo payment. (Originally 52k)**

**I have 38k in Fed Student loans averaging about 4% with a monthly payment of $390.**

The Fed Loans, as you all probably know, are in forbearance due to the CARES act. In early/mid March when this all started going crazy, I changed the direction of my income, and started putting a lot of it in savings, called the Private loan provider and put the loan in forbearance until July 7th, to give myself as much room to save as much as possible. 

Before all of this I was living on the edge, to be honest, with a measly $500 emergency fund...Mostly because I couldn't swallow not putting most of my income towards student loans. 

So here's my question...

I have about 5k in savings now after a month and a half of saving vigorously. That Private Student Loan payment is brutally large, at almost $800/mo. I am wondering now **if I should take most of my current savings and cut the Private loan nearly in half, and work my tail off to pay that private loan off ASAP, get rid of the $800 payment before the end of summer and then try to save as much as possible before that Sept 30th date when I could be looking at a furlough?** I hadn't really considered this until this morning. I was feeling very comfortable and had a peace of mind with all that cash there to protect me during these weird times, but this new idea seems to make a little more sense, strategically. 

I want to know what you would do? Or how do you feel about my new plan?

A little about my essential expenses and income:

* Income (after taxes, 401k, health insurance): \~$3,500/mo (was usually about $4-4,500 before our hours were dropped starting back in April)
* Rent: $1,000/mo
* Utilities: \~$55/mo
* Groceries: \~$200-300/mo
* Transportation: \~$50-75/mo
* Phone is covered

Thanks for your time and stay safe. I'll stick around to answer questions and respond to your messages.",finance
investing,Trying to understand the whys and hows of negative price in crude oil,"Disclaimer, this is going to be a long message.

With the oil market gone mad recently, I would like to have some insights from someone who is on the field. FYI, I have never worked in/with the oil industry, but as an opportunistic and enthusiastic learner, I would like to know what it takes to pull off a deal that would allow one to get paid for taking delivery of WTI crude oil.

So here are my thoughts and interrogations. Some of my questions can overlap with each other but anyway. All of them can be summed up in one question: ""If the same scenario of negative price occurs again in May for June's contract, how to proceed if I want panicked CL owners to pay me to take delivery of their crude oil? Then come the second top level question, how do I actually take delivery of this crude oil?""

But let's try to break this down into more elementary questions that have risen along my readings on the internet.

1. First about the delivery process. I don't understand very well how roles are split between different actors.

1)a) In CL contract specs, they talk about a Clearing House. What is it exactly? A quick tour on Google brought me to Oil &amp; Gas Asset Clearinghouse, is that the one? Is there an only one Clearing House?

1)b) Referring to that CL contract again, it's written that ""The Clearing House shall allocate Delivery Notices and Notices of Intention to Accept by matching size of positions to the extent possible"". Do I understand right if I say that it's the Clearing House that puts, nominatively, a bid in front of an ask? Isn't it up to the financial market to do that?

1)c) Apparently, some margin shall be submitted so the transaction can occur. What they call a margin in this CL contract is like a deposit, am I correct? Under which form this deposit has to be done? Money? How much? The equivalent of the whole transaction? Can you enlighten me about this margin thing? Especially when prices are negative, how this margin works?

1)d) Still in CL contract, they mention two companies: Enterprise Products Partners L.P. and Endbridge Pipeline (Ozark) LLC. Are they the only one companies handling pipelines and deliveries for CL contracts? Do they handle storage as well?

1)e) Are those two companies considered FCM? Or are FCM's completely different actors? How do FCMs interface with the Clearing House and the two companies mentioned in 1)d) ?

1)f) Can you explain me the difference between book-out, in-tank transfer and in-line transfer please? I'm definitely not familiar with those terms.

1)g) I read somewhere that delivery shall be made in accordance with all applicable Federal executive orders and all applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulation. Where can I find all those orders, laws and regulation?

1)h) Could you point me toward a FCM company?

1)i) What is the minimum amount of barrels required to be purchased so one can proceed to a delivery? I’m guessing that FCM/Clearing House/CME/Pipeline companies/Funds (big or small) won’t be interested in small transaction? What’s the smallest they toletate? I'd like to have an idea of the kind of money we are talking about.

1)j) CL contracts deal with WTI Light Sweet Crude Oil that is delivered to Cushing. Does this mean that WTI Light Sweet Crude Oil cannot be delivered anywhere else? Is any other type of crude delivered to Cushing?

2. Then, relatively to storage itself, I can't find any clear picture of storage capacity, that's  
quite confusing

2)a) I thought that the US Gulf coast is now equipped with plenty of storage capacity, like 55% of US capacity (in Houston, LOOP in Louisiana...). How come everyone talks about storage issues in Cushing? It feels like there is only Cushing in the US (only 13% of storage capacity). Isn't it possible to transfer that glut of oil to storage farms elsewhere?

2)b) Is it really an issue of storage shortage or is it more about midstream infrastructures (I mean for transportation) not being able to keep up with this abundance of crude?

2)c) What regulatory requirements do storage facilities have to meet? Where can I find them?

2)d) What if I decide to store the crude abroad? Will US authorities have a say in the regulatory requirements met (or not...) by the facility receiving the crude?

2)e) Is there an easy way to get the big picture/map of storage capacity in the US, in the Caribbean, in Central and South America?

3. About the trading/acquisition of barrels on financial markets aspects; I believe not  
anybody can buy CL contracts (therefore purchase barrels) on classic financial markets  
with classic brokers.

3)a) How to get access to this kind of transactions? I assume they are only large scale transaction aren’t they?

3)b) I didn't understand very well the difference between CME Globex and CME ClearPort... What use to do of those two ones? I got the impression that I had to be on one of those two ones to trade CL contracts.

3)c) How CME Globex and CME ClearPort are different from NYMEX? Isn't NYMEX supposed to be the exchange where CL contracts are traded?

3)d) What is traded exactly? USO or CL contracts?

3)e) I have identified some main stake holders from a financial/market point of view:

\-CME Group, apart from creating/emeting the CL contratcs and handling/supervising crude delivery in Cushing, what do they do?

\-USCF, which is a Fund that has created USO which is also a fund. If I understood correctly, USO shares are traded (under the form of an ETF) on NYMEX. This USO ETF is somehow (how?) related to CL contracts

\-This USO Fund would be managed by Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM). Why not directly by USCF?

\-ALPS, which is the distributing broker and handles the trading operation on the fund USO

3)f)i)Did I get the whole picture in terms of main players involved?

3)f)ii)Why does Bank of New York Mellon manage USO instead of USO itself or USCF?

3)f)iii) How CME Group and their CL contracts on one hand, and USCF/USO/BNYM/ALPS on another hand are related?

3)f)iv) Generally, can someone explain how all those players interact?

3)f)v) If prices go negative again, and I want to get paid to get crude delivered so that I can store it somewhere, which of those players do I need to get in touch with?

3)g) Is there any contract, other than CL of CME Group, that deal with WTI Light Sweet Crude Oil? Or do I have to assume that CME Group got the exclusivity on that type of oil?

3)h) In case I can't (for some reason) buy a very big bundle of CL contracts to big players like institutional funds (USCF, etc), how would it be possible to buy as many CLs to different retailer traders, make it a whole bundle myself and proceed to one big delivery?

3)i) USO has 30% of long CLs for June. What/Who is the second biggest detainers of CL contracts?

3)j) I have read that CME can force USO to shut down because with 30% of the contracts, USO could go bankrupt and in the end CME would have to take all the deliveries attached to the contrats. How can CME force USO to close? What's the deal between the two them? How are they related?

With Federal loans being on administrative forbearance, all interest rates have effectively been set to 0% from March 13 - September 30; meaning no minimum balance is due. (https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/coronavirus)

With that in mind, you are able to direct your entire monthly payment (or less - no minimum balance is currently due!) towards one specific loan, opposed to how it would normally distribute your payment across all of your loans. You can target your highest interest loans right now, and pay them down.

This will lower your overall interest rate once the forbearance is lifted.

*Currently on the Federal student loans website, www.studentaid.gov, interest rates are all effectively marked to display ""0%"" - which can make it difficult to determine which of your loans carry the highest interest rates. All I did was give their support line a call, and was able to quickly receive all information related to my loans and their interest rates.",finance

vet,Help injured cat at my parents house during curfew,"We found a street cat (maybe 2 or 3 months old) with cuts all over. Seem to be done by another bigger cat. Two across stomach and one on her neck. She bled a little but bleeding stopped. One of the cuts seems a little deep but thankfully I dont see any of her insides protruding. 
It was almost curfew time so I took her in my parents’ garden, used betadine (Providone-iodine) on the cuts then fucicort cream ( antibiotic/corticosteroid) then covered them with large bandages. We then fed it some water, then melted crushed panadol in water and fed her some. We found a clean cozy place for her to rest as we cannot take it inside. I dont know what else to do. I figured we can give her the panadol water again in four hours and try and feed her some soup or something. Please advise.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Pull out of buying house?,"Hey everyone
My wife and I have been in the progress of purchasing a new build home since before Covid really was making an impact in the US. The more we talk about the house with people, the more varied the opinions get. Some people are saying they think we should pull out now since the economy is looking grim and lose our earnest money. Others think now is a great time to buy because interest rates are low. 

Here’s the details:

585K house (we live in a very expensive area)

We’re likely going to get somewhere around a 3.1% interest rate without buying it down 

We were planning on putting 5% down and paying PMI (either paying off PMI upfront or paying monthly payments)

We have about 70K in accessible cash (other money is all in retirement accounts)

My company just went through a big round of layoffs but I did not get laid off. I’d give myself around a 15% chance of eventually being laid off if Covid continues affecting the economy. 

Our mortgage would be about my wife’s total income.

With both of our incomes together, the mortgage is about 35% of our total income. 

We have put 5K down in the form of earnest money that we can’t get back. 

——

What does everyone think? Should we stay the course and move in in a couple of months when the house is done or pull out and lose our earnest money?",finance

First of all I have to say that I have no interest in cryptocurrency and I'm really just here to ask what Coinbase is and why I've suddenly received an email telling me that my account has been successfully deleted.

Obviously I've never made an account on Coinbase before or even heard of it before today. I've just gone ahead to contact them to inform of the unauthorised account creation but I'm not sure if I should be worried or if there is anything I can do in the mean time.

Just thought I should mention that the email came from [no-reply@coinbase.com](mailto:no-reply@coinbase.com). It doesn't look like its a spoofed email either.

personalfinance,Am I financially prepared to buy a house?,"Hey PF! I'm in the process of hunting for a house and I want to get some extra opinions on my financial situation to see if I'm being realistic with myself. Let me know if the numbers below make sense!

**Some background:** I'm 25 years old working as a Mechanical Engineer at a large manufacturing company in New England. I've been living at home with my parents while trying to pay down student loans and save money for a house. I've lived here my whole life and commuted in college. As grateful as I am for my parent's generosity to let me live with them rent free I feel like I need to get my own space.

I'd like to stay in the area as I love my current job and see myself staying here for the foreseeable future. ""Starter"" houses (WWII era, 2 or 3 bd/1 bath / ~1000 sq ft) are selling in the $160-220k range. I am hoping to find something in the $175-190k range.



Onto the numbers: 

**Base Pay: $70k/yr**

**Savings: ~$23k**

**Stocks: ~$6500**

**Student Loans: ~$71k left ($45k private @ 4.51% + $26k Federal @ 3.9%)**

**Auto Loan: ~$7000 @ 3.99%**
******
**The Breakdown**

**Take Home Pay: ~$3950/mo** This is after hitting my employer 401k match (6% from me / 3% from them) 

**Student Loan Payment Minimums: $220 Federal + $500 Private** 

**Extra Private Student Loan Payments: $350/mo** (Actually $500/month, but will drop when I find a house)

**Food/Toiletries: $350/mo**

**Car Payment: $225/mo for car and $143/mo for insurance** (I am planning on selling my stocks to pay this off this summer to free up cash flow)

**Phone/Life Insurance/Gas/Subscriptions/Misc: $288/mo**

This leaves me with ~$2000/mo left over going up to $2200+ after I pay off my car this summer.

*******
Like I stated at the top of the post, I am looking for a house in the $175-190k range with a max budget of $200k. I plan to put 5% down which would put the mortgage + property tax at ~$1025-$1150/month. Add in ~$75/mo for PMI and another $100/mo for homeowner's insurance and I'm at $1200-$1325/month. Using numbers I got from friends/family I'm figuring an additional $300/month for utilities in a small house (heat/electric/internet/water).

**Total:$1475-$1600/mo**

*******


All that being said I would have ~$550-$700 left over at the end of each month. What I want to know is: **Is this enough?** After buying a house I should still have ~$9-10k left in my emergency fund which would give me a 3 month safety net.

personalfinance,Q for anyone with a Navy Federal mortgage who pays extra occasionally,"Afternoon.

I have a car loan through NFCU, and it works as one would think - I pay extra and it's reflected automatically on my overall balance.

My mortgage, however, is through Union Savings Bank, and it's a great rate but a hot mess.  For starters, let's say my mortgage is $1200 per month, due on the 1st.  If I get some extra money and decide on the 10th to pay $400 extra, it sits in what they call a ""suspense"" account doing nothing.  I literally have to call the bank and ask them to apply the $ in ""suspense"" to principal.  The only way I can pay extra is only if I pay a ""full"" mortgage payment - anything additional over the $1200 gets applied towards principal.  It's pretty annoying.

If I were to refinance my mortgage with NFCU - if I wanted to kick in an extra $500 once in a while, does it immediately (once credited) show the updated lower balance, a la my NFCU car loan?

btc,Introduction to stablecoins,"*Stablecoins are a major use case for DeFi but come in various different forms. The stablecoin space is still relatively young and underserved – but that’s changing fast.*

Stablecoins are one of the most important and popular DeFi products, enabling users to hedge and store value on the blockchain, without having to use exchanges or other centralised providers.

As a smart contracts and DeFi platform, Ergo is well suited for building all kinds of dApps, including stablecoins. You’ll certainly be hearing more from us in the future about a stablecoin on the Ergo blockchain, but until then, we want to introduce and unpack the idea as context for what’s coming.

## Different stablecoin approaches

There are various ways to peg a crypto token to the dollar or another fiat currency. The easiest way is to hold dollars in a bank account, and issue one token for every dollar you have. This is exactly the approach that Tether (USDT) takes. This offers users the ability to store and transfer USD easily, without using an exchange. However, this approach is still highly centralised; you have to trust Tether that they have enough dollars in their bank account to cover the issued tokens. Tether is well known for being opaque and refusing proper audits. The token could also be shut down if a regulator managed to freeze their accounts.

There are various backed stablecoins on the market, which take broadly the same approach. Tokens like USDC and Gemini dollars are much the same, but they are far more transparent, and operate within a clear regulatory framework. Then there are projects like TrustToken, which underpins the TrueUSD token (TUSD); this is much the same again, though takes a more distributed approach, with both a high degree of transparency and multiple banking partners.

All of these necessarily have a degree of centralisation and risk, because they rely on banking partners – and those accounts can potentially be frozen, shut down or even raided.

Other projects – notably the Maker Protocol – attempt to address this with a fully decentralised model. Maker’s Dai is an algorithmic stablecoin: a ‘synthetic’ dollar that is not backed by real dollars as USDT, USDC and other stablecoins are.

Dai are issued from ‘Vaults’ backed by crypto collateral (mostly ETH). A system of smart contracts and oracles (decentralised price feeds) ensures that every Dai issued is collateralised by at least $1.50; if the ratio falls too low, the Vault is closed and the Dai repurchased automatically. It’s a complex and impressive system, and the largest project in the DeFi space.

## Some stablecoins are more stable than others

Stablecoins have been around since at least 2014, though the first attempts had limited success. The earliest algorithmic coins, like NuBits and BitUSD, did not have the benefit of smart contracts platforms (which were only available with the launch of Ethereum in 2015). They tended to be centralised or semi-centralised, and didn’t work well in practice. (NuBits, for example, lost its peg and has completely collapsed.)

Tether, which has been around since 2014, has grown into a multi-billion-dollar phenomenon, with tens of billions of dollars of daily volumes. However, while Tether generally keeps its peg pretty well, occasional quirks of the market and fears about the company’s reserves mean it has not always been worth $1 (once dropping as low as $0.90). USDC, which is more trustworthy and transparent, tends to have lower spreads and a more reliable peg.

Meanwhile Dai, as the foremost algorithmic stablecoin, has historically done well. It aims to maintain a ‘soft’ peg, with decentralised monetary policy nudging it back towards $1 if market conditions push it too far away from this. This has generally been successful; the only time prices have deviated significantly was on the enormous market volatility of ‘Black Thursday’ in March, which saw a massive sell-off of almost every fiat and crypto asset.

## Algo, collateralised, back or a combination?

And so the existing stablecoins take one or more of several approaches to keeping the token pegged to the dollar. The simplest, but also the most centralised, is to back the token with actual dollars. You can also back it with crypto, so long as you ensure there is enough collateral to cover the tokens issued in the event of market volatility. Algorithmic stablecoins use price feeds and decentralised monetary policy to make it more or less attractive to buy or sell the tokens, helping to ensure the price gravitates towards $1.

Every approach has its strengths and weaknesses. Ergo will be announcing details of its own implementations in the coming weeks, and explaining why its developers are taking the approach they are.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"Law School, Retirement Savings, and the looming possibility of being unable to work","TLDR: save more for retirement in 401k or roth IRA or put all money into paying for law school in a year?

I'm 24. I will start law school in fall 2021 (deferred admission to a top 10 school--I'm not willing to change where I'm going for various personal reasons). I should make around 60k in the next year provided that I don't get laid off. I have no debt beyond the ~$200-500 I charge on my credit card and pay off in full every month. I live at home and spend around 10-15% of my income on expenses (doubt I could get this much lower), saving the rest in a mix of a HYSA, CDs, 529, and 401k + roth IRA. 

I have a 50k scholarship for law school and with the money I have saved up, I anticipate borrowing around 110k. 60k of that will be at 6.08% and start accruing interest immediately, while the remaining 50k will be at around 7% (this is presuming I'm using government, not private, loans). My plan is to borrow the max unsubsidized for year 1 (~20k at 6.08 interest rate), max unsubsidized + what I need for year 2, and whatever I need for year 3, though I was trying to figure out if I should just skip borrowing for year 1 even though it's at a better interest rate. 

After graduation, I intend to go into a government position and will likely initially quality for my school's loan repayment assistance program/REPAYE/IBR/PSLF or whatever. My starting salary will probably be low (60kish) but could grow to at least 90k and up to 120k within 5-10 years. I have no plans to have children or buy a large house or have a large wedding.

I currently have around 2.5k in retirement savings (just started saving for retirement this year). My family thinks I should stop contributing to my roth IRA and my 401k (no employer match) asap and just put it in CDs or a HYSA. Does this make sense? Or would the lost compound interest likely mean that contributing a bit now would be reasonable?

The big X factor is this: I have a chronic illness. I can currently work full-time but there's a non-zero chance that I'll become so disabled that I cannot work at an unknown point in the future. I don't know if that changes the risk/reward calculations. The other factor here is that my health insurance costs during school will likely be higher (I'll be 26 when school starts), which I've accounted for when estimating how much I'll have to borrow.

Please let me know if any other detail is needed, and thank you.",finance

Anyways, when you certify for your weekly benefits there is a checkbox that asks if you want federal taxes taken out of your unemployment insurance benefits. I check ""yes"" every week.

Thus, every week I get $1,005. This is problematic because I don't want to owe the IRS anything on this income and would prefer to have them take it out before I even see the funds.

Just today I was paid for the last two weeks, and again only $45 taken out. Has anyone had experience with this issue or can someone confirm that the $600 isn't taxable?

personalfinance,Fixed vs. Variable Rate Student Loan Refinance,"I'm looking to refinance about $45,000 of private student loans, currently about 2 years into a 15-year term. Interest rate is 5.5%, and due to a cheap living situation I've been able to overpay significantly the past few months.

I need to choose between a 3% variable rate loan and a 4.03% fixed rate loan. The variable rate loan is tied to LIBOR, and has a 9% rate cap. I understand there is a risk of the variable rate loan increasing, but I am only interested in comparing the total cost of the loans. Both loans have 8-year terms but I'd likely pay it off in 4-6 years.

I believe that the variable rate loan has a good likelihood of costing me less money. My logic is that the longer into the future we look, the more the variable rate loan has to increase in order for it to be more expensive than the fixed rate over the life of the loan. For example, if the rate increases in month 1 - it would have to increase to 4.03% to cost the same as the fixed-rate. In month 2 - 4.1%, month 12 - 5%. My budget is capable of absorbing any increases in the monthly payment due to an increase in the rate, all the way up to the rate cap.

personalfinance,"Student loans: went into default years ago, can pay off now in full - but better for my credit to “Federal Rehab Program?” and pay monthly?","I’ll keep this simple but to shed a little light my situation goes as:
I had a financial and personal crisis (divorce/foreclosure) many years ago the likes of which I actually didn’t really think I would have recovered from.  But I did, and against rough odds, better than ever.  (New amazing wife, best career year ever, I’m sober, happy yada yada... etc.) 

To the point: I have a little under 20K in student loans that went into default and was picked up by some sort of student loan collection agency/ management. I’m able to pay them off in one fell swoop, but I was told that it’s “smarter” and better for my credit to enroll in a “federal rehabilitation program” - the reason being, that if I write a check and pay them off, it will always be shown on my credit report as a “default that was paid off,” and reflect poorly...but....if I enroll in this “federal rehabilitation program” it will take 10mos of consecutive monthly payments, then add the benefit of permanent removal of all default reports - and is therefore “better.”  This is a federal gov program of some sort I’m told?

Does anyone have any insight into this?  Or can advise  the actual best move?  I’d have thought it’d be better to pay in full and wipe them, but I’ve been told the “fed rehab program” is better in the long-run, for credit.  Optimal credit health is great, but the real goal is get this balance paid. 

Further details - the woman who told me this was indeed at the collection agency - so could be an ulterior motive to have me in a longer, higher interest-bearing term rather than get a check all-at-once to satisfy?  I tend not to think so, usually people want to get paid, but possible as collections are frisky.  Further - I could pay this off myself with my own savings, sure, but have been offered a family loan with zero interest and exceptionally kind terms for repayment, like $1000 per year, as a “glad you’re back, now re-start with no debt and rebuild your credit, kid...”  (I don’t think this matters but I’m just being transparent in case it may, and someone here knowledgeable thinks this could fudge with taxes or etc.).",finance

I'll also be working 2 additional urgent care shifts a month which should increase my salary by about 20k per year. This is obviously all before taxes.

The kicker is that I have a buttload of debt from school - \~380K and about \~4K in credit card debt. The interest rate varies from 5.3-7.2%. 

My questions:

What's a reasonable amount to set aside for savings/investments versus shoveling towards the massive debt hole? 

What's the amount I should plan on for housing expenses?  I live in a pretty expensive East Coast city.",finance

personalfinance,Parent requesting lease to enable them to take money from 401K,"Sorry if the title is a little bit confusing.

I am a college student, my mother currently claims me as a dependent on her taxes, and I share an apartment with my SO.

Recently, she asked if she could have a copy of my lease for 2020 - 2021, because it will enable her to take out the entirety of the lease value from her 401K. I'm not sure how this works this is just what she told me. She isn't planning to use this money to actually help us in school or pay rent, but rather to help her pay off her own debts. 

I am receiving no hell from my parents to get me through college, and I don't want the government (federal aid, FAFSA, whatever) to see that she took money out from her 401K to ""help me"" because I am worried it could mean I receive less need-based aid.

personalfinance,Professional MBA Financial Aid Question,"Hello Personal Finance,

I am currently enrolled in a professional MBA to help with my career progression. It is a local state school that will cost me about $28k + books and fees. I already have a full-time job and will be doing this part-time and my employer will reimburse me the $5250 a year to go to school.

I will be taking summer courses to finish in 2.5 years so what I have calculated is that I would need:

Year 1 (2020): 7418 - 5250: 2168 Summer &amp; Fall 2020 (9 credits) 

Year 2 (2021): 12,504 - 5250: 7254 Spring, Summer &amp; Fall 2021 (15 credits)

Year 3 (2022): 12,504 - 5250: 7254 Spring, Summer &amp; Fall 2022 (15 credits)

Year 4 (2023): 5086: 0 Spring 2023

So total out of pocket expenses would be $16,676 give or take depending on fees and books. I know I will be accruing interest immediately but I am not too worried about that. Obviously I also have to pass the class and will be enrolled in the next one before I get reimbursed for the first class and that is part of the reason for the loan.

I have some money to pay for this but was offered a student loan for the Summer and Fall, the summer I received 7844, and I received the full amount for the fall 20,500 federal unsubsidized loans. My company is quick on the turnaround for payment so my plan was to take the tuition for the summer, then when I get reimbursed used that to pay off the loan, and continue to do so as I go throughout the program. As well as use any extra cash to continue to pay down the loans until I am hopefully close to zero by the time I graduate.

I have a few questions: 

Should I accept the full amount and use that to pay the entire tuition for the program and pay it off as I go along? I figure whatever they don't use can apply to the next semester's tuition, is that a wrong way of thinking?

Should I adjust the amount for just the tuition for each semester and keep applying for the federal aid each year if I need it? I only really need the tuition and that may be just the first year as I have been saving up to pay out of pocket, but still have some debt to payoff.. which is why I am borrowing this money now. 

I tried to ask the financial aid office what my options are, but they are closed and only doing emails and the last one did not help very much. So I am asking internet strangers to help me out. Lol.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR; Should I borrow the entire financial aid for a master's degree that my employer will partially pay for? Should I adjust just based on tuition and use that amount? Or am I being crazy?",finance

I got approved for a 2.75% interest rate but was told that I didn’t meet the criteria requiring me to recoup the closing costs ($8,100 around) within 36 months. I was told that I would be able to qualify with this loan if I could bring $9,000 to closing. My loan officer also brought to the table a loan with an interest rate of 3.00% which she could roll in the closing costs into the loan and would be recouped within 36 months. She said that the loan with the 2.75% rate is being charged a 1% origination fee and the 3.00% loan is not. I asked if I could bring the difference between the two loans around $2,000 to bring the lower rate closing costs down to meet the 36 months. She said no this was no an option. I asked her why one loan was being charged an origination fee and the other wasn’t. The origination fee in the 2.75% loan is essentially causing me to not meet the 36 recoupment criteria. She said that these fees are decided by her marketing team. I am not understanding why I cannot bring the difference of the closing costs to the lower rate. Why am I being asked to bring $9,000 for the 2.75% rate. It feels like I am being forced to take the higher rate which will net them more money. Does this make sense to anyone?

personalfinance,How difficult will it be to live off 16K a year after rent is paid?,"Hi PF. 

I'm a 23 year old male who is about to graduate college in a few days. I'm moving to a city in Texas with a population of roughly 90K that is about a 40 minute drive to down town Houston if there isn't much traffic. I'm trying to get a roommate from my friend group and from Craigslist and reddit postings and with a roommate my rent would be 400-500 a month.. But it's looking like I might not find a  roommate. In which case my rent will be closer to $725.

The job I just got as a field sales rep pays 29K a year before taxes. I expect to put a lot of miles on my car and the gas compensation isn't enough to cover it. So I'm budgeting as if I will only make 25K a year (Lowballing it on purpose). Assuming I pay $9,000 a year for rent and utilities, how hard will it be to live off 16K?

Living off 16K a year what should a recent college kid know? I'm looking for budgeting tips. And hopefully some reassurance. To be honest my parents have supported me up until now (although I did work at Mcdonalds for over two years) so I'm not sure how expensive just living and covering the bills will be (my auto insurance will probably go up a lot since I drive as part of my job) The only thing my parents will cover is my health insurance for the rest of this year. And my dad is giving me his 2014 car with 44K miles on it as a graduation present. 

I have about $10,000 in cash (my checking account and my Vanguard Federal Money Market account) and the rest of my wealth tied into stocks that I don't want to sell. I was hoping to open a retirement account and start saving but I don't see that being very possible on only 16K. Luckily I have 0 debt.

investing,"A wave of bankruptcies, surging taxes, and Americans harboring lasting scars from coronavirus lockdowns — the head of world’s largest asset manager warns of grim outlook","BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink had a stark message for a private audience: As bad as things have been for corporate America in recent weeks, they’re likely to get worse.

Mass bankruptcies, empty planes, cautious consumers and an increase in the corporate tax rate to as high as 29% were part of a vision Fink sketched out on a call this week. The message from the leader of the world’s biggest asset manager contrasts with the ebullient tones of a stock market that has snapped back from recent lows.


Even among Wall Street luminaries, Fink speaks with particular clout. He has been advising President Donald Trump on how to navigate the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. And BlackRock is playing a key role in the Federal Reserve’s efforts to stabilize markets, helping the central bank buy billions of dollars in assets.

Fink said on the call with clients of a wealth advisory firm that bankers have told him they expect a cascade of bankruptcies to hit the American economy, and he wondered if the Fed needed to do more to provide support, according to a person with knowledge of the remarks.

A BlackRock spokesman declined to comment.

Even as the U.S. is plunged into deepening economic gloom, it will have to raise taxes to pay for emergency efforts to rescue sectors grappling with a difficult recovery, he warned on the call.

Among his predictions: lifting the 21% corporate rate signed into law as part of 2017’s tax overhaul to about 28% or 29% next year, according to the person. Fink also said he sees tax rates for individuals going up.

​Raising taxes would water down the biggest legislative achievement of Trump’s time in office, when he and a Republican-controlled Congress drove through the most significant changes to the tax code in decades.

Lower corporate rates juiced profits and showered cash on shareholders through increased dividends and stock buybacks. Now, at a time when many taxpayers are less able to bear the burden of higher taxes, the government may be forced to extract a larger share of companies’ and individuals’ income.

The spread of the coronavirus, and measures taken to mitigate it, slammed the brakes on the economy. While Trump pushes to reopen commerce and his officials predict a rapid rebound, public health experts and some economists are skeptical the crisis will soon be over.

Politicians, business leaders and economists are beginning to confront the risks of a limited federal response that might speed up the demise of smaller companies and wreck state and municipal finances that pay for schools, law enforcement and infrastructure.

That won’t be the only strain on companies. Many may have to operate with only about half their staff in the office for more than a year, according to Fink. Across white-collar industries, millions are working remotely from home. It would be hard to see a complete return without mass availability of rapid testing, he said.

There’s a risk that the U.S. outbreak will be severe enough to leave a long-lasting impact on the American psyche, undermining Americans’ willingness to take public transport or fly, according to Fink. He said he’s not aware of any of his CEO peers planning international travel this year.

Underscoring the point, this week home-sharing leader Airbnb Inc. and ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies Inc. announced plans for mass layoffs as they wrestle with falling demand and dimmed prospects for the rest of the year.

Read more: Gig Economy Companies Are Facing Twin Crises

Many of the U.S.’s 30 million small businesses have struggled to get the relief they need. If the crisis continues, about 25% of those companies could close permanently before year-end, according to an April report released by Main Street America, a network comprising approximately 300,000 small businesses.

Restaurants that typically operate with thin margins will struggle to survive as they plot out ways to lure back customers with social-distancing measures in place, Fink said.

Fink also said he was concerned the worsening economic duress could further fan the flames of nationalism. The devastating impact from the coronavirus could make it a bigger threat to the global order, he said.

investing,Housing A Risky Investment?,"I know this is outside the purview of options bullshit but it’s an investment that is frequently leveraged up the ass.  3% down and you get 100% of the profit or loss, with favorable margin rates.

Here’s my theory:

A significant component in the rise of housing prices since the 1980s is due to declining interest rates.  The supply is constrained so it’s responsive to the ability of buyers to outbid each other.  Americans are used to the idea of spending 30% or whatever of their household income on their mortgage payment, maybe more.  If interest rates drop but real wages stay the same and the percentage of money spent on housing stays the same, then the principal has to increase.  Which means housing prices go up.

But now we’re pretty much touching against risk adjusted 0% interest rates.  If it was any cheaper the bank might as well be paying you.  The interest rate cannot keep dropping in order to fuel more housing price increase.  So there’s not really any more room for housing prices to boost off low interest rates.  There’s probably still time until they adjust to current rates and an increase when the economy eventually picks up again, but the growth seen over the past three decades is coming to an end.

Also, there’s significant risk if inflation picks up.  If housing and wages both rise in pace with inflation their ratio stays the same, but interest rates will also climb.  This means that buyers must now commit a larger portion of their gross income to P&amp;I payments.  If lenders won’t allow them to do that then the only way to accommodate increased i is by lowering p.  Which means housing has to lose value if that happens.",finance

As we hope cardano can replace the worlds monetary system, how does this work on the block chain? Who holds the purse strings that today are held by the fed in the US? Can governments ever ""print"" money when they don't have it? What does that mean for true adoption of crypto?

Another piece of mmt that interests me is that government creates demand for the currency through taxes.

When we filled out the IRS tool, with as much information as we can (being furloughed and receiving unemployment complicates some of the answers), it tells me I will likely owe $1400 in taxes at the end of the year. I have the desired refund set at zero and it says i will need 1264 witheld from each paycheck, $870 more than my current tax witholding. That seems quite high - last year we received a refund of \~3k and I only had \~$400 withheld in federal taxes from each paycheck(monthly). Also how do I need 1264 withheld from each check, if my current withholding status will result in only owing $1400 during tax time? That math doesn't seem to add up to me.

To further my confusion, when I download the pre filled w4 from the website, it simply has a $0 in column 3. Is that right? I just don't understand what is going on here. If it says I should withhold more, why does it simply put a zero in column 3? why wouldn't it give me a calculation for 4c (extra withholding)?

economy,Our Future - The Hourglass Economy,"Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. We've heard it before. ""They want to eliminate the middle class!"" However, with current federal policies, that's exactly what's going to happen. Here you have the federal reserve printing unlimited QE to keep the markets from falling and helping wealthy CEOs and executives (and let's not forget about our elected officials) from losing any of their wealth. In addition, they've also handed these struggling companies bags of money to hold onto. What do you think these companies are going to do with this money? They're going to use it to invest in autonomous technologies to replace the labor force. So when Joe Potato thinks he's going back to work, he's going to find out that his job has been replaced by a machine. This is a ""capitallist"" system, right? These goods and services are created to generate profit, not out of necessity. Profits will be returned a lot faster if you don't have to pay employees for the service.

For the past month we have been forced to make purchases through major retailers because main street is closed (in some places, it still is). Government is spending trillions of dollars to keep the economy afloat, but leaving small businesses to fight for pennies on the dollar.

I've just finished the Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order game and thought it was really good, a bit short and fairly easy, but pretty enjoyable. Before that I was playing Sekiro but honestly, I just got fed up with how hard it was, I got stuck on lord Genichiro when he's on the rooftop dojo with the lightening and after dying like 50 times I just thought screw it life is too short for this and gave up. 

I'm generally into RPGs, usually fantasy (Witcher3 is my favourite ever game) but would be up for a decent space based RPG as well, but can't be bothered with something that is frustratingly hard. Options I have been thinking of:

1. Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Heard it's very good but very long. Probably looking like most likely option but I've played so many AC games concerned it will be a bit groundhog day but just in ancient Greece.

2. Nioh (probably 2): love the whole Japanese history/folklore thing but don't want to repeat my Sekiro experience and risk smashing up my PS4 cos I'm so frustrated that I'm too shit to make it enjoyable

3. Hellblade Senuas Sacrifice: this looks interesting but a bit weird if I'm honest, not sure it's entirely for me. 

4. Outer Worlds: don't know too much about this game but looks decent and the whole RPG in space thing seems pretty cool, a bit like Mass Effect.

5. Monster Hunter: again don't know too much about these games but they possibly look like my kind of thing

6. Disco Elysium: never really played a game like this but I've heard it's pretty good and quite different

7. Pillars of Eternity: same as 6

8. Banner Saga: same as 6 and 7.

I wanted to refinance my car, since i was advised to do that and i can afford it as is, but it would be a little better paying less. The only thing is my car is a 2007 and the FCU said they dont refinance vehicles older than 5 years. They said i can take a personal loan to pay it off and just pay the personal loan. Tbh that sounds like a good idea so i dont need to have full coverage (im 21), and lower monthly payments (also my interest rate for the vehicle is high like 18% i believe since it is my first financed car).

Thing is, The rep said i dont have a good chance since my credit score is at 590. And i should settle the collections account ($591, medical) and call the FCU in a few months to apply for the personal loan.

Will it raise my score? Does this sound like a good idea?

solarenergy,Covid-19 would considerably boost the renewable sector,"As part of the 2009 US Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act, the U.S. Treasury created Program 1603 to allow grants to revenue-generating renewable energy programs, rather than investment tax credits. As a result, almost 110,000 renewable energy initiatives were dipped into $26 billion.

While the current economic situation could become even uglier than what the country experienced in 2008, some suggest a similar system could be used as a tool for dramatically high rates of solar growth as society returns to post-Covid-19 normality.

Among their numbers is Jim Spano, co-founder of the RadiantREIT real estate investment trust firm Solar Financing.

“I think the lesson learned from the first downturn,” said Spano, referring to 2008, “is that when the public policy takes a concerted interest in climate change, it must find ways to ensure that renewable technologies continue to be created and installed.”

The US solar tax equity funding model – involving borrowers and companies with high tax bills funding projects in exchange for the tax incentives given to them – is likely to evaporate in the current crisis and Spano hopes it will be replaced by an alternative financing model.

“I think we’ll see a lot more debt come into the market, which reduces the need for equity and makes commercially viable ventures,” he said. “Many borrowers will see substantial growth and many market equity investors will move to debt positions because they understand that on the debit side the risk-deviated returns will be higher.”

https://preview.redd.it/y87i7fburdx41.jpg?width=960&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1589bc892a2004d3c9d8a8912b172cf658f24df

The forecast came on the same day that members of the European industry expressed concerns that the whole opposite scenario would occur at their doorstep, with lenders predicted to be increasingly reluctant to take a chance on solar given the ongoing lockout of coronavirus.

Because of the financial mechanisms used to make manageable the capital costs of building projects, Spano argues that the U.S. solar industry is in a unique position to recover quicker, with less long-lasting consequences, than other industries.

## Enhanced

“Americans are eager to get back to work,” the solar investor said. “You’re going to see a fast turnaround, tons of capital looking to be deployed, and the pent-up demand for capital in the renewable industry is what will push the rapid recovery into a robust market.”

If help comes from the federal government – doubtful as this possibility may be under the White House’s current occupant – Spano predicts that new solar technology will arise nationally as states will try to minimize unemployment by creating green jobs initiatives. However, if the funding falls at the state level, the creation of renewables will be biased towards the states that have already set high expectations for renewable energy, because they will try to meet the targets and requirements they set.

“Not all states have embraced a sustainable target of 100 per cent,” Spano said. “Common sense suggests that if a state passes a law calling for 100% renewables and economics will not help \[development\], even with the investment tax credit, the states would have to step in with some sort of incentive to meet their targets … You can not afford to have a law demanding 100% renewables if no renewables are installed.

“I think Covid-19 is going to be a major boost for the renewable industry and I believe we are going to be the sector that generates the jobs and fulfils the priorities of public policy.”

personalfinance,Saving for retirement without access to tax advantaged accounts.,"Im in sort of a unique situation and have a question about the best way to save for retirement if I dont have access to any tax deferred account types because of my status as an american expat. I will soon begin to work as an expatriate software engineer in Japan after coronavirus and plan to stay for the long term.

Originally I thought to just open an IRA before I left and transfer money to this account monthly using a cheap transfer service like transferwise, but after some more research I cant do this after my first year of residency in another country because I will not have taxable income in the US anymore. So I do not qualify for either a 401k or IRA anymore either.

My next thought was to use whatever Japan's equivalent of the 401k/IRA tax deferred account is, which is the NISA (Nippon Individual Savings Account). But unfortunately, even though this account is tax deferred in Japan, the IRS considers this a normal taxable offshore account and will tax capitol gains, defeating the purpose entirely. So Im stuck between a rock and a hard place.

My last option then, would be to just open a taxable brokerage account in the US. My research indicates that vanguard and fidelity are not expat friendly for this purpose, but Interactive brokers is, so my plan is to open an account with them, transfer money to my US bank account monthly, and make regular contributions to target date funds and mutual funds. This would allow the account to grow in USD, and because the SP500 has outperformed the Nikkei225 (Japans equivalent to SP500) historically it seems like a better option then keeping my money in Japan. I would have to pay close attention to the exchange rates though, or dollar cost average. Even though this strategy would be taxed by the US I see some advantage here as over the long term I expect to see some phantom gains because of the currency conversion between the yen and USD. Additionally, Japan's interest rates for mortgages are astronomically low (1-2%!) and housing is cheaper then the area I lived in in the US. Thoughts?",finance

personalfinance,A Case for Young People to Trade on Margin,"Trading on margin gets a really bad rap in this subreddit, but it can be a powerful tool to use in one's investing strategy.

I should preface this post by saying that I'm by no means experienced in investing and that everything I'm saying here is a condensed version of [this paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1149340) in the National Bureau of Economics Research by two professors at Yale. This paper advocates for taking on high margin (i.e. 2x -3x) to invest in market cap weighted ETFs for investors in their 20s and early 30s. People should then decrease their exposure to the market over time by first reducing margin and then incorporating bonds into their portfolio.

**Expected Returns**

It's pretty well understood that trading on margin will yield higher returns on investments. If you can get a margin at a [1-2% interest rate](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=46376&amp;p=m) and the stock market increases by an average of [10% a year](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042415/what-average-annual-return-sp-500.asp), it's pretty clear that investing ETFs on margin leads to positive expected return.

**Volatility**

Normally, increasing your exposure to markets through margin increases your volatility. However, by taking on margin when young, people can get greater time diversification in their portfolio, reducing market risk. Intuitively, investing with no margin makes my total returns disproportionately sensitive to market conditions near retirement, as you have the most money then. Through both historical records and bootstrapped simulations, the paper finds that the worst performing portfolios taken under margin actually outperform the worst performing portfolios without margin.

**Some Caveats**

* This paper assumes that people's incomes either stay the same or increase over time. Generally true, but definitely some exceptions (i.e. athlete, entertainer)
* It also assumes that people will behave rationally and stick with the plan despite losses and margin calls. This is not how humans generally behave and I would expect many people to quit investing after losing everything on a margin call.",finance
economy,This is why you need to go back to work,"There’s a lot of confusion about what’s economically possible, why people need to risk going back to work early, and why pretty much the entire world is in serious trouble right now. People are eager to blame “large corporations”, as always, but, unsurprisingly it is all the government’s fault - for decades of mismanagement, as they’ve continually spent, with the full support of the people, never taking a break to balance budgets or save. 

Consider the following 4 possible scenarios:

**Scenario #1: The economy is bad and interest rates are low**

In this scenario, the Federal Reserve (Fed) or central bank, is out of tools and the economy still isn’t reacting. Businesses are being stimulated already with low interest rates, especially for the financial sector, making it easy for them to borrow. Typically, low interest rates coincide with huge cash injections from the Fed, which also pretty much only benefits Wall Street, so government stimulus needs to be targeted at Main Street. This is where Keynesian stimulation comes in via infrastructure spending, increased social spending, etc.. The government needs to open up their check book and start spending to make sure all of the benefit of cheap credit doesn’t go to Wall Street and large corporations and to speed up the economic recovery without leaving Main Street behind. 

**Scenario #2: The economy is bad and interest rates are high**

This scenario is terrible for businesses and threatens a deep recession. We saw this in the early 80s with a phenomenon called “stagflation”. Interest rates will only be high during a contracting economy when inflation is also high and needs to take monetary policy priority. The fed is out of the picture now and it falls on the government to have room in its budget to stimulate the economy through supply side stimulus, essentially reducing taxes and regulations for businesses so that they can grow and stop the economic contraction.

Contrary to popular belief, “supply side stimulation” does, in fact, “work” in this scenario and is critically necessary because the high interest rates needed to combat inflation affect businesses most acutely. Investors are gone when they can make 15% by putting their money in the bank and valuations are through the floor.  

Yes, the benefit doesn’t “trickle down” very well, and the time to offset this is in scenario #1 when Keynesian stimulus is warranted and necessary. 

**Scenario #3: The economy is good and interest rates are high**

This signals some sort of price inflation that the Fed is trying to slow down. A rare situation that probably won’t last long as the economy will either quickly cool off, or interest rates will have to be eased to prevent a contraction. 

**Scenario #4: The economy is good and interest rates are low**

Short of perfect equilibrium, this is the only scenario left. Now a common rhetoric we hear is that this is the time for governments to borrow and spend because they can do so cheaply. The Trudeau government used this excuse, so did Obama, and Trump didn’t do much to change course. Here’s the problem: the government needs to spend in scenario #1, scenario #2, and scenario #3 doesn’t happen often or for very long, leaving no other time for the government to balance their budgets and get debt on track. So if you’re spending in this step, or arguing that we should be, then you’re tacitly arguing that the government should always be spending more than it has and never have a balanced budget. 

What governments around the world have done is squander this valuable time they had. They spent when they should have saved. They increased debt when they should have decreased it, and they increased social spending when they should have gotten it under control. Every candidate after candidate in modern memory has argued for nothing but further expansions of social spending, with not a single one of them giving a damn about the deficit or deficit spending. This phenomenon was world wide. 

With COVID, we’re now out of this “scenario #4” and in the worst possible scenario #1 - and almost no government has the money in the bank to combat it. The time to act was squandered, over and over again. Governments are broke and have very little ability to help, leaving only the Fed to stimulate the upper echelons of the economy and further increase the wage gap, once again. 

**That’s** why you all need to go back to work. So if you’re one of these people that has been constantly arguing for government spending for the last couple decades, regardless of our economic situation, you need to take a long hard look in the mirror when you’re looking for someone to blame.",finance

Stay safe and stay healthy. Thanks so much for reading!

===========Edit===========

u/MrPopoGod mentioned a very interesting exercise, so I did it and update with the results here.

Basic information: current mortgage balance: $650K with 3.5%. Monthly take-home pay is &gt; 5X of the mortgage payment, so all the difference would go to investments. When doing investment, we assume a 6% annual return.

Scenario I: investing the difference in mortgage payment for retirement, 30 years down the road. Keep 30 years = investing $1500/mo for 30 years. Switch to 15 years = investing $4600ish for the last 15 years. Even with a 2.5% 15-year mortgage, keeping the current load will still result in more retirement savings.

The more interesting one, however, is scenario II: if we would like to change to another house in 5\~8 years, which mortgage will be the best to reduce debt so we are better positioned?

I did a lot of different simulations, but if we switched to a 15-year mortgage with 2.5% interest, by paying $1400 more each year, in 8 years the debt would reduce from $650K to $330K. Instead, if we keep the mortgage and invest the $1400, in 8 years the debt would be at $535K with $173K investment. If we move to another house at that point, we would end up with 10% more debt.

The reason behind the difference? Time in the market I guess :)",finance

I have recently applied for a Sam’s club credit card because we love Sam’s club and the perks were pretty great. This is 4th credit card, the others are consisting of discover, delta sky miles Amex and one from my local credit union. My longest line of credit is about 4 years with my discover card. My FICO credit score fluctuates between 740 and 766. The Sams club credit card is through synchrony bank who uses TransUnion, they assigned me a credit score of 524. With a low of 300 and a high of 620, I’m unable to find what credit score scale they are using, and why my score is not in better standing. Due to this, I have not been given the best interest rate they offer. If anyone can offer some advice or has been in the same situation I would appreciate all the help you can give.",finance
personalfinance,Car payment and interest rate is different than what I signed at the dealer. How is this possible?,"To lead off with my rate is two points lower then what I signed at the dealership which I’m not complaining about. 

But I also have a second question I need an answer too. When I bought the car I opted to get dealer financing cause I saved 1,000 dollars and after 4 months I could refinance. Because of this I was able to only put 10% down even though I had 50%. They also said that I couldn’t put down this extra 40% until after the four months. 

Now that my loan has been assigned to a bank I got the statement today and on it the interest rate is two points lower and along with that the monthly is a bit lower as well. 

My question is as follows. 

1) why is the rate lower than what I initially signed? How could that happen? 
2) do I really need to wait those 4 months to put down my extra 40% or can I just go ahead and put that down now and save a bit on interest?",finance

personalfinance,Am I living way out of my means? I could use some financial advice (with a breakdown on finances),"Hi Reddit,

Wondering if you could take a look at my current financial footprint and give advice on what to do and any advice in general. I don't have much advice from my parents or mentors and looking to get some from all the gurus on here since it seems you guys have your finances in order. I was thinking of talking to a financial advisor once this whole conora virus is over.

Age: 29

Im a Project Manager for a utility energy company (started 2 months ago) but was a PM for 3 years prior to this somewhere else

Income: $110,000 Base Salary , $15,000 Cost of Living adjustment annually and $1,000 month in a car allowance that is taxable. TOTAL= $137,000 gross annually ($93,100 NET in Ca). Excellent benefits

Rent: 3,100 a month and month #7 of a 15 month apartment lease. (San Jose CA) Usually $2100 a month but Finance lost her job. She pays $1000 and would be making about half my income if she were working.Paying the whole thing for now.

Debt:

Car#1: -$11,000 about a $440 dollar car payment a month. On year 3.5 of a 5 year finance. (2016 Mazda Mx-5 Convertible) Low Interest

Credit Card: -$30,444 Over multiple cards something like 7 and I have 3 more paid off with $0 balances. Interest rates vary from 17% to 26%

Student Loans: -$11,000 under my name and about -$16,628 on a parent plus loan that I am paying. All low interest.

No 401k yet but new employer does offer it and ill be eligible in a month.

No Savings whatsoever

Assets:

Car#2 2012 Honda Civic 51,000 miles that is paid and I use to commute to work. (I travel often)

I think I was living beyond my means for a few years while making about $80k in salary prior. I have debt but also a high income now. I don't know if I should downscale or continue my life and pay off debt. I honestly like paying a bit of a premium to live the way I do but at the same time I don't know if im over doing it. Any advice is good advice I'm always game for criticism, its what's gotten me this far. Thank you guys.",finance

personalfinance,"Budgeting for retirement, feeling guilty.","**TL;DR: Feeling guilty about not saving for retirement or paying student loans. Can I ever retire or will my life be paying debts till I die?**

I'm turning 32 this year and I just started a budget at the beginning of May. My budget goal is to start saving for retirement aggressively. 

Last year, I made ~$22,000 gross income. I became eligible for the company 401k with 5% matching and contributed for a few months before stopping due to financial hardships. My current balance is ~$1,000, not including ~$500 from a loan I pay back each paycheck. I restarted contributing 5% this month. My investments are in a target fund.

I'm trying not to project my earnings and finances but I did get a 5% raise starting this month bringing me to $13.65/hr. There is also talk about wages going to $15 by the end of the year. I average 35 hours a week. I'm also starting a part-time job next week, starting at $14.50/hr with an average of 16 hours per month.

I opened a Fidelity Roth IRA and plan to contribute at least $200 a month until April 2021. I plan on investing it in their version of a target fund. I'm loosely following the prime directive so please educate me if I should be focusing my energies on something else.

Step 0: Budget is done, everything is as low as can be. I included my ira contributions and emergency fund in my monthly budget.

Step 1: My emergency fund is $0 but it is now budgeted for every month.

Step 2: Done!

Step 3: This is where I'm unsure. My debts are ~$35,000 federal student loans, in deferment. ~$10,500 auto loan @ 10% apr (literally the best and lowest I've ever had. Cosigned). I pay my auto payment every month. I haven't touched my school debt. It feels so overwhelming and I know it's growing every year I don't pay. I looked at the calculations and I honestly think it's going to take 25 years to pay back!

Should I stay my course with retirement or switch to paying back school loans? If it does take me 10+ years to pay back my student loans will I ever be able to retire? 


P.s. I'm also feeling worried about putting that $200 in retirement every month. I know it's a poverty mindset but now that I know I can save some money every month I want to keep it liquid in case I ever need it!",finance

personalfinance,Help understanding pros and cons of a cash refinance mortgage for my situation,"My wife and I make a combined 175k gross. We have a LTV ratio of 0.66% on our mortgage however we have a 4 year old FHA loan that prevents us from removing mortgage insurance. Our mortgage is ~1200 a month plus $166 in PMI; 4% interest rate. We are grinding out 21k in credit card debt at zero interest; plus student loans and vehicle payments. We also have a baby on the way due October. We have the intention of moving within the next two years. We've been slowly remodeling our house with available cash as we have it, but are considering a cash out refinance to remodel the kitchen. Our actual plan would be a cash-out refinance to pay off the credit cards, and then use the available cash each month to do the kitchen since we are DIY'ing it. The kitchen is the only major house area left and we see this as a viable option for finishing everything up before selling; we're only looking to cash out 25k.

* Should I refinance to get out from under the PMI assuming I intend to move within two years?
* If I refinance, should I cash out 25k?
* I don't have solid numbers but most online calculators show 6-7k in closing costs. Obviously this isn't ideal if moving &lt; 3 years, however I'm currently paying $2k/year in PMI so does this discount make it worth it? Where is the inflection point?",finance
personalfinance,"I accidentally over funded my IRA account, need help on what to do!","1) I am new to IRA so being an idiot newb,

**I accidentally put too much in my 2019 traditional IRA (essentially overfunded) and went over the tax deductible traditional IRA contribution limit.** (the reason is b/c I have a 403 b account as well so I miscalculated my upper limit)

This happened just a few days ago and essentially have no earnings on the over funded amount, it's literally the same money I just placed in initially. I did not invest it in anything. **I still have not filed my 2019 Tax Return yet.**

2)  I was reading on a website that in this situation I should:

**""Withdraw the excess contribution and any income it has earned to avoid the 6% excise tax. You won't owe any additional tax on the contribution you've taken out, but you may owe federal income tax on the earnings and an additional 10% on the earnings if you are under age 59½. State taxes may also apply. ""**

3) This is the part I am confused about:

a) I am just trying to withdraw the excess money I accidentally put in originally a few days ago - there are no earnings. Therefore, I am assuming that I don't have to pay the ""federal income tax on the earnings and an additional 10% on the earnings if you are under age 59½"" as I do not have earnings? **Is this correct?**

b) **Also do I need to fill out the 5329 form  (specifically part 3)** [**https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f5329.pdf**](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f5329.pdf)  **in this situation still?**  My impression was if I submitted my 2019 tax return already with the over-funded amount, I would have to do an amendment to the tax return with a 5329 form. However, I haven't even submitted the my 2019 tax return and received no tax benefit at all with the over funded amount ( so I don't understand what I would be penalized for?). I am trying to solve the problem even before the 2019 tax return is submitted so I can just submit an accurate number with the tax.

I am so overwhelmed and confused about this whole process when I just made a stupid error, and now this is stressing me out. Any helpful advice would be grateful. Thank you.",finance

##Financial markets have got out of whack with the economy. Something has to give

STOCK MARKET HISTORY is packed with drama: the 1929 crash; Black Monday in 1987, when share prices lost 20% in a day; the dotcom mania in 1999. With such precedents, nothing should come as a surprise, but the past eight weeks have been remarkable, nonetheless. A gut-wrenching sell-off in shares has been followed by a delirious rally in America. Between February 19th and March 23rd, the S&amp;P 500 index lost a third of its value. With barely a pause it has since rocketed, recovering more than half its loss. The catalyst was news that the Federal Reserve would buy corporate bonds, helping big firms finance their debts. Investors shifted from panic to optimism without missing a beat.

This rosy view from Wall Street should make you uneasy (see article). It contrasts with markets elsewhere. Shares in Britain and continental Europe, for example, have recovered more sluggishly. And it is a world away from life on Main Street. Even as the lockdown eases in America, the blow to jobs has been savage, with unemployment rising from 4% to about 16%, the highest rate since records began in 1948. While big firms’ shares soar and they get help from the Fed, small businesses are struggling to get cash from Uncle Sam.

Wounds from the financial crisis of 2007-09 are being reopened. “This is the second time we’ve bailed their asses out,” grumbled Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, last month. The battle over who pays for the fiscal burdens of the pandemic is just beginning. On the present trajectory, a backlash against big business is likely.

Start with events in the markets. Much of the improved mood is because of the Fed, which has acted more dramatically than other central banks, buying up assets on an unimagined scale. It is committed to purchasing even more corporate debt, including high-yield “junk” bonds. The market for new issues of corporate bonds, which froze in February, has reopened in spectacular style. Companies have issued $560bn of bonds in the past six weeks, double the normal level. Even beached cruise-line firms have been able to raise cash, albeit at a high price. A cascade of bankruptcies at big firms has been forestalled. The central bank has, in effect, backstopped the cashflow of America Inc. The stockmarket has taken the hint and climbed.

The Fed has little choice—a run on the corporate-bond market would worsen a deep recession. Investors have cheered it on by piling into shares. They have nowhere else good to put their cash. Government-bond yields are barely positive in America. They are negative in Japan and much of Europe. You are guaranteed to lose money by holding them to maturity, and if inflation rises the losses would be painful. So stocks are appealing. By late March prices had fallen by enough to tempt the braver sort. They steeled themselves with the observation that much of the stockmarket’s value is tied to profits that will be made long after the covid-19 slump has given way to recovery.

Tellingly, though, the recent rise in share prices has been uneven. Even before the pandemic the market was lopsided, and it has become more so. Bourses in Britain and continental Europe, chock-full of troubled industries like carmaking, banking and energy, have lagged behind, and there are renewed jitters over the single currency (see article). In America investors have put even more faith in a tiny group of tech darlings—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft—which now make up a fifth of the S&amp;P 500 index. There is little euphoria, just a despairing reach for the handful of businesses judged to be all-weather survivors.

At one level, this makes good sense. Asset managers have to put money to work as best they can. But there is something wrong with how fast stock prices have moved and where they have got back to. American shares are now higher than they were in August. This would seem to imply that commerce and the broader economy can get back to business as usual. There are countless threats to such a prospect, but three stand out.

The first is the risk of an aftershock. It is entirely possible that there will be a second wave of infections. And there are also the consequences of a steep recession to contend with—American GDP is expected to drop by about 10% in the second quarter compared with a year earlier. Many individual bosses hope that ruthless cost-cutting can help protect their margins and pay down the debts accumulated through the furlough. But in aggregate this corporate austerity will depress demand. The likely outcome is a 90% economy, running far below normal levels.

A second hazard to reckon with is fraud. Extended booms tend to encourage shifty behaviour, and the expansion before the covid crash was the longest on record. Years of cheap money and financial engineering mean that accounting shenanigans may now be laid bare. Already there have been two notable scandals in Asia in recent weeks, at Luckin Coffee, a Chinese Starbucks wannabe, and Hin Leong, a Singaporean energy trader that has been hiding giant losses (see article). A big fraud or corporate collapse in America could rock the markets’ confidence, much as the demise of Enron shredded investors’ nerves in 2001 and Lehman Brothers led the stockmarket down in 2008.

The most overlooked risk is of a political backlash. The slump will hurt smaller firms and leave the bigger corporate survivors in a stronger position, increasing the concentration of some industries that was already a problem before the pandemic. A crisis demands sacrifice and will leave behind a big bill. The clamour for payback will only grow louder if big business has hogged more than its share of the subsidies on offer. It is easy to imagine windfall taxes on bailed-out industries, or a sharp reversal of the steady drop in the statutory federal corporate-tax rate, which fell to 21% in 2017 after President Donald Trump’s tax reforms, from a long-term average of well over 30%. Some Democrats want to limit mergers and stop firms returning cash to their owners.

For now, equity investors judge that the Fed has their back. But the mood of the markets can shift suddenly, as an extraordinary couple of months has proved. A one-month bear market scarcely seems enough time to absorb all the possible bad news from the pandemic and the huge uncertainty it has created. This stock market drama has a few more acts yet.■",finance

Bitcoin,"RIP HAL FINNEY ""His last post on a BTC Forum""","I thought I'd write about the last four years, an eventful time for Bitcoin and me.

For those who don't know me, I'm Hal Finney. I got my start in crypto working on an early version of PGP, working closely with Phil Zimmermann. When Phil decided to start PGP Corporation, I was one of the first hires. I would work on PGP until my retirement. At the same time, I got involved with the Cypherpunks. I ran the first cryptographically based anonymous remailer, among other activities.

Fast forward to late 2008 and the announcement of Bitcoin. I've noticed that cryptographic graybeards (I was in my mid 50's) tend to get cynical. I was more idealistic; I have always loved crypto, the mystery and the paradox of it.

When Satoshi announced Bitcoin on the cryptography mailing list, he got a skeptical reception at best. Cryptographers have seen too many grand schemes by clueless noobs. They tend to have a knee jerk reaction.

I was more positive. I had long been interested in cryptographic payment schemes. Plus I was lucky enough to meet and extensively correspond with both Wei Dai and Nick Szabo, generally acknowledged to have created ideas that would be realized with Bitcoin. I had made an attempt to create my own proof of work based currency, called RPOW. So I found Bitcoin facinating.

When Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away. I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test. I carried on an email conversation with Satoshi over the next few days, mostly me reporting bugs and him fixing them.

Today, Satoshi's true identity has become a mystery. But at the time, I thought I was dealing with a young man of Japanese ancestry who was very smart and sincere. I've had the good fortune to know many brilliant people over the course of my life, so I recognize the signs.

After a few days, bitcoin was running pretty stably, so I left it running. Those were the days when difficulty was 1, and you could find blocks with a CPU, not even a GPU. I mined several blocks over the next days. But I turned it off because it made my computer run hot, and the fan noise bothered me. In retrospect, I wish I had kept it up longer, but on the other hand I was extraordinarily lucky to be there at the beginning. It's one of those glass half full half empty things.

The next I heard of Bitcoin was late 2010, when I was surprised to find that it was not only still going, bitcoins actually had monetary value. I dusted off my old wallet, and was relieved to discover that my bitcoins were still there. As the price climbed up to real money, I transferred the coins into an offline wallet, where hopefully they'll be worth something to my heirs.

Speaking of heirs, I got a surprise in 2009, when I was suddenly diagnosed with a fatal disease. I was in the best shape of my life at the start of that year, I'd lost a lot of weight and taken up distance running. I'd run several half marathons, and I was starting to train for a full marathon. I worked my way up to 20+ mile runs, and I thought I was all set. That's when everything went wrong.

My body began to fail. I slurred my speech, lost strength in my hands, and my legs were slow to recover. In August, 2009, I was given the diagnosis of ALS, also called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the famous baseball player who got it.

ALS is a disease that kills moter neurons, which carry signals from the brain to the muscles. It causes first weakness, then gradually increasing paralysis. It is usually fatal in 2 to 5 years. My symptoms were mild at first and I continued to work, but fatigue and voice problems forced me to retire in early 2011. Since then the disease has continued its inexorable progression.

Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube. I operate the computer using a commercial eyetracker system. It also has a speech synthesizer, so this is my voice now. I spend all day in my power wheelchair. I worked up an interface using an arduino so that I can adjust my wheelchair's position using my eyes.

It has been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad. I can still read, listen to music, and watch TV and movies. I recently discovered that I can even write code. It's very slow, probably 50 times slower than I was before. But I still love programming and it gives me goals. Currently I'm working on something Mike Hearn suggested, using the security features of modern processors, designed to support ""Trusted Computing"", to harden Bitcoin wallets. It's almost ready to release. I just have to do the documentation.

And of course the price gyrations of bitcoins are entertaining to me. I have skin in the game. But I came by my bitcoins through luck, with little credit to me. I lived through the crash of 2011. So I've seen it before. Easy come, easy go.

That's my story. I'm pretty lucky overall. Even with the ALS, my life is very satisfying. But my life expectancy is limited. Those discussions about inheriting your bitcoins are of more than academic interest. My bitcoins are stored in our safe deposit box, and my son and daughter are tech savvy. I think they're safe enough. I'm comfortable with my legacy.",cryptocurrency

stocks,The market is perfectly rational.,"So every day, I see posts about how irrational the market is. We keep seeing all of this bad news, and the market keeps going up. The US market is almost back up to all-time highs. How can this be?

For many reasons.

First of all, the market fell 34% in anticipation of this bad news. Now it is pricing in the recovery. When the news comes out is completely irrelevant when we expected that news. I don't think many people will argue that the events we are watching unfold now didn't have the potential to deal a substantial blow to the economy but in the same time, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that they shouldn't sell when everything is pointing towards a quick recovery.

These days it is widely accepted that the economy will grow over time (something that is, in my opinion, completely false), so why would you sell at a 30% loss when you can wait a few years and sell without the loss? Obviously you wouldn't. If nobody is selling at 30% down, the price will go up until somebody starts selling.

Even if we don't see a quick recovery, then this is what we should expect from stocks in the current environment. Interest rates are 0.  That means treasuries and high-grade bonds are an awful place to have your money. Let me explain. If the interest rate is 5%, you would need at least 5% gain from your equities plus some risk premium. Which effectively put a cap on the price of most none growth stocks at a PE of 20.

When interest rates are 0, that cap is gone, and large, financially stable corporations essentially become the only place to get a relatively safe yield. This way, their relative value approach infinity (literally) as it is now worth it to buy stocks at positive any return.

If you look at the distribution of money in the stock market, they have been shifted into mega-cap stocks and a few other very safe consumer goods stocks. Which is what is pulling the market up. Look at mall cap stocks. They barely recovered anything at all.

Finally, the US doesn't exist in some sort of vacuum separated from the rest of the world. Europa has not recovered. EM has not recovered. Where do you think all of this money went? The US is your answer, not only do they have the biggest and strongest corporations, but they also have the reserve currency, which means they can do the most stimulus and have the highest chance of a quick recovery.

So now that you understand that the market is, in fact, perfectly rational and acts the exact way we would expect, can we please stop it with all those ""this doesn't make sense"" type of threads? Pretty please?",finance
personalfinance,Does an HSA Health plan make sense for me?,"It's open enrollment season and I'm considering changing my health insurance plans. (USA)

For some context, I'm a 29 year old male living in NYC with no serious health issues (knock on wood). I am planning on getting LASIK eye surgery this year and that will cost $5500. I just recently learned that I can pay for this through an HSA, meaning I can pay with pre tax money. I've got a couple questions:

1. If I pay for LASIK with my HSA am I essentially saving an amount of money equal to my effective tax rate? For instance, if my total tax rate after federal, state, and city taxes is \~45% would I be saving 45% on my LASIK surgery by paying through the HSA?
2. On the benefits sheet is says my company will pay $41.66 into my HSA for an individual (which I am). What does this mean? Does this mean they will pay $41.66 into the HSA monthly? What if I don't end up spending that money? Does this count towards the yearly limit that you can contribute into an HSA?
3. It looks like the limit for an HSA is $3550. If my LASIK is $5500 can I split the payment over two years? Or if the $3550 yearly limit does not include employer contributions than I should be able to get the $5500 in a year.

For all my life I've been on a more traditional health insurance plan where you just have a copay and deductible so this HSA stuff is confusing to me. Any help is appreciated! This whole idea came to me when I realized I could pay for my LASIK through an HSA and save \~45% (or whatever my effective tax rate is) so if I'm totally off base with that idea than maybe I should just stick with what I've got.",finance

My question: even with a strong recovery around second half of 2020, is an economic downturn (and the eventual downward pressure on the stock market) inevitable given the stage we are currently in? A good number of people have mentioned that corporate debt and commercial mortgages are the next big things that'll come home to roost. To me, it kinda makes sense and I wonder if Covid recovery can really stop these forces and sustainably push the markets to new all-time highs in 2020 - especially with the Fed freshly out of interest rate cuts and printing money like a Charmin' factory doing a mountain of cocaine.

For the bulls and bears, what is your upside and downside thesis?  As you can tell, I'm a bit bearish at the moment and as such, am more curious about the bull thesis, just in case I have a substantial blindspot that's unbeknownst to me.

investing,New York City CMBS Delinquencies Rise on $7 Billion of Loans,"By Natalie Wong

(Bloomberg) -- New York City’s shutdown is pressuring loans
tied to commercial real estate, with retail and hotels hit the
hardest.
April payments were late on about $7 billion of commercial
mortgage-backed securities debt backed by properties in the
city, more than double the amount a year earlier, according to
data firm Trepp.
About $740 million of those loans are considered
delinquent, meaning at least 30 days behind. Retail and lodging
debt, the sectors with the highest percentage of delinquencies,
accounted for 41% and 19% of the total.
Stay-at-home orders have crushed business at stores,
restaurants and hotels in New York, the center of the
coronavirus pandemic in the U.S. Owners of these properties --
including hotels in Times Square and shops on Fifth Avenue --
are struggling to pay mortgages as their rent collections fall.
The rate of delinquencies could grow if borrowers continue
to skip payments in May, which is likely given the shutdown’s
impact on the economy.
Some landlords are working out payment arrangements with
their lenders, but options are limited. Special servicers, firms
assigned to handle vulnerable CMBS loans on behalf of
bondholders, are too short-staffed to manage the sudden surge of
defaults and modification requests, said Justin Piasecki, a
principal at brokerage Avison Young.

personalfinance,Is It Worth Consolidating and Paying off Student/Car Loans Now?,"Preface this by saying I'm a 24M, junior with about a year left in school.

personalfinance,Student Loans: a cautionary tale in today's environment,"I got into my dream school with a decent scholarship a couple weeks after the stock market crashed in 2008. My parents had saved diligently for myself and my twin sister in a 529 account, but we saw that get cut in half overnight. Despite all that, my mom told me to pick the school that would work best for me and to not worry about the cost because ""we'd figure out a way to make it work"". I applied for hundreds of external scholarships, but didn't get any. So, I chose my expensive private dream school, signed my life away to Sallie Mae (the solution to pay for it after my savings was exhausted, which I didn't know in advance), and started college in fall of 2009. 

I was lucky to graduate with a good job thanks to the school's incredible co-op program, but also saddled with $120k worth of loans ($30k federal, the rest private). I met my amazing husband while there, and he was in the same boat. Together, we make a pretty decent living, but we currently owe more on our student loans than we do on our house. Even paying an extra $1k/month (our breakeven with our budget), it'll still take us many years to pay them off. It's so incredibly frustrating watching our friends from school (most of whom don't have loans) be able to live their lives the way they want while we continue to be slaves to our loans for the foreseeable future. No switching jobs because we want a new career, that doesn't pay enough. No moving to a different city, can't afford the hit to the salary in cheaper areas, or the huge cost of living increase in more expensive ones. 

I'm happy with my life and that I was able to have the experiences I did (I absolutely loved my school), but not a day goes by that I don't wonder how my life would have been different if I'd made better financial decisions. Parents, don't tell your kids to follow their hearts if the only way there is through massive student loans, particularly if their career will not let them have any hope of paying them off. Students, have those conversations with your parents. If they say don't worry about it, question what that means and what the plan is. Now is the time to be having those discussions, before you've already registered for classes and are looking to pay that first bill. Don't make the same mistakes we did.

For all the parents and high school students reading this, please take some time to go through the comments and see how many people this truly affects.

Trading,Can't get myself to pull the trigger,"For the past 4 years I've been trying to become a trader. First I was just buying the dip in stocks after earnings, if the particular company was solid. The logic was that looking at the chart back then, the market doesn't go down by much, and the stock will eventually go back up. If it dipped even further I simply waited it out. I typically closed the position after a 10% gain. I always went all in. I scored some great gains this way.

However December 2018 scarred me deeply. Desperate to make money that month I bought a dip, even though I didn't believe fully in the company and the chart wasn't very convincing either. At the end of December I closed my position, erasing all my year's gains, to protect my principal. A few hours later Powell announced that he changed his mind about the interest rates, the market started to rebound, and in a few weeks my closed position would break even. 

That's when I realized I know nothing, and I suck. I was just being lucky the whole time.

The whole last year I was scared to get into any position. It didn't help that I started following Sven Henrich. I spent the whole year staring at charts stressed to take any action. I made very little money last year. 

This year, yet again I got in although I wasn't completely convinced it was a good idea, but I felt pressure to make money. A few days later, the coronavirus news started to get louder, and eventually it came here and the market collapsed. I was down almost 40% at one point on my position. 

Nevertheless I didn't take the loss and now I'm back at the same level and in cash as I was at the beginning of the year.

Now, I'm trying to do some trades (this time with options, as they require much less capital) but even if I'm prepared to trade with much smaller positions, I just can't get myself to pull the trigger. Just like last year I just keep staring at charts for days. 

If lets say I want to buy calls on QQQ , which is logical given the market rebounding, I start questioning whether it's not too high, whether I shouldn't wait for a dip, and I end up missing out on great moves. I stare at the chart going up and down all day, and can't formulate any solid justification for myself why should the price go one way or another, and so I keep staring at it all day long paralyzed to take any action. 

Selling cash covered puts in this environment, when we have an unpreceded shutdown of whole economies, seems super risky, as a downturn may come any day.

So with the current coronavirus situation going on right now, my husband is in an interesting spot where we can make a withdrawal from his 401k account without having to pay it back (typically, it would be a loan, and it would need to be paid back in three years). We took a withdrawal early on so we could pay off some debts and be comfortable in the case of him losing his job. 

Today, one of our friends pointed out that we could withdraw enough from my husband's 401k in order to pay off our mortgage. We have about $69,000 left of a 30 year loan (started in 2008). The interest on the loan is 6.375%. 

We have VERY little knowledge in this area, so I am really not sure if this is a good idea or not... I know we'd have to pay the extra tax for the early withdrawal. Plus, my husband wouldn't be earning as much interest on his 401k, thus making retirement far away. Are there other factors we should be considering?


EDIT: Thanks so much for all your answers! They're super helpful! I didn't think it was a good idea, but didn't really have the knowledge to explain why it was a bad idea.

background:

26 yr old male, BS in Economics from USNA, 4 years in the Navy as Supply corps officer, getting medically separated from the Navy, just accepted a job offer at CACI as mid-level logistics manager for 90K with 5K signing bonus. 100% medical coverage by VA.



**Immediate goal**: settle into my new job in DC, gain experience/kick ass, get promoted to increase my income. May look into transferring jobs within 3 years if opportunity arises. Get an
MBA – just got accepted into University of Arizona online MBA. (If anyone has any opinions about online MBAs I’d love to hear it… ive heard that MBA can be just a check in the box for
negotiating a higher salary and I believe it to be true in most cases).

**Long term**: Save enough to put a decent down payment on a property in Northern VA (typically $400K-$500K range) to househack and create passive income. ex: my parents renovated their basement in their townhome so that they can rent out the basement which covers 80% of their total mortgage. I’d love to do something similar and have the renters pay for my mortgage
while living there. Eventually, I’d want to pull equity out to find another place as an investment property. I would use VA loan with no funding fee and pay no property tax due to my VA
disability rating but I just want to maximize my passive income.


**Financial picture:**
Total current savings
ALLY high yield savings: $20K
TSP: $31K
Vanguard mutual fund: $12.5K
ROTH: $14.3K
Medical separation paycheck (one time tax free lump sum): $58K
Income
Monthly income from CACI after federal/state/SS/FICA/medicare tax: $5307.40
Monthly VA disability pay: $2.5K (tax free)
**TOTAL INCOME**: $7787


**Monthly Expenses:**
$165 phone bill for entire family
$1200 rent/utilities (Staying with the parents in NOVA during the pandemic; will most likely aim
for the same price range for rent when I decide to move closer to DC)
$300 groceries (I eat a lot… 6’2’’ 215lbs and very active)
$130 auto/renters/life insurance
$150 for gas
$300 eating out/leisure
$50 haircut
$150 clothes
$200 etc/buffer
**TOTAL EXPENSE: $2600**

**Monthly Allocations/investments:**
ALLY high yield savings: $1200
VA Life insurance: $35.00 for $40K coverage
Vanguard Roth: $500
Vanguard mutual fund: $500
CACI 401K (50% match up to 4%): $375 (90,000*0.08/12 to find monthly allocation)
TOTAL ALLOCATION/INVESTMENTS: $2610

**Money left over: $2732.40**

So clearly that’s a lot of money left that I can put towards savings for a down payment. But do
you recommend spreading it out among my other allocations/investments? I could also use
that to fund my MBA personally instead of using tuition assistance from CACI since it’ll probably
incur more years of working there. I’d love to hear your opinions and your strategy.",finance

I've been considering putting my monthly student loan payment into a Roth IRA for the next several months. All my student loan payments are federal, which means that due to Covid-19 they were automatically deferred with a 0% interest rate for the next several months.

Since Roth IRAs allow you to withdraw your contributions without penalty, I would like to put the payments I was making into it, then withdraw the contributions to make a lump sum payment once the loans become due again - and ideally keep the gains.

I have a strong emergency fund and a secure job, and would probably not be able to hit the $6k contribution cap this year anyway. With the emergency fund I'd be able to cover any potential losses that occur without issue.

personalfinance,Student Loan Refinancing: My Experience,"I graduated from a state school with around 85k student loan debt. 30k in federal, the rest in private through a multiple Sallie Mae loans.
These were pretty high interest between 7-10%. My federal loans averaged to 4.5% so they weren't a priority to refinance, plus the benefits from being federally backed(I.e covid relief).

Sallie Mae had decent customer service, it was easy, and possible, to get on an income-based repayment plan. When I was able to I refinance/combined those loans with Laurel Road/Mohela. Again no complaints with their customer service and I was able to decrease my average interest from 8.75% to 6.98% so big savings. Auto-pay worked fine and any overpayments were applied directly to the principal.
With the effects of Covid, I looked into dropping my interest rate futher. I ended finding Penfed using Purefy, they offered an interest rate of 5%. Which would come up to around 20k+ savings in interest with my payment amounts. However, there was an annoying catch that involved their customer service.
To have the overpayments applied to the principal, I have to call the day of payment. This will lead me to calling PenFed customer service a total of 390 times on a accelerated bi-weekly payment plan.  While the savings is enough to warrant this inconvenience, with less savings to be had I would definitely reconsider, and I'm even thinking about refinancing it again in the near future.",finance
personalfinance,Can a home builder prevent me from applying for an MCC?,"My husband and I are under contract with a Home Builder for a new home in Texas, and they've partnered with Loan Depot to provide lending. We qualify for a zero-down USDA loan, locked already at 3.5%, and it's all currently in underwriting. I really want to apply for a MCC Tax Credit, as I'm very certain we qualify, we have very low risk of eventual recapture tax being owed, I've thoroughly researched it and am extremely confident I understand what it is and how it works, and I'm not one to leave money on the table. When I asked the sales rep of the Home Builder about it, she said ""they don't do those,"" and gave a canned explanation that didn't make sense.

I then spoke to the loan officer of Loan Depot who works directly with the Home Builder, and asked her about the MCC. She said that Loan Depot as a whole and she herself is an approved lender for the MCC program, and she agreed the MCC is a very beneficial program, but she didn't want to disrespect Home Builder's policy of no MCCs.

Can Home Builder prevent me from applying? I don't see how they could. I respect that the lender doesn't want to get in trouble with the Builder she's contracted for, but I don't see how I'm being prevented from applying for a federal tax credit I'm almost certainly eligible for by the company I happen to be purchasing from.

investing,The problems with tech stocks,"OK. I am a bear for now simply because the economy is in the toilet and won't be back for a while (think 3 years). The S&amp;P 500 is down 13.7% from all time highs and the NASDAQ is down 9.27%--not even a ""correction"" anymore. There is no way that a bear market lasts 23 trading days when companies are laying off workers by the tens of millions in a country with 165 million working people, in addition to oil companies and retailers going bankrupt left and right.

The problem, of course, is that Facebook, Amazon and Google don't pay a dividend. Meanwhile, Microsoft and Apple pay a meagre 1.x % dividend. Why is this important? Retirees have the most money and are most likely to influence the markets with their money, not some random 25 year olds just starting out.

Retirees need a regular source of income, and dividends are one way to get it. Yes, you see the stocks go up, but in order for you to get money out of it, you have to sell. When you sell, that part of your money is no longer participating in the stock market.

So, if you want income and stay in the market, you need something that has reasonable dividends (3-5%) and have enough profits to be able to afford paying them for the long term. You don't want high yield (10-15%) because these are probably going bust or their dividends are going to get cut soon (especially if the high yield is the result of the stock plunging 75% due to problems with the company).

Oh, by the way, debt is exploding at a terrifying speed (think of all kinds of fiscal stimulus paid by all countries to their residents, citizens and corporations). Oh and what about household debt that has been built up post-2008? The US fiscal stimulus can't last more than a few months and when everything reopens, there will be too many people chasing too few jobs, putting downward pressure on wages. Exploding debt + collapsing economic activity = very very slow growth going forward (You complained about how US GDP growth sucked post-GFC? Think about how much lower growth will be post-COVID!) Lower growth potential means lower P/E ratios, which basically means substantially lower prices for stocks in the face of collapsing future earnings.

If the stock market is right, and that 100X P/E for Amazon is justified, then eventually, Walmart, Target, Costco, etc... will all go out of business and the market share will get eaten by Amazon. If that kind of consolidation is actually to happen, we will see the end of capitalism because competition will no longer exist. Prices will rise to whatever the market will bear, and holders of specific assets (namely stocks of Amazon or similar monopolies) will be quadrillionaires while the rest of the world will be incapable of saving money due to, for instance, a loaf of bread that normally costs $2 becomes $20. Money will become pointless other than for the purposes of the masses enriching the 0.01%. The days of a frugal person living on $10 000 a year on a $50 000 salary will be over as that hypothetical person's spending becomes $30 000 and basically can't save anything after taxes. Standard of living for the masses in rich countries will drop to third-world levels while third world residents will starve like they do in Venezuela.

Further to that, if someone who is single, childless and makes $50 000 can barely survive, and there are about 50% of people who make less than that. This will mean that the masses will stop having kids and when they get old, population aging will cause governments to go bust because of healthcare costs--not to mention that pensions cannot survive in negative interest rate environments that last for decades. Soverign defaults will sweep the globe and that is how humanity ends.

This is a rant about how, taken to the logical extreme of what message the stock market is trying to send, is anything but good. The stock market is trying to say that, because of reduced competition, prices will soar, and as a result, the middle class craters into abject poverty and the world becomes less and less sustainable and stable and societal collapse is the only logical conclusion.",finance

investing,The new age of Monetary Policy: an in-depth analysis of Federal Reserve Policy in the 2008 and 2020 financial crises,"**The Evolution of Monetary Policy: Age of the Bailout**

In the years leading up to 2008 Wall Street had been celebrating massive gains; top finance executives were awarded up to $53 billion dollars in total compensation in 2007. Lloyd Blankfein, former CEO of Goldman Sachs, made $68 million himself. These profits were the result of financial innovations and financial derivatives, specifically mortgage backed securities (MBS). A mortgage backed security is an asset backed security which is secured by a collection of mortgages. The mortgages are aggregated and securitized so that investors can buy them and receive periodic payments similar to a bond’s coupon payment. Mortgage backed securities were doing so well in the years leading up to 2008 that lenders were running out of people with good credit to lend to. Everyone was buying and building houses so much so that the real estate market became a bubble and all the prices inflated.

At first everyone was celebrating the gains in housing prices, since price increases generally meant profits for home investors, mortgage brokers, and even big banks. Not too long after the party, the real estate bubble burst. Everyone was immediately impacted; mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were on the verge of bankruptcy. Some of the biggest investment banks in the world, each having upwards of $10 trillion assets under management, such as Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Merrill Lynch were about to collapse. The whole financial sector was in shambles. “In a period of 18 months, Wall Street had gone from celebrating its most profitable age to finding itself on the brink of an epochal devastation.” Banks were heavily involved with mortgage securities. Most of these securities were financial derivatives which means they derive their price from an underlying asset. “Banks were creating increasingly complex products, many levels removed from the underlying asset.”

The first bank to really be shallow waters was Bear Stearns. Bear Stearns was a global investment bank whose main area of business was capital markets, wealth management, and investment banking. In 2008 Bear Stearns had roughly $13 trillion in derivative financial instruments, $2 trillion of which were in options and futures contracts. The company had a highly leveraged balance sheet with a lot of illiquid assets that were potentially worthless. Bear Stearns was the seventh largest securities firm in the world. Since their business was highly intertwined with other huge financial institutions, their potential collapse would be detrimental for the global economy.

U.S. Treasury secretary Hank Paulson knew that if Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers collapsed there would be a domino effect across the financial sector and other huge financial institutions such as Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, and others would fail while consumers would start to lose confidence in the banking sector, more banks would be subject to bank-runs. In order to prevent the worst from occurring the U.S. Treasury Secretary put together a task force which included Jamie Dimon, CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase, Ben Bernake, Chairmen of the United States Federal Reserve, and Tim Geithner, Head of the New York Fed. After pondering possible loans and other solutions in order to rescue Bear Stearns, they deemed that there was no way to save Bear Stearns. This is not because of insufficient capital but because confidence had been lost in Bear Stearns. J.P. Morgan Chase ended up acquiring Bear Stearns for $10 a share, much less than their 52 week high of $133 per share.

After Bear Stearns fell the next bank about to collapse was Lehman Brothers. Lehman Brothers was the fourth largest investment bank in the United States. Its CEO at the time Richard Fuld blamed the declining stock price on short sellers. However the short sellers argued that the way Lehman viewed non-liquid assets such as mortgages was disturbing. Fuld refused to accept that the bank essentially had a bunch of junk mortgage backed securities on their balance sheets and tried to solve Lehman’s liquidity problem with more cash. He reached out to Warren Buffett to try and secure a loan, but Buffett said it was too risky. Richard even reached out to the U.S. government for a bailout, but Treasury Secretary at the time Henry Paulson refused to bail out Lehman with public tax payer money and instead said that the bank must secure funding from the private sector. Paulson gathered all the CEO’s of major banks and told them to come up with a solution for saving Lehman Brothers. Likely contenders to buy out Lehman Brothers were Bank of America and British bank, Barclays. However neither of which were willing to take on the Lehman’s real estate assets which were basically worth half of what Lehman was valuing them at. After failing to secure capital, or merge with another bank Lehman Brothers filed for chapter eleven bankruptcy protection on September 15th, 2008. Chapter eleven bankruptcy protected some creditors and most employees. In the bankruptcy agreement, Lehman Brothers’ shareholders paid the ultimate price and watched their fortunes from a year prior be worth a fraction of what they were.

At the same time Lehman Brothers was crashing, insurance giant American International Group (AIG) and mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were tumbling down cliffs of their own. James Lockhart, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) issued a plan to make the two mortgage giants into a conservatorship as government sponsored enterprises. The two mortgage companies were now and still are U.S. government enterprises who facilitate the secondary mortgage market. The United States Treasury Secretary, Hank Paulson, as well as Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke, both agreed with the housing agency's decision.

On the other hand, AIG executives were assuring everyone that the company was in sound financial standing. At the time, AIG had $1 trillion in assets and roughly $40 billion in cash. In addition, executives argued that they had an extremely profitable business supporting insurance on collateral debt obligations (CDO). A CDO is a financial tool that banks use to package individual homeowners, credit card, and auto loans into securities sold to investors on the market. CDOs at the time were mainly used to refinance mortgage backed securities.. Most of AIG’s business was traditional insurance products such as health, life, and home insurance. However during the real estate bubble the company began taking a lot of risks in the form of credit default swaps (CDS). A CDS is a financial exchange agreement where the issuer of the CDS will compensate the buyer if the buyer’s asset defaults (similar to investment insurance). Essentially investors were buying credit default swaps as insurance for their mortgage backed securities. Once the real estate bubble popped, everyone came to claim insurance for their MBS that just went bankrupt. AIG had over $500 billion in subprime mortgages on their balance sheet. Its officials were revaluing credit default swaps and losses started to pile up at AIG. By May of 2008 AIG had suffered a first quarter loss of roughly $8 billion, their largest loss ever. Hank Paulson knew that if AIG went bankrupt it would trigger the collapse of financial institutions that bought these credit default swaps.

As the MBS tied to the swaps defaulted, AIG was forced to come up with the capital to repay their investors. Shareholders started dumping their shares which made it even more difficult for AIG to produce the capital it needed. Even though they had the assets on their balance sheet to cover the losses, AIG could not liquidate them fast enough before the swaps were due. It was clear that they were about to go bankrupt. Hank Paulson and Ben Bernanke did not want AIG’s huge influence to hurt lower and middle class families since AIG sold lots bonds, annuities, and insurance products to these people. An AIG bankruptcy would’ve hurt lower and middle class families as well as the whole financial sector which owned credit default swaps issued by AIG. They were just too big to fail. So the Federal Reserve along with the U.S. Treasury planned a bailout of an $85 billion loan to AIG. To put that loan amount into perspective, “Eighty-five billion dollars was more than the annual budget of Singapore and Taiwan combined; who could understand a figure that size.”

The loan itself was not enough to calm the markets. Investors were left puzzled as to why the federal government would bailout one company and not the other. What were the rules for a bailout? Did Hank Paulson’s background as a top executive at Goldman Sachs have anything to do with the government allowing Lehman Brothers, a competitor of Goldman, to collapse? These questions forced Hank Paulson, Ben Bernanke, and Tim Geithner, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, to come up with a solution to calm confusion. Now with the whole financial sector on the verge of collapsing the Treasury and Federal Reserve came up with a fiscal policy to purchase toxic assets from nine of the largest financial institutions in order to stabilize them. The institutions include J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Bank of New York Mellon, Merrill Lynch, Bank of America, and State Street Corp. The program to bail them out was known as TARP. However congress was not too attached to the idea of bailing out Wall Street. Republicans saw a bailout as socialism creeping into the United States, and Democrats saw it as Paulson bailing out his Wall Street buddies. Congress voted against TARP and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell roughly 800 points that day.

Paulson, Bernanke, and Geithner went back to the drawing board. Now desperate for a solution Paulson decided to follow the advice of his assistant Neel Kashkari, which was to purchase equity in the nine largest banks in the United States. Paulson reached out to Sheila Bair who was the head of the Federal Depositors Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and told her about the Treasury Department’s new plan. Sheila agreed to increase the nine bank’s coverage limit.

Without wasting any time Hank Paulson, Treasury Secretary of the United States, called all the nine executives together for a meeting at the NY Federal Reserve. “It was the first time - perhaps the only time - that the nine most powerful CEOs in American Finance and the people who regulate them would be in the same room at the same time.” Without knowing what the meeting was about, the CEO’s of all nine banks had shown up. To stress the severity and seriousness of the meeting, Paulson had brought along with him the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the president of the NY Fed, and The head of the FDIC. Paulson unveiled his plan to purchase up to $250 million in preferred stock in the leading banks in order to stabilize them and restore confidence. He strong armed all of them into taking the deal even though a few of them claim that they did not need the capital, such as Wells Fargo and J.P. Morgan. He also informed the banks that the collapse of Lehman Brothers will spillover into other banks, Merrill Lynch was of most concern. Paulson agreed to let Merrill get bought out by Bank of America in order to save them. They were sold to Bank of America for $29 per share or $50 billion far from their 52 week high of $88 per share. The banks had agreed to the deal and so did Congress on October 3rd, 2008 President George Bush signed the TARP program into law. The program normalized the big banks and brought back investor confidence in Wall Street.

The following year, President Barack Obama introduced legislation that would transform the whole financial regulatory system. This act was known as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. One specific provision known as the Volker rule forbids banks from making speculative investments that do not benefit their consumers. This type of overhaul has not been seen in the U.S. financial system since the Great Depression of 1929. In regards to the subprime mortgage crisis, the United States’ Congress, Treasury, and Federal Reserve acted appropriately however they should have acted more quickly and effectively like Jerome Powell’s Federal Reserve has during the COVID-19 crisis.

Some say because of the catastrophe in 2008 and the lessons we have learned, the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve acted the way they did in 2020. Thus far, they both have combated the current financial market crisis with immediate action. If the Federal Reserve and Treasury could’ve bailed out Bear Stearns, Lehman, AIG, and Merrill Lynch the way that they bailed out Boeing, that would have been the best case scenario. In March of 2020 Boeing Co. the airplane manufacturer went to Washington with its hands out begging for a bailout. The company had spent $50 billion on stock repurchases within the past year and now was asking for a $60 billion bailout. Instead of giving the company a direct handout, the Federal Reserve boosted liquidity in the credit markets by purchasing corporate bonds, thus, Boeing was able to secure $25 billion from private investors via the corporate bond market and withdrew its original request for a government bailout. Despite the 33 million unemployed, many people are applauding Jerome Powell and Steven Mnuchin for quickly passing emergency monetary policy measures. Like 2008, these policy measures have insulated the financial markets from total ruin.

I'm 27 and was furloughed from my part-time retail job due to coronavirus. I have a 401k from the retail job with a small balance of $4,000 in it and I'm interested in cashing it out since there is no 10% penalty, I'm aware I owe taxes on it though.

personalfinance,Yet another tax refund question,"I filed my taxes through Turbo Tax on April 3rd. The federal government kicked back my documents for review through TT. That night I corrected these errors and resubmitted, and according to TT it was accepted that same day (April 3rd, 2020). As I don't use a bank (I rely on my paycard from my work), I opted for a paper check in the mail. 3 weeks go by, and on the 24th TT tells me my refund was supposed to arrive that day (I'm not sure if that means it was \*sent\* that day or if it was supposed to be in my mailbox that day). I give it a couple days, and find the IRS ""get refund status"" and ""check economic impact payment status"" services (as my stimulus check hadn't arrived, either). I changed states late January 2020, so while it didn't impact my 2019 returns, I \*did\* clarify my new address.  


I've checked each every single day since the 24th and according to the IRS, ""Your tax return is still being processed"" while the stimulus check ""couldn't determine \[my\] eligibility at this time"". I know for a fact I'm eligible for the $1200 stimulus check. I tried calling them and discovered they aren't even taking phone calls. It's been 6 weeks since I filed and 2 weeks since I expected my refund. I tried checking my refund by changing the total refund amount and the website recognized I had a different number and asked me to double check (verifying that it \*knows\* what documents I submitted).  


What do I even do? Do I just sit here and wait patiently? I know the IRS straight-up refuses to handle its paper returns right now, but I e-filed, so does that impact my payment? Why is TT saying my refund was accepted while the IRS is still reviewing it? Should I be worried the IRS will keep reviewing my refund past the deadline?

business,US National Bank Idea,"This is sort of an idea at least for the government. 

There have been talks off over the years for the US Postal Service to provide banking that would offer retail banking services but never went anywhere.

The idea is: People can own bank  accounts and do regular banking similar to any other bank. Other countries such as Japan, Israel, and France offers retail banking through their postal systems. Even North Dakota has their own state-owned bank. At some point the US postal service offered retail banking but it was discontinued due to the growth of regular banks. 

With the decline of brick and mortar banks due to online banking, the USPS already has the infrastructure in place. It also provide more convenience because people go there anyway to get money orders, sending, and pickup parcels. It also seems like a good idea especially for baby boomers and the elderly since they may prefer to still do their banking in person. In addition given the the USPS have been operating in the red due to FedEx, UPS, DHL, it will be able to provide additional revenue stream.

Ideally I would like to pay the credit card debt off first then focus on the student loans. I pay the mortgage on the first of each month. I was thinking she pays $1k towards debt on the first half (01-15) of the month and I pay $1k towards the end (16-31) of the month. I get paid on the 1st and 15th but I'm not sure when she'll get paid as she is currently in search for a job. She had an interview today and if she gets that job she'll be making about $35k. I get a pay raise in June so I'll make roughly $4,500 a month and this is after taxes, TSP contribution and whatever other deductions. As far as budget I don't have one yet as we got married in January and I left in February and she was still in school several states away. Concerning bills and living expenses, we could live off of $1000-$1200. I'm basing this off of last summer when we lived together. Couple questions

&amp;#x200B;

1. Should we get a debt consolidation loan? Most of the student loans are in small amounts that add up and I was thinking seeing small loans getting paid off would feel good
2. Should I reduce my mortgage payments? I'm only looking to own sooner than 30 years and turn it into a rental because military town
3. I was thinking to keep saving now, make minimum payments on the debt, and once I return and she has a job go full in on paying it down. Bad idea or what? Since we're not together right now I'd like to build our savings and it stings a bit to pay down debt that isn't mine but such is marriage
4. Not sure how to currently manage the credit cards and the subsidized loans as those are currently incurring interest. What's the best method to handle that?

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately I'm just in search of advice on the best way to attack the situation. I know you would likely be able to better help me if I had greater specifics such as her pay and our budget but that is not information I can provide right now. I'm looking to get ahead of this problem and build some advice before the problem gets worse. I'm looking to pay these back as quickly and with the least amount of interest incurred as possible.",finance
financialindependence,Figuring Black Swan's into your FIRE,"Not that this is news, but in Barron's this week there is an article about FIRE'ers both present and future. (link: [https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-coronavirus-crisis-has-tested-the-retire-early-movement-but-its-followers-are-unbowed-and-its-winning-new-fans-51588941001?mod=past\_editions](https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-coronavirus-crisis-has-tested-the-retire-early-movement-but-its-followers-are-unbowed-and-its-winning-new-fans-51588941001?mod=past_editions))

While I'm critical of FIRE and believe that it can mislead adherents into a false sense of security (if not implemented correctly), this article seemed to me to paint a fair picture of the careful and considerate implementation of the FIRE philosophy.

One of the pretenses of FIRE is that a person can compress a life's work into a couple decades and sail off into the sunset.  Not so. Too many uncertainties--including terrorism, a housing market crash, COVID; even unforeseen terminal illness or an early death--make FIRE a risky proposition... at least as risky as planning to work until a traditional retirement age while saving a moderate amount.  In that case, a generous emergency fund in addition to assets that can be leveraged in times of crisis (e.g. equity-based, low interest rate LOC, real estate, small business assets, etc.), and living below one's means seems just as good a plan as FIRE.

TL;DR: A FIRE plan should include a long-term bear market or Black Swan event (e.g. housing market crash, COVID, unforeseen debilitating illness), and strategies and assets to endure such hardships (gold bullion / real estate anyone?). If you were planning on FIRE, you might have to wait until the economy is back on its feet.",finance

personalfinance,Should I take over an auto loan that was taken out by my mom??,"Hello, 
So I got a car but the auto loan was taken out by my mom. At the time of purchase i didn’t have any credit history. She had great credit so the interest rate is 5.9%. I make monthly payments to her for the loan. 

I looked at refinance options at banks and haven’t been able to find a lower rate than 5.9%. My credit score is in lower-mid 700’s. And I’d like to diversify my credit. 

Should I continue to make monthly payments to my mom for the loan or refinance it in my name?",finance
personalfinance,Sell apartment or pay of loan?,"Hello, I could use some advice in regards to my current financial situation and whether or not to sell real estate that I inherited when my mother died earlier this year.  

First of all my situation:  

I(22) am currently and up until next week will be a college student and from August on will be in an Apprenticeship. Earlier this year I lost my mother and inherited several pieces of real estate but also quite a few debts.  

The inheritance:  
The house and surrounding estate I now live on.  
When my mother bought the house she took out loan that at this point has around ~12,000€ left on it.  

An apartment that is currently rented out.  
Original buying price was 140,000€. Selling price according to the real estate manager is ""significantly higher"". My mother also took out a loan when she first bought the apartment. Unfortunately as she had to stop working due to her illness since 2008 only the rent payment was used to pay off the loan. I received a letter from the bank yesterday that the rent payment barely covered the interest rate and since 2008 the amount due was barely reduced. The loan has around 100,000€ left on it.  

Several unpaid bills, funeral home, construction in our street, etc. that amount to ~10,000€.  

The way I see it currently I've got two options:  

* Option 1:  

I keep the apartment, pay off the open bills and the loan on the house over the course of my apprenticeship and see about paying off the apartment after I enter the work force in full.  

* Option 2:  

I sell the apartment and use the money that is left over after paying off the loan on it to pay off the loan on the house, pay off all the unpaid bills and put the rest away as an emergency fund.  

Before I found out about the amount due on the loan on the apartment Option 1 was what I had in mind. I see a couple reasons now however why Option 2 would be better:  

* The amount left on the apartment's loan is 100,000€. It would take several more years for me to pay this off and then several decades before I would even profit off the rent.  

* My current income from ""welfare""(Kindergeld + Waisenrente if you want to google it) and soon my apprenticeship and job on the side barely cover my monthly costs in addition to the loan payment on the house and paying the unpaid bills. Being able to pay off the unpaid bills and the loan on the house would reduce my monthly expenses by over 40% so that I could put aside several hundred Euros every month despite already having created an emergency fund from the left over money from the apartment.   

* Currently I'm not able to create an emergency fund for myself. There could always be something unforeseen happening that would lead to me needing a chunk of money quickly.  

* There's about to be a couple bigger expenses in my near future. Car repair, several necessary renovations on the house that my mother couldn't undertake due to her illness and a few others. I'm saving money on mechanics and contractors by having several friends/family that already assured me their assistance or even helped me with minor things in the past. Material costs however would be an issue due to my already ""low"" income being constrained further by paying off the loan on the house and the unpaid bills.  

Do you concur in my opinion that Option 2 would be better for me?  
I'd rather get a couple extra opinions rather than decide on my own and possibly make a 6 figure mistake.  

I also asked this question in this sub's German equivalent /r/Finanzen btw.",finance
personalfinance,Help with next steps...,"32F Recently separated from spouse. Have a small child (3 yo) who lives with me. I started a new job beginning of the year and moved back in with my family to save money for a down payment for a new house.  My husband refinanced our marital home into just his name and is keeping that house under the separation agreement. 

I am an attorney and make 120k year. Debts include fed loans through fed loan servicing of 75,308 (usually at 6.55% but temp 0 till sept). Another 14,008 in fed loans through Nelnet that consists of loans at 4.4% to 6.55%. I have paid this down from 18k at beginning of the year.   Only other debt is my car which I owe 24,508 and is at 2.49%. I have been doing income based repayment on my student loans and previous employer was a government entity so I had planned on getting lucky with loan forgiveness. Now not the case.  I use a credit card for all expenses throughout the month and pay in full. 

I have a little over 26k in savings which I was planning on using to buy a new house for me and my child but now idk if I really am financially stable enough for that...  Net biweekly income is 3k and I have basically 3k a month that I can use to put towards savings or pay off debt. 

Question is what should I do. Some friends have said use all my savings to pay off car because the payment is 463/mo. My mom recommends paying off as much of the student loans as possible and staying with her for at least another year (original plan was to move out this summer but covid stopped that real quick lol).   I just am hesitant to take my 26k in savings and put towards debt and then the perfect house pops up and I can’t buy it 😭.

personalfinance,Refinance Help (Loan A vs. Loan B),"Hello Personal Finance!

Long time lurker, first time poster. Glad to be the first person to ask about a refinance during this time. Or 1000th. Admittedly, I've done my homework but after days of looking at offers you get a bit numb and too close to the situation so I figured I'd get a second opinion on the final two loans.

Looking to refinance a home worth around 300-310k and has 265900 left on the existing mortgage which started last year in March 2019 at a rate of 4.375%. Payment all in with escrow is $1,705 a month.

House will be jointly owned by my fiance and I (would be wife already, but had to push the wedding due to Covid. Have done some shopping and got loans of both 3.25% and 3.15% with the following details:

***Loan A:***

Amount borrowed: 265,900

3.25 Interest Rate

Total Fees: 3,874

Lender Credit: -1,590

Escrow/Prepaids: 1,652

Fees to close: 4,236.00 (includes escrow and prepaids)

Monthly payment (including taxes, PMI, insurance) = $1,507

***Loan B:***

Amount Borrowed: 270,000

3.125 interest rate

Total Fees: $4302 ($2,800 of which is title related, can likely find cheaper)

Escrow/Prepaids: 1,691

Cost to Close: $5,993 (4000ish back into loan, $1800ish cash)

Monthly payment (all in) = $1,511

Any feedback helpful! I would assume I can get the title costs in loan B down from $2,800 to $2,100 or so. I've run the numbers and it seems like a coin flip to me, but maybe one of you sees something else!

Either way my current payment will drop about $200 a month and I stand to save a lot on life of loan... so I'm happy, just looking for some internet strangers to help me make the final call!",finance
investing,Deflation is bad for stocks,"To fill the hole in GDP and liquidity crunch caused by corona, the Fed and Treasury pumped in several trillion more than the estimated fall in GDP. Of these trillions, about 2.5 trillion at most was income given to businesses and individual by Treasury. This is more than 10% of annual GDP should more than fill the hole in GDP by most estimates. The rest was in the form of Fed printing and unforgivable loans. This was to offset the capital flight to safe havens like cash and treasuries and restore liquidity to bond markets. Inadvertently, a portion of this government provided income and Fed printing ended up in stocks. Consensus says that since the amount pumped in as income and loans is greater than the fall in GDP and capital flight to safe havens, the recession is cancelled or there's a Fed put on stocks not specifically doomed or even helped by corona (FAANG, etc).

Note that while stocks have rallied, short term t-bill yields are still falling and long term treasury yields are flat after falling a lot, despite record borrowing by Treasury. Gold is flat since stocks bottomed on March 23rd. Fed futures are expecting negative interest rates. Investment grade bond yields are much lower. All of this means that smart investors expect deflation, not inflation, for several years. This is while the Fed funds rate is already at zero.

Deflation is bad for stocks, good for bonds. It doesn't matter if you own the stock of a perfect monopoly with zero debt. If your money can earn a return as cold hard cash, why would you buy stock of a business that will have lower earnings due to deflation? Yes monopolies have pricing power, but this will diminish if there's deflation and could cause a revenue/income drop. Also, deflation increases the real yield on treasuries/bonds, so stocks make less sense as an investment. So why are stocks not pricing in deflation when every other investment asset is?

Stock investors are stupider and more impulsive than bond investors. This has never been more true than in the current age of instant gratification (social media), investment gamification (investing apps), index investing (blind and constant buying), and an 11 year, 500% stock rally that gave investors confidence in stocks and a FOMO. The trillion dollar question is, how long can all this keep stocks diverging from reality?

personalfinance,Advice - Student Loans,"1st time poster here! I've been thinking about this for awhile, but I need some advice about potentially repaying my student loans:

Background is I'm a married 32 year old who is expecting his first child in about a month. I do well for myself and wife is not currently working (nor will she be until the end of 2020 - at least that's the plan for now). Summary of finances is below, so let me know what you all think!

Outstanding Student Loans - ~$35,000 ($750/month but I pay $950/month). Interest rate is 3.9%
Car Payments - $250/month
Car Insurance - $100/month
Rent - $3,500/month
No other major expenses except food and alcohol (I could cut alcohol if I had to, but I love my bourbon and scotch!). Otherwise have pretty standard TV/Internet/Utilities

Salary is about $195k with an annual bonus of $80k
Savings - $25k
Checking - $10k
Joint Savings wth my wife - $35k
Investments - $60k
401k ($85k, 10% contribution with 5% match)

My thoughts are to NOT pay off the student loans with current funds and just continue with my $950 monthly payment because of the following (side note, I always plan to use a substantial portion of my bonus to pay $5-$10k of the student loans assuming nothing unexpected happens):

- $25k savings is my ""emergency fund"" and therefore do not want to touch.
- $33k joint account should be used for things like a down payment on a house (even though we are not currently looking, I want to be prepared in case something changes in short term).
- do not want to liquidate any of my investments given I am relatively young and want to continue growing these over the long term.
- Paying off my loans would only result in a 3.9% return immediately.
- Other considerations are that I should definitely be opening a Roth IRA so I can continue contributing to retirement after filling up my 401k (will definitely clear the $19,000 contribution limit for 2020) and plan to open a 529 plan once my child is born.

Looking for advice to either confirm my thinking or sway me the other way. Is there anything else I should be thinking about in the short or long term as a new parent (aside from house and future education expenses)?

2. Student Loan: $300/month, principle of $27K - interest rate is 4.5%

I want to pay off my car loan as soon as possible especially with a 5.99% interest rate, but also am considering maxing out my Roth IRA because the ROI on that investment would be much greater in the long run compared to the car/student loan, considering how much compound interest would benefit me if I were to invest this year and not wait until next year to max it out.

personalfinance,I Need A New Job and I Don't Know What To Do,"Hi r/personalfinance

I apologize for the length, I suck at being concise but did my best...

I want to preface this by saying I'm an intelligent young person, perhaps overly optimistic, and in a bad, abusive situation. Got a music degree, been living at home teaching music lessons/playing gigs for money. (Short version is I was forced into college/debt, decided I would study something I wanted to study if I had to go.) Fortunately, this allowed me to get a car, complete a home recording studio setup, get better quality instruments, do what I love for a living, even pay off more than $15,000 of debt. I don't do any drugs or anything. I will probably get roasted on this sub for this, I know, but I want to be a musician. IME on this sub for some reason that = me being a dumbass. I was originally going to pay all my debt down and scrape by as a musician in an apartment elsewhere, which would have been totally financially achievable.

However, suffice to say my family situation is extremely fucked up. I'll spare you the details, but I'm at a point where I'm basically looking for more income to exit this situation/city I'm in permanently, and help my parents pay down their mortgage and hopefully move far away if they're smart, and ideally I would like to be able to pay an abusive family member's rent/therapist/etc... for them since they don't seem to be in a mental state to take care of themselves. Supposedly they're seeing a therapist but I have no way of confirming that.

Though my income is inconsistent as I'm generally paid on a per-lesson/gig basis, I have been earning more every year as a musician and was on track to earn about $3500 to $4000 a month starting September 2019. My main job's student base dipped which has never happened before, and then coronavirus happened. So as of September I was stuck at $2000-$2500 a month total, same as last year. Add coronavirus, down to $1300 a month, add summertime, down to $700 or so a month. Some families usually go on vacation around this time, but given the current situation that seems unlikely. Obviously I don't earn a lot. Some of my friends are on unemployment and earning more in a week ($1000ish) than I will likely soon be earning in a month. I have had more students signing up for online lessons with me at my other jobs, but I'm not holding my breath.

Despite all the debt I've managed to pay down, I can't afford to move out still, as my income has been greatly impacted by COVID-19, slowing the progress of my debt elimination, and my ability to financially support myself in general. I'm glad to even still have an income, but the inconsistency has gotten old. I need a stronger and consistent income source, even though I love teaching and being a musician. I think it could definitely be a solid side hustle for me to earn an extra $1000+ per month though. I normally fully support myself as far as food, gas, bills, basically everything, except for just sleeping and showering at home because I normally work so much. I also help out my family with basically everything. Yard work, chores around the house, even technological help regarding their jobs and other technology stuff. I lend them money sometimes when they're in a jam, even if it's all I have, take their cars in to get work done, rent and use equipment to powerwash the entire house and so on. However between all the work at work, all the helping out at home, and family issues, I had no time to look for new jobs or learn skills required for a new job. Things are a little different now, but now that I have so much time, I am looking to exit this quarantine situation with a new job that will allow me to support myself living alone and get debt free, while still hopefully having nights and weekends to myself to create things, earn extra money to send to my parents, and live life when that's possible again.

My current financial picture/budget

$26,000.00 Student Loan Debt (down from $36,000)

$3800.00 Car Payment (Down from $5000)

$2900 Credit Card Debt (About to make a payment to knock this down to $2400, then I can pay $200/month til it's gone. This is down from $3300 and I always pay this card off early before the interest rate kicks in.)

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly Expenses

Student Loans ($350ish but it varies because I often pay extra. These are on forbearance until September on account of coronavirus)

Car Payment ($120 but I often pay extra)

Credit Card Debt (I'll be paying $200 a month starting next month and for the last payment in March 2021 I will pay a little under $500 extra, after this I'll focus on paying my car down.)

Gas (Not really driving right now except once every couple weeks to make sure my car still works)

Car Insurance $85

Dental Insurance $39

Adobe Programs $32

Hulu $12

YouTube Red $12

Spotify $9.99

Misc. Expenses Under $50

It's possible in September my income could jump back up to $2000 or more when the school year starts if I get a regular amount of students, but that's a big if. Right now I'm waiting for my federal taxes to come out of my account and I'm about to make a large CC payment which will leave me with about $2500 total saved, and I would like to have quadruple that before moving out.

I want to move out the instant the quarantine ends. I can create sounds, songs, etc... of all different kinds of things, I can make video content, and I have artistic skills as well. I also really enjoy budgeting and getting the most out of a dollar though I'm not great at math, and I can always find ways to solve problems within reason. I know my way around a computer and I'm good at learning different types of programs as long as there is a GUI. I'm sure I could learn command prompt given the time.

I'm willing to learn how to do something else I'm just not sure what job someone like me could get. I did once apply for a marketing job and they told me I needed to know the full suite of Adobe Apps inside and out, (which I didn't) and that if I felt I could do that they would be happy to take my application. (That job was for $40,000/yr). I do have all those apps now and I'm quite familiar with Premiere Pro, learning my way around Photoshop and Lightroom slowly, and I've used After Effects a bit (though my current computer can't handle AE too well).

One idea I have is learning all the applications in the Adobe Suite inside and out and then applying for every marketing job/social media content creator type position I can find, as that's the one option I can think of that wouldn't totally crush my soul, as I would at least still get to be creative. I'm also open to working a job that's just a job, show up, do my work, get my money, go home, that's it. Whatever job that may be, I'm looking to earn $50,000 a year minimum (about twice what I earned last year). The problem is I only know about the music market and what I should be/could be earning there, never had a desk job or anything. I don't even know what kind of jobs I'm qualified to apply for, or what someone like me could do other than maybe marketing, and I'm definitely looking for suggestions.

I probably sound like a crazy person, sorry. I'm just a 20-something trying to make a change for the better financially and psychologically so I can live a healthier not depressing life. Any help anyone can offer would be sincerely appreciated, thank you in advance.",finance

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 11th, 2020.

# **Stocks are expected to trade the economy’s reopening in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/08/stocks-expected-to-trade-the-economys-reopening-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Investors will watch the economy’s reopening progress, as well as a series of economic reports in the coming week that will provide a look at the consumer during April as the economy shed 20.5 million jobs.
*****
&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell speaks on a webcast held by the Peterson Institute on Wednesday at 9 a.m., and he will be watched closely for any new insights on the economy or Fed programs.
*****
&gt; There are just a few earnings releases ahead, but there will be a barrage of economic reports, including consumer and producer inflation, consumer sentiment and most importantly retail sales on Friday. 
*****
&gt; # Stocks versus bonds
&gt; Stocks were higher in the past week, even as some bond yields touched record lows. Yields move opposite price, and bonds usually move opposite stocks.
*****
&gt; “The stock market is trading the reopening, and the bond market is doubting the vibrant pace of an economic recovery upon the reopening,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group.
*****
&gt; Small cap stocks and tech led the way higher in the past week. The Nasdaq jumped 6% in a week, where it wiped out its losses for the year and turned positive. The small cap Russell 2000 was up 5.5%.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was up 3.5% for the week to 2,929, with tech up 6.6% and consumer discretionary stocks up 4.4%.
*****
&gt; The bond market and stock market have both responded to the Fed’s programs that put more liquidity into the financial system, with bond rates falling and stocks rising sharply.
*****
&gt; “Stocks just seem to be disconnected from everything else,” said Michael Schumacher, director rates at Wells Fargo. Some bond yields, like the benchmark 10-year yield, which impacts many types of loans, were slightly higher ahead of the Treasury’s record $96 billion in auctions in the coming week. But the 2-year, at a new low of 0.10%, was trading on concerns about the economy.
*****
&gt; Market pros will look for Powell to comment on market speculation that the Fed could take its benchmark rate to a negative yield. Fed officials have said they have no interest in negative rates, which are being used by central banks in Europe and Japan. But for the first time this past week, traders drove futures on fed funds to show slightly negative rates in contracts starting in  November. 
*****
&gt; “He could quash negative yields if he wants to,” said Schumacher. “The Fed has consistently argued against negative policy rates. Now there’s a chance Powell could comment on this. He’s commented about it, several times in the last six months.”
*****
&gt; Much of the gains in the stock market have been driven by big technology companies with operations that haven’t been deeply affected by the coronavirus.
*****
&gt; “Tech was the shutdown trade and small caps are the reopening,” said Boockvar, noting small caps are domestically focused and are sensitive to the back-to-work trade.
*****
&gt; Apple joined the reopening trade Friday, when its stock rose after it announced it would reopen some of its U.S. stores.
*****
&gt; “The stock market has sort of a hall pass as the months proceed and things reopen. At some point, that hall pass is going to expire” and the reopenings will have to result in rebound, Boockvar said.
*****
&gt; Investors have been watching for anything that suggests state reopenings are stimulating activity.
*****
&gt; Retail sales Friday will be a big focus and are expected to show sharp decline of 11%, but more like 6% when automobiles and gasoline are removed, he said.
*****
&gt; In the oil market in the past week, crude was up as much as 24% as traders reacted to information that showed gasoline demand picking up around the U.S. States have been opening up at different speeds, and California was the latest to reopen some activity Friday.
*****
&gt; “Some of the reason the market is up because the virus curve is bending, the economic data is showing signs of a bounce. It hasn’t here yet but you know it’s coming. It’s a global phenomenon,” said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. He noted that China’s export numbers unexpectedly rose in April, for the first time this year.
*****
&gt; Paulsen said he expects stocks to remain in an upswing.
*****
&gt; “There’s a lot of value out there if you’re outside the high growth in the S&amp;P 500,” he said, “When fear is as high as it is, that’s typically been a great time to lean toward risk assets. Gold is at a 50-year high relative to commodity prices. People are buying bonds at virtually zero yield. To me, there’s fairly defensive behavior and scared attitudes rather than the other way around.”
*****
&gt; Strategists say the market could retest its March lows, but a good number say the bottom has been set.
*****
&gt; “I’m getting more confident that we’ve seen the lows, and we’re starting a recovery in the stock market, but I think the volatility is going to stay there, and there will be challenges. I think the general direction is up rather than down at the moment,” said Paulsen.
*****
&gt; Paulsen said the fear of reinfection remains, should there be a new wave of the virus. “There’s a lot of terrible things that could happen and be terrible for the stock market,” he said.  “A headline could create an up or down week and then go away again. ” 
*****
&gt; “I think the rise in the stock market is really more about a lack of sellers. But I don’t think there’s a lot of buyers. If more people believed this is winding down ... there could be a  lot more money that’s going to come back into equities, to some extent,” Paulsen said.
*****
&gt; Market pros are keeping an eye on yields, ahead of the government’s record sized $96 billion in auctions in the coming week for 3- and 10-year notes and 30-year bonds.

# Market Too Far Ahead of Economy?

&gt; Another 3.2 million Americans filed for unemployment last week bringing the seven-week total to 33.5 million. This is an unprecedented streak for an unprecedented time, and it highlights the significant impact that the coronavirus pandemic shutdown is having. One small positive aspect of this week’s number is the fact that it is a decline from the previous reading which lends further support to the possibility that the market’s lows of March could be the bottom and that bottom could hold based upon the historical correlation of jobless claims and past market bottoms that we covered in a recent post.

&gt; However, the seven-week total is an unsettling number that suggests the road back to “normal” could be longer than the market appears to currently expect. It is getting increasingly more challenging to envision 33.5 million Americans returning to work as quickly as they left. And with NASDAQ returning to positive for the year in today’s trading it may be time to wonder if the market’s brisk recovery is possibly too far ahead of the actual economy.

&gt; One early sign that the rally may be getting well ahead of the economy can be seen in the following chart of cumulative daily advance/decline lines for NYSE, NASDAQ, Russell 2000 and the S&amp;P 500. The recent trend since the end of April has been lower while the indexes have managed to move modestly higher. This suggests that fewer and fewer stocks are still participating in the rally. Historically when this persisted the major indexes frequently failed to move meaningfully higher and often turned lower.

# Market Gains in Celebration of Mother’s Day

&gt; With just a few days remaining to Mother’s Day, today’s post is also a reminder. Over the last twenty-five years on the Friday before Mother’s Day the Dow Jones Industrials have gained ground seventeen times. On the Monday after, DJIA has advanced seventeen times over the same time period. Average gain on Friday has been 0.20% and a respectable 0.36% on Monday. However, in five of the last eight years, the Monday following Mother’s Day has been down. Last year, DJIA suffered its worst post Mother’s Day loss, off 2.38%.

# Group Breadth Improving From a Record Low Base

&gt; After a disastrous late February and early March period, breadth among S&amp;P 500 groups cratered to the point where not a single one of the S&amp;P 500's 24 industry groups were above their 50-day moving average. Before the most recent occurrence, that's something we hadn't seen since early 2019.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/050820-Groups-above-520DMA.png))**

&gt; While there have been numerous instances in the last few years where every industry group was below its 50-DMA, the most recent period was unique in that it lasted more than four full weeks (21 trading days). Going all the way back to 1990, there has only been one other period where every industry group was below its 50-day moving average for as long as it just was. That was during the depths of the financial crisis in the 21-day stretch ending 11/3/08. It took a bear market of more than a year to finally reach that level back then, but this time around, it took less than two months. Besides that period, there has never been another four-week stretch where every industry group was below its 50-day moving average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/050820-Groups-above-520DMA-Streaks.png))**

&gt; Overall breadth readings have already improved in terms of industry groups above their 50-day moving averages, but at this point, the number of industry groups with rising 50-day moving averages remains extremely depressed at just 8.3% as of midday Friday. Similar to the streak above, during the most recent period every group had a declining 50-day moving average for 26 straight days, and that was also the longest such streak since 2008. Granted, this is a lagging indicator and should improve the longer equities remain around current levels, but it once again serves as a reminder of how steep the declines actually were.

# Sector Relative Strength

&gt; Although the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) is down around 1% over the past week, there are two sectors that have made a push higher: Communication Services (XLC) and Technology (XLK). While these moves have left both sectors in overbought territory, a snapshot from our Trend Analyzer tool shows that Tech's rally has brought it into the green YTD.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/050720-TA.png))**

&gt; Technology's outperformance is nothing new. As shown in the relative strength charts from our Sector Snapshot below, Technology has been a serial outperformer versus the S&amp;P 500 for pretty much all of the past year (a rising line indicates outperformance versus the S&amp;P 500 and vice versa). As for the other sectors, Health Care has also seen some drastic outperformance over the past few months. Communication Services and Consumer Discretionary have also seen some outperformance in recent weeks. Contrary to Technology, Energy, Financials, Industrials, and Materials have all been consistent underperformers over the past year.

# Performance on Earnings Days

&gt; Roughly 1,300 companies have reported since the start of earnings season on 4/13 when the first of the big banks kicked things off. For those stocks that have beaten EPS estimates, the reaction has not been as strong as past years with just a 9 bps difference between this earnings season and all seasons since 2001. On the other hand, those that have missed EPS have not been as badly punished dropping 0.86% compared to an average drop of 3.56% since 2001. For all stocks, the average gain of 0.79% this earnings season is much stronger than the 0.06% gain of all other seasons.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/Earn-React-4.png))**

&gt; With stock price reactions being generally positive this season, most of the gain has come at the open. Stocks reporting earnings have gapped up an average of 1.24%. But intraday they have tended to sell-off, averaging a 0.44% decline from open to close.

personalfinance,Student debt vs. house down pmt,"I'm a scientist, but not savvy about financial strategies. What method should my spouse and I use to decide the best strategy for debt vs savings?

**Background**

* $37k federal student loan debt, but (resuming Oct 1) a high interest rate (~7%). The initial $25k capitalizes in November.
* $35k liquid
* Currently renting, we were hoping to buy a starter home in 1-2 years (as first-time homebuyers) in the greater DC area. However, we are disheartened at the price of housing here :(. I think we'll be lucky to find something we are happy with for less than $600k.
* $1500 /month is budgeted to split between student loan repayment and house down payment savings.

I am inclined to refinance the student loans (target 4% or lower) in November.  I don't know what methodology should be used to determine

1. Is that refi plan the best option, or is there a better time to refinance?
2. What are the best allocation amounts for student loan repayment vs house down payment savings?
3. Should we be targeting 20% (120k), or a smaller, more realistic percentage for a house down payment? At this rate, it will take another 5 years to have 20% saved up, (ignoring student debt and unforseen events).

Are these questions we should schedule to meet a financial planner for? How much is reasonable to charge for advice answering these questions?",finance

personalfinance,Road to financial independence: buying a house?,"Hi all, i am 28M and living in the Netherlands. I work as a business controller. My income is currently about € 55k a year. Net income approximately € 38k. My focus is growing more and more towards FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early). Not sure which are the best steps to take on the road towards financial independence. Would like to hear some views on if it is a good idea to buy a house. If that is the case, should I use all my savings &amp; liquidate my investments to buy a house or simply take a higher mortgage? What could I do now to lower the interest that I have to pay on a mortgage?

Nowadays I am able to save € 2k per month, mainly due to low housing cost, owning an inexpensive (old) car and tight budgetting. I am currently maximizing my pension contributions.

I have been able to save € 28k in total. Got €4k in a handful of well diversified etf's in terms of geography and industries. Next to that I got roughly €8K in mainly tech shares. 

Probably it is good to mention that I got a student debt of approximately € 15k (zero interest rate).

Guess I would not need more than € 10k in savings as an emergency fund.

personalfinance,Help understanding my new principal + interest HELOC payments please,"We recently refinanced and also swapped HELOCs to our new bank. The old HELOC was interest only until the repayment period. The new HELOC's monthly payment is based on 1% of the outstanding balance and the interest is taken from that and then the remainder goes toward principal. AFAIK if you had a $10,000 balance for example, the first monthly payment would be $100, of which (current promotional interest rate of 1.99%) would come out and the remainder of the $100 after interest is taken would go toward principal. This would then reduce the principal and the next month's payment amount. My question is, how is this interest calculated. I can't figure out how much interest the 1.99% would be or how to calculate it and what amount would go toward principal. Anyone able to help? Thanks",finance
solarenergy,Just Purchased the Tesla 11.34 [kW] Solar Panel Electric System! Here's my decision making process-,"Hello Everyone,

I just signed a contract on Thursday to get the Tesla 11.34 \[kW\] Solar Panel Electric System. Pretty excited. Tesla says I'll recoup my investment in 13 \[yr\]. Based on my own calculation, I'll ""recoup"" the investment in 25 \[yr\], assuming all my assumptions are correct.

\- 7.00% after-tax annual return on my portfolio

\- 3.50% annual inflation

\- Stayed super-conservative and the assumed that my Solar Panel Electric System will only offset 80.86% of my current electric usage. I'm positive it will offset more than that in reality.

\- Net Metering or Renewable Buyback plans continue to stay at 131% of the lowest available electric plan of the market

\- Monthly loss of panel efficiency of 0.17% for the first year (Panels guaranteed 98% after the first year)

\- Monthly loss of panel efficiency of 0.045% for the rest of the use (Panels guaranteed 85% after 25 years)

Also, I wanted to know how long I'll be able to use the panels. There are varying answers online, saying 25, 30, 40, or beyond. So I ran some calculations/simulations, and it seems that based on some additional assumptions, replacing the system after 46 \[yr\] would be the most financially beneficial decision.

\- The price of the Solar Panel Electric System stays the same after inflation is adjusted. Tesla system is currently the cheapest the market unless you go DIY, but I assumed after 46 \[yr\] price would have brought down to some level, and current market low may be a new average.

\- No Federal Solar Credit after 46 \[yr\]

25 \[yr\] can be a long time, but I'm still excited. I'm planning to use this system for the next 46 \[yr\], so I'll still enjoy the free electricity, albeit at a lower average efficiency of 79% for the next 21 \[yr\] after I recoup my initial investment. (IF panels don't fail after the warranty period)

IF I went with the more expensive local turnkey installers, my recoup period would've been 33 \[yr\].

.

.

《DIY Calculator》

I couldn't find any Solar Panel Electric System ROI Calculator online. All the calculators I could find were comparing scenarios of purchasing the system vs. idly holding cash. You don't do that. So I built an excel calculator myself simulating market return at the same time, and that's how I got the 25 \[yr\] above.

[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dhhB1dZhUM7dvvFqFmUWFIZrOLbgPYfT](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dhhB1dZhUM7dvvFqFmUWFIZrOLbgPYfT)

The calculator assumes you have 100K and shows different scenarios of purchasing and not purchasing the Solar Electric System, and shows simulated monthly balance. It's inflation-adjusted, so everything's in today's dollar value.

\- IF you don't want to include the value of your Solar Electric System as part of recouping, simply put the first *Solar Electric System Value* to zero. (Don't change the *Cost of Solar Electric System* and *Installation and Labor* as they apply both to the *Solar Electric System Value* and the *Investment Balance*)

Also, this calculator shows different scenarios of replacing the system at different times. It seems that replacing the system after \~46 \[yr\] when the efficiency drops to \~73% makes the most financial sense in my case. I'm sure the calculator can be used by anyone with a little tweak.

Don't be shy to point out any brain farts I had in building this calculator in the comment section, in case someone decides to use my calculator as a part of their decision-making process.

.

.

《After Purchase Finance》

Yes, the system will eventually pay for itself. But I'm paying with cash, and it's easy to just end up spending the extra monthly income without proper budgeting. And I didn't want my $26.5K to just vanish into thin air over time.

So starting my next paycheck, I'm contributing $130.00 pre-tax to my HSA. That's roughly $205.38 decrease in my direct deposit, which is the highest ever summer electric bill I had. I always budget for that amount and save the unspent money at the end of the month, so there is no change in the money I can spend. In December, I'll calculate that again reflecting the assumed increase in electric cost of 5.58% per year, and so on every year.

This way, I'm sure I'll end up saving the system cost of $26.5K a lot earlier than my simulated recoup period of 25 \[yr\] with no impact in my life.

Thanks for reading. Wish me luck, everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

* Edit: Did some fine tuning on my simulation and updated the system replacement frequency from 50 \[yr\] to 46 \[yr\]! Basic philosophy still remains to be the same. Also added more detail on my system's electric usage offset percentage.",energy
Bitcoin,Bitcoin’s values isn’t just about scarcity of the coins themselves,"First, let me just preface this by saying that I’m posting this as a jumping off point for a discussion on how you see bitcoin evolving in the future, and none of what I’m writing here I’m absolutely sure of happening.

That being said, I believe that an aspect of bitcoin that we’ll see become more of a talking point in the future is that base layer transactions are necessarily scarce themselves.

This means that (in my opinion), at a certain point, people will have to onboarded to bitcoin via a purely second layer transaction.

While that may sound bad to people who see other crypto as ‘superior’ to bitcoin, it’s actually a huge benefit to Bitcoin’s massive monetary policy and security advantage it has over everything else.

This is because it will force market makers to fund LN with more and more liquidity. This, in turn means that market makers will have to cooperate with each other in order to minimize on chain fees and maximize the efficiency of all transactions that occur on the blockchain.

Once this happens, ‘spikes’ in on chain fees will happen much more rarely, and will mostly be due to periods of time where lightning liquidity is increasing and the spread is very high which is good for the market maker. However, the true price of on chain transactions will start to emerge as a function of funding LN channels.

Thus, increases in the liquidity and use of the lightning network will actually be beneficial for market makers making the on chain transactions, in addition to the miners confirming those transactions.

The increase of transaction cost fees for makers will necessarily have to be less than the profit margin for the spread in order for them to want to add liquidity to LN, so this itself becomes a self reinforcing cycle;

More direct LN adoption by bitcoin users &gt;&gt; increased requirement for LN liquidity &gt;&gt; market makers ensuring profits &gt;&gt; higher on chain fees &gt;&gt; more miners securing the network to collect higher fees &gt;&gt; higher relative price of bitcoin due to increased security and more miners participating &gt;&gt; more direct LN adoption by users because of how expensive on chain transactions are",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,2019 Tax Return - Where is my check?,"So I made a mistake filing my federal return through Credit Karma. I accidentally missed a digit on my direct deposit account number and the refund never went through. 

I spoke with my bank and they received the refund payment and rejected it due to my error. The procedure at this point is the money goes back to the IRS and I’m supposed to get a paper check at some point. 

It’s now been about 60 days since I’ve filed and 45 days since the bank rejected the refund. How much longer is this going to take?

personalfinance,What do you guys think of a variable rate student loan in our situation?,"So here's the situation:

My wife and I recently got married. She's finishing up her undergraduate degree and will graduate next May. Combined, we have about $20k in cash, and it will be a few thousand more at the end of the summer when we're making decisions on what to do with it. Our expenses are very low out here in the middle of nowhere, and I have very good job security as a funded graduate student, so I've decided we only need about $7k in cash for emergencies. If we had to in a large emergency, we could pull money from my Roth IRA (~$10k in contributions). This will leave us with $16k or so to invest, pay her tuition for this next academic year, and/or pay down her student loan balances (currently $19,887). She has no other debt. Thanks to my parents' diligent saving and a handful of scholarships, I have no debt of any kind.

My current line of thinking is that we will set aside some cash to pay her tuition and some of her expenses for the year (she has a job on campus that will cover the rest of them). This will leave us with a good amount of money--probably $7-8k--which I am trying to decide what to do with. One idea I have is to refinance some or all of her loans into a variable rate loan, and then invest the amount we have left over into a somewhat conservative mutual fund (thinking VSCGX). Interest rates are very low right now, and we could probably get a rate close to 2%. I'm guessing rates will stay low for years, and if they go up significantly, we'll simply sell the mutual fund and pay down the variable rate loan. In the meantime, I'd like to optimize everything as much as possible, and low-interest debt isn't necessarily a bad thing if we can make (on average) 6% a year or so in a mutual fund.

Obviously, there is some risk of stocks dropping (which likely means interest rates would stay low based on my understanding of economics), but there is also something to gain from stocks rising. I'm pretty much willing to accept this kind of risk. We won't have to make payments on the student loans until she finishes school, and she's planning on pursuing a PhD after she graduates, so the time horizon for all this is likely at least five years.

investing,Stock market - Where are we? Where will we go?,"Hello everybody, I want to start of by telling you that this is a really long post and I don't expect anyone to take from their personal time to read it. With that being said the structure is at follows - a short summary is the first thing that you will read. You can find the arguments in the body of the post if you are curious. Thank you for your attention.

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary:**

&amp;#x200B;

* Why we won't see a new low in the stock market
* Why will the stock market crash or see a big correction
* How to **not** make a buying decision
* Why covid is not that horrible

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Why we won't see a new low in the stock market**

Will start of by saying that comparing this crisis with 08/09 doesn't work due to the key difference of the core problem. In 08/09 it was a core problem of the financial system, now its a virus. The business were working just fine before covid.

We will not see a new low due to a plethora of reasons. We have the Fed which backstops everything, we have unemployed people getting more money now than when they were working and basing on recent examples we also have a lot of people that can't wait to go out and do stuff. See Disney park in Shanghai being instantly sold out. See Carnival cruises getting booked like crazy and a plethora of other examples where we see people don't care about covid.

The market is driven by the Tech companies right now which we see that are doing really good in this environment.  The slow and steady re-opening will bring business to every other company affected. This is a strong argument for the stock market to go up. Gas will be needed for cars so companies like Exxon, Chevron, Shell will see their demands go higher, pushing the oil price higher and therefore the revenue will be higher.

We will see a bounce back for companies like Realty Income or Simon property Group once people will slowly start to use gyms, go to the malls, getting their jobs back and brining back the normal flow for rent payments.

We will see companies like Verizon or AT&amp;T push higher due to 5G implementation.

We are already seeing healthcare companies going higher and higher based on the situation. A lot of them will start going back down but the big dogs will stay where they are or will push higher.

And so on.. every single industry has strong arguments to go higher and higher by slowly re-opening the country and things normalizing.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Why will the stock market crash or see a big correction**

&amp;#x200B;

Here we need to talk about the elephant in the room, covid. The first and the most obvious reason would be covid doing a spanish flu style rebound and start being a real killer. This is not something that we can debate since its unlikely to happen just because a different disease did this 100 years ago.

Going with more real possibilities, the Fed could be a real reason if they start backing off to soon. I don't expect this to happen but its a possibility and we should take it into account.

The majority of people actually changing spending habits, being fearful of leaving the house or going to work.

The news. Now this one is a big one. If we take a deep dive into audience data for TV news we see that not a lot of people are actually watching them. This is also valid for Twitter, although the margins are a lot tighter. In a theoretical world this would mean that the news are not a huge influence. But they are. Not the TV news. Does are just for ratings. Almost everybody who has a decent chunk of money in the stock market does at least 1% research on their own. Now we expect the data to be bad, that's why we don't see the market going down. But if the data changes and starts coming worse than expected the market will react in accordance. A perfect example is the unemployment news. Right now we all expected it that's why the market didn't go down, but if this situation keeps going and once the country is open the numbers aren't correcting themselves its going to be a huge problem.

Inflation/Deflation numbers can also be a big influence. This is the only topic that I have an understanding for my own but a limited capacity to actually go in depth and explain if for someone else so I will just mention it and leave it here.

**3. How to not make a buying decision**

&amp;#x200B;

Do not base you decision of buying a company, or anything for that matter on what some random persons says on reddit. Never! Even if that person is a super expert and he wants all the good in the world for you, once you buy something that you, personal have no clue about its going to be a source of anxiety because you don't know what happens. Its not worth it.

Do not buy just because FOMO (fear of missing out) - if you do not feel comfortable with the price before you buy, you will definitely not be comfortable after. Just be calm, controlled, do you research, make up your mind about a price, wait for it.

Do your due diligence. No matter the company. You want to buy Apple? Check their balance sheet, check their prospects, look at their future. Ask yourself questions: Will people need this company in 10 years? Will people still buy their products? Can they adapt to new markets? Can they grow their business? Make a list before looking at any company with the things that you care about, note your responses before investigating and then see if its a right fit for you.

4. **Why covid is not that horrible?**

Ah.. the downvoter topic. I was thinking not tackling this one but, whatever.. my opinion.

I want to start out by looking at Sweden. Do not start comparing the total numbers with the US because that is ridiculous, their population is much smaller.  Start comparing the per million numbers, there things get interesting: Deaths per million: 319 (USA is at 242), Cases per million: 2567 (USA has 4070), test per million: 14704 (USA has 26943). You can see the similarities. They have half the cases but also half the testing power so we can make an educated assumption and put them close to USA.

Sweden measures when comparing with USA are zero. They have very limited measures in place yet the case numbers evolves really similar. This is a case as to why the country should open.

The death rate is 100% overblown. Recent studies in Europe but also in USA start showing that the rate of infection is 20 to 100 higher than the official numbers. Even if we go with the low number of 20, that would put USA cases at over 25 million. This again proves that Covid is not that bad as we expected.

The majority of people that died (over 90%) are people over 65 with underlying conditions. Healthy, young people are just not affected nearly as bad some predicted.

Do not interpret my words on this topic as taking in lightly. I am not. But in a healthy society we need to be able to debate both sides of the story and not only the one pushed in the media.

stocks,Stock market - Where are we? Where will we go?,"Hello everybody, I want to start of by telling you that this is a really long post and I don't expect anyone to take from their personal time to read it. With that being said the structure is at follows - a short summary is the first thing that you will read. You can find the arguments in the body of the post if you are curious. Thank you for your attention.

**Summary:**

* Why we won't see a new low in the stock market
* Why will the stock market crash or see a big correction
* How to **not** make a buying decision
* Why covid is not that horrible

1. **Why we won't see a new low in the stock market**

Will start of by saying that comparing this crisis with 08/09 doesn't work due to the key difference of the core problem. In 08/09 it was a core problem of the financial system, now its a virus. The business were working just fine before covid.

We will not see a new low due to a plethora of reasons. We have the Fed which backstops everything, we have unemployed people getting more money now than when they were working and basing on recent examples we also have a lot of people that can't wait to go out and do stuff. See Disney park in Shanghai being instantly sold out. See Carnival cruises getting booked like crazy and a plethora of other examples where we see people don't care about covid.

The market is driven by the Tech companies right now which we see that are doing really good in this environment. The slow and steady re-opening will bring business to every other company affected. This is a strong argument for the stock market to go up. Gas will be needed for cars so companies like Exxon, Chevron, Shell will see their demands go higher, pushing the oil price higher and therefore the revenue will be higher.

We will see a bounce back for companies like Realty Income or Simon property Group once people will slowly start to use gyms, go to the malls, getting their jobs back and brining back the normal flow for rent payments.

We will see companies like Verizon or AT&amp;T push higher due to 5G implementation.

We are already seeing healthcare companies going higher and higher based on the situation. A lot of them will start going back down but the big dogs will stay where they are or will push higher.

And so on.. every single industry has strong arguments to go higher and higher by slowly re-opening the country and things normalizing.

**2. Why will the stock market crash or see a big correction**

Here we need to talk about the elephant in the room, covid. The first and the most obvious reason would be covid doing a spanish flu style rebound and start being a real killer. This is not something that we can debate since its unlikely to happen just because a different disease did this 100 years ago.

Going with more real possibilities, the Fed could be a real reason if they start backing off to soon. I don't expect this to happen but its a possibility and we should take it into account.

The majority of people actually changing spending habits, being fearful of leaving the house or going to work.

The news. Now this one is a big one. If we take a deep dive into audience data for TV news we see that not a lot of people are actually watching them. This is also valid for Twitter, although the margins are a lot tighter. In a theoretical world this would mean that the news are not a huge influence. But they are. Not the TV news. Does are just for ratings. Almost everybody who has a decent chunk of money in the stock market does at least 1% research on their own. Now we expect the data to be bad, that's why we don't see the market going down. But if the data changes and starts coming worse than expected the market will react in accordance. A perfect example is the unemployment news. Right now we all expected it that's why the market didn't go down, but if this situation keeps going and once the country is open the numbers aren't correcting themselves its going to be a huge problem.

Inflation/Deflation numbers can also be a big influence. This is the only topic that I have an understanding for my own but a limited capacity to actually go in depth and explain if for someone else so I will just mention it and leave it here.

gaming,Assassin's Creed Odyssey starts off kind of... lame? [Spoilers],"I'm getting the sense AC Odyssey might not be the right game for me, which I find kind of bizarre given how much I liked AC Origins (after having 0 expectations from the franchise, I might say). I don't know, I just don't find Alexios all that interesting when compared to Bayek, and I get the feeling the game is hellbent on shoving Alexio's tragic backstory down my throat at every step, without really earning it.

I've barely made it to the point where you first enter the Ancient Forge, and immediately upon exiting I get this completely out-of-place cutscene with Kassandra blabbering about the Cult of Kosmos and how they're gonna take over the world or something. I mean, who even thought this might be a good scene? Whatever build-up the game seemed to have towards presenting Kassandra as this merciless warrior is just completely thrown out the window, in favor of a silly scene between two siblings. I just stopped playing shortly after because the whole thing felt so fake, so weak in execution. I thought presenting Nikolaos so early in the game also felt very lazy, and the whole family dynamic feels so forced it's really off-putting.

Instead of having a story, I feel like I'm being fed a poorly written family drama, as there's seemingly nothing else going on. I don't know man, maybe I'm burned out from AC Origins? I played that one back in 2018, so there must be more to it.

Without spoiling too much, does the story ever evolve into something more?",technology

personalfinance,"Looking for advice - do I pay off my last student loan, or increase my emergency fund?","Good evening Personal Finance!

I’m looking for advice on if I should increase my emergency fund or pay off my last remaining student loan. I’m a 32 year old married male with one 7 year old child. I  work in sales with commissions paid quarterly. I will receive a commission payout of $8,000 after tax on May 15th. I’m wondering if I should increase my emergency funds or pay off my last remaining student loan. Details are below-

**Income:**

Me -  New business sales for trucking company. $93,000 salary and quarterly commissions. Commissions are normally between $5,000-20,000 after tax. My Q2 will be weak due to COVID. Long term we expect our demand to remain strong and my job is secure. I allow myself one “fun” purchase each commission check, around 10-20% of the total, and the remainder goes straight to savings or investments. 

Wife – $65K salary. Her company recently furloughed and she is safe.

**Assets:**

$150,000 in our combined 401Ks , investing around 12% plus some company match

$10,000 mutual fund, investing $250 monthly

$12,000 emergency fund in savings account, investing at least $750 monthly

$5,500 529 College Savings, investing $250 monthly

**Expenses:**

Around $3,500 monthly for essentials (townhouse rent, 2 car payments, utilities, internet, groceries, and a little buffer.) 

Our expenses are lower in recent months since before and after school care and summer camps are cancelled.

**Debt**:

Cars – I have $10K and wife has $15K left on loans. My interest rate is very low (around 2%.) Not sure what the wife’s interest rate is, but she has poor credit so it’s probably higher. 

Student Loans – Started with $65,000 in loans when I graduated in 2010, I have one remaining private loan with $7,800 left and a 1.9% interest rate. Wife has none.

I really want to take the $8,000 commission check and pay off my last remaining student loan. I understand the interest on my wife’s car loan is higher and it’s a better idea to pay that down. My emergency savings is also on the low side, but I could access the mutual fund in a pinch. Mentally, it would feel so good to pay it off the last of my student debt. Am I crazy?",finance
personalfinance,Personal Debt Payoff Help?,"Hi All,

I understand that any financial advice is fairly limited but I'm considering a couple of options and wanted to get a little bit of advice.

I currently have the following debt:

Personal Loan - £14,400 left, £314/month payment, 9.8% interest rate, 57 months left

Credit Card - £5200, 0% until July 2021

Overdrafts - £5500, 0% for 2 years

and currently have the following monies:

£9,140 in current account

£4,940 in ISA

&amp;#x200B;

I was originally looking at paying off the personal loan using my current account &amp; savings, which would then free up the £314/month to pay down the credit cards &amp; overdrafts before their 0% interest offers finish. 

Alternatively, I leave the personal loan running its course and pay down the overdrafts and credit cards. 

Anyone have any advice/thoughts?

investing,A case for the market being appropriately valued,"I've seen a lot of posts about how the market is too high and it doesn't make sense.  Here are some perspectives for why things are bad and should be down from January, but also why things aren't so bad that we should be at 2008 levels.

1.  About 75% of new unemployment is expected to be temporary.  This puts true unemployment levels at numbers that are obviously bad, but not 2008 level bad.
2.  Interest rates are at all time lows.  If you've taken a corporate finance class this would help explain the risk premium.  Assume most people see stocks as requiring an additional 5% return above the risk free rate.  If the risk free rate drops from 3% to 1%, your expected return from stocks drops from 8% to 6%.  When this happens, the price of stocks go up and not down.  To explain this, assume we have a company that only pays out 100% of profits as dividends.  Under the old normal, you'd pay $100 for a stock and expect $8 in dividends every year (an 8% return).  Now the question is, how much would you pay for the same stock if it earns -$8 this year and $8 per year after that, but you now demand only a 6% return.  The formula becomes $8 in perpetuity minus the immediate change for this year of $16 or $8/.06 - $16 = $117.33.  Obviously, these are made up numbers to illustrate a point.  That point is, prices go up when interest rates go down.  If you want to make the formula more complex, assume low interest rates for 5 years then back to the higher level after that, which may be more representative of the current environment.
3.  The Fed is backstopping everything.  What this essentially means is that the money printing machine in America is issuing loans.  If these loans are paid back, then the Fed will earn money on its investment and we will have deflation.  However, the Fed can simply print more money to help avoid deflation.  The other side of this equation, would be that the Fed invests poorly and loses money.  Now, we instead have inflation which the Fed can then stop printing money to a certain extent.  Assuming they lose grip and inflation becomes quite high, this is also good for most stocks, especially in a nominal sense.  Stocks are generally a decent inflation hedge, not the best, but decent.
4.  Government debt is also hitting new highs.  However, we are literally issuing debt at a rate lower than our targeted inflation number.  Of course the government could spend it in ways that do not contribute to the economy at all.  However, they need to do the bare minimum to provide out performance relative to the rates they will borrow at.
5.  Due to the combination of 3 and 4 above, it is unlikely there will be a massive liquidity issue.  These are where the market crashes really come into play.  If there is no one to provide money to people, then investors start demanding very high risk premiums because money becomes very high demand.  This would influence number 2 in the opposite direction and make stocks go down.  All in all, I believe a liquidity scenario is possible but very unlikely, which is why I advocate for at least putting a majority of your cash in the market instead of waiting for a pullback.  However, hold a little cash in case there is a larger market issue.
6.  Larger businesses represent a majority of the publicly traded companies.  However, small businesses are hurt the most from the current crisis.  This one makes me very sad, but it is one of the reasons things don't look as bad in stocks.",finance
stocks,What do analyst recommendations really mean?,"Often I see people either taking analyst recommendations seriously, or saying that Wallstreet analysts are a bunch of idiots. Neither is true. The important thing to understand here is that it’s actually not their job to help retail investors (you) make money. Here’s how Wallstreet actually works:

Most research analysts work for banks. You probably know that these analysts get paid very good salaries. But research in and of itself doesn’t generate revenue. So how is their existence justified? 

Let’s first talk about how banks actually make money. Banks generate revenue via corporate activities – these include both equity and debt financing deals – when a company sells new stock to investors, Wallstreet takes a clip. They also take a clip when a company issues new debt. It is true that investors pay Wallstreet some commissions to trade stock and to consume research, but those are dwarfed by fees for facilitating debt and equity issuance. Wallstreet also makes big fees when companies buy one another, so called mergers and acquisitions.

So as a bank, you want to do everything you can to get a company to choose you when they are selling additional securities. How do they do this? Well one good way is to write flattering research about the company. A research analyst at an investment bank is not supposed to make recommendations that help investors make money, the research analyst is supposed to make recommendations that maintain good relations with the company, so that their ECM, DCM and M&amp;A teams can get deals that make the bank money. 

If we take an example – some people have asked me why do research analysts keep upgrading Tesla’s stock price target as the share price goes up? No, it’s not because they are stupid. No, it’s not because they can’t see that Tesla is more expensive than all the other US automakers combined. Yes, they can see that the stock price went up while Tesla stopped making cars. BUT Tesla is a company that requires a lot of money (maybe even more now due to their production delays)! And that means both equity issuance and debt issuance. The ECM and DCM bankers are sitting there salivating at the fees that they can make as long as Elon picks them as the lead bookrunner. And these are the guys that get paid the big bucks on Wallstreet – they go and have a word with the manager of the guy that writes about Tesla, a much lesser earner, and make it clear that they need their firm to stand out as the most bullish on the street, so that Elon chooses them for his next raise. Consequently all of Wallstreet falls over each other to keep upgrading in the hopes of getting into the company’s good graces. It’s twisted, but this is just how Wallstreet works. 

This is also why there are no upgrades for boring cheap and profitable companies. They don’t need Wallstreet, so Wallstreet doesn’t talk about them. On the other hand, if you are a money burning software company that pays their employees in stocks? No problem, no profits required – you will get upgrades. Research analysts are required to tie themselves into knots to justify any stock price, lest their delicious bonus will look an awful lot less delicious. 

The same goes for companies that like to make acquisitions – cash rich guys with a bit of an empire building streak – here Wallstreet wants to pander to them to make money on the acquisition streak – think Allergan before it blew up. Also companies that are in areas where a lot of M&amp;A activity is going on – guys that may be purchased by said acquirers – Wallstreet wants to pump these up to make a bigger fee when they get taken out!

Of course, the issue with buying into this is that it can blow up at any moment. Wallstreet can’t manipulate the whole market. Wallstreet also doesn’t care if Tesla goes to $300 and all the “suckers” (as they call them) who bought based on their recommendations lose money. Once Wallstreet can’t make money out of a company, they don’t care about it anymore. They will still be laughing all the way to the bank.  

**TL;DR: Wallstreet analysts are a bunch of self-interested cheerleaders. Don’t expect them to produce any actual research based on facts. Just like you, they want to make money.**",finance

The apartment is 2bdrm 2bth at $1155/mth and the house is 3bdrm (very small bedrooms) and 1bth with an approx mortgage of $1400/mth (number includes taxes, home insurance, etc). 

The apartment is in my son's current school district- I share 50/50 physical custody with his mother- so that is a bonus because he could be bussed to school (I currently drive 25ish min to bring him to, and pick him up from, school). The house is approx 30 minutes away from his current school district and also further from my, and my fiance's, jobs. 

We did try finding a house in his school district, but didn't have any luck. After a full year lease term at the apartment, they will add a ""real estate"" clause that will allow us out of the lease (with proper notice) if we do find a house and purchase. This could give us more time to find a house in his district.

Additional information, which is mildly pertinent, we are getting married at the end of October- we are funding this 100% without help from our parents. Renting would provide us additional time to save up more money, after the wedding, and also more time to find the ""perfect"" house for us- rather than potentially rushing into this other home. Also- I do have other debts that I'm working to pay off, thankfully these do not impact my credit score at all. 

Currently we each have good credit scores, around 695-700, but obviously we could work to make them even better. We have approx $23,0000 saved- some of this is going towards our wedding, but some can also be used for closing/moving costs. Regardless of WHEN we purchase a home, we are using a First Time Homebuyer program that does not require a down payment and allows for seller to pay a portion of closing costs- our mortgage lender quoted our contribution to closing costs at approx $6,000 and the current mortgage interest rate at about 5%. The cost to sign a lease with the apartment would be approx $2,350. We'd be hiring movers regardless, so tack on an additional \~$600 to each.

I feel like the answer is clear, but we're just cautious to not jump at anything right now. We want to make a sound financial decision that will help us grow as a family.",finance
datascience,Every Kaggle Competition Submission is a carbon copy of each other -- is Kaggle even relevant for non-beginners?,"When I was first learning Data Science a while back, I was mesmerized by Kaggle (the competition) as a polished platform for self-education. I was able to learn how to do complex visualizations, statistical correlations, and model tuning on a slew of different kinds of data.

But after working as a Data Scientist in industry for few years, I now find the platform to be shockingly basic, and every submission a carbon copy of one another. They all follow the same, unimaginative, and repetitive structure; first import the modules (and write a section on how you imported the modules), then do basic EDA (pd.scatter\_matrix...), next do even more basic statistical correlation (df.corr()...) and finally write few lines for training and tuning multiple algorithms. Copy and paste this format for every competition you enter, no matter the data or task at hand. It's basically what you do for every take homes.

The reason why this happens is because so much of the actual data science workflow is controlled and simplified. For instance, every target variable for a supervised learning competition is given to you. In real life scenarios, that's never the case. In fact, I find target variable creation to be extremely complex, since it's technically and conceptually difficult to define things like churn, upsell, conversion, new user, etc.

But is this just me? For experienced ML/DS practitioners in industry, do you find Kaggle remotely helpful? I wanted to get some inspiration for some ML project I wanted to do on customer retention for my company, and I was led completely dismayed by the lack of complexity and richness of thought in Kaggle submissions. The only thing I found helpful was doing some fancy visualization tricks through plotly. Is Kaggle just meant for beginners or am I using the platform wrong?",technology
personalfinance,Payment strategy,"200k federal student loans (yes I know, dumb). 100k at 7% and 100k around 3%. 130k salary. 2k monthly expenses.

2. Minimum 401k for company match

personalfinance,Refinance into 30yr or 20yr?,"Hey all,

My primary residence is a 30yr fixed with 25yr remaining and im currently at 3.75.

Im watching the interest rates to refi closely through the summer and into the fall, as I believe I will he able to get a rate in the 2s at some point this year.

My question is what is the better strategy? Refi into a 30yr, and take the money saved with the lower payment and apply towards extra principle every month? Or refi into a 20yr and keep the same monthly payment?

My current thought process was to lock in a 30yr and just pay extra principle every month, so should something happen I can stop doing that and have a lower monthly minimum payment.

personalfinance,TSP retirement strategy,"I will have a unique opportunity this year to amplify my savings and investing strategy and I wanted your opinions to see what might be the most optimized route for financial planning. I am in the military I will be deploying for a year I and have three investment accounts. TSP, Roth IRA and Brokerage. Per the TSP website there are two limits that will apply to me this year Elective deferral Limit (19.5K) and Annual Additional Limit (57K) The criteria are as follows: 

""Elective Deferral Limit: Applies to combined total of traditional and Roth contributions. For members of the uniformed services, it includes all traditional and Roth contributions from taxable [basic pay](https://www.tsp.gov/sitehelp/glossary/glossary.html?term=BasicPay), [incentive pay](https://www.tsp.gov/sitehelp/glossary/glossary.html?term=IncentivePayUniformedServices), [special pay](https://www.tsp.gov/sitehelp/glossary/glossary.html?term=SpecialPayUniformedServices), and [bonus pay](https://www.tsp.gov/sitehelp/glossary/glossary.html?term=BonusPayUniformedServices), but does not apply to traditional contributions made from tax-exempt pay earned in a combat zone."" 

 ""Annual Addition Limit; An additional limit imposed on the total amount of all contributions made on behalf of an employee in a calendar year. This limit is per employer and includes employee contributions (tax-deferred, after-tax, and [tax-exempt](https://www.tsp.gov/sitehelp/glossary/glossary.html?term=TaxExemptContributions)), Agency/Service Automatic (1%) Contributions, and [Matching Contributions](https://www.tsp.gov/sitehelp/glossary/glossary.html?term=MatchingContributions). For 415(c) purposes, working for multiple Federal agencies or services in the same year is considered having one employer."" 

 ""**If you are a member of the uniformed services**, you should know that Roth contributions are subject to the elective deferral limit ($19,500 for 2020) even if they are contributed from tax-exempt pay. If you want to contribute tax-exempt pay toward the annual additions limit, you will have to elect traditional contributions for any amount over the elective deferral limit.""

""In addition, if you are eligible to make catch-up contributions and you are deployed to a designated combat zone, you will not be able to make any traditional catch-up contributions from your tax-exempt pay. However, Roth catch-up contributions from tax-exempt pay are allowed.""

Based on the information above when I reach my deployed location, my contribution limits will go from 19.5K to 57K. 19.5K will be allowed for ROTH TSP and 37.5K will be allowed for Traditional TSP. My current strategy is to front load my Traditional TSP so I reach the Elective Deferral Limit t of 19.5K just before I deploy so I can reap the tax benefits. In my deployed location I will convert back to ROTH TSP and contribute an additional 19.5K because the limit will now be a combined total of 57K. This brings me to 39K invested and I will have an additional 18K to invest before I reach the 57K limit. While in my deployed location I will be benefiting from Tax Free pay, I can choose to invest the last 18K into Traditional TSP or to my brokerage. The benefits of is going to TSP is I can grow it tax differed, however even though it was originally tax free pay, it will be taxed on withdrawal my current tax bracket is 12%. 

The second option I see is to invest the 18k into my brokerage(ROTH IRA is maxed already), I would pay taxes on dividends, however when I plan to use the money it would fall under long term capital gains which in my situation it would be taxed a 0% until I reach the next tax bracket.

personalfinance,Wife and I want to buy a house,"My wife and I have lived in our area for 6 years now while we went to college. We have both graduated and work in our fields making $15/hr (me) and $17.50/hr (her). Both of our jobs are pretty secure and we like the area we live in. Unfortunately the average cost of a single family home in our area is $400K and far outside our budget, however we have found several condos in the $200K to $240K range which we believe is affordable. Before taxes each month we bring home around $4,900 and after taxes its in the range of $3,700. 

I have some student loans about $50K which I have budgeted $495/month to be paid off in 10 years all of which are federal students loans about 50/50 sub and unsub at interest rates of 3-4.95%. My wife has zero student debt. We currently spend $950 on rent, which is about $100 to $200 less than the average for my town so I am worried that it will go up in price, especially as the complex was just bought by another company. Our other household expenses add up to about $800/month and fun money of about $450/month. We also have zero credit card debt or auto loans. Both of our credit scores are above 750 and we have credit histories of at least 6 years.

We have been preapproved for a home loan of $230k from our local bank with closing costs of $6,000 at 3.1% and 30yr loan, but are also shopping around at a few local mortgage brokers and some larger lenders to see if we can get anything better.

Currently we save about $1,000/month and have an investment account containing $30K, have a $7,000 emergency fund with plans to hit $10K before the end of the year.

The expected costs of a condo are: $10-$15K down out of our investment account, with taxes, pmi and insurance we expect to pay $1,600/month, plus $195/month HOA fees (which include water, sewer, garbage, and snow removal) there will also be increased gas price adding about an extra $100/month.

&amp;#x200B;

So last year we spent on average $2,200/month on essentials, fun, and debts with the rest going towards savings.

If we buy a condo we expect to spend $2,900/month (until we hit 20% and can drop $100-$200 due to not needing pmi). Does this sound managable to you folks, because to me it sounds ok if maybe a little tight?",finance

While I would love to be debt free, getting to that point faster would prevent me from growing my assets significantly in the next 3-5 years. A tough pill to swallow since I feel a bit behind the curve at my age. What option makes the most sense?

Federal student loan (27k @ 5%)

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Halving Is Almost Here: Will Bitcoin Go to the Moon?,"Positive signs for Bitcoin have been increasing in different spaces, and the bullish trend seems to be more and more realistic. 

This is not the first time an event called halving has happened on the Bitcoin (BTC) network. The first halving took place in 2012; the second halving took place in 2016. Now, the third halving is expected, and like the previous ones, it will halve the reward for the calculated Bitcoin block. Originally, the reward for the calculated block was 50 BTC. Since then, the reward has been reduced to 25 and 12.5 BTC — and is about to be reduced to 6.75 BTC.

The upcoming halving, however, differs from previous halvings in that much more people are involved in the crypto industry. New opportunities have emerged, including ones for big players to manipulate the price of Bitcoin. Among the financial instruments available to large players, there are also stock options and futures on Bitcoin. There has also been a significant increase in people’s awareness of what cryptocurrencies are. Even those who used to be far away from digital currency have learned about what is expected in the Bitcoin network.

In the long term, an event such as the halving will only affect the price of a digital currency by increasing its hash rate. The hash rate and Bitcoin prices have a correlation between each other. The higher the hash rate, the harder it is to calculate new blocks and the less Bitcoin enters the market. On the contrary, a decrease in the hash rate is beneficial for miners, as it allows them to earn more BTC. Although they perform one task, all miners compete with one another.

In the short term, the network hash rate will decrease. This is due to the disconnection of old equipment by the miners, which, at current electricity prices, will no longer be able to operate profitably. This has already happened in the first and second halving of the Bitcoin network. At first, the BTC hash rate, together with the BTC rate, decreased and then increased significantly. As we have already seen from previous halvings, a noticeable bullish movement started about a year after the event and lasted several months.

The year is about the period of time that miners need for technical re-equipment. By purchasing new, more powerful equipment, Bitcoin miners significantly improve the network together. The offer of new BTCs on the market is simultaneously reduced with the growth of the hash rate. Seeing the beginning of growth, the miners begin to hold on to the digital currency in order to part with it at the highest possible price. This is how the peaks in the Bitcoin price chart occur.

The expected halving has a psychological aspect as well. Since the markets of cryptocurrencies and traditional markets have correlated with each other, the fall of the markets due to the coronavirus pandemic has also led to the fall of all digital currencies. However, Bitcoin has shown better recovery dynamics than S&amp;P 500, SSE Index, Nikkei and even gold. Coronavirus topics continue to be at the top of news publications. Because of this, an event like the halving, at first, partly went into the shadows and now is attracting more and more interest. Google Trends indicates that people actively look for information about what the Bitcoin halving is. The event for the network is undoubtedly positive, and if not today, it will promote purchases in the foreseeable future.

There are increasing signs that Bitcoin is being chosen as an alternative to fiat currencies. Thus, research at Grayscale’s Bitcoin Investment Trust and other analysts have said that new investors have not even heard about the Bitcoin halving. Their concerns are quite different: what the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said about money as “unlimited pot,” and how President Donald Trump promises to print trillions of dollars to overcome the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic. More financial institutions have been investing in digital currency. Grayscale, which manages the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, reported that 88% of investments in Q1 2020 were from institutional investors. In terms of technical analysis, Bitcoin is also doing well: Three key resistance levels have been already surpassed simultaneously — the 200-day simple moving average, the 200-day exponential moving average, and the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. A fixation above the $10,500 level may mean the beginning of a bullish trend right now.",cryptocurrency

What I plan on doing I'm going to be paying around 30% or more in cash and then getting the rest on a short car loan since I have a ~750 credit score.  
Where I got to a hiccup was investigating car loan options, I noted some younger/first time buyers with a score like mine encountering higher loan rates than what would be expected for their score due to issues with credit history/diversity.

$1,500 on a car for my sister (12.49%)

I pay more than the minimum on each. This month I have a third paycheck coming and my tax refund, which should add up to a minimum of $1800.
I have $1000 in savings and $160 goes into it every month. I’m also cutting out expenses for things not being used, like gym and clearing out a storage unit (frees up about $160).

I know from the “how to handle $” that I should pay off high interest things first (like my credit card). The thing is, I hope to buy a house a year from now, and was going to save the tax refund and third check for it.

So my question is, should I just use my tax return and third paycheck to pay off everything that I can (card and car)? Or should I just continue to pay normally and put that $1800 towards a house down payment?

gaming,Need help finding this dragon game,"Hello everyone,

This is the first post I ever made so bare with me. I am trying to find an old dragon game.

I used to have this online friend who went by the username ''Risaad''. We were good friends. At home she didn't have any internet or WiFi surprisingly and she always talked to me when she was somewhere else. She used to go to a library where she would have connection and talk to me and play her game on a public library computer.

Of course that was around... 3 years ago I'd guess... 

She used to be obsessed with a dragon game which was on a browser and she made me play it too and registering, but I stopped because it wasn't my thing.

I've been trying to find it for the past 2 hours in the hopes that she would still play it, knowing how awesome she found it. Filled with frustration of not finding it and not much hope left I thought I'd post on Reddit in the hopes for help or someone knowing the game.

The game looked similar to another browser game called ''Dragon Cave'' or let's say had the same vibe.  
You had to feed your dragons so they wouldn't starve, there were factions, you could breed them and whatever more that I don't remember. It was a 2D game and was properly made with pictures and all, unlike ''Dragon Cave''.

economy,Gold standard? Federal Reserve?,"Gold standard? End the Federal Reserve?

I'm pretty sure this has been debated before and asked a lot in this forum but pardon me being new here.

I am a history major and have been trying to read as much about economics as I can during my spare time. I'm about finished with Gregory Mankiw's *Principles of Macroeconomics* and plan to read his *Principles of Microeconomics* soon enough. I have also read Thomas Sowell's *Basic Economics* and am about halfway through reading Henry Hazlitt's *Economics in One Lesson.* I have also recently seen Milton Friedman's *Free to Choose* and also plan on reading his works, as well as Friedrich Hayek and Frederick Bastiat.

One of the topics I really want to delve into is in regard to the merits of having a Federal Reserve and whether it is more beneficial to go back to a gold standard. I think that there is an economic consensus that the money supply has a great correlation with the level of inflation and the value of the dollar, as the more that is printed, the more worthless the dollar becomes, and the less printed it is, the more worth it becomes. Particularly also, fiat currency tends to be valued only in, so, far, as there is confidence in the financial systems.

For this reason, there seems to be two issues and questions at hand. The first one is if it would be more beneficial to go back to a gold standard? I understand that there are various ways in which this could occur. This could include going back to the physical use of gold as money, pegging the dollar back to gold, or begging it to some other commodity such as Bitcoin. The purpose of any of these approaches is to control the money supply by something that is finite and hence limited in nature.

This seems to solve the problem of controlling the quantity of the dollar. Some have criticized the gold standard due to the overly restricted circulation of currency that has historically led to deflationary, as opposed to inflationary periods, which could be just as devastating as inflationary periods.

The second question and problem concern the Federal Reserve. To what extent is it beneficial to have a Fed? Should the Fed be reconstructed, and or more heavily regulated? Should we outright do away with the Fed? Or should the Fed be kept the way it is? On the one hand, it makes sense in theory to have an institution such as the Fed to help regulate banks, ensuring that things such as bank runs, and or banking disasters are preventing. It also seems sensible in theory to have an institution such as the Fed, which is independent of the government, to help in coordinating monetary policy.

However, in practice, it also seems that the Fed has often been the cause of such disasters such as the Great Depression and the Great Recession by creating boom and bust cycles through arbitrarily changing interest rates, and through its various tactics at influencing monetary policy and controlling the money supply. A similar, yet different issue would be laws passed by the government encouraging risky lending such as forcing financial institutions, whether private or public to give out bad loans to risky people such as those who can't afford to take the loan.

Would it not make more sense to simply let the ""invisible hand"" (the forces of supply and demand) to allocate the money supply and interest rates? If there is more demand for borrowing this will push interest rates up, as banks and other financial institutions would want to charge higher interests and they would ideally want to be careful as to who they are lending money to. If there is a greater demand for saving than lending, this would push interest rates down as banks would not want to give out as much money in interest and other financial institutions would want to encourage more borrowing.

I would appreciate any resource recommendations whether they be books or other media platforms that you think do a good job at tackling any of these two issues.",finance

stocks,Stocks will drop if Real Estate collapses.,"I think we are in a period of literal FOMO and disclaimer I have a lot of stock right now and couldn't be happier seeing the portfolio green. But I think the trigger or first ""domino"" will be real estate. 

As the stimulus checks and assurances of the fed run out, and the aid not reaching the most affected, this will be the catalyst for a big drop. Large companies who are still operating today are cutting forecasts and initiatives for the year...this means contractors/vendors/jobs. Small businesses are getting routed...As mainly a real-estate investor for 20 years, people who are looking to sell their houses and particularly those who bought as investments, cannot sell due to the current environment and with no one able to get out to see places/registration offices closed. 

Once restrictions are relaxed even more, we will see the true nature of the economy, and I believe this starts with the banks. With a lot of people defaulting on mortgages buying at extremely high prices, they'll end up moving back in with their parents. This is something the FED cannot dictate, where my timeline is late September/ beginning of October.

I'm all for holding a long time, but this is the only scenario where I could see a significant impact.",finance

personalfinance,Gifted 15k - Now what?,"So I just finished graduate school and my aunt surprised me with a $15,000 check. I'm a first-gen student who worked full-time and financed my college education with loans/grants so this was incredibly generous.

Now I've not always made the best financial decisions so I thought it would be best to turn to all of you for some support. My dad thinks that I should take the money and use it as a down payment for a house in a low cost area that I can rent out (this is what he did when he was my age). I would love to invest in something like this, but I'm afraid he doesn't understand my current financial situation well enough and that might not be the best choice for me.

I'm 26 and currently make 65k/year plus benefits. I also live in one of the most expensive cities in the US. I have a secure job contract until the end of September but after that it's hard to say because my field is on a complete hiring freeze due to COVID. So I may be unemployed come October.

I have a credit score of 705, a car that will be completely paid off in 6 months and I plan to drive that for at least 5 more years, savings of only about $3,000, and then a credit card balance of $3,500.

Now here's the kicker - I have $80,000 in student loans. These are all federal loans and most of them are at a decent interest rate but a few are higher than I would like them to be.

So what do I do, PF? Do I pay down all my loans starting with the highest interest rates? Do I put this check into my savings incase I hit hard times in an impending financial crisis? Do I invest in a property like my dad wants me to?",finance

personalfinance,How did it come to be legal that interest rates at banks can be so tilted in favor of the banks?,"I was wondering if someone could shed light on how polarized interest rates are in banking. Like how did it evolve that banks can charge 6 to 26% interest rates on credit lines and credit cards and lines of equity etc. but then savings account interest rates are almost nothing. I just got on US Banks website and out of curiosity looked up interest rates for various savings accounts. They range from 0.01% to 0.05%. One of them has a $10 a month maintenance fee. So if my math is correct, the account that requires a $100 minimum deposit will cost you $120 dollars a year to keep open, and the interest you will have earned in that year will be...5 cents. Meanwhile you get charged 26% on a credit card from the same bank. How did banking get to be like this and why is this legal/fair?",finance

Global corporates have announced $820 billion in buybacks this year, which has exceeded selling by traditional investors. That's been supportive to the market as a whole, since when companies reduce their outstanding share count by repurchasing units, it lifts the per-share value of the remaining stock. In addition, companies have $1.3 trillion in pending mergers and acquisitions, which he says also supports the equity market. ""

Per WSJ

BlackRock will steer as much as $750 billion into the corporate debt market for the Fed.

BlackRock is acting as a fiduciary to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,” a firm spokesman said in a written statement.

BlackRock will execute this mandate at the sole discretion of the Bank, and in accordance with their detailed investment guidelines,” he said, “in order to provide broad support to credit markets and achieve the government’s objective of supporting access to credit for US employers and supporting the American economy.

The Fed had said it would intervene substantially in money-market funds, and would shift its purchases of Treasury bills toward a broader range of maturities. Then on March 23 it unveiled sweeping measures. It said it would purchase all kinds of bonds, pledging to do whatever was needed to shore up the economy.

The Fed first focused on the highest-rated companies, those least likely to default. It wrestled with a question: What about companies that would be highly rated except that coronavirus-related troubles had cut them to junk? Would it be right to leave them out? When the Fed said on April 9 it would buy fallen-angel bonds too, its word sparked a bond rally long before any Fed buying.

As part of its role, BlackRock would buy bond ETFs. Fed officials saw this as a way to buoy broad swaths of the market rapidly, said a person with knowledge of their thinking.",finance
personalfinance,Should I buy this car,"Hi everyone. I know it’s late but hopefully you all can help me tonight or tomorrow. 
So I am looking at a 2017 4Runner TRD trail with 32k and the KDSS suspension. It’s white, it was a lease vehicle, never been smoked in. Not a ding across the body, 8 month old tires and no problems on the interior. Other 4runners like this that I’ve looked at are over 6k more in price before dealer and hands king fees which seem to be averaging around 1500 dollars. 

I currently have a 2007 FJ Cruiser with 184k on it, a cracked windshield, needs a new CV axel, tires are needing to be replaced, and the roof paint is peeling. I currently owe 7k on it with a 6.5 interest rate and my payments are 284 a month. 

Looking at dealerships the most I’ve been offered on the FJ is 5-6k, leaving 1k left to owe. The reason I want to a new vehicle is because I have a 6 year old daughter and the FJ is a tank. You feel and hear every small bump and pebble in the road, it’s loud, and getting my daughter in and out is just.. annoying. I planned to do a lot with the FJ but over the years I found that I don’t have a need for an overland as I drive to a trail and then backpack my way out, not really into hardcore 4 wheeling anymore. 

Here is the breakdown of the numbers of the new 4Runner.

reg and filing fees            43.50
-------------------------------------------------
total financeable amount  $33,159.97

My biggest fear is that in 3-4 years I’ll want to get something else and I just want to make sure I don’t end up upside down. This guy I’m dealing with will give me 7k minimum and possibly 500-1000 more as he’s waiting to get a few final offers in. My biggest questions are do the numbers make sense? Will I get enough in a few years for trade in on the 4Runner to where I’m not “upside down”? 

My finances are this:

I make anywhere between 2200-2800 normally every two weeks. My rent is 1650 and insurance is about 135. Other monthly bills are about $580. Also, I have about 9k in savings. 

Any advice would be great and appreciated. Thank you.

This is my first post on reddit, I surfed around a bit because I didn't want to ask the same question that other people have asked, but I didn't find a result that satisfied me, so here we are.

I recently landed a job as a Public Safety Dispatcher making $19.40 an hour. My boyfriend makes $11.36 an hour (we're praying he becomes a Detention Officer, they make $16.27 an hour... ANYWHO). I did the math and together we'd be making roughly 64k a year (before taxes). We are planning to move in together in July; we will have about $5,500 saved for our apartment by then. The apartment we have applied for is $1,059 per month (plus a $20 pet rent, making it $1,079 before literally..... everything else). I'm stressed out because this will be my first time ever moving out so I don't know if this is in the safe zone. I want to leave us with enough money for all the other bills, and just money in our accounts in general.

So, I guess my question is, is $1,079 rent per month affordable for 64k a year?

Everyone talks about how it’s FOMO that’s driving prices up the wall. But because they aren’t allowed to, no one ever talks about the puppet masters behind the scenes. Yes, maybe the retail trade sector has some nominal influence to an extent but the real clout is held by the big guns. AND the exchanges that the populace punt on. That’s why, if you’ll notice, the markets move in almost perfect lockstep. They move these massive blocks at the precise time of their choosing. No one ever talks about how the institutions know exactly where the market is going at any given point in time not because they can predict the future but because they are the ones that manipulate it and set the prices.

Who came out and called the bottom after the smoke cleared and the dust settled? Larry Fink who advises Trump and heads BlackRock, a firm that has been tasked by the Fed to run several stimulus programmes, and strategists’ at Goldman Sachs, among others. Rick Rieder, also of BlackRock, sits on a committee of the New York Fed. The lion’s share of the newly printed stimulus trillions is flooding into their coffers and washing out all the bad debt. Voila, their books are squeaky clean all of a sudden. Where do they pour this fresh cash? Into the markets, inflating it and thereby locking out everyone else.

In this thinly-veiled vulgar display of crony capitalism, they have flaunted that they will never be held accountable and thus the same tired behaviour will continue ad infinitum, and the next decade/s-long bull market will no doubt be a repeat of the infantile card pyramid debt-stacking that we’ve all seen eventually fall over and over, time and time again, the mess promptly swept under the rug by Uncle Sam in a mammy apron. 

Meanwhile, stimulus for main street and the working class quickly runs out, having been reduced to sloppy seconds by the ruling class who must always have their fill first, yields of anything other than equities, and maybe gold, are negative or at best infinitesimal, market valuations are at exorbitant and hardly-justifiable all-time highs, and the commonfolk are once again caught holding the bag with a quickly-sinking economy, ever-increasing and never-before-seen levels of unemployment and rapidly-rotting debt, and of course, the piece-de-resistance, the cherry on the creampie, a horrendously-manhandled health crisis, haphazardly steered by a drunk driver who’s only destination is reelection, passengers’ destination be damned.

personalfinance,Advice Needed - Refinance Mortgage (to higher amount) to pay off debt?,"Hi Everyone - I need some external advice. Throw away account since talking about personal finances. 

I received an offer from a mortgage company to refi my home to a lower interest rate (currently at 4.75% and offered to refi at 4.15%) with a cashout offer since I have a pretty good amount of credit card debt to pay off. Currently every month I am really struggling to pay all my minimum payments on my debt without pulling from savings to cover for it. It's making it pretty much impossible for me to make any headway with savings or really paying anything down. The debt is made up of CC payments and a personal loan - all in for payments I am currently at $4700 per month. 

My current mortgage on my house is at $328k - I purchased for $374k back in 2018. I don't have any plans to move any time soon. The refinance offer I received would have a mortgage of $390k - with a part of that going to come to me as a cashout to be used to pay off debt. I think the current value of my home is right around that $390k - to $400k. 

After I calculated the new mortgage payment plus the remaining bills I would have (personal loan and utilities) the new monthly all in for payments would be $4100 per month. I would use that extra $600 per month to pay down my personal loan faster and to start building up savings more. 

My question is - is it crazy to go for this higher mortgage amount with the current economy and housing market? I don't plan on selling soon but I also don't want to get in a situation where my house is worth less than what I owe on a mortgage. I can't seem to find a way to really make a strong dent in my debt in my current position (putting all my available funds to the debt), but I don't want to shoot myself in the foot for future either.

My credit utilization ratio has regrettably gone up over the last year and now that I have a decent chunk of savings built up, I'd like to put it in action.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

worldpolitics,One Canadian's View on Trump and Korean Baseball,"One Canadian’s View on Trump and Korean Baseball

This weekend is going to bring the return of many activities that until a few months ago we all took for granted.  The majority of U.S. states will be relaxing CoVid-19 mitigation strategies against the advice of scientists involved in pandemic response and against the pleading of doctors and nurses on the front lines.  They will also be acting against the will of the majority of Americans according to recent polls, and ironically these states will be contravening federal guidelines previously set out by Trump’s own Corona Task Force.  

Contrary to Trump’s delusional musings, the return of warm weather will do nothing to slow the spread of the virus.  On the contrary, the warm weather will have the obvious effect of luring people outdoors…even those previously zealous about their isolation will start to rationalize reasons to make an exception and take the risk to venture out.  “Honey, did you see the weather?  I have been perfect for 6 weeks now…just a quick 18 holes and I am right back to lockdown.  I’m fine on the golf course…all wide open spaces, and besides Frank and I will stay 6 feet apart”, or “Did you see the surf today?  The beach should be fine if I’m careful”.  Etc. etc.

Yes with the White House reversing its state of national emergency there will be lots of options when planning ahead for this weekend.   The women of Georgia and Arizona for example will be busy setting appointments for a cut and color and to have their nail extensions done, while their men hurry to get their “I eat CoVid for Breakfast” tattoos.  After all they want to be looking their best when they go down to the local 10-pin to bowl a few frames on Saturday night.  

Even those of us grounded in reality yet unwilling to re-enter the still infected community have a long awaited option available to us as of this week.  Baseball!  That’s right, the return of baseball to television.  Unfortunately, we won’t be seeing the faces that we expected to see at the plate…no Mike Trout or Aaron Judge this season.  No Red Sox…No Yankees.  I won’t get to watch my developing young Toronto Blue Jays line-up, BUT still its pro baseball, and it’s live!  There are millions of starving ball fans in N. America, and replays of the 2010 season just isn’t cutting it.  

The daily baseball games that began airing on ESPN2 this week are broadcasts of the Korean Baseball Organization (KBO), and are complete with socially-distanced cheerleaders and cut-outs of mask-wearing fans in many of the stadium seats.  Although games air live in the middle of the night, many are being rebroadcast the following day.  The ability to bet a couple of bucks on DraftKings and kill a few hours watching ball will be a welcome addition to the daily lockdown routine.  

This brings me to the point of writing this piece.  Each KBO game that airs on ESPN should be a stark reminder to every American watching of the incredible FAILURE of the Trump administration to deal with the global pandemic crisis that is CoVid-19.  

On Jan. 19 both the USA and S. Korea had their first known CoVid patients presenting  at emergency rooms.  Within days the Koreans were developing their CoVid testing infrastructure, while Trump was denying that the virus presented ANY threat to Americans.  By the end of February both countries were aware of community spread, but while the Koreans had already tested close to 100,000 citizens the States had tested only 3,300!  Trump, his pathological mendacity now costing lives, told America that the Corona virus should magically disappear with the coming warm weather, and that he had things “totally under control”.  Korea had 3,700 confirmed cases while the U.S. had but 74.

Which brings us to today.  Trump’s utter ineptitude and failure to act in any meaningful leadership capacity has cost the U.S. 80,000 lives!  South Korea on the other hand has kept mortality to under 300 people, and has seen several days during which there were no new cases identified.  Testing and tracing protocol has been well established.  Any new identified cluster of cases can be quickly isolated to prevent further spread, which means that the country has opened back up, non-quarantined life is resuming, and the Korean Baseball Org. plays ball.

Modern mankind is facing perhaps its greatest challenges to date, and what we will be left with after this medical and economic calamity has passed in the coming years is currently anyone’s guess.  The complexity and scope of the problem is almost unimaginable, and is just starting to be understood by governments and analysts around the globe.  We are learning that shutting down a society is much quicker and easier than starting it back up…at least while there is a killer virus looming.

One thing that we do know is that the speed and efficiency of a country’s national response to a pandemic (driven by clear, unified messaging) determines its population’s outcome.  It is quite obvious to me that the move toward the reopening of a functioning economy with re-established supply chains, carried out with minimum risk, demands platinum-level expertise advising co-ordinated leadership, both nationally (and eventually across nations).  

Simple as that.  The contrast is clear: South Korea demonstrating a “gold standard” response versus the USA with the DISASTER that is Donald Trump at the helm, where the virus is currently killing the equivalent of a 9-11 attack EVERY DAY in the States!  Had he responded with coherent effective NATIONAL leadership countless 1,000’s of lives would already have been spared.  There are currently 283 total deaths due to CoVid in S. Korea versus approx. 80,000 in the U.S. and that’s just the beginning.  Almost 250 times the deaths per capita for little other reason than Trump’s utter ineptitude and failure to act!

So I say to all of you hurting sports fans not stupid enough to pay attention to Dumb Donny and run out to your local Wild- Wings for some draft beer and corona-laden banter, give the KBO a try.  Who knows, you may even end up liking it.  But every time that you find yourself pining for the familiar stadiums, announcers and of course players, let it be a sobering reminder of the failures of the worst administration in American history.  Go Kia Tigers!

personalfinance,Should I consider debt consolidation?,"Good morning!

A few years back I was stuck in a low-paying job, during which time my wife and I took on a substantial amount of credit card debt to stay afloat. Our income has since doubled, and we even recently paid off one of our two credit cards (wooo!). But, we still have the giant card looming over us with roughly a $9,900 balance. The interest rate is right around 18%.

We're chipping away at this card, but I'm wondering if a personal loan that clears the card might be a better option? Our credit score is currently at 630, and has been climbing fairly quickly now that we've paid off the other card. Still, this card utilization is at 9900/11000, which is killing our credit score.

We'd love to think about a house and these credit card interest rates really hurt how much we can save. Would a personal loan to cover this be a  good idea?

Minimum payment is 2,127.61

I currently pay that plus $700 a month on principal.

The only reason I was looking at a refi is because I've had some problems with my current loan (big bank) provider, and a local credit union is running a deal where they'll cover closing costs on a refi.

Here are my two options.

120 months – 2.99% - Monthly Payment of $2,574,  not including escrow for taxes and insurance

180 months – 3.50% - Monthly Payment of $1,907, not including escrow for taxes and insurance

The only reason I'm hesitant is the 120 month adds about 400 a month to my minimum payments, and that's not counting escrow stuff, so it's likely a little higher than the 2800 a month I'm paying. 

Also, I know that generally they save you money if you're going the full life of a loan, but where I'd have mine paid off early does that matter? I'm having trouble figuring out the math here.

My question is- Is it a good idea and what credit cards come with say a flat one time fee for a cash advance or a personal loan around 4-5% APR?

I will incur some loss while sending the money but that will be offset by the current exchange rate since I originally borrowed the money when $ was not as strong against the foreign currency as it is today.

personalfinance,Buying a home to live in for 2 years and then use as investment property (rent)?,"Hello all! I have been a long time lurker and really have learned a lot about personal finance through this sub. So I thank you all for that. Today I come to the community with a question on whether it makes financial sense (as opposed to other investments) for my wife and I to purchase a home that we only plan on living in for a few years and then rent it for FUTURE 'passive' income. Ages: 25

We live in the Minneapolis area where is seems like the rental and home buying market is pretty strong. Right now we are renting a \~300k house for a little over 2k a month. We would like to put that money towards equity on a house (I know, everyone says this) but with the hopes to really turn it into an investment property for the future. We plan on being in the area for another 2 years (at least) but then may look to move 3 hours away (towards where we grew up) for a lower cost of living change and to be near family. 

So, we are looking to buy a house in the 250-350k range in a very similar location to where we are now where we also understand the rental market. Obviously picking houses that would give us the best positive cash flow after mortgage payment, prop taxes and insurance. Our families have history renting houses (so we know kinda what to expect), but in lower cost of living areas that tend to show more ""bad renters"" then good. I have experience doing carpentry work and interior ""fix's"" so I feel that it does give us the added bonus that most NON-Major repairs can be done by myself.

Financial related facts:

* Wife and I's combined income: \~140k annually
* Jobs: Licensed CPA, and Software Engineer (current jobs are very secure)
* Debt: None
* Retiremnt: $401K's (Roth) and Roth IRA's maxed every year with \~55k in each 401k and 15k in each Roth IRA
* Health: Maxed HSA with 5k in each of ours and high deductible health plans through work
* Assets worth noting for this questions purpose: Full carpenters tool set (saws, drills, etc) 2 &lt;6 year old cars paid off, \~100k in investment stock (not willing to liquidate).
* Have financing secured up to **400k** at a fixed **3.0%** (family owned financial company) interest rate.

So, what do you all think. In our position does it make sense to buy a house we only plan on living in for 2-3 years? We are looking it as an investment property and not JUST a house that we pay towards instead of rent. But the latter is a nice bonus.

However, my private student loans are crushing me. I had paid them down to twenty-four thousand through summer jobs, and then when my initial deferment from college ended, I was somehow up to thirty-thousand.

My only other debt is a car payment.  


My question is whether or not I can (ethically and legally) use the federal loans to pay off a large bulk of my private loans. The federal loan payments are much smaller (especially right now), and I can use programs that are designed to help do-gooders like me to pay it off. If I can do it, how do I do it?

I was accepted for Fall 2020 to multiple programs for a 2-year MS in Health Administration. I am currently choosing between CSU Northridge and USC (University of Southern California). The schools are equally accredited by CAHME and both have great post-graduate employment rates.

I am holding back from accepting USC due to the cost. I would have to take out about $90,000 in federal unsubsidized loans at about a 6% interest rate. At CSU Northridge I would require NO loans and am being given $6000 in grants a year for a total of $12000. The degree would cost me under $10,000 easily.

Is the prestige of USC worth the student loan debt? Could I earn this amount in scholarships? How has your personal experience with student loans been?

investing,Goldman Says Stocks Due for 18% Drop After Rally Driven by FOMO,"In the equity market, fear of missing out seems to be overshadowing fear of all that’s wrong with the economy. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. says pessimism will soon get the upper hand and send the S&amp;P 500 Index down almost 20% in the next three months.

Fiscal and monetary support over the past few weeks of the coronavirus pandemic successfully warded off a financial crisis, but a return to economic normalcy is still a long ways away and investors have gotten ahead of themselves, the bank’s chief U.S. equity strategist, David Kostin, wrote in a report.

Financial, economic and political risks darken the outlook for domestic equities, Goldman warns. The bank cites the lack of flattening in the U.S. infection curve outside of New York, what promises to be a lengthy re-start process, a 50% hit to buybacks in 2020 and the risk of higher corporate taxes and de facto consumption taxes if U.S.-China trade tensions bubble up again.

“A single catalyst may not spark a pullback, but a number of concerns and risks exist that we believe, and our client discussions confirm, investors are downplaying,” Kostin wrote. Goldman says the S&amp;P 500 will probably drop to 2,400 over the next three months before it rebounds to 3,000 by year end.

The index slumped 0.5% Monday to 2,914 as of 9:45 a.m. in New York.


Kostin notes that large swaths of the investor community have failed to cash in on the S&amp;P 500’s 31% surge since its trough on March 23. He points out that most mutual funds have underperformed since the bear market low, with long/short and macro hedge funds posting single-digit returns as a group, and investors may face pressure to chase the rally.

“The ‘fear of missing out’ best describes the thought process,” Kostin said.

Futures positioning shows investors still doubt S&amp;P 500 rebound

But he warns that it’s a risky move. Even with measures of the breadth of the recent rally improving in recent days -- potentially signaling more buy-in on the idea the gains will last -- Goldman Sachs’ sentiment indicator has barely improved since mid-March.

“Skepticism abounds regarding the likelihood the rally will continue,” the strategist writes.

relates to Goldman Says Stocks Due for 18% Drop After Rally Driven by FOMO
Kostin is pessimistic on the outlook for corporate profits, citing frozen growth plans and capital expenditures will drop 27% this year. He points out that the only encouraging driver for earnings is the swelling federal deficit, which in effect acts as substantial support for demand.

Caution on equities may also be warranted in the face of stretched valuations -- to the extent that anything about 2021’s bottom-line outlook can be discerned.

The benchmark U.S. stock gauge trades at 19.5 times the buy side’s estimate of next year’s earnings, Kostin concludes, the highest level since 2002.

personalfinance,Upside-down on a 12.15% car loan. What can I do?,"So, I bought my first ever car back in 2017. I completely screwed up every process of buying the car. I didn't test drive enough models (I could have either gotten something more fun or more practical for around the same price), didn't research all of my funding options, didn't have a good credit score (a situation of my own doing, which in and of itself was because I didn't have a budget--a problem that I've since solved), and allowed myself to be upsold on dealer services I didn't even really need; any repairs to my vehicle would have been less than what I paid for the insurance anyway.

Now I owe 14k on a car that is worth between 6-8k according to Kelly Blue Book, considering its in ""Fair"" condition (it needs a new hood), I'm getting shafted in interest, and Capital One, who offered me a refinance, turned me down since the car is too far upside down (probably for the better, considering my credit score is 648, and I would have still gotten screwed, just maybe slightly less screwed).

Currently, I make ~66K/yr and I pay 349.37/mo on the car loan, almost half of which is going to interest. My monthly income is ~5k/mo and ~3k of that is spent on bills, rent, and other expenses, ~2k of which is debt (between the credit cards and loans). What, if any, options do I have to make this situation better?

My rent is $500/mo, utilities included.

My credit card debts are as follows:

* Capital One:
      * Current Balance: 1910
      * Interest rate: 24.9
* Discover:
    * Current Balance: $2306
    * Interest rate: 22.99

    * Current Balance: $1428
    * Interest rate: 22.24
* PayPal Credit:
    * Current Balance: 1553
    * Interest rate: 25.49

I'll definitely have it all paid off before the year is out assuming I don't get laid off.

* Pay-off quote: 14,584
* Interest rate: 12.25

personalfinance,Dropping interest rates on savings,"I received another email as I’m sure a handful of you did as well from Ally that the Fed has dropped interest rates again, causing Ally to drop theirs another quarter of a point.

This has been at least the second email of this nature I have received in the past couple months. When I first joined Ally I believe my APY was around 2.25%.

personalfinance,"About to start medical school, how do I manage my money?","Hello r/personalfinance, I am in my mid 20's and will soon be starting medical school this July. I chose the cheapest school I was accepted to which will cost about $50k in tuition/year. I should add that I have also found reasonable housing with a roommate for $500/month. I am very fortunate since my grandparents left me one of their investment properties which generates $700/month of profit but could be sold for $450k. (the amount left on the 30 yr mortgage is approximately 250k) 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, should I keep the property, live off the $700/month and take a federal direct unsubsidized loan at 6.08% with 1.059% fees to pay for tuition (50k/year)

or

should I sell the property, and use the money to fund medical school and living expenses for those 4 years. This would cause me to have no loans, but I lose out on $700/month for possibly a long time and the property possibly appreciating in value over time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure if this information helps but the specialties I am interested in range anywhere from 300k to 400k salary per year and require 3-4 years of residency following medical school where I would be making \~50k.

personalfinance,Is Universal Life Insurance Ever a Good Idea?

I'm definitely no expert, but based on what I've read so far it doesn't seem like a good idea. The particular plan my mom chose seems absolutely terrible. Luckily there haven't been too many contributions to it.  I want to make sure I'm not missing anything and losing out on more by closing it out than keeping it. 

It was purchased when my grandma was 61. At the time she quit smoking but has since started smoking again. She is now 70. This seemed like something important to point out?

* Coverage Name: Universal Life 
* Face Amount\*: $30,000.00

* Maximum Loan Available: $1,734
* Net Cash Surrender Value: $1,880
* Planned periodic Premium: $279.00 

From what I' understand, we've contributed 8 payments of $279 = $2,232, which has grown to the cash value of $3,025.02? If I were to pull out all the money from this account, would it just be cash value minus the surrender charge? $3,025.02 - $1,144.50 = \~$1,881?

personalfinance,Physician mortgage loan / Doctor mortgage Loan questions,"Hello! I am. DVM and my fiance is an MD finishing up his residency. He will start his adult job October 5th.

We are looking to move and purchase a house with a doctor loan / physician mortgage loan. This is to live in ourselves.

I understand the interest rates are typically higher for these but advantage to us is certainly the lower down payment and no PMI. The loans we have looked at are either 0% or 5% downpayment which is easily doable for us. His parents are gifting 10K towards downpayment which is amazing. Even without it, we can afford the downpayment ourselves.

We are looking for homes in the 700-850K range in Atlanta, Ga area. I don't think a conventional loan will work out for us due to the down payment hurdle otherwise.

We have no student debt, excellent credit scores 800+ each, and good amount of savings. Once he starts his job, he will also get a sign on bonus on top of his significantly increased salary.

My question is how many mortgage lenders should we apply with when shopping for rates? We are looking to apply soon as we have found a good house that we both love that is reasonably priced at the lower end of our price range.

Any particular pitfalls of doctor loans we should know about?

How much higher are interest rates compared to conventional loans?

Any good experiences with these types of loans?

We are very new to to mortgage and home buying experience and would love any advice available.",finance

personalfinance,"To go abroad or stay home, weighing student loans","I'm currently graduating college with a humanities BA and some computer science work experience. My total student loan debt is 45k across 4 loans (most of which was the university forcing aid onto me, so I couldn't not take it to get other financial benefits), with an average interest rate of 3.2%. Currently the only gainful employment I have is freelance work, some web development here and there, and the potential to work with a company doing online media work for around 30k a year's contract.

Reality of the situation is that I don't make a lot, and due to physical limitations the place where I will be living is virtually inaccessible to me. The average wage is $10/hr, $40,000 a year if you're lucky (more normally $20,000), but the cost of going to and from places in Uber is routinely $40 one way. The math just doesn't add up. So I'm functionally stuck at home, even if our little Beer Virus friend wasn't keeping us all inside anyway. 

I have around 3.5k in bonds that are from the early 2000s that I can probably cash out or sell to cover 2 or 2.5k of the loans in the first year. Currently I make payments of around $100/mo when Sallie Mae sends emails saying I owe only something like $50, so at present I'm at least giving more than what is required to be paid. I know long term this isn't at all sustainable, though, hence why I'm considering looking abroad for work. 

The way the math seems to work out, if I can work in China or even a place like Vietnam teaching English for a year or two, I'll have earned a decent chunk of money coming in to where I can pay the loans off in 9 years or less. Most positions in China pay 2.5k USD/mo, with friends telling me they can easily live off of $1000/mo.. so after taxes throwing 800/mo at my loans doesn't seem unfeasible. 

At home my prospects seem very very slim. I'm not in an area that has a lot of tech/programming jobs, nor anything related to my BA, and I feel as though it will be a death sentence to go home and not do anything with my life, to be dependent on my parents because they retired in a rural area and I can't drive. For the time being I feel as though earning $2,000/mo (or even $1200 in a place like Vietnam) wouldn't be that bad of a situation combined with or even without my online work. In two years I either go for a Masters in something like Computer Science in Estonia where costs are low, or I somehow leverage my time spent in Southeast Asia to work in some NGO/Peace Corps position, and then grad school. 

TL;DR $45k in loans, average interest is 3.2%, very little prospects domestically so unsure about staying verses leaving for Vietnam or elsewhere abroad if only so there can be **some** positive cashflow rather than virtually none.",finance

personalfinance,Should I refinance my house?,"I got myself into some financial trouble last year and racked up some pretty bad credit card debt.  Here’s a run down of all of it. 

19k ~18% interest
10.5k ~17% interest (a personal loan)
7.5k ~8% (a personal loan)
4k ~0% (promotional apr for the next year)
1700 ~ 16% interest rate

Right now I still have about 29 years left on the mortgage so restarting the 30 year process doesn’t really bother me. 
I owe about 374.9k on the mortgage still. Refinancing would add an additional ~$12k to the principle while reducing the interest rate from 4% to 2.875. This would lower my monthly payment by ~$210 a month and save $75k over the life of the loan.  Dropping the monthly payment on the house also allows me the opportunity to rent out the house without breaking even every month. 

The loan officer also says I would receive roughly 3k from my escrow and defer a monthly payment. Basically allowing me to use 5k to go straight to my debt. 


It sounds like a no brainer when the Loan officer explained it to me, but I’m trying to gather more information before I jump the gun. 

Pros:
$200 off my monthly payments (75k overall)
~$5k towards debt

Cons:
~12k added to my principle and another year added to my mortgage",finance

economy,Elite College Endowments,"One day after President Trump criticized them, Harvard University announced that they [would not be accepting the $8.6 million in taxpayer money](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/us/harvard-trump-coronavirus.html) that the university was set to receive as part of an emergency relief package for higher education.

Other elite universities, such as Princeton, Stanford and Yale also announced that they would not be taking the money designated to them through a $14 billion federal aid package for higher education. The money was part of a $2 trillion relief package that President Trump signed into law on March 27th.

This criticism centred around the endowment size of the elite US universities:

**Harvard has an Endowment of $40.9 billion, the largest in the world.**

In 2019, the endowment distributed $1.9 billion to the university, representing 35% of Harvard's total operating revenue.

In terms of asset allocation, the largest allocation was to hedge funds, which returned 5.5%

Followed by public equity, which returned 5.9%

Followed by private equity, which returned 16%

**Yale,** [**thanks to David Swensen**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-09-11/david-swensen-made-yale-fabulously-rich-and-changed-endowments)**, has an Endowment of $30.3 billion.**

In 2019, the endowment distributed $1.4 billion to Yale, 33% of Yale's total operating revenue.

In terms of asset allocation, Yale is currently targeting a 30% allocation of the endowment to market-insensitive assets (cash, bonds, and absolute return). Absolute return just refers to value-driven and event-driven hedging strategies such as long/short equity, distressed investment and special situation investment. They are designed to have lower volatility over time.

It also seeks to target a 53.5% allocation to illiquid assets such as venture capital, leveraged buyouts, real estate, and natural resources.

**Stanford has an Endowment of $27.7 billion.**

In 2019, the endowment distributed $1.3 billion to the university, representing 22% of Stanford's total operating revenue.

In terms of asset allocation, it is mainly Private Equity, Absolute Return and International Equity.

Private Equity refers to investments in private companies, ranging from startups all the way up to leveraged buyouts.

**Princeton has an Endowment of $26.1 billion.**

In 2019, the endowment distributed $1.4 billion to the university, a massive 64% of Princeton’s total operating revenue.

In terms of asset allocation, it is mainly Private Equity, Real Assets and Independent Return.

Real Assets refers to real estate and natural resources, and Independent Return refers to hedge funds or, in superior Ivy League speak, investment vehicles that seek high absolute returns that are typically independent of broad market trends.

**According to Henry Hansmann, Professor Emeritus of Law at Yale Law School,** 

**""a stranger from Mars who looks at private universities would probably say they are institutions whose business is to run large pools of investment assets and that they run educational institutions on the side that can expand and contract to act as buffers for investment pools.""**

As well as this, many top US universities were [implicated in the Paradise Papers](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/nov/08/us-universities-offshore-funds-endowments-fossil-fuels-paradise-papers) for using offshore funds to grow their endowments.

104 US universities and colleges were named in data from the law firm Appleby, with four of the top 10 schools by endowment named in the files: Columbia, Princeton, Stanford and the University of Pennsylvania.

Most contentiously, some of the offshore funds invested in carbon-polluting industries, despite leading US universities playing a key role in the fight against climate change...

Let's take a look at an example:

In July 2016, Northeastern University [announced that it would invest $25m of its endowment in clean energy and renewables](https://news.northeastern.edu/2016/07/11/northeastern-to-invest-25-million-of-endowment-funds-in-environmental-sustainability/), boasting that the institution was ""a recognised leader in sustainability practices”.

In April 2017, Northeastern [invited Elizabeth Warren to open its new $225m Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Complex](https://www.wbur.org/edify/2017/04/03/northeastern-celebrates-grand-opening-of-225-million-science-facility).

However, despite the complex’s ideals and goals, which include seeking solutions to rising sea levels and pollution, Northeastern was one of 12 prominent US universities and colleges named in the Paradise Papers as investors in a hedge fund based in the Cayman Islands. The fund is a feeder to a subsidiary based in Houston, Texas, of EnCap Investments, a company that, since 1988, has pumped almost $20bn into oil and shale gas exploration and production.

Now back to Harvard.

With such a massive endowment, some have claimed that the school [should use more of the fund to entirely eliminate tuition.](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/15/us/a-push-to-make-harvard-free-also-questions-the-role-of-race-in-admissions.html?referer=&amp;_r=1)

Others have argued that Harvard’s funds could be better used by [recruiting and educating more low-income students, rather than giving free education to their already relatively well-off student body](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-problem-with-making-harvard-free-2016-01-17).

Harvard clapped back.

[In their 2018-2019 financial report](https://finance.harvard.edu/annual-report), they stressed that the endowment does not give the school full financial freedom.

""There is a common misconception that endowments, including Harvard's, can be accessed like bank accounts, used for anything at any time as long as funds are available. In reality, Harvard's flexibility in spending from the endowment is limited by the fact that it is designed to last forever, which is crucial for an institution intended to serve generations of students and pursue research on big questions - questions that cannot be answered in one lifetime.""

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 [axed the tax-exempt status of university endowments, imposing a 1.4 percent tax](https://www.acenet.edu/News-Room/Pages/Treasury-Department-Releases-Endowment-Tax-Draft-Rules.aspx) on realised income of universities whose investment assets top $500,000 per student. The IRS anticipates that about 25 to 40 institutions will fall under this definition.

Stanford are expected to face a $43 million tax bill, and Harvard are expecting a $50 million bill.

What are your thoughts on the endowment situation: are they just asset management firms with schools attached?

personalfinance,"203(k) fallout, what to do with the excess from the loan?","Hello!

Throwaway because I don't want people knowing my main's financial stuff. TL;DR at the end.

~Prelude
So, recently (as in *immediately* before the COVID outbreak in the US), I broke down and finally purchased a house, because I was getting tired of rental problems. After searching for a couple (6+ months), and getting financed at a decent at the time (3.65%) rate, I found a house I wanted (HUD @ 136k), submitted a reno list (part of a 203(k), the ""official"" estimates came in around 30k, had to set aside some for inspections and stuff and I had to slush a percentage, so let's call it an even 175k). Wasn't a terrible deal overall, because it immediately appraised at 200k, even before the renovations. The contractor is a personal friend of mine, so we came in *well* under budget. Like, total costs were 16k out of 30k. Doesn't help that we had to use HUD guidelines for prices, which are absurd. Bank didn't like that, so with the HUD consultant's help (which is a necessary evil in these kinds of projects), we submitted some documents that take the full loan amount out and I get a check for the balance (14k).

~Info on my debts
For the down payment, I took out an FHA loan, and borrowed some money from my 401(k), which I contribute fully to every year. This loan is almost paid off, and has no interest rate.

For a while, i wasn't great at finances, and I'm trying to get better. Had a while where I had to credit card, with no emergency fund. I owe approximately 12k on them, the interest rates are fairly high (22.99% - they're both cash back cards)

I've been paying on my student loans, slowly but grinding them down. I currently owe about 16k (6.8% interest rate) on them total.

I'm leaning towards paying off the credit cards and throwing the balance on the student loans. Is this the right idea? Or should I pay a chunk of the CCs off (maybe down around 20-25%) and put the balance on the student loan?

TL;DR: 203(k) loan (175k @ 3.65%) was botched due to nepotism, so I got money (14k) back from it. Put it back on the house, pay off the CCs (12k @ 22.99%), pay off the student loans (16k @ 6.8%), pay back the 401k loan( almost done - less than 6 payments left, 0%), or some combination?

Thanks for the advice.",finance

The Fed will start with bond E.T.F.s. Most purchases will be in funds that hold investment-grade debt, the central bank said, but it will dabble in junk bonds. Direct purchases of corporate debt will follow.

investing,Core consumer prices saw the largest monthly drop ever in April,"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/12/core-consumer-prices-saw-the-largest-monthly-drop-ever-in-april.html

&gt;Consumer prices in April took their biggest drop in history going back to at least 1957 as the economy reeled from restrictions imposed to control the coronavirus.

&gt;The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday that the CPI excluding food and energy prices slumped 0.4%, the steepest monthly drop since records have been kept.

&gt;While the decline in prices was broad-based, the biggest swoons in the “core” part of the index came in apparel and transportation services, which dropped 4.7% apiece. Commodities not including food and energy fell 0.7% and medical care services prices were off 0.5%. Used cars saw a 0.4% decline amid a slide in auto sales.

&gt;Big drops within the categories were car and truck rentals (-16.6%), airline fares (-15.2%) and men’s suits (-11.3%).

&gt;On a year-over-year basis, core CPI rose 1.4%, the smallest move since April 2011.

&gt;The moves come amid a series of fiscal and monetary moves aimed at juicing economic activity. Rescue efforts from both sides have been unprecedented in dollar amount and breadth, but come amid an economy frozen in place that will see a drop in GDP for the second quarter that will be unparalleled. 

&gt;The Federal Reserve continues to pump money into the economy amid a deflationary threat and an unemployment situation at its worst point since the Great Depression.

&gt;“The Federal Reserve should be more worried about deflation, when prices are falling broadly in the economy, rather than inflation, when prices are rising. If deflation becomes embedded in the economy, it can be difficult to uproot,” said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC. “If prices are falling, consumers and businesses may wait to make purchases, assuming that prices will be even lower in the future; this can exacerbate economic downturns.”

&gt;Headline CPI, which included huge drops in energy but big jumps in food costs, fell 0.8% and was up just 0.3% from a year ago. The index for cereals and bakery products, for instance, rose 2.9% in April for its largest monthly increase ever.
Food at home prices increased 2.6% as part of a broader 1.5% move higher in the overall category. A number of categories saw major spikes as Americans came under stay-at-home orders. 
Energy prices were off 10.1% for the month, due in part to a 20.6% plunge in gasoline.",finance

personalfinance,5% deposit on a house or save an extra three years for a 10%? (UK),"Background: my girlfriend and I are saving for a deposit on a house. We're currently renting, and saving around £350 each a month for the deposit. We aim to save just shy of £8k a year in total. I'm pretty new to how mortgages work exactly, so please bear with me.

My question is, is it better to try and get a 5% deposit on a house, put up with the poor interest rate during the initial term, and then remortgage; or wait an extra few years until we have enough for a 10% deposit?

My thinking is that the £11k we spend a year on rent could be going towards paying off the mortgage early... that seems obvious to me. Are there any downsides to this that I should be aware of? I know the interest rate is poor on 5% deposit mortgages, but if you can remortgage after 2-5 years anyway, why don't more people do that? Or is there something I'm missing?

personalfinance,Should I refinance my home to a 30 year and pay more per month towards principal or a 15 year?,"My husband and I are looking to refinance, but we can’t decide if we want to do 30 year or 15 year. Originally we thought 15 year for sure because we want to pay off our house as soon as possible, but due to the recent pandemic we were thinking if something happened and he lost his job, it would be way easier to come up with a smaller monthly payment. So then we were thinking, should we do 30 year and technically have a smaller payment, but then just get in the habit of making a monthly payment of like $2000(extra towards principal) while times are good, if something happened and he lost his job then we would only need to do about $1300 instead of $1883? But we don’t know if that’s a good idea or not. 

We plan on staying in this house at least for the next 5 years, but our long term goal is to eventually move and keep this house as a rental. So that’s weighing into our decision too. If we have a $1883 mortgage with the 15 year but we can only rent it out for like $1500? 

So we really need some advice on what would be the best decision for us. I think at this point we may be leaning towards the 30 year, but we wanted to get some advice before committing to a decision.

personalfinance,"Have been reading Rich Dad and Poor Dad for over a decade, what lessons have I learned?","Disclaimer- I am not giving advice to you. It is about me talking to myself. If you could help me out by telling me how naive I am and where the plan is wrong and not practical so that I could improve my future self. I NEED YOUR ADVICE.  

 The first time I read this book was when I was in 9th grade. I have never fully understood the concepts presented in this book until I encountered those concepts myself through different life experiences. Obviously, this book is a start. I try to keep it simple. These concepts just keep you on the right path, but how you get there is up to you. Walk, run, fly, crawl. Just finish it. Remember “No matter what he does, every person on earth plays a central role in the history of the world. And normally he doesn't know it.” Having the right mindset is critical. Making money is the next step, but this book does not show how to. It does but vaguely. Well, you need somewhere to start, and this book is a great place to do so. Let's get into it. Robert has two dads. One is poor and the other one is rich. He boiled lessons he learned from two dads down into 6 lessons.

The first lesson is that the rich do not work the money. One quote that got me pondered for so many years when I first read it. “The Poor work for money, while the Rich have the money work for them” What did Robert mean when he said the rich have money work for them? Is it that the rich have some magic turn money into some kind of bus boy and boss them around all day long?. If so, sign me up. I finally understood this concept when I was introduced to stock. Stock is not a piece of paper. There is a business behind it. If I can not optimize my money, let somebody use it and return me with principal plus interest. All I do is have a good night's sleep.

I remembered one of my friends told me that he invested his money in his personal car. He had all the accessories and top of the line car. I laughed at it because I believe a car can never hold its value unless he buys the car, fixes it and sells it for profit. To me, a car is just a tool getting me from point A to point B. That is why it is important to understand the second lesson: the difference between assets and liabilities. Assets are what puts money into your pocket and liabilities are what takes money out of your pocket. Assets are houses, stocks and businesses. What makes you money, not take money away from you.

The third lesson is mind your own business. I prefer to call it that profits are better than wages. You either work for a company, government or the bank. You need to have financial independence. What I mean by financial independence is that you are able to live from your own resources. Thinking about getting fire from your job the next morning. The fourth lesson is taxes. Both rich and poor are trying to earn money. The difference is that the rich spend their earnings before they pay taxes and the poor do the opposite. How do the rich do that?. You have to learn the power of corporations and accounting. This gets me to the fifth lesson: the rich invent money.

The fifth chapter is more like when I close my eyes, I can't see. It divides into 4 subsections- accounting, invest, market and laws. Accounting, you have to understand the numbers so that you could spend your hard earned money before the Fed has their hands on it. This explanation is more abstract and technical. The better way to explain it is to use accounting to keep track of your spending. Otherwise, it is like you eat and have diarrhea at the same time. You need imodium man. The best way to do it is to spend your money with cash instead of a credit card. Next, investing means keep your cash flow. This could be through bonds, stock and real estate. Stocks are easy. If you are an average investor, VOO fund is the way to go. Why? Check out your probability of beating the market. Real estate remembers one rule- Value added or Turning trash into gold. Find a house that needs to be fixed. Buy it, fix it and sell it. For every dollar you put in, you could get 4$ back. Market is full of opportunities. It is all about supply and demand. You gotta keep your eyes open and pay careful attention to what the market demands. These opportunities for you to innovate and fulfill the needs of the market. Golden rule- Ignorance of law is not an excuse for any crimes that you commit. Know the law, at least the basics, understand your rights and think like a lawyer. The reason I got into law is because when I play a board game with my friends, I see that whoever understands the rules of the game the most, wins the game because they are able to manipulate the game into their advantages. This applies to real life too. If watching “Making a murderer” does not make your hand stand straight up while thinking that you could be the one wasted 18 years for intentionally wrongfully convicted, think again. On the other hand, if you would like to get away with murder like O.J, law may be the first tool.

The last lesson is that learning to earn is more important than earning itself.The average student earns 11$ per hour. I earned 19$ per hour working as a Pharmacy Intern. I quit my job to participate in the PSSNY business plan competition. People say that I am stupid because this hospital pharmacy intern is hard to come by. There is a limited number of hospitals compared to chain pharmacies. If I work 20 hours per day, every week of the month, every month of the year, I could earn up to 18,240$ compared to 125$ for winning the competition that took me the whole year to prepare. Why I still pick the competition over the job, if I get to choose it all over again and never regret one bit. I learned how to be a leader and take responsibility and motivate others. I could earn much more in the future.

Theory is just a theory if you can not apply it. There are a lot of obstacles that you have to overcome. They include fear, cynicism, lazy, bad habits and arrogance. Fear is nothing but the suffering itself. Lazy is when you don't have enough reasons to thrive. Bad habit is your nature and hard to overcome unless you understand the mechanism of habit is cue-routine-reward and start to manipulate it. Cynicism is funny because if you die today doing what you love, will dying still be a problem anymore. Arrogance is simply that you need to shut up and listen. Beyond all of this, the first step is a big step. I am lazy to run every day. But I tricked myself. How about I change my clothes and drive my car to the bike trail. If I get there and I still do not change your mind, I could always drive back home and continue to do whatever I am doing at the moment. But it  has never happened that I drive back to my house after getting there. . Well if you make it to here, thank you so much. Comment below. Let me know what you think. I really appreciate it.",finance
personalfinance,Permanent DEFAULT credit card rates. Why?,"Something I don't quite understand: Back when the CARD act legislation was passed, why didn't they also put in provisions that would prevent credit card issuers from locking their customers into a permanent ""default"" interest rate (usually nearly 30%), rather than requiring them to drop the rate back down over time to the original rate after something like 6 or 9 months of on-time payments and ""good behavior""?

With all the positive changes that legislation produced, it seems that they missed a huge opportunity to prevent CC issuers from endlessly screwing their customers year after year by tricking them with a low rate, then as soon as they accidentally step on any ""late payment landmine"" ... BOOM! ... their default ""loan shark"" rate kicks in for the entire life of that card.

I remember missing a few payments on my Discover card around 18 or 20 years ago after which they immediately locked me into a 28.99% default rate and kept it there for all that time. They refused to lower it after repeated requests, even after almost 2 decades of perfect payments. The only option they offered was to close out my original card and open a brand new ""Discover It"" card, which meant possibly loosing my very long card history length and also paying some huge transfer fee to park my debt onto the new card. Fortunately, my high Discover balance is now $0 and has been for some time, for that very reason. They were simply too greedy when all I wanted them to do was lower my rate just a little. I finally decided to use an installment based loan to get rid of their excessively high interest payments. So rather than robbing me just a little less, they lost the whole shebang. I only keep my original Discover Card active because it is one of my oldest cards and I don't want the hits to my credit score and DTI for closing it right now. But I do wonder why the CARD act didn't simply put a stop to the filthy greedy practice of jacking up rates permanently. To me, it's a bait and switch and a huge overreach for even the smallest ""infraction"". Heck, even a full-blown bankruptcy is forgiven (no longer reported) eventually. Why don't credit cards penalize, then forgive too?",finance

Well, in these unprecedented times I didn't factor in that mail delivery would be effected, and I should have paid for express shipping and delivery confirmation. 

Moral of the story, kids: If you're gonna pay the debt collector and you choose to mail it, pay the extra $$$ for overnight express (or Fed Ex it) , have it certified and get delivery confirmation.


UPDATE: They received the payment shortly after I posted this. I mailed the 2nd payment by certified mail,  overnight shipping and signature confirmation. The DC reminded me that if it doesn't get here by such and such date,  that the agreement will be annulled, I'll have to pay the full amount, yadda yadda....I LMAO and told her to take her empty threats elsewhere.

personalfinance,Should I invest money I'd just have sitting in savings?,"I have a robinhood account and I make profit (not obscene amounts but a decent amount here and there) pretty consistently. It very very easily beats the interest rate I'd be getting if I left my savings in absolutely any bank or credit union.

Is this the beginning of the dump after they pumped it up?

EDIT: I'm asking about the extremely odd synchronization and the complete change in trajectory. I AM NOT worried about stocks going down. Oh no! I'm losing money! That is precisely not what this post is about.

Second EDIT: I'm going to be synthesizing an answer for the benefit of everyone and myself. So far we have a bunch of really interesting comments. As for the timing of this phenomenon, lots of commenters have mentioned that an enormous amount of equities are in the hands of large financial institutions and that they operate in a type ""hivemind"" way and definitely do not collude with one another. Following this theory, souring talks between China and the US (Graham Bill), comments by the Fed, and the LA area announcing an extended quarantine may have changed this ""hivemind"" at around 1.5 hours before closing. Still sounds far-fetched to me, but that's the best answer we have so far IMO.",finance

personalfinance,Best Financial Strategy,"Hello everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

I was talking with my brother and I'm now trying to figure out the best way to set myself up for a better financial future. 

I currently have 36,000 in student loan debt.

I will be going to school in a few weeks to get a second bachelor's degree as a registered nurse. The tuition will be paid by the post 9/11 GI bill in conjunction with the Yellow Ribbon Program so I don't need to worry about that. 

While in school I will be making about 4,000 a month (tax free) between VA disability and the stipend from the GI bill.

I was originally going to take this time to aggressively pay off my student loans, but I'm now wondering if perhaps I should refinance to a lower rate, pay them off at a longer time and take the extra money and invest in the market. Right now my interest rates for the loans are at 0% until at least September due to the Coronavirus legislation. After that, I believe they sit somewhere at about 5%.

I have about 15k in savings, 3k in mutual funds, 15k in retirement, and 1k cash. I only pay 250 in rent, for the next year, but will move after that. 

What do you think it is that I should do?

Thanks in advance.",finance

personalfinance,"Bad credit but good job, financing a car for the first time","Hello everyone! I know that PF hates financing new cars from what I’ve read but most of the horror stories seem to be people that are already struggling before getting into a car loan. 

Anyway about me I am in my late 20’s and have always just paid in full in cash for all of my cars. They all inevitably break down after a few years and I repeat this cycle. The current car I was in got t-boned and is still drivable but it has just gotten away from me. Check engine light on, brake light on, side mirror destroyed, registration out etc. I’ve avoided repairing these things (all recent things) because I’ve been planning on moving on to a new car soon anyway. I work in management for a large medical company and just got a big promotion and have fantastic job security. The only downside is I’ve not done much throughout my life to improve my credit and have had a few things zap the life out of my credit score until it settled at 568 which is where it’s at now. 

I’m at a point where instead of buying beaters to get through the life I want to get a reliable, new car that I will have for quite some time and gets great gas mileage for my commute and that will also allow me to help build my credit in conjunction with secured credit card, etc. 

I have started the process at a Toyota dealership with a 2019 Corolla that only has 10k miles on it. They’re selling it for $13,990 which is below market for it. At first they were estimating my terms to be 5k down with a payment of $286/month over the dreaded 72 months. After leaving last night I played around their website and looked at what if I bought the car online from them and it came to 4k down and $281/month. 

From what I’ve been told by friends and family I should go in there and tell them I have 4k to put down and that I could do a monthly rate of 260 instead of 286 and tell them if they can match that then I would buy. 

Now I know my interest rate is going to be astronomical and easily 20%+ which adds an insane amount of money paid out in interest over the 72 months. I figured that I have another 6k in bonuses arriving next month and was planning on using another 2k of that to pay on the principle and to repeat that next year when my bonuses come in as well. I also plan on 6 months down the line attempting to refinance with my credit union that I’ve been at for 5 years (they denied my application for initial financing) to work on getting the interest rate down lower.",finance
personalfinance,Preppy Mortgage or Invest in Index Funds,"Hi r/personalfinace!  I just signed a 30 year fixed rate mortgage which is substantially lower than my previous interest rate (which was a 30 year fixed at 4.75% with 28 years remaining). The result is that I’m saving about $600/month in P&amp;I payments. According to a few online calculators, if I pay that $600/month from day 1 towards extra principle the loan will be paid off in 21 years and I’ll save $87.5k in interest.

personalfinance,"Parents buy my mortgage, act as new lenders?","Recently, my stepdad proposed replacing our home loan with a loan from them.

They said they'd still charge interest, but it would be lower than what we currently have (3.875%) and presumably free of PMI. We just closed on the house in January, so home-ownership and paying off that debt is still relatively new to us. Still, on the surface, this looks like a win-win deal - We get a better interest rate, no PMI, and they get our interest payments.

Would it generally be advisable to take advantage of this? Would it affect how we build credit? Deduct our interest from our taxes each year? What other considerations would we want to take into account, other than any family issues that might come up (Very good relationship with my mother and stepfather - No drama in the years he has been in my family).

Let's just assume for a moment that this happens and avoid a debate about whether or not it will:  what does this mean for investing strategy which, up until the crash, was to just buy and hold a diversified portfolio and assume 8-9% annual nominal returns?

The Nikkei 225 has returned a total of -50% (yes, negative) over the past 30 years though deflation and stronger yen relative to other currencies may have blunted some of that impact.  Only from 2011-2019 did the Nikkei return a respectable 7-7.5% pa.  

At what point would you pull your money from the market and put it into cash or bonds?  One strategy is to ensure geographical diversification and invest in other developed and emerging markets - but many of them are tied to the US so it may not provide much of a hedge.

Strong earnings reports, especially from tech companies, drove the markets upwards last week, despite unemployment hitting 14.7%, as the economy shed 20.5M jobs. For context, unemployment reached as high as 25% during the Great Depression. Given the current state of joblessness, why are markets so bullish? Here are the details:

1. **Nearly 30 states have begun to reopen, with another five states with plans to reopen soon.** Investors were bullish about the market as the vast majority of states began to reopen facilities ranging from beaches to retail. As money begins to start flowing through the economy again, investors expect a gradual return to market levels before COVID-19.
2. **The Nasdaq is in positive territory year-to-date as tech stocks have continued to outperform despite COVID-19.** The Nasdaq, an index weighted towards tech, has entered positive territory since the beginning of 2020 due to positive earnings reports from tech companies, including Facebook (FB), Match.com (MTCH), Uber (UBER), and others. Investors expect the index to reach pre-COVID levels soon enough.
3. **The FDA approved the first antigen test for detecting COVID-19****.** The FDA approved Quidel Corp's (QDEL) antigen test for quickly screening for COVID-19. QDEL's antigen test can be completed in minutes compared to traditional PCR tests, which can take hours. This test will help the economy reopen by enabling mass testing at the workplace and beyond. We believe this news will drive the markets upward this coming week.
4. **The April unemployment report indicated 14.7% unemployment, with tech companies like Uber contributing with layoffs.** The federal government released April's unemployment report last Friday and demonstrated a 14.7% unemployment rate. Unemployment mostly stemmed from the hospitality and travel industry. However, tech companies, including Uber (UBER) have recently contributed to layoffs. Uber is cutting 3,700 workers, while Airbnb and Yelp plan on cutting 1,900 and &gt;1,000 employees respectively. While this is devastating for the employees, investors see this decision by tech companies as a cost-cutting measure needed for these companies to achieve greater profitability.
5. **After COVID containment success, South Korea recorded highest daily infections in a month.** South Korea recorded 34 new COVID-19 infections today, the highest one day increase in COVID-19 infections in a month. The U.S. should also expect there to be a second wave of COVID-19 breakouts as the economy opens. However, because countries and people are better prepared for COVID-19, the impact of the second outbreak will not likely result in additional quarantine measures and be dampened in terms of cases and deaths. Furthermore, research is beginning to indicate that even mildly affected COVID-19 cases produce antibodies, suggesting potential for at least partial immunity even from those who had low to no symptoms. 

**Overall, I remain optimistic about the U.S. economic recovery.** While unemployment is incredibly high, government stimulus have enabled most U.S. citizens to sustain in this difficult situation. The reopening of state economies will hopefully provide the stimulus needed for businesses to start re-hiring those who were laid off, leading to a dramatic decrease in unemployment. The May and June jobs reports will be a strong indicator for our recovery.",finance

We’re considering refinancing through a VA “Streamline” or IIRL but aren’t sure whether or not it’s worth it because while we aren’t looking to move any time soon, this house isn’t our “forever home.”
 
We called around for quotes and the best we received was from our current lender, who offered a 30-year rate of 2.825% with a monthly savings of $661, which we would immediately then re-apply to our monthly payment as principal, essentially keeping our monthly payment the same, paying off the loan roughly around the same time but slightly earlier, and just reducing the amount of interest paid over the life of the loan by about $184K. We would skip one month’s payment before our new loan goes into effect, then apply that deferred payment amount to our principal, and all we’d be on the hook for at closing would be rolled into the new loan, which is $5,101 and includes closing costs and per diem interest. So we’d break even within the first year.

personalfinance,Balance Transfer Card Payment Strategy Before Personal Loan,"I've got 3 balance transfer cards right now, all at high utilization (detailed below). I intend to take out a personal loan in the next few months (August probably) to pay these off, and I was wondering what the best strategy would be for paying these down in the meantime to get the best rate on the personal loan. Credit Karma lists my score as 680 if that matters here, and I have a number of other cards at 0 utilization.

Card 1 - $5,000 balance on $7,500 limit, just ended 0% APR and is now 13.99%  
Card 2 - $3,200 balance on $4,000 limit, 0% APR until August  
Card 3 - $6,200 balance on $8,500 limit 0% APR until August

I currently have roughly $1,500 budgeted per month to put towards paying these down. In terms of credit score and rate on a personal loan, would the best option here be to:  
1 - pay these down ""equally"", trying to reduce utilization on each of them equally  
2 - pay down card 1 as fast as possible and minimums on the others

Or does it matter at all? I recognize that option 1 would result in slightly more interest charged on card 1 for the couple months, but maybe that's offset by an improved interest rate on the other one. Thanks in advance for your thoughts.",finance
investing,Druckenmiller Says Risk-Reward in Stocks Is Worst He’s Seen,"Stan Druckenmiller said the risk-reward calculation for equities is the worst he’s seen in his career, and that the government stimulus programs won’t be enough to overcome real world economic problems.

“The consensus out there seems to be: ‘Don’t worry, the Fed has your back,’” said Druckenmiller on Tuesday during a webcast held by The Economic Club of New York. “There’s only one problem with that: our analysis says it’s not true.”

While traders think there is “massive” liquidity and that the stimulus programs are big enough to solve the problems facing the U.S., the economic effects of the coronavirus are likely to be long lasting and will lead to a slew of bankruptcies, he said.

“I pray I’m wrong on this, but I just think that the V-out is a fantasy,” the legendary hedge fund manager said, referring to a V-shaped recovery.

Druckenmiller’s remarks are among the strongest comments yet by a Wall Street heavyweight on the bleak outlook facing the U.S. They also stand in contrast to the optimism that has pushed the S&amp;P 500 Index to rally almost 30% since its March low even as the pandemic has brought the economy to a standstill, seized up credit markets and ended the longest bull market in history.

The damage spurred the Federal Reserve to unveil a raft of emergency lending programs and Congress to unleash almost $3 trillion in stimulus funds. But those programs aren’t likely to spur future economic growth, Druckenmiller said.

“It was basically a combination of transfer payments to individuals, basically paying them more not to work than to work,” he said. “And in addition to that, it was a bunch of payments to zombie companies to keep them alive.”

Druckenmiller said he thinks that the current liquidity will soon shrink as U.S. Treasury borrowing crowds out the private economy and even overwhelms Fed purchases.

Druckenmiller, 66, the former chief strategist for George Soros, converted his hedge fund into Duquesne Family Office in 2010. His long-term track record, making returns of about 30% a year over three decades, established him as one of the world’s top money mangers. He has an estimated net worth of $5.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Like other investors and Wall Street executives, Druckenmiller agrees that the pandemic will lead to more regulation and higher taxes.

Other highlights from the Druckenmiller interview:

In the future, he said he wouldn’t be surprised if the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak becomes the “poster child for the worst public policy decisions ever made from a cost-benefit analysis.”
On a relative basis, he’s as bullish on long-short strategies as he’s been in 10 years. “That’s partly because I’m worried about everything else,” he said.
Druckenmiller was also bullish on Amazon.com Inc., saying people should be thankful that the company exists right now given the number of jobs created. He also praised its transition to less profitable, essential-needs products without raising prices.

I was hoping to be able to do an internship this summer so I wouldn't have to take more loans out, but then COVID-19 hit. So I will need about 4k per semester to cover the remaining costs, hopefully less once things open up again and I can find a job. At the end of my final year, my total will be something like 25k Federal Unsubsidized, and 16k other, for a total of ~41k. I have had a credit card for a while, and my credit score (according to the report provided by Discover) is 739. I haven't checked yet, but I suspect my mother's credit score is lower than mine.

Would I be able to get a better rate with parent plus loans or private loans, considering that I have a decent credit score? And what student loan servicers should I look into? I am a member of NASA Federal Credit Union, would I get a better rate there vs a big servicer?

personalfinance,Trying to start planning my finances and feeling overwhelmed,"I work as a teacher and my wife works as a nurse. We have stable careers and a combined take home of around 150k.

We had an opportunity at age 24 (her 25) to buy a home, so we spent the money we saved for a wedding on the downpayment and remodel of our home. We were a bit over our heads with it, not financially, but more in terms of being homeowners. It was a great deal on the smallest house in an amazing neighborhood that has doubled in value since we bought it.

However, because of the amount of remodeling we had to do to it, we've just spent a lot of money on short term 0% loans to cover things like appliances, floors, and other remodeling things.

Now, four years later, we are in a position where our budget is very stable after several years of salary growth with very little debt. I'm looking to refinance my home and start saving for retirement, while not affecting our short terms saving goals (as we still need around 60k in remodeling to ""finish"" the house entirely).

29 has kind of snuck up on me, and I know I should've invested earlier than now, but I want to get started.

1. Refinancing my home.

My current home loan was originally 198k at 4.25% fixed, and the current principal is at 182. I talked to quicken loans and their offer estimate for a 15 year was 2.875% but they are looking to add 12k to my note in closing costs. 5400 for an escrow account and 6600 for their closing fees and whatever points they are paying down, which is unclear to me as of yet. It feels like I shouldn't need escrow and the closing costs seem very high as well. I should definitely shop around for this, right? 


I'm not sure I want to throw 12k paying those up front, but at the same time the escrow account from my current mortgage should cover the 5400 for the new escrow (I did check the balance), but that still leaves their 6600 fees. The paperwork estimate he sent was for the 30 year (I was exploring both options) and says 2pts paid down and 1600 in fees, with an interest rate on the 30 year of 3.375. Seems like I should have a better interest rate than that at this point. The original loan was with 10% down, a much higher debt to incom ratio, much worse credit, and much worse rates at the time (Feb 2016). Now we both have 800+ credit scores and they are offering me 3.875 as my interest rate before I pay it down? That seems like I'm being ripped off, but again I know nothing.

2. Setting up my retirement.

My dad says RothIRA. I think my wife and I are pretty capped at our current levels of income. She won't be making much more in her current position, I probably won't be breaking 70k any time soon. Is a RothIRA the right choice for us? 

Should I dump the 6k max for the year in right now for both of us, while the market is at a low, or stick to 1000$ a month this year and go to 500$ a month next year? Does that even matter? 

Are there any better investment options for my situation?


The only other debt we have currently is our car payment of 400 a month.

///BREAK///

My husband and I have a 30-year VA mortgage with an interest rate of 3.75%. We’re considering refinancing through a VA “Streamline” or IIRL but aren’t sure whether or not it’s worth it because while we aren’t looking to move any time soon, this house isn’t our “forever home.” 

We called around for quotes and the best we received was from our current lender, who offered a 30-year rate of 2.825% with a monthly savings of $661, which we would immediately then re-apply to our monthly payment as principal, essentially keeping our monthly payment the same, but paying off the loan slightly earlier, and reducing the amount of interest paid over the life of the loan by about $184K. All we’d be on the hook for at closing would be rolled into the new loan, which is $5K, so we’d break even within the first year.   

It seems like all of this makes sense, and we’ve been with this lender for 8 years now with absolutely no issues, but are there additional questions we should be asking that might change our decision?",finance

personalfinance,Parents paying minimum on private student loans--not sure how much to put towards them,"Basically title. I make right at 100k/year gross right now, pay 2k in rent each month, and have approximately 45k in student loans. Half is a private loan with a \~5.5% interest rate, the other half are a smattering of federal loans ranging from 3.5% to 4.5%.

Right now I am maxing my Roth IRA and putting 10% into my Roth 401k. I pay slightly above the minimum payment on the federal loans (currently funneling it into my emergency fund during COVID forbearance and will be applying all of it towards the federal loans at the end of the forbearance period).

My parents make the minimum monthly payment on the private loans, about $230 per month. I am fully responsible for the federal loans.

With the economy so uncertain, my general dislike of being in debt, and given the fact that I (currently) don't anticipate being laid off, I am considering halting IRA contribs, lowering my 401k contribs to the employer match, and avalanching all of that money into the private loans until they're gone, and then the federal loans. I still put about 1k/month away in my savings account for short term goals (a car and a pilot's license).

Is this a good idea? I'm hesitant to spend so much money paying off the private loans since my parents will *theoretically* pay them until they're gone, and I could use that money for other things (like retirement, as I have been doing), but I have no way of knowing that for certain. Any advice about what to do would be appreciated.

investing,Market Tumbles Earlier After Powell Warns Of 'Lasting Damage' Due To Coronavirus,"Stocks cut gains from the pre-market  session and opened lower Wednesday, as traders eyed commentary from  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

In his comments, Powell undercut hopes of a quick V-shaped recovery for the U.S. economy amid the coronavirus pandemic, [saying that a deep, long downturn could](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/federal-reserve-chairman-powell-us-economy-faces-longer-term-concerns-130001781.html) “leave behind lasting damage” to economic productivity.

“The  recovery may take some time to gather momentum, and the passage of time  can turn liquidity problems into solvency problems,” Powell said during  his webcast appearance with the Peterson Institute for International  Economics, according to prepared remarks.

Powell  also reiterated that the central bank would use all of its monetary  policy tools “until the crisis has passed and the economic recovery is  well under way,” and suggested that Congress boost fiscal stimulus to  mitigate the risk of longer-term economic damage.

The  remarks reiterated sentiments previously expressed by other Fed  officials, many of whom acknowledged that the extended shutdowns that  have helped bring down new case growth for the virus have simultaneously  come at the expense of economic and business activity. A number of  Federal Reserve officials who delivered public remarks on issued more  cautious commentary around the coronavirus’s near- and long-term impacts  on the U.S. economy and financial markets.

Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, a voter in this year’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), [said Tuesday](https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/speeches/sp-20200512-an-update-on-the-economy-and-the-federal-reserves-policy-response.aspx)  she expected unemployment to hit or top 20% domestically, and for  second-quarter annualized GDP growth to be negative by as much as 40%,  before a gradual economic recovery kicks off in the second half of the  year.

personalfinance,Crazy to purchase house right now?,"My wife and I signed and put down earnest money to build a larger new house last November (2019).  I remember having a long conversation with my father saying ""I hope the economy doesn't collapse between now and then"".  We put down $2500 and paid an additional $850 for inspections, so we are in it for $3350 and our realtor said we could walk away at any point if we are willing to lose our earnest money.

We have been living in a 1400 sqft home for 5 years that we have outgrown since our kiddo was born.  We paid $249k for it, owe about $180k, and in the pre-corona market, we would probably sell for about $300k since it is a newer home in a great part of town.  Homes in our area are still selling, but our new home won't be available until late July, and who knows what will happen between now and then.

Our prospective new home is priced at $344k, and we have 20% down (\~$66k), and were planning on using equity from current home and doing a recast after our current home sells, meaning we would have an additional $80-90k \[ideally\] to put towards principal (approximately 42% down).  We are approved at 3.5% interest rate, and can buy down the rate as low as 2.75% with an additional \~$10k at closing.  

For what it is worth, we plan to stay in this house for a very long time -- possibly as long as to see our little one off to college.

I have a number of reservations about this whole process.

1. We are buying into a market at the inflated home price from last fall, and that may (will?) not last
2. We will need to sell our existing home, and might not be able to sell for what we want/need
3. Our jobs are both stable, but that could change at any given time given the uncertainty of covid

investing,The Phases of the Classic Deflationary Debt Cycle,"I've started to read The Principles for Navigating Big Debt Crises by Ray Dalio (You can download here: https://www.bridgewater.com/big-debt-crises/Principles-For-Navigating-Big-Debt-Crises-By-Ray-Dalio.pdf) and I found the part about the phases of the classic deflationary debt cycle a very good read for the present times (Pages 16-38 on the book).

Here are my notes on the section:

As of today, we have already gone through the early part of the cycle (2009-2020), the bubble (we skipped this part in my opinion), and the top (Jan-March 2020). We are currently on the depression portion of the cycle (Which started in mid-march for the US)

The Top did not occur due to typical market forces (interest rates rising), it occurred due to an external force (COVID-19) completely stopping spending on it's tracks (This has never happened before).

The cut in interest rates to 0 on March 15 did little to 1. Produce a positive wealth effect, 2. Stimulate economic activity and 3. Ease debt-service burdens.

The onset of the depression immediately revealed cash-flow problems, which the fed eased by announcing infinite QE and the US govt eased with their first two stimulus bills. Both measures where announced and implemented throughout the last three weeks of March (fiscal policy at a slower pace than monetary policy)

According to Dalio, the policies that reduce debt burdens are the following:

1. Austerity - Although this policy was not enacted, it's happening naturally. With 3 Billion people locked at home at it's peak, we are forced to not spend as much as before. 

2. Debt defaults/restructuring - Also happening, at a slower pace than I expected. 

3. Debt Monetization / Printing - Quickly enacted through QE

4. Wealth Transfers - Not happening yet, although important voices are already signalling that it better be coming (Larry Fink)

The most ideal way out of a deflationary depression is to a 'Beautiful Deleveraging' - aka when the 4 policies above move in a harmonious way where growth grows at a faster pace than debt without inflation spiraling out of control. 

We are not even close to a beautiful deleveraging since income is decreasing at the moment while debt is increasing. 

Important point from page 32: ""People ask if printing money will raise inflation. It won't if it offsets falling credit and the deflationary forces are balanced with this inflationary force.""

According to Dalio's table about well managed beautiful deleveraging on page 35, Both The Federal Reserve and the US Government have done a great job by acting quickly. However that doesn't change the fact that spending is not being stimulated, again because of an external force. 

At this point in time (And it's worth noting, Powell mentioned a variation of this today in his 9:00am video interview), The Federal Reserve is basically out of tools to get businesses and consumers to spend again. It is pretty much out of his scope. 

Monetary Policies Enacted:

MP1 - Interest Rate driven: Enacted on March 4 and March 15

MP2 - QE: Enacted from March 8 to March 23

MP3 - Putting money directly in the hands of spenders: Ongoing, but again, hard to incentivize people to spend. 

Conclusion:

I do believe we are in the depression face of a deflationary debt cycle. The Federal Reserve has done a great job through Monetary Policy so far, and the US Government has done a good job through Fiscal Policy so far. However both are running out of tools in order to solve the last piece of the puzzle: Get business and consumer to SPEND. That lands entirely on the US Government's Public Health Policy.",finance

I’d much prefer a career in the non-profit sector, but their pay is pretty dismal compared to what I make in the private sector. I’ve told myself that when my husband and I are debt-free, I will quit the corporate grind.

2. Invest and quit my job when my investment pool &gt; my debts (using that pool to pay my remaining debts monthly/dampen the pain of a reduced income)

* The power of compound interest has been pounded into me, so I know that contributing to my retirement in my 20s is important. However, I hate the idea of substantial debt and I worry that the interest rates that I would need to pay on potential loans would outweigh the interest earned on my retirement savings during the same period. 
* Would having a substantial sum in my savings account ($50-60k) when applying to grad school hurt my chances of receiving need-based aid? It would be frustrating to be penalized for saving.

personalfinance,I'm sick and tired of credit scores. I don't get it.,"Can anyone explain some nuances of credit to me? I've been working diligently to raise my scores, but I just keep floating in the same spot.

Today, my Equifax score dropped 16 points from last month. The only factors that changed, as per the report, is my balance decreased on my student loans by $400 (my last payment, the same payment I make monthly) and there was a remark put on my student loans that they're in deferment (as is everyone with federal loans), even though I'm choosing to take advantage of the 0% and continue to make payments. Why on earth would would this result in a drop in my credit worthiness?",finance
stocks,Welcome to wave 4 of the Elliot wave,"Hey All,

I have been studying the stock market for a while. My opinion (only an opinion, take your caps off now, take it off, good boy)

If this stock market has been following a pattern, its the Elliott wave's pattern and if the pattern is right we just entered Wave 4, what happens at wave 5? People try to buy the new ""dip"" and it goes a bit higher than we most likely transition to a crash (wave 6).

Wave 4: This wave is pretty disappointing for those that bought this stock too late. The stock moves a lot slower and is a signal that the best part of the trend is over.

Next wave:  Again, this wave is usually sluggish and not near as dynamic as the third wave of an Elliott wave cycle. This also marks the last burst of buying before a new downtrend starts.

Now stop typing the feds are pumping money into ETFs, they have been buying risk-free bonds, they just moved their focus into risk bonds and ETFs, will we see it a bit higher? yes, can the feds carry the entire market up? Not really, again my opinion, if I am wrong, good for you!",finance

&amp;#x200B;

* Powell says virus poses lasting harm, more may need to be done
* Federal savings plan delays transfer to fund with China stocks

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-12/asia-stocks-to-open-lower-after-u-s-retreat-markets-wrap?srnd=premium&amp;sref=VyUXtO60](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-12/asia-stocks-to-open-lower-after-u-s-retreat-markets-wrap?srnd=premium&amp;sref=VyUXtO60)

Article on Bloomberg, by Rita Nazareth, Vildana Hajric, and Katherine Greifeld.

U.S. stocks tumbled to a three-week low after Jerome Powell warned economic risks from the virus are significant and tensions with China flared.

The S&amp;P 500 fell after the Federal Reserve chairman said the threat of a lasting downturn can deepen without additional government spending. Equities extended losses after a federal savings plan delayed moving funds into an index with Chinese stocks, adding to tensions stoked by President Donald Trump. Treasuries and the dollar advanced.

&amp;#x200B;

The stock weakness has the S&amp;P 500 headed for its worst week since March 20, the session before a furious 30% rally started. Equities tumbled Tuesday after health official Anthony Fauci warned the pandemic could worsen if states open too soon, and some Fed chiefs expressed concern the recession will be long. Famed investor Stanley Druckenmiller also hit sentiment, saying stocks are too high. David Tepper joined hate chorus Wednesday, saying only 1999 was more overvalued than the current market.

“It continues the theme from yesterday that the recovery will be slower and more uneven than what markets may currently be discounting,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. “With the nice run off the lows, it makes sense to take some profits.”

Meanwhile, traders of fed funds futures pushed bets on a negative policy rate into next year. Powell acknowledged the speculation, but said such a move was not being considered -- though he stopped short of completely ruling the tool out as an option in the future.

“While Powell’s remarks paint a grim but realistic picture of the deep scarring of the virus on the U.S. economy, Fed watchers might find relief in the fact that Powell remains committed to deploy his remaining arsenal to the fullest extent as we continue to ride out the pandemic,” said Mike Loewengart, managing director of investment strategy at E\*Trade Financial. “This means their toolkit primarily relies on additional fiscal stimulus.”

Here are some key events coming up:

* U.S. weekly jobless claims data is due Thursday.
* China on Friday releases industrial production and retail sales data for April.

These are some of the main moves in markets:

## Stocks

* The S&amp;P 500 decreased 1.8% as of 1 p.m. New York time.
* The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 1.9%.
* The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 0.1%.

## Currencies

* The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index increased 0.3%.
* The euro decreased 0.2% to $1.0822.
* The Japanese yen strengthened 0.1% to 107 per dollar.

## Bonds

* The yield on 10-year Treasuries decreased two basis points to 0.64%.

personalfinance,Financial Education for Teens?,"Hi all!  

I've spent most of my life bouncing between good and bad credit.  I'm finally in a place where my debt is manageable and decreasing, and my credit report is free from derogatory accounts and information.

Because I spent half my life with poor credit, I am a huge advocate of teaching kids to manage their credit and finances as early as possible.  I spout off about it as often as possible, and I was pretty sure that no one listened.  Evidently my niece was actually paying attention!  Her mother is on the streets so she lives with one of my other sisters.  She asked if we could teach her about finances and good credit, something she knows nothing about.  I'm soooo excited to get her started!

That brings me to my question, what are the things that we should be educating our teens about to prepare them for their financial future?  I am thinking how to read a check stub, how taxes work, getting and maintaining a bank account (the minor bank account thread is what finally pushed me to ask this question), interest rates/credit cards/good vs. bad debt.  Of course that's just a high level idea of topics, what else do you think would be a good addition to helping her be financial knowledgeable?  Are there any tools or sites you would recommend?  She's bored and needs something to do so our plan is to give her a topic once a week or so and having her research and then we can discuss in detail what she learns and how to apply it to future decisions and actions.  Thanks in advance for any help you can provide!",finance

personalfinance,MAJOR warning if you have a Great Lakes student loan right now,"TLDR; Great Lakes submitted the WRONG student loan status code to the three credit bureaus for ALL of their customers with student loans (as part of the CARES act) and it's causing everyone's credit scores to drop 40-50 points.

I'm in the midst of buying a house and my lender pulled my credit yesterday. She told me what it was and I was shocked, it was lower than I thought. I know numbers fluctuate from free services like Discover and Credit Karma, so I looked at Credit Karma to see the numbers from two of the bureaus, and sure enough, a MAJOR drop of 45 points on both of them over a 4 day update period. I know the numbers themselves aren't super accurate, but the trends sure are.

I saw some articles on this subreddit today alluding to this issue but I wanted to verify the info. I googled and found ONE article about this [here](https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/atlanta/student-loan-borrowers-discover-significant-drop-credit-score-following-cares-act-protections/DBNHS5ODKBCNHOE7VKU3RWNFVI/). It was actually pretty informative and accurate.

I called Great Lakes and a woman confirmed that it was true: their company had provided the wrong 'code' to the credit bureaus, essentially causing everyone's student loans to look they are in REAL forbearance/deferral. I asked if it was worth looking at my account to see if I was one of the ones affected and she told me that it wasn't necessary because it affected everyone across the board. Wut.

My follow up was 'when is this going to be fixed?' and she said on May 31st they send their normal monthly report to the three bureaus and it will have the correction in there and will set everyone's accounts back (yeah right! Trust but verify!). As for when the bureaus will fix it once they receive the new information, I am still sitting on hold with one of them now to find out.

The last thing I asked her was if this was written publicly anywhere so that I can show my lender proof of this information. She said that they don't have it posted anywhere. WTF! No press release, no statement, NOTHING. Feels weird to know about something that affects so many people, yet there's only one article on it.

I'll update this post once I talk to someone at TransUnion. What a crazy year.

**EDIT: Since Credit Karma pulls Vantage Scores, I wanted to see what my FICO scores were. I signed up for a free trial with Experian's service that gives me access to all 3 bureaus' credit FICO 8 scores. It also has, just for Experian scores, a breakdown of a specific credit score for mortgage, auto lending, and credit cards. The  only one that was slightly low, at the level my lender would have seen, was the mortgage one. I cannot see 'trends' here to see if it had dropped recently.**

**Conclusively, I cannot confirm yet for SURE whether my lender uses a FICO 2, FICO 8, or Vantage score. Going to talk to them this morning.**

**EDIT: Sidenote cuz I thought this was pretty cool: as part of the trial of the experian service (and I would hope the other bureaus have something similar), you can use a 'score simulator' to click scenarios to see specifically what your credit score will do when you get a new credit card, pay off credit card balances, close down a credit card, etc. Thought that was pretty cool. It's only on the FICO 8 score model though, not the mortgage, auto, or credit card one.**

**EDIT: My mortgage lender talked to the credit company and they said they use the following scores to determine my rates:Experian: Fair Isaac v2Transunion - FICO Classic 4Equifax - FICO Classic**

**In conclusion, I'm calling this the ""Great"" Mishap of 2020. As far as I know, unless anyone says otherwise in this thread to me, Great Lakes screwing up the code is only affecting the Vantage Score calculations (used by Credit Karma) and not Fair Isaac or FICO.**

**Last edit I swear: If you have student loans on automatic deferment because of CARES, do yourself a favor and open a high yield online savings account. ""Pay"" the same monthly payment into that account every month. If you have an emergency between now and September when payments are due again, you'll have cash on hand. If you don't have an emergency, even better - take that massive lump sump you saved up with hopefully &gt;1.5% interest, and make a massive payment on your loans - target the ones that HAD the highest interest rates. It's a win-win scenario.**

**EDIT on 5-21: Looks like** [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamminsky/2020/05/19/student-loan-servicers-are-dinging-credit-reports-for-the-cares-act-forbearance/#23d7e28865fa) **decided to write an article about it! And Great Lakes denied any wrong doing in a statement.**",finance

personalfinance,What private student loans should I consider for getting a B.A in Pure Mathematics?,"Hey Reddit,

I consider taking out a private student loan. I know it should be the last resort but I do not know what else I can do. Right now I need to make a choice: either accept the fact that every resume of mine or any application form I have to fill out will always contain ""Education: High School Diploma"" or take out $50,000 in loans to pay the tuition fees and housing. Honestly, I do not know which of the two is worse. I have done all I can to avoid taking out a private loan. I have completed two years at a community college, knocking out all of the utterly useless general education requirements, and have transferred to a local university (not a top university, but quite decent). I'm a math major and intend to go to graduate school for a statistics degree. Now, the university I transferred to, has not offered me anything but federal loans. The federal loans cover only half of the tuition each semester. On top of that, I will be living in a $400-$500 apartment close to campus. Also, I will not be working during the first semester at the new school, since I intend to take a quite heavy course load so that I can graduate in two years and have a good chance at being accepted to a Ph.D. program. I understand that taking private loans should be the last resort, but I have exhausted all options. I have also considered taking Parent Plus loans, but since I will be 24 years old next semester, I will not be eligible for that. Thus, private loans.

Currently, as an in-state resident, I will need to pay $8,500 in tuition fees per semester. I also estimate that I would need about $6000 per year to pay rent plus food. Thus, two semesters at university would cost me $23,000. I need to complete four semesters, hence $46,000 for a B.A in Pure Mathematics. I intend to go to grad school right after undergrad and would like to defer payments until after I finish the graduate program. On the bright side, I will be 24 next year and will be considered an independent student, so I hope the university will take that into consideration and offer me some financial aid.

Now, the reason I'm typing all this: I need your advice on what private student loan lenders I should consider? In particular, I need to pick one that would allow me to DEFER payments until I finish graduate school. I have talked with Sallie Mae about Smart Option Student Loan, and they said that I would be able to defer payments until after I finish grad school. But I'm not sure I believe that. They told me that I would need to call an agent after completing undergrad so that they would defer payments. Could anyone confirm that it's true? If no, what other private loan providers should I consider?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I should clarify a few things. I was awarded $3500 in Stafford loans per semester. That means I would need to find an additional $5000 to pay off the rest of the tuition, and hence I'm considering taking out a private loan. In total,  I would need to borrow $14,000 in Stafford loans and about $32,000 in private loans to pay for the entire undergrad degree. Secondly, I should have mentioned something about the career I'm pursuing -- machine learning (basically applied statistics). It's quite difficult to get a job in the industry straight out of undergrad unless you go to a top school, so most ML positions require a graduate degree. What I'm worried about is that  I won't be allowed to defer payments and would need to start paying off the undergrad debt while in grad school. 

Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,"E-filed taxes a bit early; ""still processing"" to this day.","I'm not sure if this is the place to ask, but I've scoured the internet and haven't found a direct answer.

So I e-filed my 2019 taxes on January 29th of this year through TT, just as I have the past few years. It's a joint file with my wife and my toddler claimed. Last year, it went through no issues and we got our state and fed within a few weeks (we got the EIC so fed took a bit longer, which we knew). However, this year, we only received our state rather quickly. We also received a letter from the IRS on February 20th stating our federal return was randomly selected for an accuracy review but we didn't have to do anything on our end. Nothing changed in our filing compared to last year (TT had all our information already). It said it would take up to 60 days then the refund would be issued, on top of the extended wait due to getting the EIC. 

Here it is May 13th, and the Where's My Refund? tool STILL shows ""still processing, a refund date will be provided when available"" with no progress bar. We haven't received anything else from the IRS, and we can't call due to no live staffing.

I have an online credit card with a bank (mbna.ca) , some back story, I have had this card for 6 years and have never made a single purchase on it because I exclusively use it to hold debt at times due to their low interest rate.

About a little over a month ago I received a phone call from [infoprotector.ca](https://www.infoprotector.ca/), this company claim to be calling **on behalf of MBNA** and were offering a credit protection plan of some sort which I quickly denied. A few weeks later they sent me a physical mail pamphlet which i just threw out cause I was by no means interest in their service.

Surprise surprise 2 weeks later I got charged ($100) for this service that I never authorized, wanted nor gave my credit card info to. In fact like i said above I have never made any purchase with this credit card so the only explanation is that they somehow got the info from my bank, which makes sense since they literally said they were calling on behalf of MBNA.

I tried to contact MBNA about it and they quickly turn me down and asked me to contact infoprotect first. Turns out their phone number cant be called due to covid19 so I had to send them an email which two weeks later is still unanswered.

I went back to my bank to try and report their fraud but they once again said there is nothing they can do about it cause is a third party. After a lot of back and forth and getting transfer through every department, they ended up transferring me to the dispute department which I waited for one hour and they never pick up despite every other department picking up within 1 minute.

Is becoming quite clear to me that they aren't gonna help me and are defiantly in on the fraud, so I'm just wondering what are the best next steps for me take? also wondering if anyone else with this bank has had similar issues?

She came back on the phone and offered me a 4.6% rate, no hard credit check needed, for a one time $50 processing fee that gets added on to the final payment of the loan, or final payoff, whichever comes first.

personalfinance,401k to ROTH IRA Rollover - Laid off edition,"Hi Finance Gurus on Reddit!

I need your advice. I was recently laid off from my employer in late FEB 2020 from ole 'Rona, and I will not return to the same employer. When the market was in a down spiral, I also moved 100% of my 401k mutual fund investments to Money Market account to not lose more % of my total portfolio (I know...I know...rookie mistake, but whats done is now done....Lesson learned) and my overall portfolio went from $150k to $100k :(

I am 29 and believe to rollover my company sponsored 401k to a ROTH IRA would be in my best interest. I figure with 40ish years left until retirement, a ROTH conversion now makes the most sense - i bite the bullet and pay taxes now on $100k, and be able to withdraw the rewards of compound interest 40 years from now tax free in its totality.

Here is my logic and please let me know where this doesnt make sense:

1. I understand that I will owe Federal and State Income Taxes on that $100k - but if there is a brightside to my story, I now dont have to pay taxes on $150k hahaha
2. I forsee the majority of this year job hunting and free-lancing work so WITHOUT the $100k I expect to be in the lowest tax bracket for 2020 single filers - 10% (less than $9,875 annual income)
3. I know that I can split the rollover into X% per year to allow me to stay in a lower tax bracket. So for example, 2020's 12% Tax bracket is $9,876 to $40,125. So if I rolled over, say 33%, I would only owe 12% of $33k rather than 24% of $100k. In this example, I am taking three years to roll it all over, paying $12,030 total in federal taxes over 3 years  vs $19,200 for taxes owed this year.
4. Using the previous example, I understand that would I lose the magic compound interest if I break up the rollover into 3 years. If I go ahead and transfer the full $100k, by the end of that third year, I believe that $100k would be larger than rolling over $33k for three years, and be large enough to offset the tax differential.
5. Plus THIS year, I know what my federal tax bracket will be (10%) and I can plan accordingly. The next three years I will not know what my tax bracket will be.
6. I thought about rolling over $30k in Dec 2020 and then the other $70k in Jan 2021. That way, they hit different tax years AND I wont lose the compound interest opportunity because I will be with the full $100k within weeks of each other. 
7. As I mentioned, i am 100% in money market accounts. If I invest back into mutual funds and wait until Dec to rollover, my account will be (hopefully) larger, and I will owe more taxes than rolling over today.

So should I rollover now? Other plans/strategies I havent considered?

I have 8 loans with interest rates ranging from about 3.85% - 5.1%. I’m currently on the standard repayment plan, and my payments are about $450/mo, which we can afford, but I’m considering different repayment options to try to take advantage of the different interest rates to pay less over the life of the loans. This would basically involve switching to either the Extended Fixed (EF) or Extended Graduated (EG) Repayment Plan, which would increase the term of the loans from 10 years to 25 years and decrease my minimum monthly payments. Under EF my payment would be reduced to $227/mo and under EG my payments would start at $151/mo and ramp up to $392/mo.


I would make the minimum payments on all of the loans, except for the one with the highest interest rate. I would apply any money saved from my payment reduction (and maybe apply an extra $50 - $100 each month) to pay off the highest interest loan first and then avalanche that money into the next highest interest rate loan and so on. I know that I need to check with my loan servicer first to find out if additional money over the payment amount can be applied to the principle. If this isn’t the case, then I will use either a savings account or a money market account to save up and pay off the loan once I have enough.


Is there some reason why I shouldn’t do this though? Are there hidden fees with switching payment plans? Are there other disadvantages to doing this that I may not be considering? Thank you.",finance

personalfinance,Traditional or Roth 401k?,"I’m having a hard time deciding if I should be making traditional or Roth contributions to my 401k. I typically follow Ramsey’s advice, and he recommends roth- but the more I research it I feel like traditional might be more advantageous.  I wanted to check in and make sure I’m not misunderstanding or missing something. 

Currently make ~$125k with a unionized 12 year pay scale that tops out at ~$215k. 27, hope to retire at 60. I currently live in a high income tax area- my state and city affective rate is 4.4% on top of federal. I don’t plan to live here forever and will eventually move to a lower/no income tax state. Wouldn’t it be more advantageous to make pretax contributions now to lower my overall tax bill, and then in retirement when I’m in a lower tax rate area pay tax on the withdrawals? 

I do have a Roth IRA so I will have some tax free funds to withdrawal from in retirement.",finance

investing,Why TLRD:US market participants have likely misjudged,"Tailored Brands (Ticker code TLRD:US) has gone down by 95% or so already, to $0.98 USD. Yet sellers may have made mistakes in valuing this business. 

Tailored brands is currently the largest provider of formalwear in the USA, and it owns Men's Wearhouse, JoS. A. Bank Clothiers and Moores.

Perhaps due to the some mental shortcuts, like:

Social proof:
They see what the crowd is doing (selling) and they feel comfort in doing the same thing, even if they are wrong.

Scarcity:
People see a recession coming and they want money in their own hands. This drives down the price further.

Authority:
People tell them that brick and mortar stores are going out of business due to internet retailing. Not really applicable in this case, because suits need to be measured.

Reciprocation:
The stock has lost a great deal of money for them, so they want to pay it back by driving the price even lower.

Also, losses are more painful than gains so they probably want to be rid of it just so they don’t see it anymore.

Or other factors such as:
Not recognising the assets TLRD:US owns, since it was renamed from Mens Wearhouse circa 2015.

Leverage:
If they are leveraged, they may be forced to sell the stock regardless of their desire to keep it. This doesn’t apply to us!

Also there are psychological motivators such as:
Incentives (extreme fear, wanting to make their money fast - so looking for the hot new opportunity)

Denial (they see what they could have spent the money on otherwise)

Pavlovian association (feeling like they are being punished for holding the stock, association of suits with funeral wear due to constant pandemic coverage and so on)

Stress induced misjudgments (perhaps due to leverage)

Extra vivid evidence (recent bankruptcies of the clothing retailers Nordstrom and J Crew).

Analysing the raw numbers shows it is unlikely that TLRD:US will go out of business, as they have had between $11m and $240m of positive free cash flow annually in the last 5 years. The company is also the largest retailer of formalwear in the USA and therefore likely has many economies of scale.

Human misjudgments have therefore likely made this the deal of the year, due to the lollapalooza effect of multiple mental shortcuts and multiple misjudgment factors.

When we purchase, we can probably expect the price to drop further.

My prediction is that once the big dividends kick back in, the reciprocation tendencies to drive down the price further will fade. Once the price stabilises, a new type of social proof can arise and the stress induced misjudgements can decrease. These are causes which would work to show the real value of the business and therefore drive the price up, perhaps significantly. Once the pandemic coverage ceases, positive pavlovian associations can kick in.

At the current time we can get more value than we have paid for. TLRD:US is now selling for less than $50m USD (private market sale price) yet has nearly 1700 stores, 17000 employees, $3.3B in sales and between $11m-$240m in Free Cash Flow annually. That is like buying a grocery store for about one to five years of net profit.

Additionally it is the largest formalwear provider in the USA, with corresponding efficiencies of scale that are unavailable to most competitors.

Also, TLRD:US debt is funded by 4.5% bonds. If inflation rises to its historical average of between 2% and 4%, the debt burden of TLRD:US will be far lighter than it is at present.

A strong inflationary force at this time is the Fed printing trillions of dollars, because it makes each USD purchase less than it did previously. If inflation goes above 4.5%, the $2.2B worth of bonds will actually become assets on the balance sheet of TLRD:US and they will be a corresponding liability for the fixed debt bondholders.

TLDR; 

Tailored Brands is currently selling at a price far below its value to a private owner. This rare mispricing has occurred because temporary mistakes in judgment are working together to drive down the price. Such stupidity can't last for ever.",finance

personalfinance,To pay or not to pay...,"I'm a teacher with current $26k in federal student loans from my master's degeee (that the system required me to get to move up a measly pay scale). I've done the math a million times and no matter the feds service loan forgiveness programs, etc. I am still in the end going to pay a ridiculous amount more than I ever borrowed and contine to pay a good chunk of my income towards it every month until then. (They should be forgiving me $17,500 already, but they find trivial technicalities to deny me and forgive nothing.)

Anyway, recently I sold my place and made a nice profit. And since Covid, they've dropped my interest rate to 0% with no payment or penalty till September. I'm tempted to just pay it all off in full with my earnings and save thousands in interest and not have that monthly payment in my life. Just put it behind me and move on.

Yet, I'm hesitant because of all the buzz about a massive loan forgiveness bill for Americans. I'd hate to give them the $26k just to learn later had I not, I could have had no loans and kept the money in my own pocket. Also, refinance, or making any changes to my loan will essentially write me out of any forgiveness opportunities in the future.

personalfinance,"$30k in up to date debt, $17k in collections -- wondering if I should start a Debt Management Plan and settle for 50% of the loan currently in collections?","Hi there! I am hoping to get some advice regarding my current debt situation. Yes, I am $47k in debt and obviously very concerned about it. I moved to Los Angeles a year and a half ago, and was unable to find a job as quickly as I expected -- in the year it took to find one, I blew through my savings and took out a few loans in order to keep my head above water (I WAS working at the time -- I commuted weekly to San Diego to work 30 hours a week at my last job there, but it wasn't enough). The 17k loan was basically a refinance of an earlier large loan from a different creditor. Because I was unable to find a job for so long, I defaulted on this loan (choosing to stay current on my other loans/credits in order to continue having a good relationship with my credit union) and it was sent to collections last December.

&amp;nbsp;

I was sent a letter in April from American Recovery Service Inc. claiming they now had my debt and offering to settle for 50% of the amount due ($17087 &gt; $8500). I missed the 21 day deadline to respond due to the hectic stress of the pandemic, and am wondering it its worth it to reach out to them. From what I've gathered while doing research, settlements usually mean you pay everything right then and there... which I obviously can't.

&amp;nbsp;

I reached out to a nonprofit credit counseling company and had them look at my debt. They sent me a Debt Management Plan that claims I will be paid off on my debt in 3 years, but this does NOT include the loan that is in collections. I emailed the company back asking why the loan in collections was not included and if they are doing anything to help out their clients affected by the pandemic. My credit agency is pushing back due dates and willing to work with me when I get behind, and I'm not sure that would also be possible with the DMP. The DMP monthly payment would be $968.

&amp;nbsp;

My credit was actually really good before my loan payments fell behind, and I know it's likely shit now. I've been too scared to check it...

&amp;nbsp;

Current Bills:

- $1400 Rent
- $75 Electricity/Trash
- $35 Gas
- $50 Internet
- $85 Car Insurance
- $115 Health Insurance
- $235 Car Payment ($3070 left on car loan, car is 6 years old and in great shape)
- $250 Personal Loan 1 ($8870 left, 16.35% interest rate)
- $170 Personal Loan 2 ($5930 left, 16.35% interest rate)
- $260 Credit Card ($12930 balance, 13% interest rate)
- $60 Care Credit Line ($1700 balance, 14.9% interest rate)
- $80 Cell Phone
- $75 Cat related expenses


&amp;nbsp;

Total: $2900 before food/gas/etc

&amp;nbsp;

Total with Lending Club Loan, not included above: $3350

&amp;nbsp;

I was lucky enough to land a job in October, then another in December, so from end of December through March I was working 70-80 hours per week (because of the debt I stupidly incurred). I work in hospitality though, and both of my hotels closed the same day due to COVID-19. I am currently on Unemployment.

&amp;nbsp;

Income After Taxes/month (before COVID-19): $4000, at the least
Income After Taxes/month (EDD): $3000

&amp;nbsp;

Unfortunately, EDD bases your eligibility on the first four of the last five quarters.... and I made half of what I did at the most during that time. I have been meaning to call them to see if they will change it to what I made in the 5th quarter and this backpay me for the difference, but I'm not holding my breath that they will agree. I will likely not return to work until July. I wish I could say that I put a lot towards savings during these three months, but I had a few other debts I needed to pay off and expenses I could not avoid.

&amp;nbsp;

If it helps, I am single and live alone. My family are all living barely above the poverty line, and have all left the state. Due to my career, I have to stay in LA.

&amp;nbsp;

Tldr: I am wondering if it is worth it to contact the collections agency that currently owns my $17k loan and try to settle it for half off (and if they will do payment plans?) or what other options I have besides ignoring it and hoping for the best. I am also wondering if a debt management plan is a smart choice to pay down my other debt.

Mining state calls blockchain the main innovative technology, they say it fuels the competitive environment for the crypto business and connects large bankers and telecommunications giants.*

On April 18, 2020, the Agricultural Bank of China launched a test application for using the national cryptocurrency. The acronym “DCEP” (Digital Currency Electronic Payment) is increasingly discussed in the analytic community. The app became available in test mode in large cities of the country.

The system created by the Agricultural Bank includes two types of digital currency. The first is the currency for commercial banks. The second is the issue of digital money for individuals and legal entities by commercial banks. 

Although mobile payments through Alipay and WeChat Pay have been used in the daily life of the Chinese for a long time already, the government made another step and created a new cryptocurrency.

The digitalization of the global financial Chinese system and the widespread adoption of blockchain technology – that is a future caused by the actions of China, which initially remained wary of such initiatives.

## A little bit of history

In October 2019 Xi Jinping, the President of China announced that the development of blockchain technology is one of the state’s priority tasks and called for boosting the development of this sphere in the country. It was heard by the grapevine that China started developing its own cryptocurrency in early 2014. The news about new crypto periodically popped up, although according to the experts, the country was more associated with strict regulatory actions. The industry was even included in the preliminary list of industries that should be banned and some blockchain conferences were closed by the police.

Much has changed with the release of Libra (Facebook cryptocurrency). Facebook is a private company with 2.3 billion users worldwide and the prospect of issuing its own currency could potentially turn the project into the main global cryptocurrency.

China took this as an incentive. First of all, an incentive to push the dollar out of the electronic payment market, and in the future, to change the entire global financial system. Looking at the example of China, and realizing what opportunities might be missed, many other countries have announced the development of their CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency). For example, the European Central Bank, the Central Bank of South Korea, Russia, Sweden, and several other countries talk about their own developments in the field of state cryptocurrencies.

Forbes has placed the launch of the DCEP in the first place on the list of the most influential events that will determine the blockchain ecosystem in 2020.

However, China has always been the largest cryptocurrency miner. Huge mining farms and some of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges are based here. And while Xi Jinping’s statement was logical and expected, official support from the authorities led to major investments and blockchain research. The Chinese telecommunications giants have been given the green light to freely innovate. In fact, they were given tremendous power. Immediately after the October announcement, shares of Chinese technology companies rose significantly, as well as Bitcoin prices. Requests for the term “blockchain” in the Chinese searching engines have grown up 60 times.

## Blockchain Bonds

The scale of China’s actions is huge nowadays. One of China's largest commercial banks, Bank of China (BoC), issued blockchain bonds for $2.8 billion. Two-year bonds will go on sale with an interest rate on the coupon of 3.25% per annum.

The Bank of China intends to direct the raised funds to support small and medium-sized businesses. Entrepreneurs will be able to obtain loans at lower rates since the blockchain system allows the bank to reduce the cost of issuing and circulating debt instruments.

## What positive changes will the project bring?

The introduction of the DCEP system will help the People's Bank of China reduce the cost of issuing money. It will also help reduce the commercial banks’ costs in transactions, improve the business climate in the field of innovation, and minimize risks. When making an interbank transfer using the new currency, users will not be charged a transaction fee. DCEP will allow us to make transfers within the country and abroad easily. It is most likely that the DCEP platform will have more opportunities and advantages. Now the world needs to accept the fact that the monetary and financial system has entered a new era.

Is it worth it to refinance to avoid paying PMI? My interest rate is at 4.5% which I think could be better as well.

personalfinance,How to strategize paying down student loans in the time of 0% interest,"I am an American with a hefty student loan debt burden but am fortunate enough to be able to still make aggressive loan payments throughout this covid crisis. As I look towards the next 5 months where my federal loans are accruing no interest I am faced with a decision.

A) Keeping with my snowball plan and paying off a $7500 fed load (typically 5% interest) by September. (This would free up $135 of monthly payment)

B) Using that $7500 to pay down a federal loan balance of $70,000 (made up of several small loans ranging from 4-6%) targeting the payments towards the higher 6% loans.

C) Something else

investing,A resource on market components and their relationships?,"Hi guys,

I recently started working at a multi-asset class family office shop that manages HNW $$. I come from a deep fundamental value investing background (read: model building) so have little experience with market components besides a high level understanding. My managers are extremely well versed in understanding the components that make up markets and the managers we use for each component. They go deep on analysis regarding the books of our managers - things like the relationship between preferred shares and credit markets at different points in time in the economic cycle or how $$ should be allocated between commercial mortgages and other types of private debt or credit. They seem to know all of this stuff off the top of their heads and understand the dynamics between all of these components to a degree I never even considered. To this end - I could spend a few years learning it from the little tidbits they give me at a time (in their notes, in client meetings, etc) or, preferably, I could learn this stuff on my own. Would anyone have any resources? I wouldn't even mind high level stuff so I could dig deeper as I develop more of an understanding. I am even happy with resources that are within asset classes - for example the relationships between the economic cycle or interest rates and value vs growth, market cap dynamics, etc.

personalfinance,Should I buy a House now or wait?,"Hey guys- been a lurker on this forum for quite some time now and would like to get some advice on my current situation and what I should do. 

I'm currently 38 Years Old and long story short have been in debt most of my life. My wife and I earn $205K Annually Combined. (and climbing) We spent the last year clearing out all of our debt outside of a Small Personal Loan we took out to consolidate our high APR Credit Card Debt that has a balance leftover of about $8000. 

In December of 2019 we for the first time made a serious effort to start saving the majority of our Money and have done really well, averaging $5300 a Month for a total of $31,800. We currently have a Monthly Rent of $1500 of a decent, but not great Condo, and no children yet. 

Our Lease is running out in August, and by then my Projections have us at a minimum of $42,500 of available cash, and as all of you know Interest Rates are low these days. We both have Credit Scores of 760+. My initial plan was to extend our lease another 6 Months and continue to save as much as we can, as I've never had the chance to really put money away, as I moved out of my parents when I was 18 and have been on my own ever since.  However, with the current Interest Rates I'm wondering if it would make sense to just buy a House in July and do a Conventional Mortgage with 5% Down. 

So my question is, should I go with my initial plan of continuing to save for the rest of the year to grow our savings? Or should we just take advantage of the Low Interest Rates and buy something with a lower Down Payment now. I was never a big believer in the ""Rent is a waste of Money"" logic for the obvious reasons- I like having a locked in Housing Expense with no surprises, but I feel like I'm second guessing myself every other day so I'm turning to you guys for some thoughts.

Should I take this chance to pay down my debt before it starts accruing again? Or should I keep saving?

I have a pretty good credit score thanks to student loans so I was approved for 2.9% APR for 60 months. Speaking of student loans, I graduated college in December of 2017 owing around $35,000 and have managed to chop it down to $26,000 now. 

My loans are federal so they are all in forbearance until September, but I have continued paying them to take advantage of the zero percent interest rate. I have been paying anywhere from $340 - $800 a month as my salary increased over the years (the minimum payment is something like $340 a month for the 10-year repayment plan). Oh and in case it was unclear, I am not in danger (fortunately) of being furloughed due to COVID-19. I work in tech and specifically in the healthcare sector, so I don't see that as being likely, and in fact my company is currently hiring.

I think I can afford this car (and the insurance), but I'm having reservations as to whether it's really worth it.

Rent: $567

Utilities: \~$70

Groceries: $200

Restaurants: $200

personalfinance,My employer is no longer matching 401k contributions for the remainder of 2020. Should I decrease my 401k contribution in order to increase my student loan payments?,"Hi all!

First, sorry for the lengthy post. Just wanted to make sure I provide enough context on my situation.

I'm a 22-year-old who has been working full-time at a Fortune 500 company for little over a year (graduated college Dec 2018). I'm currently paying off a 5-year student loan (been paying a bit more than the minimum payment, so it is planned to pay off in November 2023, and it has a 2.99% interest rate). I also am paying a 3-year auto loan (been paying just the minimum payments, so it is planned to pay off July 2022, and it has a 1.95% interest rate). The auto loan minimum payment is larger than the student loan's minimum. I live at home with parents who fortunately don't make me pay rent.

I've been maxing my IRA contributions as quick as possible while meeting my company's 401k match of 4%. Once my IRA is maxed, I've been increasing my 401k contribution to 16% as this is as much as I can afford while maintaining my monthly expenses and depositing an adequate amount to my emergency savings.

With the market heavily down due to COVID, like with everyone's 401k, mine has dipped quite significantly. Additionally, my company announced that it will not uphold its 401k match for the remainder of the year. With this in mind, would it be smart for me to decrease my 16% 401k contribution and increase my student loan payments until my employer begins matching 401k contributions again?

TLDR: Employer is revoking its 4% 401k contribution for the remainder of the year. Should I keep contributing 16% of my salary to my 401k, or should I decrease this contribution and put that money towards my 5-year, 2.99% interest student loan?",finance

2. Knowing Wall Street and knowing that they don't have a moral compass as much as we (the average retail investor) would hope they do, they probably sold off a lot of their risk in junk bonds to the Fed
3. If consumers default on private company owned mortgages, it affects the market as a whole in a dominos effect, but what happens when they default on mortgages that are now part of the Fed owned CDOs? Will it affect the market as much? I don't see it happening.

Would love to see some thoughts on this line of thinking.",finance
Bitcoin,Arca Top Manager: Hong Kong financial policy will trigger a new phase of bitcoin growth,"According to Jeff Dorman of the American financial company Arca, the monetary policy of the Hong Kong authorities will create conditions for a sharp increase in interest in Bitcoin.

In Twitter, the executive director of the company wrote that BTC may become one of the most popular instruments after Hong Kong will launch a policy to stimulate business activity.

Dorman responded by his post in the social network to the readiness of the authorities to allocate up to 10,000 Hong Kong dollars ($ 1200) in cash to each resident of the metropolis.  It is planned to allocate a total of HK$120 billion from the budget.  Of this amount, part of the capital will be used to provide guarantees to companies that receive loans at low interest.

The ultimate goal of the new budget policy will be to create conditions for more accelerated economic growth.  This was reported by The South China Post with reference to Hong Kong Finance Secretary Chan Moe.

The publication also notes that the authorities plan to use reserves of 11 trillion Hong Kong dollars to improve economic performance.

Jeff Dorman is confident that the allocation of cash to ordinary citizens of the metropolis is the first step to a new phase of take-off of Bitcoin.  People will choose not to spend the money allocated to them, but to invest it in safe tools.  One such instrument is Bitcoin, which now needs support.

The top manager of Arca stressed that all the funds allocated to the authorities are unlikely to go to the cryptosphere, but part of this capital will certainly be able to penetrate into digital assets, and BTC in particular.

Moreover, the population of Hong Kong knows very well what the cryptographic currency is.  Bitcoin was popular in the region during the riots six months ago.",cryptocurrency

crypto,"Please break my stable, structured hash function","I've developed a stable (across compilers, platforms, lib versions, etc) structured (of data like - \`Vec\`, structs with fields, enums, that sort of thing - like [EIP-712](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-712.md)) hashing function that is now strong enough that I can't break it. I would appreciate more eyes and expert review.

It's here: [https://github.com/graphprotocol/stable-hash](https://github.com/graphprotocol/stable-hash) , is implemented in Rust, and contains a cyptographic and non-cryptographic variant.

First, what this function intends to accomplish, what is in and out of scope for its needs, and the broad design.

# Features:

There are a couple of features that this structured hash needs that make existing solutions like EIP-712 impractical.

First, this hash needs to be constructed incrementally in an ""online"" mode because not all of the data is available at once or in order. By way of example, given the finalizer `h` and a partial update function `p`

    h(
        p({ ""a"": 1 }),
        p({ ""b"": 2 })
    )
    
    ==
    
    h(
        p({ ""b"": 2, ""a"": 1})
    )

Second, a limited set of backward-compatible changes to the ""schema"" must be supported such that adding fields with default values has no effect on the final hash, and changing certain data types has no effect on the final hash.

For example:

    h(p({ ""a"": 1 }))
    =
    h(p({ ""a"": 1, v: []}))

Supported data type changes include but are not limited to things like changing a 32 bit integer to a 64 bit integer.

This feature is at odds with any kind of replay protection, and replay protection is explicitly out of scope and would have to be something that would be layered on if desired.

# Needs

No collisions. Given any schema (or any schema evolution makes backward-compatible changes) it should not be possible to find a collision for a valid value for those schema(s).

No information leak. Given a hash, a schema, and some strict subset of fields for which values are known, it should be as hard for an attacker to derive the unknown values as brute-forcing the state space for those values.

No derived hashes. Given a hash, a schema, and some strict subset of fields for which values are known, an attacker cannot swap out a known value for another value and produce a valid hash of the whole set of values.

Other attacks? I don't know what I don't know, so please feel free to ask if there's another kind of attack you think I might need to be concerned about.

# The design

Broadly the way cryptographic variant works is to assign a unique `SequenceNumber` to each and every field of the struct (including nested fields, each member of an array, etc). This `SequenceNumber` is concatenated with the value of the field in a way that is injective. The resulting byte stream produced by this concatenation is hashed using Blake3. The output hash is then mixed into a multi-set hash function based on multiplying and modulo a large prime. The final composite multiplication is then fed into Blake3 again to produce the final output. There are a bunch more details, and I'd be glad to answer any questions in this thread or on GitHub but all the details are in the code as well.

stocks,The Impact of COVID-19 on Realty Income ($O),"Hey guys, I've been doing some analysis on Realty Income ($O) and thought I'd share the COVID-19 section of my analysis for anyone who may be interested.

# Impact of COVID-19

**As of May 1, 2020**:

* Collected 82.9% of contractual rent due for the month of April 2020 (99.9% collection from investment grade tenants).
* In rent deferral discussions with tenants that account for a majority of the unpaid contractual rent - hopefully plans will be put in place, so at worst this revenue will just be delayed rather than lost.

On April 9, 2020, Realty Income borrowed an additional $1.2 billion under its revolving credit facility to increase their cash position to $1.25 billion as a conservative measure due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of May 1, 2020 Realty Income has $1.9 billion in borrowings outstanding under their revolving credit facility, with a remaining available capacity of $1.1 billion. 

Also on April 9, 2020, Realty Income withdrew their 2020 guidance due to the ongoing uncertainty regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Have yet to provide revised guidance.

&amp;#x200B;

# Industry/Tenant Breakdown of Payments

***Significant Industries Affected***;

\* Health and Fitness Industry \- Accounts for 7.2% of Realty Incomes' portfolio, however the industry only made up 2.5% of April's income - meaning *only 34.72% of tenants in this industry paid rent*.

\* Restaurants \- Accounts for 8.8% of Realty Incomes' portfolio, however the industry only made up 6.3% of April's income - meaning *only 71.59% of the tenants in this industry paid ren*t. 

\* Theatres \- Accounts for 6.0% of Realty Incomes' portfolio, however *none of the tenants in this industry paid ren*t in the month of April (a 0% rate).

Smaller Industries affected; Child Care (accounting for 2.2% of the portfolio but *only 31.81% paid*), Automotive Tire services (accounting for 2.1% of the portfolio but *only 71.42% paid*). 

&amp;#x200B;

***Significant Industries which have Not Been Affected***;

\* Convenience Stores \- Account for 12.1% of Realty Incomes' portflio, with the industry amounting to 12% of April's income (a *99.17% pay rate*).

\* Dollar Stores \- Account for 7.9% of Realty Incomes' portflio, with the industry amounting to 7.9% of April's income (*100% pay rate*).

\* Drug Stores \- Account for 8.6% of Realty Incomes' portflio, with the industry amounting to 8.5% of April's income (a *98.84% pay rate*).

\* Grocery Stores \- Account for 5.1% of Realty Incomes' portflio, with the industry amounting to 5.1% of April's income (*100% pay rate*).

\* Transportation Stores \- Account for 4.2% of Realty Incomes' portflio, with the industry amounting to 4.2% of April's income (*100% pay rate*).

From this we can see the three primary industries affected by COVID-19 are the fitness industry, restaurants (large portion of payment is from takeways), and theatres. This makes sense as all these industries would have suffered from the lockdowns in place due to consumers being restricted from using their products and these industries essentially having to shut down. It is however, nice to see that a large portion of Realty Incomes' portfolio is made up of tenants from industries that are actually benefiting from the COVID-19 lockdown (i.e. convenience stores, drug stores, grocery stores, and transportation). These staple industries make up around 38% of Realty Incomes' portfolio. 

Given the circumstances having an 82.9% collection rate is great, however it is worth noting that going forward this is likely to get worse, esepcially in the short-term (at least the rest of FY20). The industries largely affected by COVID-19 make up roughly 26.3% of Realty Incomes portfolio, given this we could probably estimate that in a 'worst' case scenario roughly around a quarter of Realy Incomes' revenue may be at risk (this is only if the lockdown/COVID-19 issues further deteriorate). With EBT margins for FY2019 being 29% this is a great sign when analysing the 'downside' and risk Covid-19 poses to Realty Income. With the EBT margins being greater than what I believe the worst case hit to revenue will be, it's highly unlikely Realty Income make any substantial losses in the coming months (although obviously income/profit margins will significantly decrease as has already been seen goin from an average of 98% to 82%). 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Risk Factors**

*Adverse Material Factors*;

\* Deterioration in both Realty Incomes' and their tenants ability to operate \- Due to lockdown/social distancing - *Causing major loss in revenues.*

\* May experience difficulties in leasing, selling or renewing expiring leases \- *Could cause major losses in impairments (selling properties lower than their carry value in weak market conditions)*.

\* May experience difficulty accessing bank lending, capital markets and other financial markets on attractive terms, or at all. - *This is highly unlikely at the moment*, especially with the how governments are pumping money into their economies to avoid a situation like this (trying to avoid credit crunch which occured during 2009-2011). *Although if the virus/lockdown continues the quantitive easing we are seeing will not be sustainable and we then could see another credit crunch.*

\* Could negatively impact credit ratings and the interest rates on borrowings.

\* Market value of Realty Incomes' properties may incur impairment charges or asset write-downs.

\* 84% of tenants are Retailers who depend on customer traffic \- *Prolonged lockdown will materially affect business.*

I'm lucky enough to have a decent job lined up post-graduation in this economy but I'm not sure what's the best path to go from here.

Here's some numbers:

* I'm 200k in student debt right now, mostly from the government's Parent Plus Loans, which has an interest rate of 7.08% as of 2020.
* New job pays 70k a year, employer matches $0.50 on the dollar for 401k
* Currently have $400 stashed in savings (Acorns). I'm thinking about ramping it up to $200 a week to get my emergency fund to \~$9,000 asap
* Monthly expenses usually at $1,500 to $2,000 in HCOL area

I know, 200k is absurd. But like I said, me and my parents knew *nothing*. My question is, if you were in my place, what would you prioritize first? Build up emergency fund or start with student loans? My 6-month of expenses is around $9,000, would it be smart to save less (say, saving for 3-months instead) since I'm loaded with debt? And how fucked am I with 200k at 7.08%?",finance

This year, I took out around $40k in Stafford and Grad PLUS loans at a rate of 6-7%. With the recent announcement that federal graduate student loans will be 4-5% next year (AY 2020/21), I will have the ability to borrow an extra $29k outside of what I need for tuition and fees.

personalfinance,"Should I pay off credit cards, refinance auto loan, or save for a house?","I just got my $1200 check. I’m not sure what to do with it that would make the biggest impact. I’m still working full time, so I don’t really need it for food and I don’t want to blow it on gadgets and gizmos. My goal is to be debt free (house exception) as soon as possible.

My financial stats:

I make about $2000 a month before bills, this is what I’ve got:

$1400 in credit card debt, pretty high interest rate on them, consistently drop that amount by about $200 a month.

$9000 remaining car loan at 15% interest. I have a much better credit score now than when I bought it a few months back, so I know I could drop that rate.

I’m saving for a house, need about $5000 for down payment and closing costs, currently at $500. Hoping to be there by December, but I know that isn’t likely.

I owe about $3000 in back taxes (not currently paying, but I know it will need to be gone before buying a house.)

I have about $500 remaining in other debt (no interest, paying $100 a month)

I’m not good at math so I’m not sure which one to throw this check at that makes the most financial sense.",finance

Normally, I wouldn't be looking at a refinance because we're expecting to move in a year or so, but if it's authentically cost-free, it seems like there's no downside.  It's not a particularly huge cut in interest rates, but even if it would shave $100 off a month, that's a nice savings over a year.

I was about to roll them all together, thinking that if I just paid with the same 23-year term as the original mortgage, I'd save money all around. But when I used a loan calculator, it wasn't really working out. So, I broke down the cost of each loan, and even though the loan rate is lower, by bundling the HELOCs in with the longer term (23 years), it still looks like I'll end up paying a LOT more interest on them. Is my math correct? Should I keep them separate even though they are at a significantly higher interest rate? Thank you, math geniuses. I appreciate you.",finance

Pros:

* Employees can mostly work from home efficiently, companies can save on renting
* The consumer spendings on flights, travels, hotels, sports events, restaurants will be replaced by buying computer hardware, software, cloud, online entertainments
* Drugs developments are also in Nasdaq
* While Nasdaq (QQQ) is down from 237 to 222 (-7%) more money is expected to be printed. And already, some money supply has increased since crysis:
   * M1 from 3.99 to 5.01 (25%)
   * M2 from 15.51 to 17.76 (15%) 
   * Fed balance sheet from 4.13 to 6.9 (67%). 
* This crysis is not financial, that’s why the stock prices are based on expectations that the things will come to normal, sooner better than later

Cons:

* Until the vaccine and treatment people spend less, not known when the economy returns
* Even after returning to normal some frugal habits of un-spending will stay for a long term
* The bonds and real estate crash can lead all the markets down because of lack of liquidity.

So, to summarize, pros are stronger, I will not be surprised if Nasdaq will even double itself this year.",finance

* Card 1: $270 at 19.99% 
* Card 2: $4920 at 17.99% (with balance transfer apr)

* Minimum payments due every month: $229.41

At the moment I have around $96,000 in student loan debt which includes private and federal student loans. I will be taking out my last private loan for the summer which will get added onto that. I will be getting $9,500, but will have a lot left over after tuition (\~$3600) so I plan on returning most of it back. 

Realistically my student debt will be around $104,000, with my highest apr for the private loans being 6.75%. I am obligated to make payments on the private loans, which costs me around $200 a month. 

So in total my bills come out to $429.41…

On the bright side I was still able to save up around $9,000 before I lost my job. I live with my parents, so I do not really have expenses other than gas, and I’m not really going anywhere anyways.

I’m currently 24. When I got my first job when I was 16, my parents and I set up a linked checking account through USAA so I could get direct deposits and use my own debit and credit cards. 

Now, 7 or so years later, I still use that checking account and have a savings account as well. I also have USAA car insurance and renters insurance in a package. Honestly, USAA is great, I’m thinking of opening another savings account just for better interest rates but I have had 0 complaints with them from a banking perspective, and since my insurance is linked through them and my direct deposit for my job, I would really like to reduce the hassle of finding another bank and switching everything over. 

HOWEVER, My mom is a bit of a narcissistic control freak and while she has never done anything out right and likely never would, she still is checking my accounts because they are still linked and will make weird comments to me here and there like ‘you’re doing a good job saving, I saw you put more in your savings account.’ Or, the other day, my dad asked if I was still getting paid from my job and my mom answered before I had the chance to and was like ‘yeah she is.’ 

I’d really like to get advice on what to do here...anyone have any similar stories or suggestions? Can I call USAA and have them somehow unlink our bank accounts? I read somewhere that’s USAA minor accounts automatically become unlinked once the minor turns 18, but that is clearly not the case here. I’d like to keep using USAA...my father works for the Veterans Affairs Hospital which is the only reason we even have USAA—so not even sure if I’d be able to have it on my own?

stocks,Cannabis Legalization Speculation (Or How I Rolled Up Money and Smoked It),"For some background about why you shouldn't listen to me, I've been passively investing for years in index funds. I'm a huge believer, because I'm a software engineer and I understand the power of machine learning algorithm's ability to analyze large data sets and predict upwards or downwards trends. I've gotten to the income level where I have excess money outside of my normal investing and I have spent the last few months learning in order to start actively investing.

I am still working out the specifics of what individual stocks I want to invest it; I don't know enough about assessing individual stock value to invest. However, one area I've really wanted to buy into was all the cannabis ETFs that started popping up in 2019. The symbols are MJ, POTX, THCX, YOLO and TOKE. With the exception of MJ, which opened in 2015 and did quite well for years before dropping down to the current $11 a share, all of these opened up at around $20-25 a share and then dropped to their current price of around $8-10 a share. I own shares in all 5 at the moment.

From the research I have done, this drop in price can be sourced to three factors: the volatility of the industry and all the bankruptcies (heavily influenced by the fact that no one can use anything in the financial industry that is federally insured), federal legalization not being a Fed priority and the recent Coronavirus lockdown. Some people have argued that this is a bad investment, because of how many losers there have been in the cannabis industry.

They are correct from that perspective. However, I don't need the existing companies in the 11 states with legal cannabis to do well; I just need the Feds to have a change of heart and stop blocking federal legalization, leading the way for new investment opportunities to be created in the other 39 states. It will trigger another gold rush with other guys looking for investment vehicles to put their money into. I can sell half of my investment after that to take my gains and leave the other half to see if the industry stabilizes in the long term with federal support.

So, why would the Fed support federal legalization now? Why would they have a change of heart?

One, this is already going to happen culturally; it's just a matter of time. It's a priority for every DNC presidential candidate (might be wrong on a few) and the House already got a bill to federally legalize it passed last November. The right has largely conceded they have lost on this issue with the new generation of conservative podcasts in the form of Ben Shapiro and Steven Crowder taking a libertarian position to it. Joe Rogan on the #1 largest podcast in America smoked cannabis with Elon Musk and everyone giggled when ten years ago, it would have been unheard of. It's just not something that's overly popular with the GOP base, so they cared about it.

So why care about it now? Because we just spent a trillion dollars to fight a global pandemic. Every state just blew their budget. Tax money talks, the government needs a lot of it and cannabis has produced a lot of tax money for states like Colorado.

Why would you do something unpopular like raise income tax to pay for all this when you can do something popular with the millennial generation (legalize cannabis) while introducing new lucrative federal and state tax opportunities that will be palpable to the older generation (only cannabis users pay the tax)?

I was holding off on investing in the industry, because I didn't think it would be federally legal until the current political party rotated out in 2024. However, I believe the COVID lockdown has created a serious opportunity for this to happen in the next year or two once all the dust settles and the money printer stops going ""Brr!"".

Or none of that happens, the ETFs continue to trend downward, because of all the bankruptcies and the funds all close because federal legalization happens, so wish me luck.",finance

Because of that, my refinanced amount is $1,500 more than the current loan amount $12,000. They said if disbursed, the extra money would be returned to them and applied to the principle or I can start the loan process over for the lower amount. If I let them overpay the original lender and get back the overage, will that impact how interest is accrued or does it not matter?

personalfinance,What to do with about $6k in this situation,"Assuming we have an emergency fund what should I do in this situation:

Car loan $19k left on note. Current market we are upside down about $2k if sold private party.  Paying $350/m - interest rate is high so this is only going to get worse on value of the car (and yes I am aware a car is not an investment) 

Student loan $6.4k left - interest rate is also high but minimum payment is only $60/m

Obviously at first glance, Eliminating the student loan would free up $60 extra a month to put towards the car. But the car is deprecating rapidly and by the time it’s all said and done we will have paid more in interest on the car than the student loan.

My thoughts are to put the $6k at the car and continue to make the same $350 payment and any extra $$ to pay the vehicle off first. Because if we have any payoff left on the student loan we could shift the $350 after the car is paid for to that loan, thus knocking off whatever we have left on it quick. 

We have no other debt to knock out besides these last two items.",finance

personalfinance,Car loan and saving money,"Me and my girlfriend are thinking about moving out and finally getting an apartment. With that being said I purchased a car last summer that was a reasonable price and would allow me to pay off the loan within a year. I currently have around 9.5k left on the loan at a roughly 8% interest rate. Realistically I could pay off my loan and still have a couple thousand left over in savings. However with the uncertainty of covid my plan has changed a bit and I'm now thinking about saving more of that money in case something were to happen once we get an apartment so we can still safely pay rent.

Should I pay off the car loan and just not worry about it or try to refinance to get a lower rate.
If I refinance does it make sense to pay half the remaining loan in that I'll get a lower interest rate and being paying a lower amount each month?

My credit score is good but I have very little consistent payment history on anything. If I payed off the loan I would still have around 5k left over in savings for the apartment in case of an emergency. We both also make just under 3k a month so collectively were doing pretty good.

I am also taking out roughly 80k in loans to get my nursing degree over the next 16 months which I'm deciding to pay just interest on while I'm in school and start making full payments 6 months after graduation.

I originally planned to go with the VA loan, but the lenders are trying to steer me more towards a conventional loan.  They said the conventional loan looks better to buyers since it is less complicated and that I might get a better interest rate.

personalfinance,Financing an ADU through HELOC or something similar,"Hello All,

I've been mulling over this idea for a while and I'd like someone with more knowledge on the topic than myself to poke holes/reveal liabilities in the idea. Here's how it goes:

Let's say I have a $500k home with $300K paid off. I therefore have 200k in equity to finance renovations. 

I want to use the equity in my home to finance the construction of an ADU on top of my detached garage, so I open a home equity line of credit. 

The garage isn't very large, 400 sq.ft, so let's say the construction costs end up being \~100k. ADU gets built using the HELOC, and I then get the home re-appraised, and the value of the home goes up 100k, dollar for dollar.

Last step is to refinance the mortgage, and use the pay out of the increased home value to clear the costs of the HELOC. My property taxes go up, but not enough to offset the (potential) income I would gain through renting the ADU. My mortgage payments don't change (provided the refinance leaves me with an equivalent fixed interest rate) because there isn't a net change in equity.

So, ""free,"" ADU?

&amp;#x200B;

I have a hunch that a renovation loan could trim down the steps required, but what flaws are there , if any, in the plan I've laid out?

stocks,Is the Fed stabilizing (kinda mean reverting) markets via index ETF's on a daily basis?,"Rambling, possibly incoherent, conspiracy theories incoming.

Maybe this is just a conspiracy theory and I am just a crackpot. However, is it possible the Fed is buying and selling large index ETFs (e.g. SPY, etc) in a way that keeps the daily change in market indexes fairly smallish? Kinda sorta mean reverting near the end of the day?

I don't know if you have noticed, but it seems like a large sell off is about to begin and then all of a sudden the market reverts to almost a 0% change for the day. People say it's priced in, but P/E's have never been higher and the Nasdaq is 6% down from all time highs again. Technically, the S&amp;P is not even in bear market territory (20% down) anymore. How did the the biggest economic catastrophe since the Great Depression, and maybe including the Great Depression, simply turn into almost a simple market correction that is not really a bear market anymore? 

It seems that everyday we see news items where some piece of data is the worst its been since the Great Depression. Yet, market stays flatish almost every day. Maybe slightly up, maybe slightly down. Circuit breakers are no longer even close to being tripped. Previously we were tripping them almost daily. Now, it seems like there is less than 1% movement on the day even when the biggest economic news data in a lifetime are occurring almost every day.   

When you take the total work force that was employed in Feb and divide it by the 3% that was unemployed before covid plus the number of people that have been layed-off since covid, that gives an unemployment percentage of 25.9%. In the Great Depression unemployment topped out around 25%. Yet, the market stays flat or is green on the day. At most maybe 1% movement or so. I have seen the Dow drift down to -400 points over a few hours and then mean revert to zero in the space of minutes. No overshooting. Just zero or very close to it.

In volatile times people usually fly to safety at the end of the day. However, now it seems like at the end of the day the market roughly mean reverts. Not exactly, but close. Again, some days slightly up, some slightly down. Very modest changes.

Can the Fed do this indefinitely? I mean, if the Fed is going to put a hard (or kinda hard) floor on the market why shouldn't I just buy SPY and call it good? Fed's got my back. Fed's got all our backs. Everybody's 401k is in index funds, so it would almost be done as a national security issue for the Fed to stabilize the markets and prevent retirements from being wiped out. Especially if they could do it in a way that is not super obvious. Maybe via Blackrock?

I remember reading about the GFC several years after it happened. I also remember reading about actions that were taken and dire situations that existed that were not disclosed to the public when they occurred. For example, during the GFC ATM's were 72 hours from no longer working and McDonalds was a week or so from no longer being able to make payroll. Yet, I don't remember news stories at the time covering that. I only learned about years later. I mean, there were some hypothetical articles written by people trying to sell gold but nothing telling us that in 3 days from now ATM's will stop working. 

My point is that, just like last time, there may be huge events happening behind the scenes that the public, news, and media are not privy to and will not find out about for 5 years or so, well after it is all over. Further, I think part of the huge events include guaranteeing the market doesn't drop 56% like it did in 2008 or 80% like it did in 1930. Perhaps those shares of SPY that the Fed is purchasing will be very slowly sold once things settle down or perhaps the Fed will simply throw move them to a dusty part of the basement that is seldom visited and forget about them. 

Markets closing soon. Checking indexes just now, S&amp;P is literally 0.00% changed on the day. Jeez, just rolling my eyes at this point. At least make it a little less obvious.",finance

BUT you bet your ass I will continue to gather them because I'm scared that I might need them for something important in 20 hours time!

I would love to speak people who work at games studios which incorporate this mechanic into their game(s). Is it something that you genuinely think players want in games? I mean, it very well could be and I'm very much in the minority here for all I know. Is it there because the mindless tedium can boost sales of microtransactions that let you skip the gathering?

&amp;#x200B;

**Summarized**

&gt; Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co said on Friday it will build a semiconductor facility in Arizona, as concerns grow in Washington about the security of the technology supply chain which is largely centered in Asia.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Construction is planned to start in 2021 on what would be TSMC's second manufacturing site in the U.S. The factory will be focused on producing so-called 5-nanometer chips, the latest in semiconductor technology being manufactured today.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;TSMC's decision to build a new U.S. chip plant comes as President Donald Trump's administration continues to scrutinize the global technology supply chain upon which American firms rely on.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;In particular, the government has sought to reduce reliance on China, a feat that may not be so easy, experts previously told CNBC. During his presidency, Trump has also looked to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. While TSMC is a Taiwanese firm, it does have plants in China and has big Chinese customers such as Huawei.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The Trump administration was considering a rule earlier this year, that if implemented, would require companies using U.S. chipmaking equipment to apply for a license before supplying Huawei, according to a Reuters report in March.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;""This deal bolsters U.S. national security at a time when China is trying to dominate cutting-edge tech and control critical industries,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a tweet.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;TSMC said it decided to build the new plant with the ""Mutual understanding and commitment to support from the U.S. federal government and the State of Arizona."" ""This project is of critical, strategic importance to a vibrant and competitive U.S. semiconductor ecosystem that enables leading U.S. companies to fabricate their cutting-edge semiconductor products within the United States and benefit from the proximity of a world-class semiconductor foundry and ecosystem,"" the company said in a statement.",finance

personalfinance,"I was recently scammed out of $2500 dollars from a pet-sitting job, and my bank is closing my account.","Hello! I am looking for some advice after falling victim for a pet-sitting scam (Vermont, US). 
I apologize if this is the wrong place to post. 

On May 7, I accepted a dog-sitting job. I was super excited since the pay was fairly high ($30/hr), and I love taking care of animals. They emailed me my first week's pay of $450; however, they sent me an additional $2000 to wire to their ""pet supplier."" I know this should have been a huge red-flag, but I unfortunately gave them the benefit of the doubt (I have had other pet-sitting gigs with similar set-ups, albeit, I met these clients in person). These folks were moving from Canada to our little shire, and had a baby on the way (not an important detail, but it fed into my gullibility). They were hoping to move to our town by mid-May, but because of COVID-19, their move was delayed to the end of May. Hence, they wanted me to receive their pet-supplies, just in case they did not arrive in time.

As you can guess, I deposited the check (via my banking app) and wired the money as directed via Zelle. Because the wire worked, I believed that they were trustworthy. I also sent them receipts/screenshots in order to confirm the deposit and the transfer. 

On May 11, they sent me an additional check for the same amount ($2450), which I deposited (I believed their story of needing dog pens, like the fool I am). Of course, my bank account was put on hold (meaning I am unable to make withdrawals, deposits, etc) and investigated. At this point, I was mainly worried for my employers, because the hold was causing stress for the ""expecting mother"", who was instructing me. I really wanted to prove that I was trustworthy, so I assured her that I would keep them updated with the hold and would transfer the funds as soon as they were available.

On May 13, the checks were found to be fabricated (it read ""the paying bank returned the check unpaid because the item was altered""). Duly, both deposits were rescinded. My bank also charged me a return fee for each check. 

I now have a balance of negative 2500 dollars. I called the bank to ask how I should proceed, and they told me that they cannot help me in any way. Because of this fradulent activity, they will close my bank account in the next four days. They also need me to pay off the negative balance on my account... which I do not know how to do, since I am unable to make electronic deposits and the closest branch is in another state-- I cannot drive. I am also unable to recover the funds I sent through Zelle (they are not liable for fraudulant activities). 

Yes-- I know. I am an idiot. I am a fool. And most of all, I am a broke, moronic, dimwit who ""rationalized"" every single glaring red flag that came my way. I am more ashamed and disappointed in myself than I am angry at this point. In fact, before posting here, I found that this scam is quite common. Except unlike all the other pet-sitters who justifably asked if this ""job"" was a scam beforehand, I fell for it. 

So I need to ask: is there anything I can do? Is there anything I should do? Should I bring this to a lawyer or private investigator? Can I file for fraud? Are there better questions I can be asking the bank?

Or 

Much to my chagrin, should I accept this as an expensive life lesson? 


If this helps, here is some of the information we exchanged:

I have given them my name, address, age, phone number, receipts/screenshots, and email (gmail). 

I have their phone number, email, Zelle number, CashApp username, and the email of their ""financial clerk"" who sent me the checks in the first place. While we initally communicated via email, my ""employers"" preferred to communicate via text. However, I would not be surprised if these accounts were not linked in any way to their actual person(s). I also have the email of their ""niece"" who was an alumna of the college at which my mom is employed (my mother is the one who forwarded me this job opportunity).

They know that my account is on hold; they MIGHT not know that I have fully realized their scheme.
My evidence? It's slim. They have texted me 1-2 times a day asking for updates on the hold. For each of my replies, I have assured them that I would send their funds to them no matter what (I offered to send them back their check by May 21, the day after the hold is lifted (my initial misinterpretation before calling the bank)).

They do not know that my account will likely  be closed. Maybe they are trying to squeeze a little more out of me? Do I have a chance to reverse this?

For now, I am going to call the bank again to see if I can get any more advice/information, since the first person I spoke to was a bit unclear. 

I would really appreciate any help or advice on this matter. I will happily clarify anything in this message. I tried to be concise with the information for privacy reasons, but I will add more details if necessary. I am also willing to share the emails and text messages if required/permitted.

I can also share the list of red flags, which is steadly growing the more I think about what just transpired.

2) Emergency Fund - About 6 months worth of essentials.  (Such as rent, food, etc.) - I plan to also move this to a High Yield account, where it is still accessible but earns an ok interest rate. (Tips on banks appreciated... Ally? Marcus?)

3) ""Savings""   This is where I am confused.  I currently have a decent amount of money in this account (above 10k but below 15k) and it's just sitting there.   I am also porting over an old dead employer 401k in to an IRA with Vanguard, which is what got me thinking about all of this. 

In my head this ""Savings"" was for a future purchase, such as a home, or a car.  I like to keep my checking account rather low because it makes me aware of what/how I'm spending my money and keeps me from overspending. 

But now I am wondering if it would be better suited in a) a High Yield account like Ally earning the 1.25 percent.

investing,House Passes $3 Trillion Democratic Stimulus With No Path to Law,"The House passed a $3 trillion Democratic economic stimulus bill Friday that Republicans and President Donald Trump have already rejected and isn’t likely to trigger bipartisan negotiations any time soon.

The measure, passed 208-199, would give cash-strapped states and local governments more than $1 trillion while providing most Americans with a new round of $1,200 checks. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said it should be the basis of talks with the GOP-controlled Senate and White House, which have called for a “pause” to allow earlier coronavirus recovery spending to work.

Pelosi this week has repeatedly invoked Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who has said Congress will have to inject more fiscal stimulus into the economy to prevent a prolonged recession. The U.S. has more than 1.4 million coronavirus cases, and more than 86,000 have died.

But Republicans also cite the Fed chief, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell saying Powell hasn’t explicitly said how quickly Congress must act. He and other Republicans have dismissed the House Democrats’ bill as a liberal wish list and are using it to attack Democrats, whom polls give an increasing chance of holding the House and taking the Senate in November’s election.

“This is much more about political messaging than effective legislating,” Republican Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma said.

Powell Warns of Broad Virus Danger, Bats Down Negative Rates

GOP members said some provisions don’t belong in a virus bill, such as reductions in immigration enforcement, providing stimulus checks to undocumented immigrants, money for the troubled U.S. Postal Service and a national requirement to hold elections by mail.

Trump and Republican congressional leaders have acknowledged, however, that some sort of further economic stimulus will likely be necessary as the economy continues to shed jobs. The number of people filing for unemployment benefits since March now exceeds 36 million.

“Phase four is going to happen but it’s going to happen in a much better way for the American people,” Trump old reporters Friday. He said he holds leverage over Democrats in any future talks.

“We have all the cards because we have the cards of the American people. I know what they want,” the president said.

personalfinance,Can't Decide Which HYSA To Choose,"I can't decide between Capital One Performance Savings, HSBC Direct Savings, and Marcus by Goldman Sachs. I've also heard a lot about Ally on this sub but I haven't heard the name before so I'm a bit skeptical

Suggestions? 

For context, I'm a college sophomore looking to open a high yield savings account to start an emergency fund. I currently have checking and savings accounts with a bank but their interest rates are abysmal and I'd like to start an account for long-term savings.

My biggest concerns with opening a new account are 1. easy access to the funds 2. customer support/mobile application 3. general ease of use. 

I am not particularly concerned with the interest rate given the current circumstances and the fact that I won't have a lot of money to save just yet. I do, however, want reliable customer support to answer any questions as I learn to manage my money.

personalfinance,How to pay off student loan with Navient online?,"I'm trying to pay off as much of my student debt using the debt snowball for my 7 federal loans, especially since we don't have interest accruing during this time until September. Navient gives me two options and I'm not sure which one to pick or if it doesn't make a difference since I'm paying the full amount of the loan. I just don't want to be screwed over since I've heard some horror stories about Navient. 

This is what it says on Navient: 

You made a payment that is equal to or more than the amount of future monthly payments – do you want to be billed for your full Monthly Payment Amount? (Note: We’ll always apply your Overpayment toward your Current Balance.)  
The Billing Direction assumes that payments you have scheduled are going to post to your account.

**- No, Advance my due date by the number of payments I cover.** Even if you have zero amount due on your billing statement, continuing to make payments will reduce your total cost of borrowing.

**- Yes, Bill me for my full monthly payment.** You will be required to make a full monthly payment with your next billing statement.",finance

# **Stocks could be stuck in a range until there’s more proof reopenings are reviving the economy  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/15/stocks-could-be-stuck-in-a-range-until-theres-more-proof-reopenings-are-reviving-the-economy.html)**
*****
&gt; Coming off a volatile week, analysts expect stocks to continue navigating choppy trading as investors try to build a view of what the economy will look like once states reopen.
*****
&gt; Recent data on April employment and consumer spending show the worst declines in post-World War II America. More data in the coming week may reveal how the housing market fared in April, after the economy abruptly fell off a cliff when states shut down their economies in the second half of March.
*****
&gt; Investors’ focus will also be on the government stimulus programs to help the economy and markets get through the coronavirus crisis. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin appear before the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday, as it reviews the government’s trillions in spending to help the economy, businesses and individuals. An interview with Powell will also air on “60 Minutes” Sunday night.
*****
&gt; Earnings season is winding down but there are a number of reports from major retailers, like Walmart and Target, which should show that the big box stores and discounters are making out better than other retailers as consumers halted many discretionary purchases and moved more shopping online.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down nearly 2.3%, in its worst week since March 20. The S&amp;P ended at 2,863. The Dow was off about 2.6% for the week, in its worst week since April 3. It finished the week at 23,598. The Nasdaq also had its worst week since April 3.
*****
&gt; # Home sweet home
&gt; “Housing is going to be important in that you’ll see the chilling effect that Covid has had on housing as well, less on construction than on sales, but on both,” said Diane Swonk, chef economist at Grant Thornton. “That’s going to be an issue. One of the key things we’re watching going forward is the credit market and housing. There’s been a real tightening of credit because of the servicers.”
*****
&gt; Swonk said the mortgage servicers are caught in the middle between the banks and people who aren’t making their payments. She said it has been impacting lending. “That’s something we cannot afford. Housing was on a tear before, and it has to pull us out of this,” she said.
*****
&gt; Retail sales were down 16.4% in April, and there was an unevenness of performance across the sector. The only positive category was online shopping, up 8.4%. Clothing and accessories, the types of things department stores sell, fell by 78.8% in April. Building materials and garden equipment were down just 3.5%, and that could help Home Depot and Lowe’s which report earnings on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.
*****
&gt; “Market reactions to the data have been somewhat muted,” said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital. He said stocks on Friday were reacting negatively to threats from China that U.S. companies could be targeted if the U.S. does not ease up on Huawei. “The markets right now don’t need another reason to be pessimistic. It seems like both the bond market and stock market are getting a little tired. Both markets are looking for the next catalyst.”
*****
&gt; # Solvency concerns
&gt; The Fed has been given generally high marks for keeping markets liquid, but analysts say they are now more worried about the solvency of companies.
*****
&gt; “There’s an interesting kind of threshold here as we’re approaching three months stay at homes or shelter in place. We’re moving from a liquidity challenge, which the Fed helped us address, to a solvency challenge,” said Michael Arone, chief market strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said unpaid bills start to pile up and default rates rise on credit cards and mortgages.
*****
&gt; “The longer this goes on, the harder for folks to make those payments. That’s why states are eager to open even if it has some risks,” Arone said.
*****
&gt; The Fed on Friday said the pandemic poses severe risks to businesses of all sizes and millions of households. It said there could be a sharp rise in defaults as households struggle to pay bills.
*****
&gt; Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, said the Federal Reserve has removed worries about liquidity with its facilities and asset purchases. “The reality is the solvency issue which is the bigger focus of the economy and they go hand in hand with the employment issues as things that have to be addressed at some point,” he said. “Look out over the next two months, the solvency issues are based on how the economy reopens and how that medical progress looks.”
*****
&gt; Emanuel said the Fed’s corporate bond program has helped companies refinance and clean up their balance sheet so if insolvencies become a big problem it would not be until next year. He said how the economy reopens over the next few months will determine what happens.
*****
&gt; “The numbers are out in front of us. We do believe based on what we’re seeing so far, this is the trough of every reading we’re seeing. We do believe things are going to get better. We don’t have reason to believe that’s not the case,” he said.
*****
&gt; Emanuel said the reopenings would be graded as a ‘B’ of ‘B+’ based on how they appear to be going so far, including the infection rates. Nearly all states have resumed some level of activity.
*****
&gt; But the market will continue to be choppy until there is more medical progress, such as a vaccine. In a sense, the market depends on science more than ever, Emanuel said.
*****
&gt; “If all of a sudden, we have a commercially viable vaccine in the first half of next year that’s going to be injected into peoples’ arms prior to, or well before the fall of 2021, then I do think you could make the argument the market is potentially going to hit new all time highs,” Emanuel said.
*****
&gt; # Range bound
&gt; For now though, he sees the market as range bound, and the S&amp;P 500 is currently about in the middle of it.
*****
&gt; “We have been very adamant about the definition of this market as being neither bull nor bear. It’s bounded by the 200-day moving average on the top, which is basically 3,000 and the 200-week moving average on the bottom which is 2,667 right now,” said Emanuel.
*****
&gt; Arone agrees stocks are going to be choppy, and could react to friction. He said one source of friction is the disagreement over state reopenings, between people who want to see a reopening and those that fear a new outbreak. He said there is also friction between Republicans and Democrats.
*****
&gt; “I think until we get clarity that the economy is open and without incident and some of these economic numbers are improving, I think the market is going to remain choppy,” he said.
*****
&gt; Emanuel said it makes sense for the market to remain in a sideways range while different issues are resolved.
*****
&gt; “On a valuation basis, the market is expensive but it’s not so expensive if you assume this economic period is going to be over in a couple of quarters,” Emanuel said. “If you return to growth in the third and fourth quarter which we don’t necessarily know if that’s going to be robust, but we expect it to be better next year.”
*****
&gt; He said he expects a recovery to be more shaped like a bathtub, than like a V or a U, meaning it would be elongated on the bottom before an upturn.
*****
&gt; “Part of what actually supports the market is this abject negativity. When everyone is already pessimistic the presumption is they’ve already done a lot of their selling so there isn’t a ton of fuel for the downside there,” said Emanuel.

# Retail Sales Telling the Economy’s Story

&gt; Retail sales numbers for April were released today, and the basic story was no surprise. Retail sales fell a record 16.4% in April, after declining 8.4% in March, already the largest decline since the government started keeping records in 1992.

&gt; The year-over-year decline of more than -21.6% has already topped the -11.5% seen during depths of the financial crisis, as shown in the accompanying chart. But there are hints that the decline has been heavily influenced by store closures rather than shoppers tightening their belts, and that might bode well for the future as the economy gradually starts to open up.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.15.20-Retail-Sales-Blog-Chart.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “One of the reasons for the major decline in retail sales is simply because many businesses are closed,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “As the economy slowly opens back up, retail sales should bounce back, as pent-up demand is there”

&gt; For the past two months, the economy experienced an 89% decline in apparel sales and a 59.2% decline in restaurant sales. These numbers capture the effects of businesses closing. The one area of the retail sales numbers that has done relatively well? Groceries had a record April as consumers stocked up and continued to show some strength in May.

&gt; While it will take time for retail sales to get back to normal, several factors are in play that should help support retail activity as the economy opens up. Pent-up demand is increasingly evident. Fiscal stimulus should help preserve incomes. And consumer balance sheets remain relatively healthy, with credit card debt declining the most in decades in March. While weakness will continue, April data may be the low point for retail sales, with good prospects for some strength in the second half of the year. A return to full strength will ultimately depend on the progress doctors and scientists make in limiting the dangers from COVID-19, but even the gradual opening up of the economy may show retail sales numbers starting to stabilize as early as next month.

# How Expensive Are Stocks Right Now?

&gt; As stocks rallied 30% off the March 23 lows and earnings expectations were cut dramatically, valuations have become increasingly concerning for many investors (including some high-profile hedge fund managers being quoted in the financial press).

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the forward (next 12 months) price-to-earnings (PE) multiple for the S&amp;P 500 Index recently eclipsed 20, which is overvalued based on historical averages and at the highest level since the tech bubble in the late 1990s.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.14.20-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; While stocks look expensive on this metric—one of the reasons why we expect a correction of perhaps 10% from the April 29 highs—valuations may be getting too much attention.

&gt; “Stocks look overvalued based on earnings estimates for the next year, which will probably fall further,” said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “While the return to 2019’s earnings levels may still be two years or more off, the potential for steady improvement and low interest rates suggest they may not be as stretched as they appear.”

&gt; So how worried should investors be? Here are three reasons not to worry too much:

&gt; * Earnings will eventually come back. This recession has an end date, and eventually we’ll beat this virus. So while earnings will take time to reach last year’s levels, they should steadily improve starting next quarter. A vaccine could accelerate the timetable.
&gt; * Interest rates and inflation are low. A 20 PE with a sub-1% yield on the 10-year Treasury without a whiff of inflation on the horizon is not unreasonable. And Federal Reserve support isn’t going away anytime soon. In such a low-rate environment, the opportunity cost of waiting an extra year for earnings to come through is not high. Most of a stock’s value is derived from the earnings the company could generate in year two and beyond.
&gt; * Valuations are not good short-term timing tools. There is essentially no statistical relationship between PE ratios and subsequent one-year performance for the stock market. Although we expect more volatility as the path of the economy and corporate profits becomes clearer, we also expect stocks to grow into their valuations as earnings likely recover next year.

&gt; Stocks are expensive on traditional PE metrics, and a correction would not surprise us. But given the environment we’re in, valuations are not as worrisome as they may appear. The potential for a steady recovery in earnings over the next couple of years with low interest rates suggests that some of the valuation fears may be exaggerated.

# Why Gold Will Continue To Shine

&gt; Gold has done quite well so far in 2020, up more than 12% year to date versus the S&amp;P 500 Index which is down about 10%. We started to warm to the yellow metal late last year and continue to think it can serve as a potential hedge in a well-diversified portfolio for suitable investors.

&gt; “From COVID-19, to massive monetary stimulus, to historically lower yields, to potentially negative fed funds rates down the road, there are many reasons to think gold could continue its recent strength,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, gold based for years before breaking out last year. This is a strong chart from a technical perspective and eventual new highs over the coming years could be quite likely.

# Retest Possible, But Bottom Likely In as Jobless Claims Trend Lower

&gt; Initial Weekly Jobless Claims of 3.3 million, 6.9 million, 6.6 million, 5.2 million, 4.4 million, 3.8 million, 3.2 million and 3.0 million the past eight weeks, totaling 36.5 million, is astonishing. The good news is the trend is lower and as we pointed out in mid-April four weeks ago a spike peak in Initial Claims and an immediate precipitous retreat has been an effective indication of a bear market low over the years.

&gt; Today’s chart, presented above, is from the FRED database hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis compares the recent history of Jobless claims with the Wilshire 5000. (Gaps in the Wilshire index line are market holidays.) Clearly, the March 23 low and the spike high in Claims at the end of that week correlate quite well.

# Sentiment Unexpectedly Improves

&gt; The preliminary read on sentiment from the University of Michigan was a surprising bright spot in Friday's weak economic data as the headline reading improved from 71.8 up to 73.7 versus expectations for a decline to 68.0. Even with this increase, sentiment remains near a 10-year low, so it's not as though investors are actually positive, they're just less negative. While the increase in sentiment was a bit of a surprise, it makes sense. April was a month where the economy was essentially shut down, so the impact of that sudden stop on sentiment was intense. However, now that things have started to thaw a little bit, you can't fault people for becoming more optimistic.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051520-UMICH.png))**

&gt; While consumers are feeling a bit better about the way things are, they are still extremely uneasy about the future. The chart below breaks down sentiment towards current conditions and expectations about the future. While the current conditions component showed some improvement, the expectations component saw further declines.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/051520-UMICH-C-vs-E.png))**

&gt; One question in the monthly survey that caused us to do a double-take was the question that asks, ""During the last few months, have you heard of any favorable or unfavorable changes in business conditions? And what did you hear?"" In this month's survey, the index that tracks instances of unfavorable news mentions hit a record high of 141. This series goes all the way back to 1959, and never before has it been near current levels. The prior high for this index was back in the depths of the financial crisis when the index peaked at 133. There hasn't been much good news lately, but even this reading is extreme.

# Investors Remain On Guard

&gt; In a post earlier today, we noted that individual investors still remain overwhelmingly bearish despite the equity market's rally off the March lows. Another sentiment indicator released by TD Ameritrade supports this view that investors aren't particularly bullish right now. The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index is a proprietary, behavior-based index created by TD Ameritrade designed to indicate the sentiment of individual investors’ portfolios. It measures what investors are actually doing, and how they are actually positioned in the markets.

&gt; The TD Ameritrade Investor Movement Index has been in existence since 2010, and in that entire history there have only been five months where the index was weaker than it is now, and that was from October 2011 through February 2012. That was also a period that marked a major low in the equity market and was followed by a nearly uninterrupted three-year rally in the S&amp;P 500.

&gt; While the Investor Movement Index is near record lows right now, it has been weak for some time, and that weakness came even as the S&amp;P 500 was climbing to record highs over the last 12-18 months. In other words, while investors are just about as cautious as they have been at any time in the last ten years, this conservatism is nothing new.

personalfinance,30 year old unsure where to go from here,"Hello /r/pf,

Finally made it to a good spot in my life. I have my finances in a state where I can do pretty much anything I want with my disposable income. I’m 29(sorry for the error in the title. Can’t edit), in the military, and trying to set myself up for an early retirement.

My finances:

Take home pay: about $3700/month


Monthly Bills:

Car insurance: $80/month

Internet: $30/month

Cell phone: $25/month

Personal loan: $400/month

Rent: $500/month

Loans:

$12000 @ 0% interest

Investments: 

$20,000 in Roth IRA(already made my 2020 contributions)

$26,0000 in Roth tsp(military version of 401k)

$10,000 emergency fund in HYSA

Goals:

-Save for a down payment for a house

-Vacation fund(currently at about $1800)

Currently close to maxing my TSP. I am contributing $1100 a month. Max is $19000 per year.

I feel comfortable with my emergency savings for now because for the most part my job will be safe for the next 5 years. 

As far as my goals I’m not looking to put more money into the HYSA because of interest rates slowly dropping out after the fed lowered the national rate. I’m thinking about maybe opening up a brokerage account at some point although my faith in the market a at an all time low. Basically I will have a decent amount of disposable income and I’m not sure where to go from here.",finance
personalfinance,"Starting a new life, couple of financial options including line of credit","Hey guys,

Hoping to get some opinions from people with some experience in personal finance

I'm in my late 20s about to start medical residency in a pretty expensive city (vancouver). Because I'm a doctor in training there is what looks like a pretty good deal on Line of Credits. The advertised amount is up to 350k at a interest rate of prime minus 0.25%.

[https://www.scotiabank.com/healthcare/ca/en/banking-solutions-for-medical-residents.html](https://www.scotiabank.com/healthcare/ca/en/banking-solutions-for-medical-residents.html) 

I'm wondering if it would be sensible and/or even possible to take around 150k if another stock market crash/dip occurs and put it into several ETFs (70% etfs and 30% stocks) in my TFSA in addition to taking 2k per month from the line of credit to pay for my rent and food to lead a more comfortable life during residency.

My expected salary on graduation is around 150k, during training I'll be making about 55k

The other thought that crossed my mind was to buy my own place (use the line of credit as a down payment) instead of paying rent since housing prices are coming down however I feel investing into the stock markets may be a better option since the markets always seem to recover after a recession. I'm aware currently the markets have rebounded heavily since the last crash so would not plan on investing the market now at the current levels. 

Appreciate the time!",finance
personalfinance,Student loan refund,"Ok so I’m not sure if this is the right sub to post so I apologize in advance.  Long story short I defaulted on my student loans 2 years ago when I got divorced and lost my job.  I got a job in 2019 and worked about 6 months and then in November 2019 I was in a serious car accident that left me disabled.  I filed my tax return from 2019 and was initially going to receive $1600 ($500 state and $1169 federal) back however since I defaulted on my student loans, the IRS took the $1169 and I was sent a check from the state for the $500.  My doctors sent off papers about 2  months ago to the Department of Education or whoever is over federal student loans requesting that my loans be forgiven due to being disabled.  Well yesterday I received a check from the IRS for $1169 and the check stub said federal student loan refund.  I haven’t received anything official stating my loans are forgiven so I’m confused on why I received a check.   I was sent another paper from Nelnet over a month ago (I went through them to refinance my loans years ago) asking for my doctor to sign the exact same papers I sent the Education department.  I sent them the signed documents last week.  So my question is why did I receive my federal tax refund?  Are my loans forgiven? 

Thank you for any help!",finance
personalfinance,How much equity do I need to refinance?,"I bought my home last July using my state's (CA) first time home buyer program. I used a down payment assistance loan and a 0% interest closing cost assistance loan. At the time of home purchase, list price was $350k, and my mortgage loan is $345k. My interest rate is 4.5% (conventional loan, fixed rate). Currently paid down to $340k.

My credit score is 760, and I make 85k a year after taxes/retirement/etc. I have a stable government job. I also collect $800 in rent from my live-in partner. I believe my house can appraise for at least $370k, based on similar homes in my neighborhood that have sold recently. Zillow/redfin say $385k but I don't trust them. 

Do I have enough equity to refinance? I was going to look into it after a full year of mortgage payments. I have the funds to pay down the ""silent second loans"" plus 15k if I need to pay down the house more. I intend to live here for at least 10 years if not more. My main goal is to lower the monthly payment, and lower the interest I am paying.

Edit: I have no other loans and no credit card debt.",finance
personalfinance,Do I qualify as a dependent?,"My mother contacted me yesterday telling me that her tax return was rejected because she filed me as a dependent and I did not do the same.

She is (quite understandably) upset about this because she lost around $2k in her refund and this is presumably something she depended on each year.

She asked me to amend my tax return which I am considering, but I need to know a few things first to gauge how this will affect us both.

So, a few factors to consider:
- I turned 24 years old in November of 2019 before the end of the calendar year.
- I made over $12k in income last year as listed on my tax return.
- I moved out of my mother's home in December but was living with her up to that point for the rest of that year.
- I was also studying full-time from January to August, but at an unaccredited school.
- I received no refund myself and was actually billed $812 in federal taxes.
- I received my stimulus check of $1200 this past month.

With that information in mind, I'm wondering how exactly this amendment would affect both of us?

Specific questions I have in mind are:
- Will I be billed for doing this, and if so by how much?
- Will my stimulus check be revoked?
- If I filed again, would I even qualify as a dependent?

I've done some research of my own and there are a lot of resources, but all are fairly confusing and I'm not sure which opinions are accurate.

Any advice on this matter would be greatly appreciated. I understand that my mother was probably counting on this refund as income, but I'm very concerned about how it could affect my own finances and the budgets I have in place at this time.

Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,401k New Job + Owing Federal Taxes (+ Credit Card Debt),"I'm 32 and I just started a new job. I filed my taxes and found out I owe close to $9,000 in federal taxes! This is the first time I've dealt with owing taxes and I'm overwhelmed.

Since I started a new job, I am thinking about withdrawing my previous 401k investments instead of rolling them over to a new portfolio to pay off my federal taxes and some credit card debt.

This particular 401k portfolio is roughly $9,800, but overall my previous investments total just over $177,000 (this is not including the $9,800.) 

I'm making more with my new job and this employer actually matches my 401k contributions so I feel okay with my current retirement situation, even if I'm behind what I should have at my age. 

My question is:

* *What should I be worried about or look out for, if I withdraw the total sum of $9,800?* 

... some more background, I'm working to repay close to $20,000 in credit card debt which has been  an uphill battle and then owing that much in federal taxes was a big surprise. Essentially, aside from living expenses, almost everything I make has been working toward paying off this credit card debt.",finance

Forex,Weekend Read: USD/JPY – A Long Term Fundamental and Technical Approach to the Pair,"**DISCLAIMER.**

I suspect that for most people here, this post won't be palatable given its length and content.

This post will be about USD/JPY and will focus on long term possibilities for the pair. I’ve been trading FX for over a decade (not my primary asset class), so I know long term means the next hour or day to some FX traders. I am defining long term as 1-3 years.

I do not hold pairs in this current interest rate environment for long term trades. There is no carry trade. Even if so, that does mean I would be long said carry.

I won’t be talking much technicals outside of the Summary, but rather putting a focus on economic data and yields. I will share some data and charts that are not meant to be indicators for the direction of the pair. The data and charts are simple observations, nothing more. They are not the entirety of the data which I observe. Also, correlation is not causation.

I do not have a position at this time.

I will be looking at the pair primarily through the lens of the US economy.

My data sources are: OECD, St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), Dallas Federal Reserve, US Treasury International Capital System, and ThinkOrSwim

There may be spelling, grammar, or formatting errors that I will edit along the way.

&amp;#x200B;

**SUMMARY.**

USD/JPY is reaching a 20-year low in realized (historical) volatility. This is after coming off a multi-year high in RVol/HV which occurred at the end of 2016. The inputs used in the chat below are length=12, basis=monthly using ThinkOrSwim. Lulls in volatility are common after a “vol explosion”, however we are reaching levels not observed in 20 years.

I observe volatility. You’ll find this in my other posts if you are curious. This pair has hit my radar. It is not the only pair observing low levels of RVol/HV, but it is the pair I am most focused on at this time.

This post will look at various data that help me piece together the possible direction this pair my trade over the next 12 months or longer. A note about volatility: it does not rise because it is historically low. Volatility increases due to an event(s).

**PURCHASING POWER PARITY (PPP).**

I start here, with the OECDs Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) data. No, I do not subscribe to the belief that the exchange rate and purchasing power parity should be the same value, however I do believe it is a good benchmark to understanding where the exchange rate may be overvalued or undervalued. This data heavily lags.

https://preview.redd.it/h5p3esure6z41.png?width=727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e976a32a93987db4f7c22653f0eefc2846e788a

From 2000 to 2013, PPP fell every year. After 2013, PPP has more-so flatlined; the last reading for 2019 was 103.37. In terms of a valuation difference, I would view this as in-line/fair value, though again, I would never take a position on this data point. I am simply referencing this as a marker for possible value, i.e. a starting point.

&amp;#x200B;

**10-YEAR GOVERNMENT BOND SPREADS (US-JP).**

After observing PPP, I have looked at the 10Y government bond spreads between the US and Japan.

https://preview.redd.it/kxzciydte6z41.png?width=695&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=739f6bfe235518e90ec99418393170fb023fbf37

After the Fed was caught offsides with rates at the end of 2018, the tightening cycle ended and a new loosening cycle began, which reverberated across all parts of the yield curve in the US. SARS-CoV-2 has exacerbated the spread tightening between the US and Japan’s 10Y paper as US treasury yields reached record lows in March.

https://preview.redd.it/ipgijjbue6z41.png?width=667&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45fba7a92f594f7e48b36ca4e756889c142f2bba

The 10Y spread and USD/JPY have a correlation of 0.52 over the past decade. There are periods where lower yields in US treasuries (relative to JGBs) led to a weaker USD/JPY and vice versa. The second leg of the USD/JPY bull run which occurred from 2014-2015 corresponded with a compression in the spread. The pair later retraced \~50% of its bull run in 2016, which led to the highest RVol/HV reading as mentioned in the Summary.

With the spread falling some 230bps between the end of2018 and present, the largest swing in 10 years, USD/JPY has only retraced roughly 600 pips.

When adding the element of inflation in the mix, the correlation to USD/JPY greatly improves, to 0.73.

https://preview.redd.it/e2018sfze6z41.png?width=688&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=51fb7de26d1a59f7d67e90fbad6003f9502167c7

If we look a real 10Y yield cycles in the chat above, we find the following:

Between November 2011-January 2015, real yields improved in the favor of the US by \~725bps. Subsequently, USD/JPY rallied 4766 pips; the move lagged the 10Y spread rally. The simple math says for every 100bps in improvement in real yield spread, USD/JPY rallied 657 pips.

The correction in the pair, between January 2015-September2016, followed the a real 10Y yield compression of \~450bps, peak to trough. The correction was \~2300 pips. Simple math again, every 100bps in real 10Y yield spread compression resulted in a loss of 511 pips. This period is mentioned in the Summary section as the largest move in RVol/HV over the past 20 years.

Between September 2016-October 2018, real 10Y yields improved, in favor of US, by 215bps. Over this same period, USD/JPY rose by 1,165pips, or for every 100bps in spread widening, USD/JPY rose by 541 pips.

Lastly, between October 2018-Present (March 2020), real 10Yyields have tightened by roughly 220bps (from +1.86% to -0.33%). In the same period, USD/JPY has fallen from 112.86 to 107.53, or 533 pips. Unlike the three previous cycles, per 100bps of spread tightening/widening, this equates to 242pips downside in the pair.

https://preview.redd.it/9qqiq7j0f6z41.png?width=651&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f17d80114f79ebf1c34a4a9a79af8840832b3a09

I’ll spend more time later on in this post to discuss the 10Y US treasury yield specifically.

&amp;#x200B;

**TRADE BALANCE AND JAPAN'S US TREASURY HOLDINGS.**

There are two facts: We (always) import many more goods from Japan than we export and Japan is the largest foreign holder of US treasury debt.

https://preview.redd.it/3s11dew1f6z41.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2358f56a96899f25c08060a6d006607f4d737c4

After a consistent period of US treasury purchasing pre and post the global financial crisis, Japan turned primarily to reduce UST holdings between 2014-2018. It was only at the time the Fed pivoted to a dovish stance that Japan once again became a buyer.  

https://preview.redd.it/31dbx9o2f6z41.png?width=710&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=070255114639ccda28a3e4e920d61e89f5b85039

For almost a decade, between 2003-2013, Japan’s acquiring of US treasuries had a 0.85 correlation to USD/JPY, in that as Japan bought US treasuries, the yen strengthened. However, that correlation completely disintegrated since 2013, currently standing at -.08 between 2013-Present Day.

With exceptions, annual dollar changes in the trade balance with Japan have historically mirrored annual changes in pips for the exchange rate, i.e. as the US trade balance improves (positive number), the dollar strengthens against the yen.

[edit: RHS is pips\/100](https://preview.redd.it/zwcl3cw3f6z41.png?width=781&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3402a5d02da04cf306e5ea0832b2c9859fe21a49)

Since 2014, our trade balance with Japan has essentially flatlined, around -$70 billion per annum.

&amp;#x200B;

**10-YEAR GOVERNMENT BOND SPREADS AND JAPAN'S US TREASURY HOLDINGS.**

With 10Y JGBs entering negative yield territory in 2016, the spread between 10Y government bonds widened as the Fed tightened between 2015-2018; this period also saw Japan begin reducing their US treasury holdings.

https://preview.redd.it/3pz27wl5f6z41.png?width=736&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb68b7cc3f8eac71542e43d2b9276e96c153012a

Since 2003, a correlation of 0.61 exists between the 10-Year Government Bond Spreads and Japan’s US Treasury Holdings. As the spread has collapsed over the past \~15 months, Japan has been a buyer of US treasuries to the tune of \~$235 billion.

&amp;#x200B;

**INTERMISSION.**

Stepping back at what I have presented so far, we can seethe following:

1)  Realized/Historical volatility has made a 20-year low

2)  PPP has a slight favor to a stronger yen, around the 103 area

3)  10-year government bond spreads, both in nominal and real terms, are tightening and have a decent to strong (respectively) correlation to how USD/JPY trades; however, the current tightening cycle (of spreads) has not generated the same volatility in USD/JPY as previous cycles

4)  Japan has returned as a buyer of US treasuries as the Fed pivoted to a dovish stance, however the correlation between Japan’s ownership of US treasuries and USD/JPY performance was severed some years ago

5)  Changes in annual trade balances show to have some impact on USD/JPY, however the annual trade balance with Japan hold steady around -$70 billion since 2014

The above implies yen strengthening, in particular how the real 10Y yield spread has turned negative more recently and yet the performance of USD/JPY has not followed suit to the same degree as previous cycles. But this is not my bias at the present period given what is below.

&amp;#x200B;

**US CONSUMER BEHAVIOR, THE MONETARY BASE, AND THE RELATIONSHIP TO THE 10-YEAR US TREASURY NOTE YIELD.**

The US consumer habits have changed since the global financial crisis. These habits are identified in what I define as consumer savings. This is simply disposable personal income less personal consumption expenditures. The recent surge has been related to SARS-CoV-2.

https://preview.redd.it/105jifj7f6z41.png?width=708&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d16cbf2cd0987cbe8acae4c4db333777197f3932

It is too early to estimate if consistently higher consumer savings is here to stay, or if this temporary. That said, the change in consumer savings trend was established well before SARS-CoV-2.

Since the GFC, the monetary base in the US has risen sustainably,primarily driven by reserves balances.

https://preview.redd.it/q50wq5h9f6z41.png?width=670&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=092f5d67184b7d688a42f9b77a401d63e97ff462

Looking at the ratio of consumer savings (again, DPI less PCE) to the monetary base, we see that there is a significant correlation to the nominal US 10-year treasury note yield that dates back to 1962, at 0.89.

https://preview.redd.it/ml0yok6af6z41.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16d4cba6dcf91334b841428c16688421b4531fdc

We can observe the relationship above in a scatter graph, seen below.

https://preview.redd.it/acbsl1zaf6z41.png?width=748&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf81a88c75de3fb1630ba694ede0bf938c59f3c0

The obvious, and standard, argument is that with the Fed’s monetary invention policies, this correlation may have ended; since Q3 2008, R2 = 0.0027.

I am not willing to take that argument as truth at this time, especially given recent fiscal and monetary stimulus programs, i.e. there is “a lot” more money in the financial system. That said, I won’t discount a break in the long-term correlation either.

As a quick note, I am not implying, nor do I believe, there is to be a regime change in 10-year UST note yields. I am not calling for, or again implying, that the secular bull market in US treasuries is over. That said, a rise of the 10Y note yield to 200 or 300bps, while seemingly feeling far-fetched, is a possibility in my view.

&amp;#x200B;

**US TREASURY PERFORMANCE.**

The performance of US treasury debt during the Fed’s pivot has been remarkable.

https://preview.redd.it/0w4aijicf6z41.png?width=682&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fddd4419b0b3308a477c05c61e5ad9373878a20

As of March 2020, the marketable treasury debt par value was $17,108 billion. That same debts market value was $18,697 billion. In other words, if you had bought all the marketable US treasury debt at par, you’d have a gain of almost $1.6 trillion, or 9.3% (1.09 mkt/par value). The level of market to par value has only been seen a few times in prior history, less than 5% of all readings.

https://preview.redd.it/mxx5hpcdf6z41.png?width=757&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=efc3adc29001ad33ab2ed9d22eb998aa94a0b968

The most obvious answer to a rebalancing of the market/par value is the slew of treasury issuance. Unless one believes we are headed to negative yields (and I do not), it is unlikely that with the amount of issuance, one will be able to squeeze out anymore of a profit from USTs.

The scatter graph below illustrates the market to par value for all marketable US treasuries and 10Y nominal yield at the end of March.

https://preview.redd.it/rel6si1ef6z41.png?width=785&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1774dbd2155467bd6435393a4d3911a3d6f5f842

&amp;#x200B;

**WHAT MIGHT THIS ALL MEAN FOR USD/JPY?**

As I stated in the DISCLAIMER, I am observing the pair more-so from the lens of the US than Japan. As stated in the INTERMISSION section, initial bias for USD/JPY is stronger yen. However, observing US data gives me pause to take said bias. In fact, given what may occur with 10Y UST yields, this may influence the direction of the pair. Additionally, given US politics and SARS-CoV-2, the trade balance (deficit) for the US with Japan may shrink in the coming quarters.

Higher nominal yield spreads between the US and Japan have led to Japan selling US treasuries, and vice versa…

https://preview.redd.it/g4dac2ref6z41.png?width=658&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02d555ba63144771f5906cafb7b9d466a74df19f

which both have influenced USD/JPY…

https://preview.redd.it/5ngmm6gff6z41.png?width=710&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2993e11adbe4f6fb4b00d53a7ede1dce4b41544

Lower trade deficits for the US to Japan also have some correlation to stronger USD/JPY.

&amp;#x200B;

**FINAL THOUGHTS.**

In the coming 1-3 years, I suspect realized (historical) volatility for USD/JPY to increase. An increase in volatility does not equate to specific directional movement for the pair. Fundamental analysis fails to give a clear pathway of direction for the pair, but what is known is that the pair remains in a lull, even as historical indicators tell a different story.

I hope to provide updates in the near future with analysis and positioning, should people be interested. Thank you for reading.",finance

My family and I, despite our stability, academic success, and full employment within our fields, are just able to maintain. Instead of feeling like we are succeeding or getting ahead or establishing ourselves, we just feel like we’re keeping our heads above water as the days pass. What we would love is to be at a net zero- that is to have no more debt. With that burden lifted we would be able to make choices off of interest and desire and our future, and NOT so much out of necessity. A major piece of this is the ability to move away from the financial market that pays us enough to address our monthly debts, but doesn’t pay us enough to get ahead or allow us the flexibility to move away from that economy.

ABOUT US (FINANCIALLY):
-Gross Annual Income of US$230k
-Car debt of US$20k
-Home debt of US$275k at 4.5% interest rate
-Educational debt of US$300k
-Daycare bill for another 2 hrs of roughly US$1,800/month

MY QUESTIONS:

I don’t know what my questions even are. I’m at a loss by this. We feel stuck. What’s the process? What resources should we avail ourselves of? How do we prioritize our debts to reap maximum benefits?

I have a stock trading account with TD Ameritrade, so I decided to open up a Roth IRA account as  well, but havent made any investments yet. I've read a lot about compounding interests in Roth accounts and seems like I can grow my money more efficiently this way than a normal savings account. My question is, how do I take advantage of this compounding interest? Do I basically have to invest in Mutual Funds for the next 30-40 years? If so, do I go for the Mutual Funds that have ""no-load"" fees? Will TD Ameritrade charge me a fee for investing in, say, FXAIX, a Fidelity fund?

My car is fully paid off and has proven to be very reliable over the last two years and I don't foresee replacing it anytime soon.

My state marginal tax rate is 9.30% and effective tax rate will be 4.81% at this salary in this location.

My first priority is going to be saving up 6 months expenses in a HYSA. 

I have about $22k in student loans that have a first payment due at the end of December 2021. Their interest rates are between 3.76% and 5.05% Only 2 are un-subsidized and building interest before the first payment is due. I'm planning on only paying the minimum on my loans under 4% and paying off loans above 4% as fast as possible. I'm not sure if I should start paying down the principal on the loans during the grace period or make contributions to retirement and other savings accounts.

I've been looking into 401ks and IRAs and I see people talking about splitting their contributions around 50/50 between Roth and Traditional options but this seems disadvantageous to my situation. My Income Tax is substantially higher than most places in the country so I was thinking of contributing $4-5k to Traditional IRA and $1-2k to Roth. My reasoning is that when I retire I'll probably have a much lower income so my traditional withdrawals will be taxed much less and I may be in a different state which will further reduce my tax burden.  I want to put some in the Roth IRA in case some major emergency happens so I can raid it with minimal penalty and just generally diversify. Is this sound reasoning? Is there something else I should be taking into consideration?

For my 401k, it doesn't appear to have a Roth option and my employer doesn't have any form of match until after my first year of employment. I was planning on contributing 10% of my gross pay during my first year which totals $7250. Overall, I'll be saving $12,250 towards retirement.

I definitely want to start saving up for a house down payment as well. How much should I put away per month for this? Where should I put this money (HYSA, CDs, I Bonds, stocks, etc.)?

The fact that opinion leaders like Vin and Hayden support IFP makes me truly sad - IMHO it's a horrible idea, and it needs to die in a fire. Not only is IFP unethical, it's an attack on the fundamental consensus and Nash equilibrium of Bitcoin.  Both Vin and Hayden are heroes of mine, so I can only conclude that they've been fed some powerful Koolaid. 

That said, I'm 100% behind the BCH P2P electronic currency project, and 100% believe that BCH Node will be the path forward with the best devs on an ethically sound roadmap. I'm not a huge BU fan, but I think it's obvious why people now choose BU over ABC - BU is ardently opposed to IFP and BCH Node is a brand new fork. Finally, the way Amaury and team are talking is really alarming, I just can't stomach all of this BS about ""protest movements"". In my opinion BCH Node is the path forward: no shitty IFP and no garbage propaganda to justify it. 

Sorry guys but it's just the way it is in my opinion.",cryptocurrency

My car will be paid off in December anyways but I have the cash to end the loan and drop my monthly expenses further. Credit cards paid off.

personalfinance,"Employer wants me back for 1 day per week, and at hourly","Hi PF,

Throwaway for personal reasons. I was furloughed in March, and currently collecting unemployment until my expected return to work in July. State max is $648 (HI), and with the federal add-on, I receive $1248 weekly, bringing me to the same pay as when I was working. My salary was \~$60k. My employer wants me to come back to work for one day a week, on an overnight basis, and converted to hourly pay. The pay would be a little less than $30/hr, and they say it would be about $200/nt (10 hours). This would be the most basic version of my previous position.

&amp;#x200B;

My concerns:

&amp;#x200B;

\*They are currently paying my healthcare contributions while furloughed. When I am on payroll again, I will be once again paying for those, which is 1 hour of pay gone right there.

&amp;#x200B;

\*They are stating that I am currently making $150 of ""Self funded"" unemployment (which I have never heard of), the $648 state, and $600 federal ($1398 which is not true, especially because I've received the $1248) checks. They are saying that if I come back, I would be losing the $150, but would otherwise be the same. This seems incredibly naive and uncaring in nature, since it doesn't seem accurate (Which is surprising considering everything they are doing for us while we are furloughed (Paying healthcare, etc.))

&amp;#x200B;

\*This would be only 1 shift, on the overnight from 10pm-8am. I just got over being on an awful sleep schedule (was sleeping from \~6am to \~4pm regularly), and really don't want to revert back to this awful schedule.

&amp;#x200B;

\*If I decline this offer, I believe that I now have to mark ""yes"" on the ""Have you declined work this week?"" question on the unemployment questioner. Does this put me at risk of losing out on unemployment benefits?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Pros:

&amp;#x200B;

\*I would be showing my company good faith and I do feel grateful for how they are handling the situation. (Though I am hoping to relocate ASAP to be closer to home, but have no idea when that can happen).

&amp;#x200B;

\*There is a part of me that misses work, and it would be nice to get out of the house.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; Employer wants me to comeback for 1 day per week on the least desirable shift going from salary to hourly, while giving me what seems like misinformation about unemployment benefits. I feel like this whole thing is not in my favor, but I don't want to lose any unemployment benefits. I'm not trying to come out ahead, but I certainly can't afford to be making less than I currently am.

Despite the obvious worldwide circumstances, I've finally reached a point in my life where I feel very solid in my financial situation, and while I'm trying to follow the prime directive, I think maybe there's some missing pieces that I hope the community could help me with. I'm a first-gen graduate who comes from a low income extended family, and what I know about budgeting/saving is from this sub, so I really appreciate any advice in advance. I don't have folks in my life to talk about this, so I've gone into a lot of detail below. I hope that's alright!
 
 
Personal info: I'm 26 and am a career federal employee in Washington, D.C. I started this particular job \~6 months ago, but have no probationary period and have been assured by leadership that my job is very secure. I rent with my partner, who is a recent graduate, 26, working full-time and building savings. We plan to get married in the next few years, and currently split all living expenses evenly.
&amp;nbsp;

**Income: $86k**  //
**Take-home, bi-weekly: $1960**  
- My position officially requires 25% travel, so once things stabilize I expect I'll be earning small amounts here and there by saving as much of the per diems as I can.


**Pre-tax deductions, per paycheck:**  
- **Roth TSP:** $197 (6%, agency gives 5% match)  
- **Fed Pension:** $145 (can't opt out)  
- **Health Insurance** (Med/Dental/Vision): $80  
- **FSA contribution**: $58  
- **Union dues**: $24  
&amp;nbsp;

**Monthly Budget:**  
- **Rent:** $830 (1660/2, for a 1-bed in the suburbs, 40m from work, including parking and pet fees)  
- **Utilities:** \~$20/mo  
- **Internet:** $30/mo  
- **Phone:** $10/mo  
- **Medication:** $\~60/mo, but self-reimbursed thru FSA  
- **Transit:** Paid by work  
- **Grocery:** $300/mo (I have significant food allergies, and am on a medical diet, so I have to buy a lot of specialty items)  
- **Gym:** $80 (currently $0 due to self-isolation)  
- **Pets:** $60 (two old kitties)  
- **Spotify:** $10 (my indulgence!)

**Additional:**
- **TSP Balance:** $22k  
- **Savings:** $7k  
- **Credit cards:** 3 cards, $0 balance, total $14k avail. credit.   
- **Student Loan Balance:** $41k federal, bachelor's + master's.  
- Some of my loans are held by a servicer not subject to the pandemic forbearance, and I'm electing to continue my 'normal' lump payment on the rest by targeting the 1 loan I know has the highest interest rate normally, so I can get the principal down.  
- **FICO 8:** 800

(Re: ""money to family"" line item: for the duration of the crisis, I'm paying for groceries for my family. Once they're able to resume work as normal it'll go to zero.)  
&amp;nbsp;

**Goals, in order:**  
- Starting next paycheck, throw an extra $250 min. at student loans.  
- Up my TSP percentage 1% every birthday, COLA, raise, promotion  
- Pay off all student loans above 4% (approx. $22k), ETA June 2024  
- Start to save for a down payment for a house, likely not in the DC/MD/VA area.  
- Pay off all student loans, ETA Jan 2026.  
&amp;nbsp;

**Questions:**  
- I think of my savings as an emergency fund, so I never touch it. Now that it's at $7k, what do I do with it? It's just sitting in my BoA savings account. Being mindful of the pandemic, is there a better option?  
- Do I maintain a savings account plus an emergency fund? How does that work?  
- Is there another financial instrument I can put money in and not touch that helps me save for possible future goals, e.g. vacations? Or is this better accomplished by updating my budgeting spreadsheet?  
- My family has a tendency to live for a very, very long time. Should I open up a private Roth sometime soon and contribute the yearly max, or is upping my TSP % enough?  
- Is there any general advice for a 26-year-old with hopes for future home ownership? I have no idea how much I should be saving for a down payment.

Thanks everyone! I'd be glad to provide additional info where I can.

-Varo HY savings - $3k just sitting there.

-Robinhood investments - ~$400 in GOLD; ~$210 in crypto; ~$30 in some other shit.

-Fed Studet Loans - $5,500 in forbearance, obviously no interest atm.

-Private loan through UpStart - $6,500 in forbearance, not sure about the interest rate.

Summarized:

Around 600 banks, most of them small community institutions, tapped the Federal Reserve's Paycheck Protection Program facility for about $30 billion of loans as of May 6, the U.S. central bank reported on Saturday in its first detailed disclosure under the new program.

&amp;#x200B;

The lenders used 3,676 PPP loans they had issued to small businesses as collateral for money from the central bank's PPP program, clearing room on their own balance sheet for further lending.

&amp;#x200B;

The Fed program was set up to encourage banks to participate, allowing those who choose to do so a way to make the loans to businesses and collect a fee for doing so, then borrow a similar amount from the Fed at a nominal interest rate of 0.35%.

economy,What happens if a country prints money to ramp up production?,"So I was wondering, as many countries are still poor and have a malnutrition problem. Why don't they print money to start government owned enterprises? Isn't that what China did?

In poor countries it's often the case that people can't get loans to start a business because the interest rates are high and the people don't have money to begin with. A lot of poor countries have educated people that can't find a job because there are not enough businesses to provide them with a job. So they either fly to another country or go into illegal practices like scamming people online.

It seems like a cycle they can never get out of, because they're poor and sometimes in unstable countries, the interest rates stay high, thus it becomes exceedingly hard to start a business. 

I know printing money could trigger hyper inflation if done improperly, but looking at China, their country started government projects with I assume printed money and this way the inflation stays stable, because they're increasing their production with government funded projects, and thus increasing the output of their economy at the same time. So why aren't poor countries doing this more?

Now looking to renew my mortgage that’s at $550,000 and have decided opt for a 5-year fixed at 2.29% bi-weekly (based on a 20 year 2 month amortization (did an accelerated bi-weekly so ended up paying off more than the minimum). My broker just called with another option that’s 2.93% for a 5-year fixed (25 year amortization) bi-weekly with 3% cash-back. Broker’s calculation shows that at the end of the 5 years, I’ll have paid around $2k more towards the mortgage assuming I put the whole cash-back amount towards the mortgage principal on day one so that the higher interest is based on a lower amount going forward. In both cases, payments are approximately the same.

Is the 2.93% with cash back option worth it? Am I missing anything?

Edit: thanks everyone who replied. Should have stated I’m in Toronto, Canada if that makes a difference. 

This is not an ARM - it’s a fixed rate mortgage that would renew every five years. The amortization period is only relevant to calculate the instalment payments. No lender here would normally lock into a term beyond 5 years. 

The plan would be for the 3% cash back amount ($15,000) to be put towards the principal right away so according to my broker I’m looking at the following choice:

$550,000 @ 2.29% for 5 years
Vs
($550,000-$15,000) @ 2.93% for 5 years 

Something feels off to me but is it because I’m focusing on the interest rate and not what my final balance owing would be in 5 years?

economy,Ruffer and the 50 Cent Hedge,"As stock markets tanked in March, [Ruffer Investment Company enjoyed a gain of 4.2% thanks to a number of derivative hedges proving their worth](https://citywire.co.uk/wealth-manager/news/ruffer-defies-the-bears-as-50-cent-hedge-pays-off/a1345766).

The investment team noted that derivative protections were 'critical' in countering its equity losses during the month.

In 2017, [Ruffer were identified as a big buyer of volatility options](https://citywire.co.uk/funds-insider/news/ruffer-named-as-mystery-50-cent-buyer-of-fear-options/a1013712) designed to protect its funds from another market crash.

The contracts, which cost half a dollar each, earned Ruffer the nickname ‘50 Cent’, after the US rapper famous for the album Get Rich or Die Tryin’.

Despite [initially losing money on the contracts](https://www.businessinsider.com/mystery-trader-50-cent-cant-stop-betting-on-a-stock-market-shock-2017-4?r=US&amp;IR=T), their strategy paid off recently, as they announced that they had made a total of [$2.6 billion during the stock market sell-off](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/50-cent-fund-ruffer-3-billion-coronavirus-hedges-sell-off-2020-4-1029080177).

Ruffer, which manages roughly $23 billion in assets, invested $22 million in derivatives tracking the VIX volatility index.

**When the stock market tanked due to the virus, the VIX spiked to record levels, and netted the fund more than $800 million.**

**Ruffer gained another $1.3 billion by investing in credit derivatives that surged in value after corporate bond prices slumped.**

**It also netted $350 million from S&amp;P 500 and Euro Stoxx put options, and $145 million from gold hedges.**

Basically, a put option allows someone to “lock in” the sale price of an asset.

If someone owns a put option, they can force someone else to purchase an asset at a set, pre-defined price.

That agreed-upon price is known as the “strike price” and is defined in the option contract.

The actual market price of that asset might end up being significantly lower than the strike price, but the put option has locked in the sale price.

This is essentially how Ruffer made bank from their S&amp;P 500 and Euro Stoxx put options.

A call option is basically the opposite of a put option, and this is how Ruffer made bank on the VIX.

Ruffer also performed well in the 2008 financial crisis, thanks to their well-diversified risk portfolio.

On their website, Ruffer describes how their two investment objectives are:

\-not to lose money in any rolling twelve-month period and

\-to grow funds at a higher rate than cash

**The recent sell off is a prime example of why diversification is so important and why it is vital to protect against large losses.**

**Due to the mathematics of compounding, the big losses are essentially ALL that matter to your rate of compounding, not the small losses and not even the big or small gains.**

In Ruffer's latest fund report, they give the reasoning behind adding to their yen allocation.

""A number of factors argue for yen appreciation - Japan's oil imports are now much cheaper, its low interest rates are no longer such a relative rarity, and the Bank of Japan will find it hard to surpass the stimulus efforts of others given how much of the Japanese government bond (JGB) market the Bank already owns, to name just three - and this appreciation would be turbo-charged if further distress or defaults were seen in the US corporate credit market, as Japanese investors repatriate their significant investments there. Worldwide, it is the currency that looks most like gold and is therefore deserving of a significant allocation.""

Hello, I changed my first and middle name about like 3? years ago.(I am trans and I have the paper work to legally change my gender marker as well, I just haven't had the time to go to the DMV to get a new ID). My last name stayed the same. I've updated my name legally, it's on my ID, my bank has my new name, my job only knows me by my new name, my ssc has my new name etc. However Creditkarma, won't let me change my name as it ""isn't reflected in my bank statements"" and my paypal credit was applied for under my dead name. When I got my taxes back 2 years ago, it was still addressed to my dead name, even though I filled it out with my new, legally changed named. I didn't see my tax reports come back this year (my uncle does them and I was happy enough to just get my return directly deposited) so I'm unsure if my tax papers have my Actual name on them now, or what. I just signed up for another credit report website, with my legal name, and it said it ""can't find any credit history"" for me.

I feel like this is really messing up me being able to get a credit card. I've gotten THREE separate ""You're pre-approved!""  from my credit union, capital-one and frigging /hot topic/ all telling me I could get their credit card, only to be denied for ""not enough credit history."" 

My credit score is like 714, which I know isn't AMAZING but I feel like I definitely should be able to get a basic starter credit card with it. I paid all my utilities and rent on time, I maybe missed like 2 payments on my paypal credit but it's about to be entirely payed off by tomorrow. The only thing I haven't touched is my school loans as I went from one college to another and I'm trying to take advantage of not having to pay my loans while I'm in school. I probably can afford to make small payments on my school loans now, but given I owe about 40k, I'm unsure if measly 30$\~ a month payments will help me that much. 

I'm really at a lost for what to do. I'm planning on moving out of my parents house finally within the next few months, and I would like to have a credit card open to work on improving my credit history as I don't want to make my partner feel like he has to be the one to use all of his credit for anything.

personalfinance,"Should I try to pay off my Parent Plus loan NOW or LATER, when I make more money lol","So my first bachelors was only $20k in my name because i got an almost full scholarship... BUT then I did an accelerated 2nd degree program impulsively thats going to cost ~$120k in direct Parent plus loans (7% interest) in total...

Im supposed to graduate in a few months and im projected to make $90k....

But i do want to return to school again after 2 years for a Doctorate. It’ll cost &lt;200k the entire degree (but ofc im aiming for scholarships) and after that I’ll be projected to make 200k afterward...

My question is, should i worry abt aggressively paying off the $120+ PP loan in the 2 year gap between this 2nd degree &amp; my third degree while I only make $90k? (I’ll probably use the avalanche method because the PPL interest is more than my sub/unsub $20k loan interest)

(FYI my parents are poor and cant contribute anything to the PP loan so its completely on me, but I do plan on continuing to live here with them rent-free)

My payments would be paused once i return to school but idk if it makes more sense to save money to fund my life while in grad school and just pay the $1000/month minimum towards the PP until then and then worry about aggressively paying the entire bulk once i graduate and make ~200k or should I aggressively work off the $120k now on a $90k salary... in reality Id probably only be able to pay off $100k of it at MOST before having to pause to return to school. 

During the Doc program unless I get a scholarship that provides a stipend or I get married, I’ll have zero income but the loan payments will be deferred. It sounds impossible to save a sizable amount of money and aggressively pay off ~$140k at the same time.

personalfinance,Take out forgiveable loans or pay upfront for grad school?,"I'm going to begin grad school part-time in the fall. I should be able to graduate after 7 terms (5 Fall/Spring Semesters and 2 Summer terms), for roughly 2.5 years of study. I'll be going to a City University of New York (CUNY) school, which are pretty affordable in-state.

In total, it should cost about $26,000 over the entire program, but I have been given a $2,000 scholarship to be split between the first two semesters, with an opportunity to renew in the second year. 

Technically, based on my and my spouse's salaries, we can afford to pay it straight out, though we would have to tighten up in the meantime.

Now of course taking on avoidable debt is typically not a good idea, BUT I work in the non-profit field and am pursuing an MPA in Non-Profit Management. In other words, if I took out a loan, it would be a federal loan forgivable after 10 years of minimum payments (assuming the public service loan forgiveness program survives).

Additionally, beginning the second year of school, I will have accrued enough service time that my employer would offer up to $2,000/semester in tuition reimbursement. That program, however, is subject to budget constraints. Given the state of the non-profit world, which many fear will be hit even harder next year as donor fatigue grows and the urgency of the pandemic wanes, there's no guarantee that this reimbursement program will survive. If I was confident that it would, my decision would be a lot easier. As it is, it's looking like a 50/50 chance (and I realize I'm fortunate to work for an employer where there even is such a chance, let along the program existing in the first place, and even just to have a job).

* I’m 25 years old, married, and since February 2020 I've been trying to learn about investing so I can be financially secure in the future. I served 5 years in the military and was medically discharged in 2019. I have been unemployed since then. I currently receive $4,229 in disability pay from the VA but I am unable to work due to my disabilities. Our monthly expenses are approximately $1,600. I have $22k between checking/saving. 3 CD's totaling $33k, and an M1 Finance taxable investment account with $2,200.

FI Plan:
* We invest $500 bi-weekly. My portfolio is 85% VTI, 15% VXUS and I will possibly add a bond fund in 20-25 years. I plan on reinvesting all dividends and dollar cost averaging through all ups and downs of the market for the next 30 years, if not longer. My reasoning is that because I have disability pay for life and it's more than enough to cover my cost of living expenses, I'm okay with the fluctuations I'll inevitably see. As long as I can safely withdraw $8,000 on average when I’m 60 (if not later). 

* I also have a traditional Thrift Savings Plan with $5,700 but am unable to contribute because I don't have earned income and I'm no longer a federal employee. My plan is to avoid early withdrawal fees and roll it over to a Roth IRA with Vanguard (100% VTSAX, reinvest dividends, and add a bond allocation down the road). 

* I'm still on the fence about opening a Roth IRA since having future earned income to contribute can't be guaranteed. And because of this I've considered withdrawing all $5,700, taking the penalty fees and reinvest what I’m left with.


Anyway, from the research I’ve done it looks like I can expect to meet my $8k minimum in 30-ish years but I’m also very new to investing so idk if there’s something I’m overlooking/uniformed about",finance

Financials/Credit: Our credit scores are decent mid-700's, but is relatively short term for me. (about less than 3 years). No debts minus mortgage/car notes. No missed payments. No financial worries atm. Income has gone up as well.

The Cars:
My wife and I got two two cars in 2019 and 2020. The 2020 is at less than 1%, so we're not going to mess with that. The 2019 is at 3.7% and we've been paying extra on it. I can easily pay it off now or wait until january 2021. Just to reiterate for credit wise, this means that we got two loans in jan 2019 and 2020.

The House:
Because of our short term credit history, we got screwed over into paying PMI even though we put down more than 20%. So around a mid 4% mortgage with $100 dollar PMI. Judging by current rates, we think we can get 3.5 or lower. Guestimating: the house is worth about 205k. Bought house at 195k with a ~40k downpayment.Currently owe 140k. 30 yr loan.

Our goal: Since the interest rates are lower than they were than the ones offered when we got our house, we want to get rid of this nasty PMI and get a lower rate (&gt;mid 3% hopefully).

I made some very irresponsible decisions when I was 18-21, but it’s a few years later and I am trying to get out of it.

I should have been completely debt free coming out of college, but I went through some shit and pretended I had money by using credit cards and student loans to spend.

I took out two private student loans at ~10.5% variable (so I didn’t have to tell my parents) that are now right at $20k. Simultaneously, I racked up almost $20k in credit card debt that I’ve now gotten down to $16k. I’m not spending on my cards anymore and have gotten my shit together.

Understandably, my parents have decided to stop funding college (they paid the first 4 years, but I dicked around and am going into my 6th). I have to take out federal student loans and use pell to finish up.

My question is should I take those federal student loans and pay off my cc or should I pay off the private student loans.

My gut is telling me to just pay the private loans off and use my passive income to continue paying down my cards. However, because the cards have high interest (~14.5% and ~24%) I am unsure if this is the best course of action. I can afford my payments and my lifestyle and luckily the stimulus is helping a ton, but I’m kind of at a crossroads where I am not totally sure what the best route is. I can definitely continue without doing anything, but it is a bit intimidating seeing the interest build like it is and I feel there just has to be a better way.

PELLEY: In the early days of the crisis in this boardroom, you and the committee lowered interest rates essentially to zero. Would you lower them further into negative territory, which the president has suggested is a good idea?

POWELL: So around this table during the last crisis and during the recovery, we looked at negative interest rates. And it's something we decided not to do. We used other tools instead. And those tools involved forward guidance about the federal funds rate and also lots of asset purchases or quantitative easing as it's often referred to.

I continue to think, and my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee continue to think that negative interest rates is probably not an appropriate or useful policy for us here in the United States.

PELLEY: And why not? The President seems to think it would help.

POWELL: The evidence on whether it helps is quite mixed. And the issue is people would be depositing money in the bank and that money would be shrinking. They'd be paying interest to put their money in the bank. So it's not a particularly popular policy, as you can imagine.

But in addition, it can also tend to depress the profitability of banks, which makes them likely to lend less, which weighs on economic growth. So I would just say it's not at all settled in, you know, in economic analysis that negative rates really add much value.

PELLEY: I think the idea of negative interest rates is something that a lot of people have a difficult time getting their head around. Would you explain it to me?

POWELL: Well, rather than being paid interest on your cash, you pay interest to the bank -- or if you borrow money, they pay you to borrow money. And if you lend them money by putting it in a bank, then they pay you money.

PELLEY: So the banks would pay people to borrow money, essentially?

POWELL: Yes.

PELLEY: And that would conceivably cause more business and commerce to happen?

POWELL: It would. But, you know, this has been tried. We have negative policy rates in many countries around the world as a result of the financial crisis. And there's no clear finding that it actually does support economic activity on net. And it introduces distortions into the financial system, which I think offset that.

There're plenty of people who think negative interest rates are a good policy. But we don't really think so at the Federal Reserve. And I think it's an area of real uncertainty in the central banking world.

I don't quite get what he said here 'Well, rather than being paid interest on your cash, you pay interest to the bank -- or if you borrow money, they pay you to borrow money. And if you lend them money by putting it in a bank, then they pay you money.'

So there are 3 parts here:

1. Rather than being paid interest on your cash, you pay interest to the bank

2. Or if you borrow money, they pay you to borrow money. 

3. And if you lend them money by putting it in a bank, then they pay you money.

So the first 2 parts are coherent in logic, but the third point, if you lend the bank money by putting it in the bank, shouldn't you pay them interest, as suggested by the first 2 points?

* Percent of tested positive cases continue a downward trend in the US (especially in both Georgia and Texas that opened up weeks ago  - where media spreads fear that overall cases have risen but this is due to increased testing. PERCENT POSITIVE is falling [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EYL3LGZX0AEj7Cq?format=png&amp;name=small](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EYL3LGZX0AEj7Cq?format=png&amp;name=small)). 
* MOST CASES are asymptomatic and not detected which is good news for the trend towards herd immunity.  [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01095-0](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01095-0) 
* FORTY PERCENT of deaths have been in ALF and nusring home facilities. **NURSING HOME PATIENTS MAKE UP ONLY 0.4% OF THE ENTIRE US POPULATION!** 94% of deaths occur in age 50 or above. The working force labor pool remains very well intact.  
* Denmark and Norway cases have not spiked despite reopening schools 3+ weeks ago (despite COVID's incubation period being &lt;14 days). Sweden has done very well staying open (curve has stayed flat/hospital capacity never overwhelmed).
* Hope for vaccines continue to increase. Of more than 100 vaccines in development globally, at least eight have started testing in humans (lightning fast vs other vaccines in prior epidemics).

CONSUMER DATA

* Thanks to income equality, the bottom 40% of households comprise 11% of total income in the country. The top 20% hold 52% of total income. Of people working in February, nearly 40% of those with a household income below $40,000 reported a job loss in March.  
* The April jobs report that showed nearly 90% of Americans who had lost a job said they were on temporary layoff. 
* Social distance spending (bars, restaurants, transportation/airfare, cruises, sports, gyms, movies) only comprise $717 billion of the $17 trillion consumer wallet.  &gt;90% of spending can remain intact, if no one ever does any of the social distancing activities ever again. 
* Thanks to federal $600/week increase to state unemployment benefits, income for majority of unemployed people is actually higher than when before losing their job.

* On April 30, Boeing completed the largest bond deal ever not associated with a transaction – they wanted 10 billion, but because there was SO MUCH demand they ended up with a 25 billion issuance, with some bonds that won’t even be redeemed for 40 years at 6%. This is all despite the facts of complete collapse of airplane demand and its 737 max scandals, and even despite literally the day prior, Boeing reported a second consecutive quarterly loss and had its credit rating downgraded to a notch above junk status. Bond investors are looking ahead through this crisis.
* Overall in March 2020, U.S. investment-grade issuance topped $259 billion for a new monthly record and an additional $162.7 billion in April 2020, bested only by March! This means many of these companies have raised enough to insulate themselves through the downturn for up to 12 months.
* In every recession related crash, markets have ALWAYS bottomed BEFORE initial jobless claims PEAKS. They have ALWAYS bottomed BEFORE consumer sentiment bottoms out. **This has very likely already occurred when we saw initial claims peak out at 6.8 million in March, after the Mar 23 stock bottom.** [https://d3fy651gv2fhd3.cloudfront.net/charts/united-states-jobless-claims.png?s=ijcusa&amp;v=202005151525V20191105](https://d3fy651gv2fhd3.cloudfront.net/charts/united-states-jobless-claims.png?s=ijcusa&amp;v=202005151525V20191105)

TECHNICALS

* Mostly copied from my prior April 10 post: When you look at the 1987, 2002, and 2008-2009 crashes, **whenever the stock market had recovered 50% of the losses,** it was already well on its way to completing the next high of the new bull market. **We have closed** **above 2792.69 on SPX**, and has held solidly. This is clear confirmation that the bottom has already passed.  [https://imgur.com/a/LsHZCpb](https://imgur.com/a/LsHZCpb) 
* And if you also look at the prior crashes, recovery to 50% takes about half the time it took to crash. We fell for six weeks, and now 3 weeks from the march 23 bottom we are already closing in on 50%. It also takes three times the duration of crashing to reach ATH if you look at the prior events- meaning we could be SPX 3300 before September or October. 
* That being said, stocks will remain volatile. No one can predict short term market movements. That’s why I’m staying long, continuing to buy stocks and hedging with trading of short term puts. Based on analysis from Robert Sluymer (at 48 minute mark:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBdaJ7OX\_3U&amp;t=48m](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBdaJ7OX_3U&amp;t=48m)  ) which I am going off of: **anticipate no greater than 10% correction from the \~2950 SPX recent high, so if stocks drop to the 2600s level, I will go all fucking in at buying that dip.**

TAKE AWAY:

* Remember. Stock markets always always always always bottoms out **BEFORE the bad data bottoms out.** Do not look at data today and try to ‘price’ the market at where we are TODAY. Try to price today’s market at what you think it will be in the future. Markets. Are. Forward. Looking.

personalfinance,"CA tax question: If purchase a house from my father-in-law at a below market price, will the property taxes still be based on the low price? (plus two more questions)","So my wife and I need a bigger house than our current 1bd/1ba since we now have a little one on the way. My father in law purchased a 3bd/2ba in LA 20yrs ago as an investment property and is offering to sell it to us. We like the house and the area, and are willing to buy it from him at a fair market price which is \~$1.2m.

As part of the transaction, we'd like to accomplish three things if possible: 1) reduce the capital gains tax burden on my in laws, 2) keep our property taxes low, and 3) get a nice mortgage interest tax shield. Also, since he's \~60yrs old and retiring, he doesn't need a big upfront cash payment, so he's willing to seller finance the property to us and will get a nice income stream from our mortgage payments.

Since I can get a 10/1 loan at 2.5% right now, i figured that was a fair rate for the transaction. A loan for $1.2m, at 2.5% rate, and 30yr am is $4741/month. My proposal was the following: record the sale at $750k and a write a seller note for 30 years at 6.5% rate. This would also equates to at $4741 loan payment, the exact same as $1.2m at 2.5%.  My FIL currently rents the property for $3200, so he's happy with step-up as well.

My questions are the following:

1. Will LA county recognize that this transaction price is below fair market value and the tax assessment will come in higher than the transaction price?
2. Will the federal tax man take issue with my in laws selling us a property below fair market value?
3. Having a $750k loan at 6.5% will obviously provide a great tax shield as a mortgage interest deduction. Given the write-off will be $48k/yr, which is much higher than most deductions today given how low rates are, will that raise any flags?

personalfinance,Student Loan Repayment Help - Credit Score Situation,"Hi, 

I need a little advice on the best way to go about re-financing my student loans. Currently, I am about 85k in student debt. I have been graduated for about 6 months, and I am working a 65k/year job. I have been saving a lot of my money, so I have it when I went to figure out how to start repaying loans. I recently ran into some car issues, so I need a car as well; I sold mine before I couldn't get anything out of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The issue:** My credit score isn't great (\~620) due to my credit age being relatively new. I am almost at the 2 year average age of credit (1 yr 10 months, currently). I have a total of 6 (open/closed) accounts. I recently had paid off a small collection, and it dropped my score about 40 points (which I don't get). I don't have any payments other than rent and 2 credit cards that I keep below 15% usage (I don't like to carry credit card debt). I need to refinance/consolidate my 3 loans into one and get a decent interest rate so I can make some sort of progress with the payments. I also WANT to get a cheaper, used car, that'll last me a few years (thinking around keeping it under $15k). I don't want to get a shitty interest rate there either. 

&amp;#x200B;

**My question:** How should I go about this so I can get the best interest rates possible, without my credit taking a huge hit? I am flexible on time, as I don't NEED a car right this second. It could wait a month or two. I am more concerned with the consolidation of my loans, as I am scheduled for my first payment on June 20th. I don't know if waiting maybe another 6 months to make any inquiries would be in my best interest.",finance
investing,Gold Due For A Correction,"I'm new to investing and it's my first time doing one of these so go easy. I'm going to try to explain gold price movements post 2008.

Whenever gold ascends, it starts with the fed coming in and lowering the federal funds rate (2019). Bond yields then follow and drop right alongside with funds rate. Investors start pumping up gold thinking that lower interest rates/QE will cause inflation but CPI is closely tailing behind yields showing that it's deflation. (Confirmed by April's CPI report). graph: [https://imgur.com/gallery/jzDe1Kk](https://imgur.com/gallery/jzDe1Kk) (yes, crayon drawings).

Banks then start to keep excess reserves to brace for a period of contraction. Graph: [https://imgur.com/gallery/rg8toHP](https://imgur.com/gallery/rg8toHP). Both follow a very similar slope until the excess reserves diverts upwards while gold starts to poop itself. Gold trades sideways when there's more than \~1.6T in reserves. Keeping our reserves high (as banks will however long this crisis takes) keeps the dollar strong and the price of gold down as USD increases purchasing power.

Gold went on a crazy rally starting 2009 until 2012 despite the deflation effect of the great recession. This is attributed to the fact that yields rates were too high. The Fed wasn't purchasing enough treasuries bc they focused on buying MBS. In this graph, you'll see that whenever the fed increases it's bond purchases, yields are able to be pushed under the CPI which coincides with gold dropping. graph: [https://imgur.com/gallery/sSWlm02](https://imgur.com/gallery/sSWlm02)

The CPI and Yields are trying to touch swords right now and it looks scary. I'm guessing we'll see a correction by end of summer.

personalfinance,"looking to move out/become more independent but am worried about student loan debt getting in the way, where should i start?","hello all o/

i'm a 24yr-old still living at home, and have been working my current job (35k gross but made more like 46k gross with OT last year) for about a year and a half now. the idea was to continue to live at home for long enough to pay off my loans entirely/almost entirely, but i've hit a point where it's starting to become detrimental to my mental health and wellbeing (and my finances, in turn - more on that in a sec) to remain here for that entire time.

i've managed to save up ~$30k over the last few years with jobs throughout college and now this one, but have absolutely no idea where to start in terms of where i should be putting it. both of my parents aren't in good financial situations and neither have been able to give me any advice because of it.

i have started to look through the resources on the sidebar but need to give it a more thorough read during the day, and was hoping for some additional advice to have in mind for when i do start sorting through it all.

relevant background info:

* i have two federal loans (one large/higher int., one small/lower int.), currently in the payment freeze from the CARES Act - they aren't gaining interest but i hadn't been paying on them bc i wasn't sure of my job situation (i was furloughed, but i'm now back to work)

* i have a single credit card which is paid off each month to a $0 balance, and no other monthly payments aside from student loans

* my guaranteed takehome pay each month (w/40hr week) is roughly $2200 after deductions for dental/vision insurance, taxes, and 401k contributions (matched 100% by my employer up to a certain dollar amount (would need to check the amt), but currently i don't have very much each month going in), **but** this number will be higher for at least the next few months as we're ~~being forced to work~~ all working mostly 11hr+ days while our staffing is limited but our orders seem not to be

* i was looking into consolidation and refinancing my loans pre-COVID, but now feel it's safer to keep them through my federal lenders at least for the forseeable future with current events/in case i lose my job again

* the larger loan is in my dad's name and unfortunately the monthly payment is based off his finances instead of mine, putting it at around $1050 a month - feasible while living at home with minimal bills, but unsustainable if i were to leave, so i'd have to refinance it in my name for sure

* i do not think any jobs in my field would qualify me for PSLF, and given the recent rejections for forgiveness for people who were already on that track, i'm not really considering it an option

* i was a bit of a spender up until recently when trying to get more serious about getting my finances in order. my only non-monthly spending now is on gas and kitten food, the occasional meal here and there (but not even that anymore thanks to pandemic), but a lot of the impulse buying was just from home getting more and more depressing, hence the desire to leave (and it would force me into buying less anyway, as i'd have bills i'd be responsible for first and am better with solid, consequential deterrents to spending money on stuff i don't need as opposed to more abstract far-off consequences)

my current list of considerations were:

* paying most of the savings (leaving enough left for an emergency fund) on my highest-interest/principal loan - this would put a dent in it but wouldn't pay it off, and likely wouldn't lower the monthly payment (i would also basically lose my entire non-emergency savings)

* putting most of the savings into my lower-rate/smaller loan - i could pay off this loan entirely, but this was lower on my priority list as it's a lower monthly payment

* using part of the savings for a down payment on a house (i don't want to rent or buy a condo, as both of those options are far more expensive than a mortgage + utility bills in my area), then splitting the rest up into emergency fund/several months' expenses to get me started

* some sort of?? investing??? i literally have less than zero idea how that works and with no support from parents since they've never done it, it's always seemed like a big confusing mess to me :') i'll be looking more into any resources for that in the sidebar in the morning

obviously my biggest desire is to get out of my home situation and start to establish myself outside of that environment (and hopefully be able to get a better job once i can get all my personal shit sorted more), but i also want to do it in the way that will offer me the best chance of financial success.

i also realize my dreams of leaving may be put on hold right now *anyway* bc of the pandemic, so i guess, assuming that will stay true for a while... what might be a next best option for what to do with my money in the meantime, that would still allow me to be in a good situation to move out when things start to normalize again?

let me know if anything needs more clarification or more info!

&gt;*What is the saving rate your money earns at your bank?*

What would you imagine are the lasting effects of an abrupt end to what you accepted as normalcy? Each day we arise and begin our day, very similar to the prior day. We begin our routine, our cup of coffee, a fast review of the news, checking in on those still sleeping, and getting ready for work. Future actions enter our mind, bills to be paid, matters awaiting us at our job, relationship joys and challenges, salary raise hopes, car servicing, food needs of the house, that lunch planned for today, the meeting(s) to be had, and so much more. Our mind fills with the hundred other things that our day will encounter. And so, another day has begun.

But today none of the above feels normal. There is no work today. There is no need to hold to a schedule. There is no paycheck. The bank account is shrinking or may already be empty. There are worries about health, about paying the bills, about access to food, about our children’s educational needs, and even about going out for a walk.

A week goes by, and then two, and then a month goes by. Uncertainty is the operative word in a world that denies us what we knew and believed to be normal. Our future is clouded and our worries build.

The word pandemic becomes the topic of the day, a word we rarely heard prior to the year 2020. Headlines, big and bold, carry words of Depression era unemployment, of a daily death count, of a daily infection rate, of the lack of basic supplies and equipment to protect the health of all, and attacks on government leaders for perceived failures to protect society.

There will be fallout from this change in life. A shock to the system that we took for granted shakes the grounding of our beliefs and expectations. There must be consequences, outcomes, new choices, that are driven by our inability to clearly see the future. The impacts of the Covid-19 virus will make us hesitate, make us rethink what is important.

How much money do we really need for that rainy day? More or less than we previously kept in reserve? Will we ever take a vacation again? And to where? On a cruise ship? On an airplane? How much money should we allocate to vacations vs building that reserve fund? Enough to cover necessities like food, toilet paper, antiseptics, medicines? And what about the elderly, the most vulnerable, that need the younger generations to provide care and safety?

The lessons we are learning will change behavior. It is unlikely that we will live and interact in the same manner we did prior to this pandemic. Yes, I believe there may be that initial feeling of high emotion, to believe we are beating this thing and that our lives may quickly return to what we knew, but that impulse will fade as jobs fail to come back, as unemployment remains high due to reconfiguration of the normal work day, as companies adopt more technology to make them less reliant on people to make, distribute, and sell their products. Healthcare will change, education will change, transportation will change, supply chains will change, global trade will change, and politics will get even more difficult as the matters that divide us are blared by politicians in search of votes to keep their roles in place.

I foresee a world where we save more, spend less, reassess our values, focus on security versus adventure, as we move away from embracing the experiences of life as a priority to one where we focus on safety and a return of predictability.

**If I am right about saving more, then the everyday person will become much more aware of interest rate differentials.**

Savings grow based on the interest rate that depositors are paid for keeping their money with a bank or financial institution. In a world with money only earning 0.25% interest per year, which on a $1,000 deposit earns the saver only $2.50 per year, the saver has no incentive to keep their money with a bank. Yet, the focus on saving, on being prepared for rainy days, demands a safe place to keep our money. Will people accept such low returns on their savings even though the bank is lending out the depositor’s cash at rates from 3% to 25%? The bank is keeping all of the profits, and in fact in some instances is even charging service fees that exceed the interest being earned. I think we will see a much more active and discerning saver. Comparison shopping for higher interest rates will become important to all depositors, and there are significantly higher alternatives in the market.

**It will be the alternative financial institutions that will attract more capital as depositors select these newly formed enterprises for their saving needs. If that is the case, then investing in those new enterprises, enterprises that will provide better saving rates and greater incentives to save, will be the wise choice.**",cryptocurrency

A few months ago, my husband (28m) and I (29f) were approached with the opportunity to buy a small (900sq. ft.) house on a land contract, owned by a coworker of mine. If we do not purchase it they plan on renting it out, so there is no risk to them if we pass. We want the house and feel no pressure or obligation to buy, it's the perfect size for us and in a great work-adjacent location. I did a lot of research on the pros and cons of land contracts before we decided that it would seriously be an option.

The term options we are offered are:

**3 Year-** Purchase price- $38,500, Down payment of $3850 (10%), Finance Cost- $34,650, 3 year balloon, 5% financing, $247 monthly payment

or (which we will probably agree to so I can improve my credit in the meantime)

**5 Year-** Purchase price- $38,500, Down payment of $3850 (10%), Finance Cost- $34,650, 5 year balloon, 8% financing, $331 monthly payment

They are also requesting a $2000 good faith payment to finish up any remodeling needed to be move-in ready as we requested (it was gutted and remodeled) so the down payment either way would actually be $5850 and I'm assuming the final purchase price with go up a few thousand as well.

We're about $150 in pinched pennies away from having the full $5850 and plan on meeting about the contract within the next few weeks.

Today my coworker took me aside and said something along the lines of ""I wouldn't feel comfortable if you didn't explore all financing options before everything is finalized, have you checked to see if you could get a first time home buyer mortgage? It might save you some money.""

I haven't considered looking into it because I made some pretty costly credit mistakes in my early and mid 20's and after working hard at repairing my credit for the last 18 months, I'm still only at a 620 FICO score (trust me, I've come a long way!) My husband also has a pretty low credit score after sharing a lot of debt on joint accounts with his mother (that's a whole other story).

We both have jobs in healthcare and make about $70,000 combined annually.

My questions are- is trying to get a mortgage even worth it in our situation? I know there are options for both first time home buyers and for lower-credit buyers, but is it worth the hit to my already somewhat fragile credit if I don't get approved? I understand that interest rates are super low right now, but would I even be eligible for anything less that I would be paying with the land contract options?

Additionally- if we don't finalize by late summer (it's estimated to be move-in ready in July), they will want to rent it out as soon as it is finished. Would I have enough time to go through the mortgage process if we were to start now?

Thank you so much in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

Edit- TLDR: Trying to decide if I should go for a land contract or if I would be eligible for any mortgages. Combined income is $70k, have close to $6k saved up for down payment, FICO score is only 620, when done with renovations home will be valued around $40k and will be either a 3 year or 5 year term with a balloon payment.",finance
personalfinance,Aging parents deeply in debt...don't know if retirement will be possible.,"My parents are in their sixties (mom 60 and dad 66). Their major debts are shown below. 

30K in bank of america credit card debt, split between 3 cards.

8k in back tax debt as of this years' filing. 

3k on a personal loan

1.8k left on a car loan

132,000 Mortgage on a house (under water as they used all the equity over the years) the house also needs lots of repairs. I don't know the exact amount. But somewhere in the range of 20-30k in repairs as no maintenance has been done on it since my parents bought it 30 years ago. 



My mom has  a small 401K with less than 10K in it and my dad has one as well with about 10K in. They have about 18K in the bank currently.


Both of the my parents have two jobs ( my mom is currently furloughed from one of her jobs and getting unemployment). My dad is also collecting social security. 


Between all the four job plus my dad's social security they're making about 100K currently. I have not seen their tax return for this year. So this is an estimate.


I was a having one of many discussions with my dad regarding making a plan to get them out of debt and he insists on trying to get another personal loan. He says that the new loan can be used to pay off all the existing debts and then they can pay off the new loan. 


The credit cards have high interest, and they may be able to get another loan through their credit union at much lower interest rate. Unfortunately my parents have already done this in the past and though they only owe 3K on that loan now. The credit card debt put them right back where they started. 


I suggested that my parents organize all their debts, pay off the ones with the highest interest first and then roll the left over money to payments on the next highest until they've paid them all. I think with the money they currently have coming in, if used wisely, their debts could be paid down significantly without needing another loans.


For their house, I suggested they see if their lender would be willing to let them do a short sale. The house is underwater and needs more work than they will ever be able to pay for. I submit their mortgage payment for them online every month and the bank lists the value of the house at 0. 


My dad does not like my plan for the debt because he claims that it will take too long. I don't like his plan because their track record shows they are not responsible with loans. 


My parents are not in great health and they will not be able to work forever. I'm very worried how my brother and I will be able to care for them if they can't work any more, or one passes away years before the other. 


Any advice would be appreciated? (Also this post is not to bash my parents. They are good and very hard working people. They're just bad with money.)


I just wanted to add that my parents have not been making 100,000k their whole lives. This is their most recent income with all four jobs and social security. 

I'm not able to say how much they've been making year to year for last 30 years but their income has steady increased over the years. But usually when the income would increase or they would get a windfall( my mom won a few small lotteries here and there) they would make a large purchase like a new car or living room suite. But they did not save up for these purchases they would finance them. They also went through a gambling phase and I'm not sure how much money was sank into that.

Thanks everyone, you've given me a lot to consider. I'm going to share this with my brother as well.",finance

personalfinance,Northwestern Mutual Whole Life Insurance Yes or No,"A somewhat close friend from high school called me last week to sell me insurance and investment products.

personalfinance,There are risks to staying on unemployment and not looking hard for a job.,"The Federal government is paying an additional $600 per week in unemployment benefits. Because of this many are making more on employment than they do on their job. These are set to expire on July 31, 2020 although it is possible new legislation may extend this.

There is risk of staying on unemployment. Many employers are going to be operating with less employees, so many jobs people thought they could go back to are not going to be there. When these benifits expire there is going to be a huge increase in people looking for work. If you wait till the extra benifits expire to look for work, you may find it more difficult to find a job.

As we can see, the market has made a significant runup over the past month or so, approaching back to where we were pre-pandemic. I post this as I would like to pose the question to the community to what extent are FED fiscal measures propping up the market, and if you think there will come a point where the FED has run out of fiscal measures to implement to continue driving up the asset prices?

 If this were to happen, what type of situation would you expect to see play out in the market and the broader economy?

I look forward to your responses.

investing,Stocks Jump 3.2% the Most in Almost 6 Weeks After Moderna Vaccine Announcement,"Stocks surged to the highest levels since early March after promising early results for an experimental vaccine sparked speculation economies could snap back quickly. Crude oil advanced and yields on Treasuries rose.

The S&amp;P 500 jumped 3.2% after Moderna Inc. said its vaccine tests yielded signs it can create an immune-system response in the body. Companies that would benefit from a return toward more normal economic activity rallied. Carnival Corp. surged 15%, while Delta Air Lines and Live Nation Entertainment climbed more than 13%. Energy producers popped 7.5% and real-estate firms added almost 5%.

The risk-on rally comes as more economies around the world and within the U.S. ease restrictions that created one of the steepest downturns since the Depression. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stressed the central bank has more ammunition to combat weakness. The Stoxx Europe 600 jumped the most since March, while indexes in Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea all posted modest advances.

“Powell addressing that the Fed is not out of ammo combined with positive vaccine trial data has set the markets off to the races,” said Matt Miskin, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management. “It just shows that sentiment can change so quickly in times like these.”

Gold traded at its highest price in seven years before retreating, while West Texas oil rose above $30 a barrel for the first time in two months as producers in the U.S. and elsewhere continued to cut activity.

While Powell said the U.S. economy’s recovery could stretch to the end of 2021, he added that policy makers are “not out of ammunition by a long shot.” Several European countries ended bans on short selling, as they continued to report the lowest number of daily deaths from the virus since March.

“The market is very tied to measuring the success of these economic reopenings,” said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist for Charles Schwab &amp; Co. “A successful vaccine would really make those reopenings very successful. The market is excited about that news although it would be a long time until the vaccine is developed.”

State benefits only account for 40% of wages prior to unemployment, and many states are already feeling the burden of paying out tremendously high levels of unemployment, as nearly [half of the states cannot pay for new unemployment claims](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/nearly-half-states-do-not-have-enough-funds-pay-all-n1175246).  At the moment, 40% of unemployment claims have not even gone through.   

At the moment, unemployment has been tremendously helpful in slowly the draining of economic resources in the wake of COVID-19. Although \~30% of retail workers have been laid off (the largest single employment sector in the US), many retail workers are actually seeing higher incomes due to unemployment. They continue to spend money on rent (4/5s of which has been paid for April despite huge job losses), groceries, and utility bills. However, when the unemployment checks stop on August 1, we will see the true effect of the job loss. With a short-term recovery, many of these workers should be re-hired by July, and the markets will be up. If many have not been re-hired, it will underline major issues in the so-called ""recovery"".

Consumer Spending is the biggest indicator of the market's health. If we see vast decreases in consumer spending due to declines in unemployment payouts, this will result in declining revenues for all businesses across the board and stock market losses in a traditional market. However, we have seen that the Federal Reserve is willing to do whatever it takes to keep the market afloat. They will buy junk bonds, ETFs, long-term securities - essentially pumping the market full of cash to weather the storm. The important question to ask is, what are the long-term repercussions of this? Will deflation from rapidly declining consumer spending be enough to counter inflation from the rapidly increasing money supply or vice-versa? In any other market, we would be seeing Depression-level stock market losses. But this isn't 'any other market'",finance

personalfinance,FHA to Conventional Loan with no closing costs... seems to good to be true,"Mortgage Questions for Conventional Loan Refi

TLDR:  FHA to Conventional Loan with no closing costs... seems to good to be true.

**Backstory/Scneario/Interest:**  So my lender called me last week offering a lower interest rate from my current FHA loan rate (4.625%) down to a new rate of (2.85%), which seemed great (lowering our monthly payment from $1,593 to $1,334 a $259 savings, getting us out of our loan in 21 years if we kept the same payment).  During this conversation I asked about conventional loans and if it would be a possibility.  The loan officer hung up, crunched some numbers and called me back with 'great news' that he can offer me a conventional loan **with no up front closing costs** at a higher rate (**3.40%**) yet lower overall monthly payment of approximately **$1,268** (getting out of the loan in **18 years** if we kept the same payment of $1,593, which we intend to do).

He had my curiosity before, but at this point he has my attention.

**PMI:** Lowering my current PMI payment of $168 to **$30.13/month**.

**Loan amount:**  Goes up from my current (principal remaining) $237,661.99 to $241,000. Variance of ($3,338.01) I think this may be the kicker here now that I look at it, but with the lowered PMI and Interest payments, I am making this up in 1-2 years easy, and then the PMI drops after around two years, lowering even further.

**Appraisal:**  Apparently no appraisal needed either. Reasoning front lender "" The collateral relief means the value of $285,000 I am using is acceptable and no appraisal is required.  With no appraisal there is no risk of a value coming in light and the approval changing.""

**Lender:**  My current Lender is through Caliber Home Loans, and they are the firm offering this deal, so the loan stays in-house and isn't sold to a third party for management. They mentioned that they are trying to be competitive with other loans that may be trying to grab me in a refi (which is why this deal may seem so sweet?), would keep the loan with them so that's part of the reasoning.  Further more he emailed me this "" We are not just a random company that called you out of the blue saying we can help.  It is my job to find benefit and help our clients save money.  In your case, a significant amount of money in interest, mortgage insurance, and a better loan program (conventional).""

**Little more background.**  I bought in 2018 at apx $246,453 at 5.25% interest, refied in 2019 to a $241,472 at 4.625% interest (FHA Streamline), and am now considering another refi. I am well employed (nearly 4 years, good job) and have solid credit 750+.  Long term plan is to live in it for 3-5 years longer, and keep as a rental property when we move out.  We live in Arizona close to both ASU and spring training facilities, so we believe it will be a successful rental and to hang onto it as an asset (for rental purposes, I know that a conventional loan is much better for rentals).

**Question:**  For myself with basic mortgage/refi knowledge, this seems like a no brainer because the timeframe we're out of the loan is way less (10-11 years earlier) if payments remain the same, with significantly less spent on PMI and interest.  However, I can't shake the feeling that I am getting out of the FHA into a conventional loan way to easily and that there has to be a catch.  Is it the 3.3k getting tacked onto the loan?

What's the benefit to the lender for this?  and why at no cost up front?  it seems to good to be true that I'm refinancing into a conventional from an FHA with basically no up front cost... unless the cost is looped into the mortgage over the life of the mortgage (which appears to be the case with the fees of 2k and the additional 3.3k tacked onto the loan amount).

He is recommending that I go conventional out of the two options.  Any reason I should lean towards the FHA over the conventional or forego the refi altogether?

personalfinance,Modern apartment to keep for 5-7 years vs long term house that can be updated?,"My partner and I are buying our first home together and are unsure about whether we should buy a cheaper apartment for the next few years or spend more on a house that we are happy to settle in and revamp over time. I've given the details and costs for two specific properties that we were looking at below if that helps, but general guidelines would be really useful so we can narrow the search to either apartments or houses instead of both.

The two bed apartment is in a high rise two buildings away from my office while the larger 3 bed house is a 20-30 minute drive away. If we go for the apartment we could sell my paid off car and use that to pay off her car and put a small amount into the house. My partner works in audit, so she is at clients 95% of the time and the house and apartment have equally travel times for her (since the apartment is against traffic).  If she leaves audit, the apartment is right in our business hub, so most major firms are a walk/10 minute drive away. 

The apartment has modern furnishing, there isn't anything decor/layout wise we would change. The house has much larger rooms, with an additional bedroom and lounge. One of the bathrooms in the house was recently renovated. There's nothing wrong with the other bathroom, but it could be modernised, and we can add feature walls, redo cupboards etc over time. We are quite happy to raise kids in the house, but think the apartment would get cramped, hence the 5-7 year timeline. 

Cost-wise, without a deposit the mortgage + rates on the apartment is about 19% of our combined gross income, compared to the house at about 21%. I realise the price difference is small (around 10%) but that excludes all remodelling costs and being able to sell a car. Interest rates are low right now, but even at their average over the past 5 years the repayments only increase to 21% and 24%. We both stay with our parents right now so don't have any furniture, so we need to think about those costs as well. Our bank (my employer) offers a 110% LTV mortgage, but we can put about 8% down if that makes the interest better, but thought that it might be better to use this for furniture. The 8% we could put down excludes selling off any long term savings/touching pension money, but would cut our emergency fund to just one month's savings.  

We are leaning towards the house, but the main reasons we are considering the apartment are that:

* being able to sell a car lets us aggressively repay the mortgage in 5 years,
* it's easy to lock up and go when we travel,
* we don't need the extra space for the next few years,
* When we do need more space, we can use the equity in the apartment (or keep it and rent it out) to get a long term house that's probably a bit nicer than the one we could get now and remodel,

In December myself and my fiance purchased a 345,000 home and took out a 293,500 30 year loan 4% interest rate with a PMI of $47 a month. Now we are looking to refinance and were offered 3.25% for 30 years on the remaining 291,500 but PMI will go up to $81 a month. Why is my PMI so much higher and should I still do the refi?

personalfinance,Invest or Pay Off Debt?,"I will be starting a new job soon that has great growth prospects and will pay much better than the job I will continue with until the end of June (due to my employer having received a payroll protection loan).

From what I've been told, there will be a probationary period where I will be making $16 an hour. This is in contrast to what I'm making now ($13 an hour, minimum wage in my county). This means that I will start out making $250 more per month after taxes. And it would be more than that, but I am electing additional withholding due to the fact that I did a Roth conversion earlier this year and I'm not making estimated tax payments 

After the probationary period, I could be making $18-20. And, yes, I will be sure to get that in writing. But I've been told by other employees that the boss is very good about regular raises. If I make $18 an hour, that would give me $720 more per month after taxes, including additional withholding. If I make $20 an hour, that would give me $875 more after taxes, including additional withholding. This also takes into account the extra I'll have to pay on student loans and health insurance (REPAYE and subsidized health insurance through the state marketplace), a slightly increased food budget, and the fact that by the time I'm making $18-20 an hour, I should no longer be paying for my courses ($680 per course, each one taking me about a month to complete). 

I'm 28, with $22,000 in my Roth. I have $35,000 in student loans at 5.62% and a $16,200 auto loan at 5.94%.

If I put all the extra money toward my auto loan I could pay it off by the end of 2021 or early 2022. I would then roll the free cash from not making auto payments into student loan payments. And even with the increased balance from interest accrual, I could pay them all off in three to four years. Then the only debt I'd have is the mortgage or rent I take on (I don't currently pay for housing). I understand rent isn't debt, but you know what I mean... 

All this being said, I used to absolutely shovel cash into my Roth and haven't been doing so for the past year or so due to the fact that my online classes take up a majority of my discretionary income. I'm young and I really want to take advantage of time being on my side, compound growth and all. But paying off my car and student loans would free up a a few hundred bucks a month at least, and I should be making even more than $20 and hour in a few years (hopefully closer to $25). Although, I do hope to eventually start my own business and those usually aren't profitable for at least a few years. So we'll see how that goes.

Anyway, it seems like now could be a good time to really start focusing on paying down debt. What would you do in my shoes? Pay down the debt? Invest and hope I can get a higher return than my interest rate on the debt? Or perhaps split my extra earned income between the two?",finance

Now, what are my options for paying for the vehicle and how much will each one cost me?  Pay close attention to interest rates and length of the loan.  Dealers are trained professionals.

personalfinance,"Getting Started in budgeting and investing, Thoughts on my plan? (24 year old, Canadian)","Hey everyone, 

I'm a recent graduate whos working a professional job and for the first time I have some savings and I'm trying to be smart about investing and budgeting. I live in Toronto Canada currently and have a monthly income of around $3750 (after tax). My rent is around $900 per month and living expenses is around $1000 per month. Trying to go by the 50 (need), 30 (want), 20 (save/debt) budgeting plan.  I have around $11K in my chequing right now but I'm trying to actually put those into good places. 

**The following is my plan for assets:** 

\- $8000 in a HISA (Emergency Fund) 

\- $1000 into a TFSA (questrade and then DRIP into some high dividend CAD stocks/ETFs) 

\- $500 into same TFSA (questrade for some growth investing and selling of some USD ETFs)

\- $1500 in my chequing account to have some liquidity and spending 

**The following are some of my liabilities:** 

- I have no credit card debt or other high interest outstanding credit 

\- I have around $55K in student loans which I pay around $660 to per month. (If I have more than $1,500 in my chequing i'm going to put everything extra into debt) I believe its around 3-4% right now. 

Please let me know what you think so far of my plan or if you have any tips. 

**The following are some questions I'm not sure about:**

1. Whats the best way to lower expenses? 

2. Should I be selling and buying so much in a TFSA especially in USD? I'm buying some USD stocks in hopes that it will go higher in price and then sell off, but I'm worried about capital gains taxes or US withholding taxes. I've heard its better in RRSP, but a TFSA seems friendlier to withdrawal if needed. 

3. Should I try starting a HISA with a new bank than my current one for better interest rate? I'm worried about transfer fees and regular bank fees. If I do go with another bank, should I keep my chequing to my current bank and then just keep the HISA with the 2nd bank or put everything to it? I heard Alterna bank has a really high interest rate of 2.3% for their HISAs. 

4. Should I get a new credit card? I've had the same credit card since I was a child and I heard American Express is really good. 

5. Is there a way to pay rent in credit card? Seems like a good way to get more points easier.",finance

investing,Market to crash around August? What do you think of this post?,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/gm06tp/anyone_else_negotiating_down_their_next_lease/fr23nf9/?context=3

&gt; Well, if after June the market is still contracting, we will officially be in recession by definition. August is the 2nd month of 3rd quarter and will be when a lot of decisions will be made since we will most likely have a 3rd quarter of contraction. Further making the recession feel real to more and more people.

&gt; Also, the restrictions on rent placed in February and March will be lifted, indicating the beginning of 6 months of nonpayments for mortgages and thus beginning of foreclosure proceedings.

&gt; Individuals with multiple mortgages won't have people renting their property as much since people will move in with family due to hardship, as what happened in 2008.

&gt; Banks already put a stop to Home Equity Lines of Credit, back in March, which means a lot property owners that rely on rental income to pay their mortgages, will essentially not be able to pay them, or take a line of credit based on their equity, to pay their mortgage (floating). There will be numerous foreclosures, banks gonna bank, people gonna hurt.

&gt; The Federal Reserve has a $0 reserve requirement at the moment, since that was lifted. People can't pay their bills, their credit lines (cards, loans, mortgages, HELOCS) will go into default, and banks are going to take bigger losses. With no reserve requirement, banks are going to become more unstable as people don't pay their debts.

&gt; U.S. economy relies so much on banks, and if they collapse, so will the entire U.S. economy, as did in 2008. Just wait a bit longer, we already have record unemployment. A record student debt bubble, mortgage bubble, and credit card debt bubble.

&gt; The manipulation of the Fed is prolonging the bubble burst.

&gt; August is just a guess as to when it begins for many of the paycheck to paycheck individuals, the hardships begin for those without income when they run out of their savings.

personalfinance,Student loan unknowingly sent to collections. Next steps? Overwhelmed,"I attended a state university seven years ago and took out student loans. About two years ago I paid off all student loans (paid online through Navient). 

After paying off those loans, my parents received a notice that I owed more money to the school. After inspecting the letter, the PO Box listed was in a completely different state 
and looked very, very unofficial. Since I had just paid off all my known loans and it looked suspicious I assumed it wasn’t legit because this is a common area of fraud. My parents ended up receiving a couple of these notices in the mail but I convinced myself they weren’t legit (didn’t do enough research and I’m regretting it).

Now, they received a letter from a collector (William &amp; Fudge). It looks a lot more legit and they’re seeking a lot more money than the original letters were asking (fees and interest so it makes sense). I called William &amp; Fudge and they said it’s from a Perkins Loan I received through the school so it wouldn’t show up on Federal loan websites like Navient.

The conventional, even with 20% down, interest rate is between 4.2-4.6% every where I’ve been approved. the difference in my house payment is a moot point. There really is no difference, and I can put down 0% or 20% and be in the same spot.

investing,Inflation for US vs Inflation for Zimbabwe,"""Too much money chasing too few goods = inflation"" - I get that.

&amp;#x200B;

Thought experiment:

I say there were 100 apples, and everyone needed 1 to survive, and there are 100 people with $1 per person, then everyone could survive. But what if the money supply increased to $200 ($2 per person)... Well then I suppose Apple sellers would raise their prices to match... But it does seem awfully odd that Apple suppliers are able to figure how much money people have in their pockets and are quick enough to adjust prices accordingly. But let's just say they can and do - and the government doesn't try to stop them like Venezuela or Zimbabwe. Then yea, I suppose we would be balanced by the actual supply.

On the other end, if everyone was given $100 million, then yea, that would seem kind of absurd because essentially American's would now be the wealthiest nation on earth and able to buy anything from anyone... At-least until those goods, like the Apple suppliers, adjusted for the value of our dollar?

&amp;#x200B;

What I don't understand is say, if economic wealth is tied to supply, productivity etc, why then doesn't a government just print money to build and invest in the country's infrastructure to increase that supply and productivity?

""You don't have a place to live?!"" - boom we print money to pay developers to build a house

""You want to create jobs?"", - boom we print more money to create jobs to build a factory

""You can't afford medication?"" - boom here's money for you

\- This is some AOC progressive rhetoric that is being thrown around all over politics and seems absurd but is it?

If the United States is the worlds reserve currency...

So we try to tether ourselves to reality (of supply) and reasonableness (printing $100 million per person is not reasonable) by backing our currencies to several across the world. Though wouldn't this give those who hold reserve currency status (like the United States) tremendous power to just print their money? **In other words, if a country has its debt denominated in its own currency and holds a reserve currency status, what's to stop them from just doing whatever they want? Put another way, why hasn't everyone been given $100 million to tell our problems ""bye-bye America #1"".**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Just to clarify for the Austrian Economic elitist that might come on here and take out of context what I am talking about:

&amp;#x200B;

CONTEXT:

Giving everyone $1 million dollars wouldn't change anything. If everyone says needs a house, a car and a phone, basic necessities, for the most part, it wouldn't matter if you gave everyone the ability to buy all those because we have a finite supply of them. there just isn't enough resources available. So prices have to go up to account for the limited supply OR we can just go straight commie and say everyone gets half a house.

Though on the other end, you can't deny that not giving people or stimulating the economy when faced with massive deflation due to a collapse in demand. Maybe not $1 million but say $1000 to be able to afford the prescription they need. The supply of drugs isn't disappearing here before people losing their jobs and thus having a lower income and ability to afford what they need.

&amp;#x200B;

QUESTION

We can talk about the balance ALL day, should we give $1000, $1,000,000 $0??? - But that's not what I'm asking. I am talking about how does our reserve status comes into play? If other forex currencies are pegged against us, what's to stop us from printing more? If all oil is transacted (barring a war) in USD, then what stops us from abusing and devaluing our currency on our own terms.

personalfinance,MD - Haven't received any unemployment or tax return. My boss offered me a job at a low rate. Do I have to accept?,"I was let go mid March due to covid. I filed my taxes electronically mid March as well. I haven't received either my federal taxes or any unemployment/pua, and all other money is basically gone.

My old boss recently offered me a job, but with lower pay and lower hours. Plus, we are expected to NOT wear mask or gloves and will be working closely with co-workers (always close proximity and physical contact from time to time). I have a toddler at home and am not comfortable with this. I'm in such a tough spot. I need money immediately but this seems like such a bad deal, but its better than the nothing I'm getting now.

At the same time, am I forced to take the offer just because it was made? If I report I was offered work and declined, won't I lose unemployment eligibility and any possible pay that may come in finally? Is there anyway to reject or quit down the line due to their no mask/glove policy?

With all of this, does anyone have any advice on what I can do about not receiving my unemployment for so long and going on week 9 of no federal tax return? Phone numbers get me nothing but busy signals.

Thanks for any and all advice!

Edit: I filed for unemployment in mid April and was approved.",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage loan officer keeps misquoting me on interest rate lock,"I am doing a new construction primary residence loan with a major bank/lender. We got the conditional approval and everything done back in early January (required by seller/home builder), and we did a 6-month rate lock with a 1-time float down. I was locked in at 3.875% (with close to 0 points) from back then, so I'm trying to float it down now, we're about 2 months out from anticipated closing

It's been 3 separate occasions now of the loan officer giving me the day's float-down rates, me saying ok let's lock it, then she comes back and says it was misquoted to her from her pricing desk or from her manager and then gives me the ""correct"" rates which are pretty significantly higher (like 0.5% higher). This is all within the span of like 1 hour to 2 hours tops, in the same day.

I'm trying to understand what is going on or why this is happening. Is it possible she really is just getting misquoted by her pricing desk or manager keeps messing this up, this many times? Or is it possible someone trying to take advantage of me or what. I want to believe that the loan officer doesn't have that power to manipulate the rates, that's what I always thought but I really don't know what goes on behind the scenes. Or is it possible that the rates are really just fluctuating so quickly in the same day?

It's not apparent to me that the loan officer herself is being dishonest, otherwise she is just an amazing liar. She knows I'm shopping other lenders, but is committed to the fact that there's nothing she can do.

Any insight or opinions appreciated. I did pay a commitment fee with this lender which is supposed to be credited at closing, so I'm trying to figure out what is going on before I just switch to another lender and forfeit the commitment fee.",finance

personalfinance,Unique credit card debt reduction situation,"Forgive me if this has been answered before, I searched for a while without finding the specifics  I was looking for. 

My situation is I have around 10k in credit card debt spread across three cards:

\~4k on the highest interest rate card (24% APR about $85 in interest per month)

\~4k on a reasonable interest card (15.99% APR, about $53 in interest per month)

\~2k on a card with two rates (22.99% for purchases, 24.99% balance transfers, about $36 in interest/mo.)

Unlike most of the cases I could find on here, I recently acquired 6k and want to pay off the debt as smartly as possible. I'm familiar with the avalanche vs snowball methods, but I also want to factor in that I would like to save some cash to start a savings/have a little bit of a safety net. Should I pay off the highest interest card and get a debt consolidation loan for the rest? When paying off card balances, is there any realistic chance of getting them to cut you a slight break?

for context, I make about 60k/year usually, no idea what my job security going forward looks like by the end of this pandemic. Any advice is much appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Monthly Expenses - Are we doing ok(ish)?,"Hello everyone, 

I am trying to get mine and my husband's finances somewhat under control. We essentially live paycheck to paycheck but have started saving again. I would just like some input on if we are approaching things the right way I suppose. 

Our total monthly bills are $4513. That includes mortgage, 2 car payments, groceries, all utilities, car insurance, some loans we are paying off, and some credit cards. Some of the things have ends in sight within the year. We recently started taking $200 out of each paycheck for each of us to put into savings, so we are putting $800 a month into savings. Unfortunately right now we only have about $4,000 in savings, but will be filing our taxes soon and hopefully can bump it up to $5,500. That leaves us with roughly $300 left each month. Does this seem livable? I  have had no positive influences in my life when it comes to finances as my mom has a shopping problem and my father has never held down a job or saved a dime in his life. I have a very warped sense of what a normal household should look like. I have some debt I'm trying to also make small payments on which would further decrease the amount of money left every month. To me, it feels very tight but as the same time if monthly bills are paid and we are fed and have gas in our cars and putting savings away, is the $300 just ""extra"" that could go to more bills or savings? 

Any advice or insight would be great. (Side note, as far as the future, my husband and I both work for the state and have retirement accounts through them. Neither of us are vested yet but plan on it)

investing,Hypothesis on S&amp;P 500 heading down,"We all recently learned that the Fed will boost the money supply to any extent to keep the “economy” in ok shape. We also learned this boosts stock prices a lot. So do widespread shutdowns that force people to save because huge swathes of the real economy for goods and services is shutdown. The Fed’s new money doesn’t have much place to go but to assets, and cash flows for people that still work also don’t have much place to go but assets (saving rate spiked up), and hence the S&amp;P 500 is doing fine as the US is on track to have Great Depression levels of unemployment. 

However. Many states are starting to open back up and allow the real economy to start up again. Prices on everything will be low because of the slowdown, while the valuation multiples for equities are sky high (Q1 earnings doesn’t show us the full picture, but Q2 will). So as things open up, not only will savings rates (read: money funneled towards assets) fall back down, but also people might want to sell assets at rich valuations to buy goods and services at fire sale prices. A slow down and even reversal in the flow of money to the S&amp;P 500 could mean that there is another leg down ahead for the S&amp;P 500.

personalfinance,Refinancing Home Loan,"Trying to decide if refinancing is right for our situation. I bought our house 7 years ago. The original loan was for $73,000 with an interest rate of 3.25%. We have paid the loan down to $62,000 at this point. Between major renovations to our house and the general rise of home prices my realtor thinks we could easily get an appraisal of \~$125,000. We had been thinking of selling and moving to a bigger house, but have decided between Covid and the debts we have that we should wait a year or two and get debts paid off. This would give us the ability to free up about $600 a month of our current income, and make a bigger house note easy to take on.

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen numerous posts on reddit about people refinancing and getting low rates ranging from 2.875 - 3.5%. Right now my credit score is sitting at around 830, and my wife is mid 700s. We are currently paying PMI on our loan, but since we have not hit the 20% equity to loan mark the bank will not remove the PMI. I'm thinking refinancing may give me two benefits 1st being that we would easily have enough equity to get PMI removed. 2nd we could cash out $10-15,000 to pay off a student loan that i have about $10,000 left on. The interest rate on the loan is 5.75% and I have about 10 years left on it. I understand there is a chance that refinancing could raise my rates a little bit, but since I don't plan on staying beyond 2-3 years I'm not sure that i'm worried about .5% increase in interest on such a short term. My  loan counselor has already told me that closing costs will be $3500.

personalfinance,Is it possible for an individual to purchase a specific mortgage backed security for a property?,"For personal research purposes, and just answer a few past questions I've had in the field.

\*Background\* Family had an ARM loan that we were led into without much knowledge of, refinanced too late and interest rate was too high to continue affording the property, defaulted, and foreclosed. Always wondered if the individuals involved with providing us the loan, (real estate agency, private mortgage broker, banking personnel, family friends etc.) were part of the investors involved with our loan in general. 

Towards the end when we were pleading to refinance again, or seek aid from Wells Fargo through mortgage relief programs, we'd always get a short forbearance letter that would say we'd have a reduced mortgage amount briefly, but would have to payback the total defaulted amount as a lump sum. Otherwise the letters would say, ""Your loan modification claim has been denied by the investor"". 

I understand that Mortgage Backed Securities can be sold by banks such as Wells Fargo as portfolio based security pools to investment firms, or individual investors. Is it possible or an investment firm, or individual investor to select out a security pool with a specific property mortgage line attached to it?

stocks,"My portfolio strategy for a 2022 recovery bet: leisure, digital, and Chinese equities","I believe the economic recovery likely won't begin until later in 2020 and won't actually bring us back to 2019 levels [until the end of 2021](https://chimerais.com/covid19-may13-prospects). So far, Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell seems to [agree with me](https://www.ft.com/content/2ed602f1-ed11-4221-8d0b-ef85018c96ea).

With this in mind, there are a few specific observations I'm making that I want to turn into concrete investment decisions:

* The recovery in entertainment and leisure will begin taking place near the end of 2020, and we'll see a recovery in demand by 2022.
* We'll continue seeing a shift to digital technologies and products as a result of COVID-19, and companies focused on digital transformations (or providing consumers with digital experiences) will do well.
* Companies based in Asia will do particularly well due to the combination of aggressive COVID-19 responses, earlier recovery for their economies, and focus on digital infrastructure.

If the above is true, then...

* Leisure and entertainment companies that have suffered financially due to COVID-19 will recover by 2022. Call options for 2022 could be a good and aggressive bet. This could include companies like Disney, Netflix, and others.
* Asian companies like Alibaba or Kingsoft Cloud will likely do well too, especially due to their combined focus on digital consumer experience and digital transformation. Other companies in this bucket could include JD.com, SEA Group, and others.
* As will digital work and transformation companies based in the US, such as Salesforce, Zoom, Microsoft, and so on.

Of course, you still need to find companies that have great management teams, have good revenue or product momentum, and meet fundamental requirements.

With the above in mind, here’s is my 2-year portfolio to operationalize this specific set of expectations. I believe this will either 5x itself in the coming two years, or I might lose everything[2](https://chimerais.com/covid19-may19-portfolio#footnote2). See the footnotes for when I actually made these purchases and what the asset breakdown is[3](https://chimerais.com/covid19-may19-portfolio#footnote3).

* **Kingsoft Cloud.** Buy the actual equities, due to the recent IPO. Th
* **Alibaba.** Call options for 21 January 2022, with the expectation the stock price will increase 30% or more.
* **Carnival Cruise Lines.** Call options for 21 January 2022, with the expectation the stock price will recover.
* **Disney.** Call options for 21 January 2022, with the expectation the stock price will recover.
* **Salesforce.** Call options for 21 January 2022, with the expectation the stock price will increase 30% or more.

These investments will do well if (a) my view on a 2022 recovery is correct, (b) the recovery positively impacts the types of companies I'm focusing on, and (c) that the *specific* companies I'm selecting will do well. There are many unknowns, but also a large upside.

I'd love to hear what your strategies are or discuss the above. I'm also happy to provide additional points on each of the companies above, and why I feel strongly about them.

So I'll have ~8k and after a grant and scholarship I'll owe ~6.5k for my first year at college. I will have some other expenses, books, laptop, and rent (my parents are paying most, so about $200/month will be coming from me) as well as groceries/utilities. 

I'm currently earning $15.25 an hour but I'm going to be looking for a student job so in all likelihood I will probably be downgrading to $12.50-13/hour (although some student pay goes up to 17.25 an hour)

I've been offered two forms of federal financial aid.  A $4500 subsidized and $2000 unsubsidized loan. I initially accepted both of these offers but I'm thinking I should probably drop at least the unsubbed loan. Is there any harm in taking out the $4500 subsidized loan, keeping the $4500 of my personal funds I otherwise would have spent for an emergency fund/whatever other expenses I may need and then just paying off the loan before I graduate (and the government stops paying part of the interest)?



Some scholarships are still in review so there is a chance I could earn more in aid but I'm not banking on it, I'm also working to improve my GPA (3.8 currently) even more, I have a term of straight A's and this term where I'm likely to get straight A's that haven't even been sent to my new college yet, so the hope is I'll receive more aid for my Senior year, will be a junior in the fall.",finance

personalfinance,Should I file my 2019 taxes electronically after sending paper return,"I am in a bit of an odd situation.  

Due to income repayment that spread over the years 2017 and 2018 I had to take the IRC-1341 repayment credit to the tune of \~5k to recover taxes held by the government. Effectively, I payed my last employer back 20k of which 5k was withheld.  They reissued W2cs for 2017/2018 as if the 20k was not part of my income.  I amended.  Everything was accepted and I moved on. 

Enter 2019 taxes, I still want that 5k back that the government has!  No tax software supports this credit (most support only the deduction) so I was stuck doing this through the Fed free file system by hand and cross-referencing against FreeTaxUsa.  Here is the thing. The supporting tax forms for this are basically non-existent....you  figure the credit following publication 525 and plop the number into your 1040 schedule 3.  That is it.  A passive reader of my taxes would find a ""random"" IRC 1341 credit to the tune of nearly 5k without any context.  In addition to this, I took a 4500$ EV credit effectively boosting my return to just under 10k.  Basically, I am sweating a bit that I will get flagged/audited/IRS will not believe me.  The fed free file system provides no avenue for supporting documentation.  So I decided to mail it.  With the mailed return I included the repayment breakdown, proof of payment, 2017/2018 W2cs, my amended returns, and finally a short letter documenting how I arrived at the IRC 1341 credit number following publication 525.   

Perfect, taxes mailed. Well I did that in late February and the USPS never updated the priority tracking number.  The IRS ""Where's my refund"" system also never indicated receipt (interestingly my state return was received without USPS tracking indicating delivery lol!)  I was assured by USPS that a lot of tax returns don't get scanned at arrival so I moved on.  Then Covid-19 hit.  Feeling a little worried mid march, I decided to mail it again. This time I was given a proper tracking confirmation, however its been a month and the ""Where's my refund"" system still shows nothing.

I am reading that the IRS is basically shutdown, not processing mailed returns, and **heavily encouraging electronic filing**.  I have tried calling to get there view.....no luck.  Its looking like best case this will get processed at the end of the year. 

**So here is my question, should I file my forms electronically through the Fed free-file and forgo the supporting documentation?**

This is a large return of nearly 10k that I was planning on getting around April. Frankly, given the current circumstances, it would be really nice to actually have this money.  However, I am not sure what the implications are of electronically filling after already mailing it and if I likewise risk the return getting flagged without my IRC credit explanation.

gaming,I'm so disappointed in the gaming industry,"Title explains the essence of this post, I'm fed up with the lack of innovation and creativity in this braindead industry.

Once a flourishing market for ideas has become a corporate treasure hunt. Instead of people being hired with the job of spending time thinking of creative, fun, unique missions/quests/features, they hire psychologists to help them understand how to keep people playing.

Once upon a time, I used to buy games and be so excited to play and now, when I hear of a new title, I'm afraid of how it's going to be a let down. 
Couple examples for people that may not understand, Borderlands 2, great game, one of the most bang for your buck game that you'll find but then it's followed up with 3, and anyone that's a fan will know they cut far more endgame content than the first or second game had and instead replaced it with grindy BULLSHIT.

Another example, one of my most favourite game series of all time, fallout, more specifically, fallout new vegas. Which was followed by fallout ""your settlement is under attack"" 4 and it goes without saying all the issues people had with that game. 

Couple more examples, Destiny 2, games with battle passes, GTA Online/Red Dead Online, etc.

It's very fucking clear, to the idiots sitting in their fancy houses on the phone asking what went wrong, quality of content over, amount of content (measured in hours completable). Stop focusing on how to keep people playing your game and instead only focus on making a good game because at the end of the day, people only want a good game, nobody wants to run back and forth for hours. 

And just because you have a big title and a bunch of people play it, doesn't mean you can cheap on the content and slow progression, more players means bigger budget dickheads. 

And just in case you need something else to let it sink in, it is rare that you'll ever find a Witcher 3 player or dark souls player that speaks about the negative parts of the games but I bet you that any players of the other games will, so if you want your game to actually set in stone, make sure you take the correct steps to ensure your finished product is worth buying 60$ and that when the person is finished playing, they will be happy with their purchase.

TLDR: Focus on making a good game rather than one that just keeps people playing.",technology

personalfinance,Looking to Refinance 30 year 3.375% Mortgage to 15 year 2.75% Mortgage,"Hi all, I was hoping I could run my logic by anyone here to make sure I wasn't making any glaring mistakes (which I probably am). My aim was just to see if this was a good time to refinance or if I should just keep my existing mortgage.

I was shopping around for interest rates and was able to get a 2.75% fixed rate, 15 year loan for a $260K balance. 

Current loan that I have outstanding is approx  $260K, \~24 remaining years (orig 30 year term) at 3.375% fixed rate. 

Monthly payment once refi would be \~$1.7K compared to current \~$1.3K a month, this would be an annual difference of $5.4K a year in mortgage payments.

I'm looking to try and pay off the mortgage entirely at the end of 2030, and using an amortization schedule calculator that puts me at an ending lump sum payment of $86K once refinanced, or $169K with my current mortgage.  

My main question is, given that I'll be paying approx \~$53.5K more in P&amp;I payments after I refinance, is it worth it to save the approximately \~$25K in interest? 

It seems like the refi is not worth it as I could put the extra money I pay into a HYSA or CD but I believe I am drastically oversimplifying things and missing the time value of money and annuity factor of all this.

This is my first post in personal finance so I hope I have not done anything against the rules and forgive me if this was a dumb question. Any help is much appreciated and thank you all for your time!",finance

personalfinance,Fraud cheque causing my account to close while over seas,"I copied this post from r/scams but if anyone knows how to deal with this since I already called them to handle this since it wasn't me. I don't understand who would deposit a cheque in my name?

So this started on 05/18/2020 I was working in Thailand and definitely would love to be back the States right now. Anyway, so there was a notification and email saying I have a deposit of $100,000 that was posted on that day and I later on found out that Navy Federal Credit Union stopped my account for Suspicious Activity because someone mailed in a physical check with payable to me signed...? How? I'm in thailand I explained to them and now I'm stuck here without a bank account and the only payment I get is through Wire transfer/Swift Transfer and as a veteran this screwed me big time because i'm in a foreign country and I cannot receive my VA disabilities or if stimulus check happens. I work as a contractor in Thailand for investors, oil rigs, and as well as a paymaster for myself and my two partner who does investment but it's funds from stocks and no physical cheques. I do get paid a good amount of money for each job and it ranges from 250k-800k because I arrange purchase of hotels, and i work as contractor for oil rigs as well since I was a Heavy Equipment operator in the corps. As for trading i've been doing it quite a while but sold my stocks and bitcoin and yes i paid tax on these. So now i'm trying to resolve this issue saying that it wasn't me idk who it is maybe it's one of the investor groups but these deals are contracted and the bank has the contract which doesn't make sense why a physical check with my name and it was endorse mailed in to Navy Federal.

Has anyone had this happen to them? Because now when I do make big amount of money I feel like they might close it down again even though I have contracts proving i am part of this job just to bring them and help them buying and promoting business etc....

Now let's not involved my job with this scam. The check that was physically mailed to Navy Federal came from the U.S. and I do not get paid by USA or do I associate myself with employment there right now except for my VA disability check and maybe stimulus, I get paid by German company, Thai, or Indonesia by Wire transfer or Swift no paperchecks at all. But yeah can anyone please explain or give me some ideas on how some retard mailed a check payable to my name with my signature when I can't send mail out of the country? this check was signed by me.

Okay sorry I'm just alittle jumpy since I'm very concern becuase I am in the dark about this and I've never experience this before and i'm just scared being stuck out here homeless or something. Anyway let me explain the situation that happened clearly. Someone Physically mailed a check to Navy Federal for deposit into my account without my knowledge for 100k endorsing the check with a signature(not mine) through U.S. postal without my knowledge. My investor and who ever sent the check has no contact with each other so who tf in the right mind would do this? because the investor is here with me, and he has duestch bank in germany so he does not need to send any kind of physical check since he will pay me in Swift transfer electronically and before he pays I have to inform navy federal and my tax attorney for obviously tax reason. But this physical cheque idk from who(I will find out tonight thailand time from navy fed),my employment for this contract does not involve any kind of physical check and the US bank is not involved in anyway that involves my employment with these investors so I see no benefit of someone sending me this check at all and forging it at that, keep in mind I cannot send mail out right now from thailand with the coronavirus but this mail was sent within the US which I am not currently residing in. Now in my current situation, I will get paid by my investor because I am helping him with the bank here, and helping him connect with people to invest in a hotel and I get a commission for promoting and setting up ads and popularity of this hotel. As for right now I am surviving with my VA military disability to pay my Bill's and stimulus check from the first wave and money I saved up before I EAS out of the military. And when I do get paid it will be and only be wire transfer(electronically) from my investors account with full documentation of where the funds are from, the contract of my employment and my attorney will be involved as well. But right now I don't have money to spend on this stupid situation for a lawyer about this fraud check case, I'm just trying to make a living but somebody has to screw me over from across the world. As for this investor himself, he knows I am good with bitcoin and investing in stocks, so he wants to help me build up an LLC for me but want me to invest by using my commission from this job and he will jump in once I show results and have his full support. But like I said right now I'm basically working for free until I fulfill the contract of helping him and yes he has a legitimate company, and I get paid in a week which how bad of a luck do I have? This happened before I get paid, and with that commission I open my business for investment for myself and yes I will get license as well later to be a broker. The commission I am getting will be taxed, and will be notified accordingly. But this isn't the issue, the issue is somebody send a damn fraud check without my knowledge, forging my signature and tried to deposit this and I don't even know a reason for this. I just want some advice on why and what will benefit who ever it is who did this. I hope this cleared it up the situation alittle

Bitcoin,There is no imminent $ inflation coming. Get over it.,"I see so many posts and memes in this and other crypto communities that talk about printing machines going ""brr"" and the inevitable inflation. These posts demonstrate a lack of understanding on how currencies work.

Just because a central bank prints more or less money does not necessarily imply that inflation will rise or fall. Inflation is a measure of how the cost of goods and services as measured by that currency change over time. If demand for a specific good falls or its supply increases, you can typically expect its price to fall as well. That's deflation in its price. If demand for a good rises or supply decreases you can typically expect its price to drop. That's inflation in its price.

The same holds for goods and services collectively, as is happening now. The aggregate demand for goods and services has recently taken a sharp dive. Supply has decreased as well, but the demand shock seems to have outweighed it. So prices are generally decreasing not increasing.

Qualifier: this is obviously an oversimplification but the point holds. There will always be variations by geography, and short-term effects caused by supply chains being impacted and people panic buying, etc. These are short-term effects that don't matter for the bigger picture. I'm talking about sustainable changes. And most currencies other than the US$ have their own issues as well.

Now to be sure, just like any other good the US$ is subject to to the same economic laws and dynamics. If its supply increases too much its value should decline which everyone would perceive as US$ inflation. However, the Fed has been singularly focused on containing inflation for the past decade at least and some would argue for three decades now. The long-term trend is decreasing not increasing inflation. In fact over the past several years the Fed has not reached its own self-declared target of 2% inflation. Some economists fault the Fed for its singular focus on inflation targeting at the expense of other goals like containing unemployment.

And the US$ has for decades now reigned as the world's reserve currency. That means that when things get risky investors in the US and globally rush to the ""safety"" of the US dollar: $-denominated government debt, equities, and cash. Recall that during the Great Recession when shit hit the fan in the US investments counter-intuitively rushed to the US$. I put ""safety"" in quotes because a big reason it is safe is precisely because everyone perceives it as such and rushes to it in times of uncertainty. But the Fed realizes this and makes sure they don't compromise this quality so this status quo persists. They have their eye very much on the ball.

Other countries would \*love\* to have their currencies have reserve currency status because it gives them more monetary policy flexibility, but very few succeed and then only partially. For now at least, the US$ reigns supreme.

**Right now the consensus among world's brightest economists is a concern about US$ deflation not inflation** ([source 1](https://ritholtz.com/2020/05/no-inflation-for-years-to-come/) and [source 2](https://voxeu.org/article/gauging-impact-covid-19-market-based-inflation-expectations)). This is because, mentioned above, demand has dropped so precipitously and the Fed is, notwithstanding what you might guess reading this subreddit, a professional organization with a stellar track record.

For the record I'm a huge crypto fan and have invested quite a bit into it. Mostly Bitcoin. But that's not because of some stupid impression that the Fed is currently printing the US$ into the ground as we speak. That will not happen. I invest in crypto because in the \*long-term\* I think it is a wise move and anti-inflationary. And because I like the control it gives me compared to debt, equities, real-estate, and other investments.

But I also recognize the shortcomings of crypto. It is far from used widespread. It's subject to regulatory risk. And these things can affect its status as a perceived safe haven. It is far more volatile than most respected currencies. Also, total holdings of crypto are dominated by a few large whales. These are very real not imagined shortcomings.

Anyway, what I'm saying is that crypto is great, everyone should invest some of their savings into it, but understand the issues. The memes and circle-jerk surrounding it and this BS about printing press are really cringe-worthy for anyone who understands what the real picture looks like. I realize this probably will not be a popular submission and get buried, but I had to put it out there. /End rant.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,How do you decide how much to spend?,"TLDR: I have stable high income but feel guilty spending money on things I want but don't need.

Background: We live in a high cost of living area our combined income is 360k a year. Biggest expenses are rent 3250, utilities ~100, streaming/internet ~100. Only debt is student loans I have 85k left at 5 year 3.2% fixed. We have paid down half of mine and all of my wifes in the last two years. But the plan with the low interest rate is to just pay it off over the next 4.5 years left in the loan

Goals: save for a house but not sure on timeline. We are currently saving 8k a month towards a house.

Overall we have a plan for retirement and future savings but I don't really know when it is ""ok"" to spend on a want vs a need. I have used mint to track expenses for nearly 10 years. I overall just don't really spend money. My splurges are on traveling and nice dinners (not doing that now, thanks corona).

personalfinance,Refinance Breakeven - Cashflow vs. Actual Costs,"I'm trying to calculate a breakeven for a refinance, let me know if you guys see this differently.

If you refinance a mortgage with the primary goal of reducing your cash outflows by reducing your interest rate... Let's say you close in July, you ""skip"" your mortgage payment in August and pay the refinanced amount in September. Now assume:

Closing costs are $2,500   
Mortgage: $2,000/month  
Refinance Mortgage: $1,750/month  
Savings of $250/month  
Breakeven solely from refinanced monthly savings = $2,500 / $250 = 10 months.

However, when purely thinking about lowering cash outflow, breakeven, and other factors, I would think this ""skip"" should be factored into the overall breakeven equation.

i.e. If you don't refinance

Normal cashflow:  
August Mortgage: $2,000  
September Mortgage: $2,000  
Total Cash Outflows: $4,000

Refinanced cashflow:  
August Mortgage: $0  
September Mortgage: $1,750  
Total Cash Outflow: $1,750  


So you ""save"" $2,250 in cash outflows ($4,000 - $1,750), and you effectively breakeven in basically a month, since closing costs are $2,500 and you save a second $250 the following month from the refinance.

Granted, I recognize that you're not really ""skipping"" simply mortgage payments are in arrears, and you're just putting the interest for September in the closing costs, but from a cashflow and total payment perspective, it seems like using cash outflows makes more sense to calculate breakeven from a refinance vs. purely on reduced payments. What do you think?",finance
personalfinance,is it wise to create CDs with declining interest rates?,"My father and I have been getting debate about the best way to save my money.

personalfinance,Paying off low-interest student loans vs. investing in index/target date funds in this economic climate? 30+ years from retirement,"I know most long-term investors believe in their system just as much in the bad times as the good. 

I’m young and new to investing and had really bought in strongly to the “Boglehead” style of investing in the 6 months or so before the pandemic. I have a decent amount of student loan debt, but at a very low interest rate (about 4%), and had bought into the idea that it was a better long-term strategy to invest my extra money and make minimum payments on my student loans. (With the mindset that a 7%+ return on investment was likely over time.)

Due to the concerns of the virus, I’ve been saving up all my money for now waiting to see what happens before making a decision. I already had a substantial emergency fund (over 12 months) before the pandemic, but now that I’ve lost my job and moved back home, my expenses are next to nothing and I expect to save almost everything that comes in for a while.

Pretty soon, I want to take that lump sum I have that’s not the emergency fund and either invest it in index funds or put it towards my student loans. 6 months ago, I would have said the best move was to invest, but I’m admittedly a little concerned to pass up the sure thing (paying off loans) for the thing that doesn’t seem as sure to me as it did. How confident does everyone feel about these investments compared to pre-pandemic for someone a long way from retirement?

If it makes a difference, I currently have barely anything in investments at 24 years old.",finance

Trading,Day Ahead &amp; Sentiments for 20th May 2020,"**DAY AHEAD**

In Britain, the preliminary PMIs for May will hit the markets on Thursday, ahead of retail sales for April on Friday. The PMIs are expected to rise, but to remain deep within contractionary waters, while retail sales are primed for a record collapse. As for GBP, it is being battered from all sides. The UK economy will reopen very slowly, investors are worried that deficits will result in austerity, the BoE is considering negative rates, and to top everything off, the risk of a no-deal Brexit is back on the radar.

First, markets weren’t impressed by the government’s handling of the health crisis, as the early hesitation to shut down the economy now means a longer period of things staying shut. Second, there are growing fears the exploding government deficit will result in ‘belt-tightening’ austerity once the crisis ends, either via tax increases or by spending cuts or both, sapping demand as the recovery begins.

I just spent roughly a year and a half getting it back up and had just gotten over the 700 mark. The only comment is that it is related to my student loan.

personalfinance,Question - Anywhere to see Bank Account Interest Rates over time?,"Hey there,

I'm currently researching Checking Accounts, Savings Accounts and Money Market Accounts to completely reorganize where my funds are kept. One main motivating/differentiating factor is APY interest rates. However, rates now are extremely volatile, so it's hard to choose one bank over another solely based on interest since there's no telling how their rate will trend in the future. Online it's really easy to find sites that list the updated current rate, but I haven't seen anywhere that lists past rates. If I could average out the interest rate of each bank I'm interested in over the last two years, that would be a lot more actionable than just the current interest rate.

Does anyone know a site that does that? Namely a site that lists the past monthly interest rates for the main accounts of popular banks? As opposed to just listing the current interest rate, as so many sites do.

Thanks.",finance
personalfinance,Aren't mortgage points really an investment/loan?,"I'm looking into several refinancing options. I can pay $2,589 more for a 3.375% rate instead of a 3.625% rate. In doing so, my mortgage payment would be $61 a month lower. Over a period of 30 years, this would save me about $22,000.

Doesn't this just mean that that I'm essentially making an investment that costs $2,589 up front and then pays out $61 a month for 30 years? This works out to be about a 7% interest rate. Except that 1) if I refinance/sell in the future then the savings stop and 2) I don't get the mortgage interest deduction on the $61 a month I would save. Is that an accurate way to think about it?

Similarly, if I were to accept a higher interest rate with lower closing costs, wouldn't this essentially be a loan? I would be getting a financial benefit now that I would pay back at a 7% or so interest rate over the life of the loan. Except that 1) if I refinance/sell in the future then the payments stop and 2) I would get a larger mortgage interest deduction on the additional interest I would be paying. Is that an accurate way to think about it?",finance

personalfinance,The best way forward financially?,"Throwaway account. 
I am eight months pregnant. I was laid off due to COVID for two months unable to collect unemployment because I have an interstate case(base periods in Nevada and I currently live in Alabama) that requires me to file on the phone in Nevada which is impossible right now. Been trying for weeks. I have a paper trail so eventually I should get back pay for the last two months(my employer here has been filing weekly for us in AL) but who knows when I will see that money. 

My financial situation:

~17k credit card debt
~16k car loan (actually 42k if including my brothers car loan I co-signed for) 
~56k fed student loans
Credit Score: 653

I will have to add to my fed loans in the next year or so to finish my degree that was put on hold in NV when I got pregnant and had health complications. I have ~2 terms of school left to finish. 
Finally back to work for the next 2-3weeks before I have to take maternity leave.
I don’t pay rent thankfully. 
My car payment is $445 a month plus $150 for insurance. Boyfriend crashed my car last year and we cannot afford to fix it right now so I can’t sell it for the value of the car, my brother is a co-signer on it so I don’t want to stop paying for it. Both my brother and I have never missed our car payments. I have never missed any cc payments either. Up until now I have been just barely making it every month. Due to pregnancy complications we were paying bills on my cc to survive for a couple months until we moved to AL. 

One of my cc payments is ~$300 a month which I struggle paying for along with the other cc’s and my car. 
I do not qualify for any type of car loan refinancing at this point, nor any personal loans since my recent paystubs are so sporadic. 

For the co-signed car loan: We are hoping my partner will qualify for a 16k car loan that isn’t co-signed with my brother so we can get a more manageable monthly payment. We are still unsure if he will qualify though. 

As soon as we moved to AL I stopped using all cc’s and have not bought any thing that isn’t a dire necessity. 
I don’t know what to do at this point. I have been looking at bankruptcy and don’t know if I should save what little I have to pay for an attorney or if there are other options. 

I have one missed cc payment from three days ago which I have to figure out but I am finally at a turning point where I’ve got to formulate a plan out of this so I can provide for my newborn. 

My boyfriend works but he has ~$600per month in his own bills and I will be out of work for at least 8weeks after delivery. On top of that the place we live in is in need of repairs pre and post baby to be safe and livable(flooring, rotting windows, etc.) We will barely be making it(as in if he pays all our bills we may not even have grocery money). 

Any pointers would be appreciated.",finance
Bitcoin,I wanne sell my bitcoins,"So the reason i'm maybe (there is a 85% chance) going to sell is because there is a bubble in the system that a few people also see with the economy

\- $3 trillion digital dollars have been printed to stablelyes the economy from falling apart. They bought low bonds and they try to fill up these holes in the bubbles that are leaking.

\- 36 million people lost there jobs. You could say that in august many stores are gonna be open, but maybe 12 of the 36 will still not have there regular jobs. And at one point, there will not be enough to support the people who have to pay there rents and other stuff like food or cars.

personalfinance,Deferring student loans to focus on higher-interest mortgage,"I'm in the process of buying a house, and it looks like my mortgage rate would be somewhere in the 3.2-3.8% range. I also have a little under 100k in student loans, at a variable interest rate (currently 2.1%).

My student loan provider allows for up to 36 months of deferred payments (no questions asked). In addition, payments deferred during the current pandemic do not count against the 36-month limit.

Considering the interest rate difference, I'm thinking it would make sense to defer student loan payments as long as I can and put the difference towards paying off the mortgage instead.

investing,Fed minutes show fears of ‘extraordinary amount of uncertainty and considerable risks’ because of coronavirus,"The Federal Open Market Committee released minutes Wednesday from its most recent meeting, which concluded April 29 with the central bank’s policymaking arm holding steady on interest rates.

After slashing its benchmark rate to near zero as the coronavirus pandemic took hold, the FOMC voted to keep the rate there in a range between 0% and 0.25% and not move it until a recovery is firmly in place.

The action came as central bank officials noted the excessive damage the virus was doing to the economy and the potential for damage ahead.

“Participants commented that, in addition to weighing heavily on economic activity in the near term, the economic effects of the pandemic created an extraordinary amount of uncertainty and considerable risks to economic activity in the medium term,” the minutes said.

One area of particular concern is what should happen in the event that coronavirus infections should surge later in the year. The minutes noted that the “more pessimistic” outlook for a rebound was probably as likely as the baseline forecast for improvement.

“In this scenario, a second wave of the coronavirus outbreak, with another round of strict restrictions on social interactions and business operations, was assumed to begin around year-end, inducing a decrease in real GDP, a jump in the unemployment rate, and renewed downward pressure on inflation next year,” the summary said.

As far as specific threats, the meeting summary noted vulnerability to the banking sector and the potential for bankruptcies from nonfinancial companies.

They also noted the danger of high unemployment levels as workers became separated from the workforce.

In addition to the pledge on rates, Chairman Jerome Powell discussed the multiple measures the Fed has taken since early March. The central bank also instituted nearly a dozen liquidity and lending programs aimed at maintaining market function and getting money to needy areas of the economy.

personalfinance,Underwater car loan advice,"As the title says I currently owe more on my car loan than the car is worth and I could use some advice. 

Back in 2016 my mom passed away, she's lived out of state since I was a teenager (currently 34f). I was in my car when I got the abrupt and rude phone call from her room-mate at the time yelling at me when was I going to get rid of my mom's shit. Color me confused cause I wasn't aware that my mom was in the hospital and in a coma.  Queue panicked phone calling etc. Flash forward to the end of 2017, I hated driving my car because every time I got into the driver's seat I remembered that first call.  So despite my 2008 Ford Focus being completely paid off and in great condition I traded it in for a 2012 Toyota Prius C (which I do love). Because I was desperate to just get rid of the bad memories attached to the old car I accepted a really bad trade in deal and didn't haggle or negotiate at all with the purchase price of my Prius.  I ended up getting my car loan through the dealership (another no/no I can hear my mother yelling at me for lol) and coming home with my new car the same day I test drove it.  It's important to note that my credit is trashed due to prior bad decisions (like trusting my ex to handle all the finances since he had such great credit &gt;.&lt;)  So the interest on the first car loan was like 20% or something absolutely insane.   One smart thing I did was go to my credit union after 6 months of on time payments on the car loan and refinance it and got it down to 11.99% interest. Still bad but loads better than before.  I make a payment on the car loan every paycheck  (Payment is about 245 a month, I pay 125 each paycheck the same day the money is deposited.) I've made some good strides in the last few months and my credit score is a bit higher at around 600 (vs the 550/560ish when I refinanced)  I have a ways to go yet obviously and I was able to pay off a majority of my debts this fall with the small amount of money my father left me after his passing. And I'm now working on building an emergency fund and trying to really repair my credit. (shitty credit card is had, and my only one. used to pay my cell bill and gets paid off in full each month)  However I've just realized how badly underwater in my car loan I am. I knew I owed more than it was worth but didn't know how much until I looked up the value of my car.  KBB says the best I could expect would be 7,000 private which I highly doubt, I think the average of about 3000 to 5000 (trade-in) seems about right.  I currently owe about 6500 on my loan. While I have no plans to trade in or sell the car and it's running fine I'm not sure if I should focus more on paying the loan off early vs building the emergency fund or possibly refinance it again for a better interest rate?  Or keep doing what I'm doing build the emergency fund and focus on building credit and consider it a painful lesson in not making purchases based on emotions? 

&amp;#x200B;

Tl:DR;  Bad decisions led to bad credit, bought car I didn't need due to emotional issues, owe 6500 dollars on a car worth 5000 in the best case scenario. Need advice on how to fix.",finance

On April 23 I got my federal tax return, but have yet to get the $1200 check.

I suspect this is because I was declared a dependent in 2018, and since I had not filed for 2019 (where I'm not longer a dependent), they used the 2018 taxes for me.

We will lower your interest rate from 3.875% to 2.875%, you will also get to skip a payment.  This will not only save you $100 a month but it will save you over $35000 over the rest of your loan.  To move forward with this either call me or email me and we will get this in process.   The only thing we need from you is to electronically sign a new application.  We DO NOT need to pull credit.

For those bulls who want to buy stocks now, you must have been going crazy buying stocks in 2019 and even crazier in 2018, and 2017. Many people were saying stocks were overvalued (or at least a bit frothy in 2019), but now (going into the most cataclysmic economic event of our lifetimes), it is a good time to buy??

Here is my bearish case for stocks:

* The economy is being kept afloat right now by insane debt forbearance, money printing and stimulus spending. If a individual or business cannot pay make loan payments. No worries. They will just be deferred. Everyone gets a $1,000 check from the government. Uncle Sam will pay the wage costs for all businesses for 10 weeks. Many Americans are making a lot more $$$ on unemployment then they did from their jobs. You can't pay rent? Well your landlord does not have to pay his mortgage so that can wait. This will wear off. A lot of it will be re-upped. However, the economy is in recession right now even with this massive stimulus. This is the end of a long economic expansions and people have decent savings and are fine. It is only down hill from here.
* There will be pain once defaults start happening. We will not escape this recession without some pain. Banks and Financial Institutions will not want to lend or invest into uncertainty. Credit markets will dry up which will squeeze the economy.
* Its going to get more expensive for many businesses to operate with safety restrictions. Profits will be more difficult to come by. Retail, restaurants, travel and leisure will take a huge hit. Autos probably will too. Businesses are not going to have there employees travel (stay at hotels, take planes, eat at restaurants) in 2020. People are not going to go out like they used too (the bartender wearing a face mask just kills the vibe).
* Businesses will be forced to make cuts. Unemployment will lead to lost wages and the recession/depression spiral will develop.
* I expect the FED to go through unprecedented measures to keep the economy afloat. But there will be economic pain.
* Who knows how long it will take to get a vaccine? It could be one or two years or longer. We hear about companies making progress, but companies have the incentive to do that to increase their valuation.
* What if there is a second out break? The virus is out there and it quickly went from 1 case in the USA to shutting everything down.
* Even with insane FED spending, the economy will be in worse shape the virus goes away because all the debt, inflation, ect. Companies will have to pay more taxes to pay debt, the government will have to reduce the deficit (government spending is much less than 2019 and 2018). If there is inflation well that is a tax too, because everything is more expensive.

My questions is why by stocks now? Do you think the S&amp;P500 is going to increase 12% to its all time high? Then what. Is it going to increase 100% once the virus goes away?

The economy has been so good for so long, that people have forgotten that companies can lose money. It is not just ""I struck out this time at bat, I'll do better next time I'm up"". If you can't pay your debt, the companies goes under (or has to shave assets to stay alive...a recession is not the best time to be a ""forced seller""). If you cannot pay your employees you have to lay them off. A company may be relying on cash flow from operations to invest back in their business t continue their growth. If you are a company with ""growth potential"" your funders may no longer investing more money which leads to tough decisions.",finance

personalfinance,"College student with unexpected income. Should I start paying my student loans off early, or begin investing?","I'm a full-time college student without regular income. My school expenses (tuition, room &amp; board) are covered by federal financial aid, and anything else is typically covered with help from my family. I have no substantial savings.

Due to COVID-related refunds and stimulus from my school, I suddenly have about $5,000 that I'm unsure what to do with. I'm considering using it to pay off some of my student loans, or paying only the interest on my loans and investing the $5,000, but I'd really like some advice!

Option 1: 

I currently have $19,000 in federal student loans (borrowing at a rate of $9,500/academic year, which will continue for another two years). $5,000 would make a considerable dent in that amount. $12,000 of what I owe is accumulating interest while I'm still in school, and the remainder will start to accumulate interest when I graduate. I currently owe $372 in interest on top of the principal. The interest rate on the loans is 5.05%, and I'm not required to start payments until I graduate in 2022. 

Option 2:

I'm considering investing the amount into a Vanguard index fund, like VTSAX. My reasoning for this is that my loans have an interest rate that's not concerningly high and don't need to be paid until I graduate. With the recent drop in the stock market, my thinking is that it may be more profitable to invest the $5,000 than to begin to pay off my loans early.

I'll admit that I don't have any experience with debt or investing, so if I've made a basic error, I apologize! Thank you for your advice.",finance
Bitcoin,I have a question (could be dumb),"If every time the halving occurs transaction fees go up. What will happen in the future when it is no longer lucrative for miners to mine (they exit) and more and more bitcoin transactions are happening (oh it's happening).

stocks,Dow Chemical in Midland: Flood water mixed with our containment ponds,"[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/climate/michigan-dam-dow-chemical-superfund.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/climate/michigan-dam-dow-chemical-superfund.html) 

Summarized

&gt;   
Floodwaters from two breached dams in Michigan on Wednesday flowed into a sprawling Dow chemical complex and threatened a vast Superfund toxic-cleanup site downriver, raising concerns of wider environmental fallout from the dam disaster and historic flooding.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Kyle Bandlow, a Dow spokesman, said that floodwaters had reached the Dow site's outer boundaries and had flowed into retaining ponds designed to hold what he described as brine water used on the site.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Overnight, Dow filed an ""Unusual event"" report with the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission warning of potential flooding at the site.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;""We were almost nearing the end."" A former lawyer for Dow who oversaw the cleanup for more than a decade, Peter C. Wright, now runs the federal government's Superfund cleanup program within the Environmental Protection Agency.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;A 2018 New York Times investigation found that while Mr. Wright led Dow's legal strategy relating to the cleanup, the chemical giant was accused by regulators, and in one case a Dow whistle-blower, of submitting disputed data, misrepresenting scientific evidence and delaying cleanup.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr. Wright has pledged to recuse himself from cleanups related to his former employer, and was not involved in the government's response to the flooding, said Francisco Arcaute, a Chicago-based spokesman for the E.P.A. The agency was prepared to assist Michigan ""In assessing and responding to any public health and environmental impacts from the Tittabawassee River Superfund Site and Dow's Midland facility due to the ongoing flooding,"" Mr. Arcaute said, including dispatching emergency personnel to the area.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The threat to the Dow complex highlights the risks to Superfund and other toxic cleanup sites posed by the effects of climate change, which include more frequent and severe flooding.",finance
personalfinance,Please help me develop a pathway out of debt,"**Long story short:** 

I was/am married to a spending addicted spouse and got to the point I couldn't cover for her excesses any more.  Around November, we separated.  We're currently semi-living together and share a rental house lease until next March.  We have three young kids.  Might divorce, might not.  I have only had access to my own salary (\~$56k or $1,560 take home every two weeks) since November and my job is stable.  Things were crazy, I was initially broke and emotionally overwhelmed, and the result was four credit cards in my name that didn't get paid to the point they were charged off in March.  Now I am trying to get my financial situation sorted out.

**Outstanding debts:**

I have four cards that got charged off.  I just pulled my 3 credit reports today and no debt collections are currently listed.  The first two are with the same bank.

CC1: $4,645

CC2: $15,706

CC3: $1,202

CC4: $8,108

\~$170k in federal student loans.  My payments are currently zero based on my income, and I have transitioned to an income based loan repayment program.  I'm a federal worker, so if I pay the minimum payments for 10 years and keep my federal job, the remainder will be forgiven.  I think I have the student loans situation figured out.

Some recent medical bills will be coming in soon.  Maybe $300-500?

**Monthly bills:**

Rent: $950

Misc Utilities: $300

No car payment.

**Assets:**

$12,500 in checking\*

\*$2,500 of that represents a loan from my dad from when I got separated, which I am holding as part of a rainy day fund, but I want it available to repay to him at a moment's notice.

$6,000 in TSP funds that I can't touch (I contribute 5% which is matched)

I own an older Toyota that is in reasonable shape.

I'm pretty proud of that little bit of cash in the bank, since I started with literally about $500 to my name when we separated and I have pinched pennies to save it up.  I could never save money when my wife had access to our joint income.  She makes twice what I make and she has had to ask for temporary loans from me until payday on several occasions.

**My Questions:**

I would like to approach the three banks that charged off the credit cards and try to get them to take 50% as a settlement.  Since I don't see any debt collectors on my credit report, does that mean the charged off debts are still with the CC companies and I could communicate with them directly?  I really hope to avoid debt collectors, but I don't know if that's a reasonable expectation.  Is 50% even a possibility?  

I know my credit is FUBARed, probably for 7(?) years.  But is there anything I can do to improve it while getting this debt off my back?

If I could get all of them to take 50%, I think I could drop $7,000 immediately and pay off CC1, CC3, and CC4.  Then I believe I could afford a $400/mo payment for 20 months to pay off CC2.  Should I be trying to hold onto more cash on hand?

I don't have any interest in getting into new debt, but I would like to get a credit card with a small limit (secured card?) that I could use in an emergency.  My wife recently couldn't rent a car for a weekend because she has no open credit cards and crappy credit.  I mainly want to avoid something like that.  Is that reasonable for me to do?

Am I likely to get sued?  I'm dealing with Bank of America, Synchrony, and Cap 1.

Basically, any and all advice is welcome.  I know I F-ed up, but I am trying to fix it now.",finance

personalfinance,"Pay off credit card debt in chunks, or all at once?","I have two credit cards - one with a balance of $917 and the other, a balance of $6000. I get paid twice monthly, so my mode of operation has been: leftover from 1st of the month goes into savings (~$200), half of the leftover from the 15th of the month goes into savings and the other half gets split in two and pays down the cards. I now have $2k in a separate savings account, which is enough to cover one month’s expenses and then some. Since reaching $2k, I’ve shifted to splitting the leftover money only between the two credit cards.

Using my current budget (which does not account for bonuses or an upcoming pay raise), I’m due to pay off the $917 credit card by August, even with an added ~$40 a month in interest rates and fees. However, looking at my main bank account right now, I realized that what I have in *that* savings + $10 transferred from checking would be enough to pay my credit card in full. Then, starting next month, I could throw all my leftover money from the 15th paycheck at the second credit card (nearly $700 a month), have that paid off by the end of the year or sooner, and still be putting $200+ a month into savings.

personalfinance,House purchasing questions round 2,"A few days ago, I made a post inquiring about first-time homebuying. This post pertains to a new specialized topic - *physician loans*.

My wife is a medical resident and as such we (she) will qualify for the physician loan program. In a nutshell, here's what that means:

* No downpayment at all required

* No PMI for downpayments under 20%

* Currently, about a 3.25-3.5% interest rate

So my question here is somewhat a theoretical question - because there's no PMI, what's the downside to putting almost no money down so long as we're not jacking up our presumed purchase price? For instance, we're looking at a $300k house (we make a combined 150k - I make 100, she makes 50). This is a reasonable purchase price for our income and is the same price we would otherwise be looking at. We *can* put $30k down for a 10% downpayment, but why would we if there's no PMI? Following the conventional wisdom that the money can (in theory) get more returns in even a low-return bond fund (4% returns instead of 3.25% interest avoidance), doesn't it make sense to keep all of the money that would otherwise go to a downpayment and stick it in investments? 

The other factor i'm considering is cash-on-hand. Now more than ever (I sound like a generic commercial), I feel like having cash available is a luxury for a few reasons:

*  if the market tanks again I can get in at a favorable position

* if I get laid off, that $30k now represents about 8 additional months of emergency fund or about a year's worth of mortgage payments

personalfinance,Should We Buy a House?,"Hi Personal Finance,

I’d like your feedback/ thoughts/ suggestions on us buying a house.

- I make usually $5,000-$6000 after taxes.
- Our federal student loans monthly combined are $1,111/month.
- we live in San Antonio, TX and plan on using the VA Home Loan without a down payment

Expenses: 
$300 Healthcare+dental  combined 
$220 auto insurance 
$200 auto gas 
$450 groceries 
$70 internet
$70-100 electric
$1100 rent and water 
$1,1111 combined fed student loans 
$200 cellphones 
$? Miscellaneous going out to eat/shopping  (we should probably budget better, have in the past). 
$ ? Maintenance car/ dogs 
$ monthly army reserve pay has gone straight to tsp/Roth, didn’t count in income 

We plan to live in San Antonio forever.  My concern is my income is variable, I was a flex pool therapist(higher pay more risk but insurance through army reserve part time job)  and that got cancelled indefinitely due to covid. Previously the therapy job was stable for years. Fortunately  my reserve job needs me full time which I will be doing for a while locally x1 year (~$6-8k before taxes) 

My concern is my income is not  the same every month. I am hopeful that in one year therapy will pick up again at hospitals (elective surgeries, etc.).
 
Should we buy a house now? And if so how much can we afford.

My thoughts are: we aren’t getting any younger, we plan to live here forever, and we are paying rent. Concerns instability in economy and my jobs, but both seem to balance out depending on the economic situation.

A $170K home would be no different than our monthly rent, a $220k home wouldn’t feel different either as my spouse use to pay $300 month for healthcare is not longer doing that.. However   a lot of homes we are interested in are in the $280k-$290k(more this side/higher) price range because good location, good schools, and good community.

Bitcoin,My Story of BTC,"This is my story of how I derped around during the last BTC bubble, made some dough, and saw my friend pile up a mountain of debt on himself, only to become a millionaire. I hope if you read it there is a moral somewhere, but I'm not so sure there is. (prices are approximate to dates, going back in my memory a bit)

**OCT 2011: (BTC $4) (preface)**

As an undergrad computer science major I mined a few coins in a cyber security class . ~~It took about 2 months and I think it was around .89 BTC or something like that~~ (Edit: OK so I probably didn't mine this much, but I had access to the computers in the graphics lab and during this time, and they were mining 24/7. We let them run for a while after the class before taking our share out). I think it was worth about $8 at the time. I thought this was really cool, but also remember at that time you couldn't do anything with it, especially where I lived. I just kind of forgot about it, got a new laptop sometime later, and eventually chucked that one with the coins on the hard drive...  (it was just $8 and I had no way of spending it remember) oh well so much for those. Who knows how many coins were lost by these standards back in those days. I take in all the maths, graduate with marks, drink all the beer, laugh with friends, fun times.

**May 2015: (BTC $234)**

Fast forward.. I end up in Los Angeles, CA through another long set of tales.  I live with aspiring actors and film makers grinding it out as waiters and bartenders. They are good mates and take me to parties on occasion where we meet all kinds of characters. I end up chatting with a guy (lets call him Bill)  who's nuts about BTC. I explain to him that I know all about it, and he is ecstatic to find someone who understands what he is talking about. I haven't been paying much attention the past years, and he shows me how far its come in tech and price. I smack my forehead, knowing I tossed away 8/10ths of a coin (could have been beer money man). We become friends and talk about Bitcoin pretty regularly.

I don't buy initially, but Bill is giving it all he's got, buying left and right with anything extra dollar he can scrape up. He believes in it. I get so worried that Bill is going to loose what he put in that I just buy a bit (.1BTC) so I will be invested enough to watch it, to know if Bill is up or down. You can guess what happens at this point. Up we go. Bill makes money, I make money.

**June 2016:** **(BTC $661)**

All is well. I am happy that Bill didn't lose his money and hoping he will take and re-invest his earnings in a more diversified portfolio. I'm worried about the \~$100 I made in earnings, like do I file this? (lol younger me)

I meet with Bill for the first time in a while. I'm excited to share our gains. We both show our gains and cheers. He immediately tells me that he is looking at ways of taking out credit to buy more BTC.... WTF? I say. He quickly proceeds to tell me the banks turned him down, but he found out he can just buy BTC with credit cards... so he is filing 7 applications right now to see how many he can open to buy BTC... I think for a second. I do the rational thing. I try to talk him down, but no way. He's doing it. I don't know much about investment at this point, just math and percentages, but thats enough to make me beg him to not do it.... he doesn't listen.

By my estimates Bill purchased a total of $30K worth of BTC with combined cash and credit on hand at (my best guess) an average price of $589 per BTC. I invest what I have to spare from savings to just keep up with the train wreck I am worried about happening to Bill. I think I have .2 BTC at this point just to keep up with his insane position

**August 2016: (BTC $576)**

The first dip comes, and Bill is facing credit card bills with interest rates that will kick in soon (he will not be able to make the minimum payments). We discuss is troubles at this point frequently. I suggest he should liquidate and close the cards. He disagrees, and liquidates only a position large enough to pay the minimums and give him a bit of cash. Not only that but he use the cash to secure short term loans at higher interest in order to re-invest to make up the losses. I once again beg him to re-consider, but no... this is his path. I once again invest more to keep up with it, so I can keep up with Bill and his well being. I purchase a good bit more and have .5 BTC

**November 2016: (BTC$758)**

I move to another city and mostly forget about my interactions with Bill. He messages me a few times about the price going back up and being bullish about it once again. I do the same song and dance of trying to warn him to close his cards and positions to get out while he can. Nope he's holding strong. Nothing to be done. I assume I can't do anything to help this situation. Once the price busts above $900/BTC even I can't say anything. I've made money, he's made bank. I feel happy for him, but once again concerned. I know he is running on margin and don't want him to get sucked in, but I also don't want to weigh in on such a big investment at this point. He texts me about the gains, I mostly just give the thumbs up back, knowing I can't back down at this point, but I don't want to be around him if it fails.

**Jun 2017: (BTC $3000)**

I have mostly lost touch with Bill because I live in another city. I never sold my BTC though, and I never forgot about him. Around Feb. 2017 I visited LA and saw Bill. I thanked him for making me the money that I held now in BTC. I asked him what he was doing with his stake. As always he was ready for the apocalypse  to happen and for his BTC to be the only currency left somehow. He was holding stone cold. I wasn't persuading at this point, hell, I was holding myself.

**Dec 2017: (BTC $16000)**

While I thought I would never be swept up in the chaos that is BTC... I was. The amount of BTC I hadn't sold (.3BTC) was making even me feel like a genius. I had made so much money off just forgetting about something over months at a time. I often thought about Bill, but I didn't envy, in fact I really hoped he had paid off his credit card debts and was sitting on his fat profit. I watched BTC Youtube channels and debated if we would go to $100K or if this was it. I couldn't take the pressure and sold half my position @ around $16K/BTC

**2018-2019 (BTC $20K -&gt; $3.5K) (Epiloge)**

In early 2018 price went up to $20k before quickly falling back to 10K. Thankfully I sold the rest of my position on the way down at about the same point as on the way up ($16k). I bought a few back in  2019 but have never really put as much capital back in as I made. As for Bill, well I told you at the beginning. Bill is a millionaire. My best estimates based on my text with him is he cashed out @ around an average of $17k/BTC.  Even after taxes, he ended up real nice. I don't know if he was in the run up in 2019 but I must assume he was.

MachineLearning,[R] PointPainting: Sequential Fusion for 3D Object Detection,"**Abstract**:  Camera and lidar are important sensor modalities for robotics in general and self-driving cars in particular. The sensors provide complementary information offering an opportunity for tight sensor-fusion. Surprisingly, lidar-only methods outperform fusion methods on the main benchmark datasets, suggesting a gap in the literature. In this work, we propose PointPainting: a sequential fusion method to fill this gap. PointPainting works by projecting lidar points into the output of an image-only semantic segmentation network and appending the class scores to each point. The appended (painted) point cloud can then be fed to any lidar-only method. Experiments show large improvements on three different state-of-the-art methods, Point-RCNN, VoxelNet, and PointPillars on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets. The painted version of PointRCNN represents a new state of the art on the KITTI leaderboard for the bird's-eye view detection task. In ablation, we study how the effects of Painting depends on the quality and format of the semantic segmentation output, and demonstrate how latency can be minimized through pipelining.

I was pre med in college, but also had undiagnosed complex ptsd due to my childhood it greatly impacts my ability to focus, concentrate and function right now. My parents wouldn't let me take time off bc my lack concentration and focus were producing grades that didn't reflect my abilities (they thought that would lead me to drop out, go wild, etc.) unfortunately that just left me struggling and with grades so bad I was dropped from the school. I was diagnosed properly a few years later, about 5 years ago. 

So, I had been left disowned on my own using credit cards, (I was dumb and figured oh I'm going to be a doctor ill be fine) my credit score is in the 600s, I don't have a degree and am finding only minimum wage jobs. I'm struggling bc I'm in therapy and that is expensive, but something I need to help me heal so I can focus and go back to school.

I have a fed loan of about 15k, about 3k in credit card debt. Is it worth going back to school to get a 4 year degree? I've taken enough classes to have an associates in art and an associates in science if I take one more class... But I feel like that doesn't hold up for anything. Returning back to a 4 year school would mean me digging myself out of a hole due to my grades from the university. Majoring in science scares me bc there's no guarantee I make it into a masters program to become a physician's assistant and don't want to be left without a job and student loans. I also have had to dip into my savings to go to therapy with covid so I barely have a couple grand if that.

I've been thinking about going and getting a degree I can just get a job out of college in case getting my masters doesn't work out (which I have no idea in what) ...but my bf suggests a degree wouldn't do much except weigh me with debt and I should do a medical trade program instead, but I feel like that would limit me.

personalfinance,Clergy housing allowance while living with parents under one roof,"Personal finance/tax question and wondering if you can give some advice. Let’s say a clergy worker (married w/ children) decides to move in with her parents and live altogether under one roof. Her parents own the house and pay mortgage, the interest of which they deduct on their annual taxes. And as clergy, she receives housing allowance ($1000/month) which is exempt from federal/state tax (not SE). She wants to use this housing allowance to help with the monthly housing expenses of her parents without taking anything away from them being able to legally deduct mortgage interest. Her incentive to use the housing allowance is of course to lower her tax bracket for Fed/State.

So a few questions:

(1) Let's say her parents normally spend monthly $2000 on the mortgage and $1000 on property tax, HOA, home insurance, utilities, etc. Can she ""pitch-in"" $1000 from her housing allowance specifically targeting the non-mortgage payments without forfeiting her parents' ability to continue deducting mortgage interest while also allowing her to use the $1000 monthly housing allowance as a legitimate housing expense?

(2) Being that she and her parents are family, will her contribution to the monthly housing expenses count as income for her parents, or does it not matter since they are essentially a multi-generational family living under one roof?

(3) Are there any other tax implications that need to be addressed in this scenario?

My SO is the owner of the vehicle, and basically just drives it to and from work (which is about 5 miles round trip). 

We just put $1500 into last month, for general maintenance and brakes. However, the AC unit has stopped working and they've identified cracks in the piping and Freon leaking in 3 places. Needs to be replace, which is around another $1400. 

The dealership has a program that would pay us the already paid $1500, plus the trade-in value of the vehicle if we purchase a new one with them. 

My question is, should we put another money dump into this thing, which would bring it to about $3,000 in just about 2 months. Or, should we trade it in and suck up the cost of a new car.

My wife and I were traveling home to another state with our personal vehicle, a 98 Honda Accord. It had 120000 miles on it, so I knew it had life in it. We had just purchased it for $2400 secondhand a month before. I took the car to get the oil changed at a place, I'll call Spiffy Lube. They replaced my radiator cap after saying it needed it, cool. We get four hours down the road and an hour from the nearest town, and the car blows the engine. Smoke, burning oil, flashing dashboard, the whole shebang.


So we get towed and the mechanic says it'll be $3250 to replace the engine, distributor cap, and all hoses because we had a bulge in our coolant lines, it burst, and that's why the engine overheated and blew. Note that very morning Spiffy Lube replaced my radiator cap. Why didn't they check my hoses while they were at it?


Now we have to decide. Do we just scrap the car, after we had very little money and try to get an auto loan? (At the time I had sub 550 credit). Or do we max out our credit to repair the car?


We repaired the car and things got better, but looking back I'm wondering if it would have been worth paying the interest rate on a newer, more reliable car. But it isn't supposed to get more reliable than a 98 Accord, right?",finance

The [PDF of the Borrero, Bloom, and Davis working paper](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/BFI_WP_202059.pdf)


I'll try to quote some relevant sections from the NYT article:

&gt; “I hate to say it, but this is going to take longer and look grimmer than we thought,” Nicholas Bloom, an economist at Stanford University, said of the path to recovery.  Mr. Bloom, a co-author of an analysis of the coronavirus epidemic’s effects on the labor market, estimates that 42 percent of recent layoffs will result in permanent job loss.

&gt; “Firms intend to hire these people back,” Mr. Bloom said, referring to a recent survey of businesses done by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. “But we know from the past that these aspirations often don’t turn out to be true.”

&gt;In this case, the economy that comes back is likely to look quite different from the one that closed. If social distancing rules become the new normal, causing thinner crowds in restaurants, theaters and stores, at sports arenas, and on airplanes, then fewer workers will be required.  Large companies already expect more of their workers to continue to work remotely and say they plan to reduce their real estate footprint, which will, in turn, reduce the foot traffic that feeds nearby restaurants, shops, nail salons and other businesses.

investing,Have we transitioned to a bull market?,"The stock market is forward looking and while a lot of major companies have acquired the capital to survive the pandemic, they have done it mainly through debt at the cost of their balance sheet's health. The short term erosion of the market is going to make it such that a larger percentage of a company's earnings are going to be used to pay off the interest of the debt that they had to secure to stay afloat (higher interest rates and lower EBIT). While people's hope that we will return to real life soon, consumer spending will be delayed until there is confidence that the market is stabilized and unemployment shrinks back to the single digits.

In the US, Q1 earnings only included about a month of lockdown measures and most companies recorded impairments totaling in the billions of dollars nationwide. An impairment in the simplest sense is the reflection that a company paid more money for an asset than they will get value out of it, thus reflecting poor investment in earnings producing assets. Looking forward to Q2, I expect an even greater negative impact from COVID-19 since we are still under governmental restrictions nearing the end of May which, I believe, will extend through June if not further. This contraction will be reflected in company earnings and the GDP of the nation. For Q1 2020 the US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) estimates that GDP shrank by -4.8%, compared to Q4 2019, driven by a 7.6% decrease in personal consumption and a 5.6% decrease in gross private domestic investment, partially offset by an increase of 0.7% by government consumption. Compared to Q1 2019 the private investment and personal spending decreased 11.9 and 8.7 percentage points, respectively. Looking forward, consumer spending and private domestic investment is expected to decrease further due to even lower consumer spending and private domestic investment and will be offset by higher Gevernmental spending.

The YTD rolling average PE ratio for the S&amp;P 500 (which is fairly tech heavy) has decreased by about 10%. PE ratio, for those who don't know, is calculated as the price of a Company's stock divided by their earnings per share and reflects the investor's belief in future growth. The 4 quarter rolling EPS number (the denominator) for most companies shrank due to poor performance in Q1 which would cause the PE ratio to go up but since the PE ratio went down. It didn't, meaning the stock prices have dropped by about 10% more than the EPS. The problem, however, is that EPS only includes 1 quarter of poor performance and 3 quarters of 2019's incredibly strong EPS. The coming quarters are expected (if not known) to have weaker EPS due to COVID-19, and therefore we should see a significant spike the PE ratio. When the PE ratio goes up, I then expect stock prices to decrease proportionally and normalize the ratio.

Company's took on debt and furloughed workers which limits earnings growth in the near and mid-term future, Q1 2020 private investment decreased 11.9 percentage points and consumer spending decreased 8.7 percentage points compared to Q1 2019, GDP decreased by 4.8% compared to Q4 2019 and is expected to decrease further due to a full quarter of state mandated restrictions, and the average PE ratio decreased by 9.8% but does not fully reflect expected EPS decreases in the coming quarter(s). This means that we should expect the stock prices are trading at a higher level than the market would suggest and should be expected to contract.

personalfinance,Fees on savings account bring rate down - worth it?,"TL;DR - Whole life insurance policy tied to high interest (something like 4.5% over central bank rate) savings account. Fee for insurance component is currently about equal to interest gained. Interest will obviously increase if central rate increases and if more is paid into the account, but the fee (nearly $100) is so high that I think it doesn't become worth it unless both the amount in the account and the central bank rate both increase substantially, in which case better opportunities would probably come up. Am I thinking this through right?

--------

Hi, this post is for my gf. When she was a child her parents set up a 'whole life insurance' policy tied to a savings account. This savings account currently pays something like 5% interest and if the fed (I think) rate ever went up then this savings rate would also go up. The account has over $20k in it.

However, it isn't growing because the monthly fee for the life insurance component is about equal to the monthly interest. In fact, the fee is currently something like $2 more.

In my mind, although the interest rate looks good at face value because the fee is so high the effective interest rate is 0. Even if the fed rate (or whatever the standard the account is tied to) increased by 2-5% the net interest rate would be 1-3% and if the central bank rates did raise like that I expect she could probably find a savings account offering 1-3% anyway. The amount paid if she was to die isn't even that much. The amount of money in the account to make the interest worth it would have to be much higher.

We spoke to the financial advisor holding the account and they very strongly told us she should keep the account and that it was an excellent product. I'm not a financial advisor, but it's currently losing money and at best will increase barely as much as a retail bank after fees while offering very basic life insurance policy.

She unfortunately doesn't have an IRA set up at all and she is also planning on going back to school (expected &lt;$8k cost) and finish her degree in a very employable sector which will mean at least a 4X increase in salary.

We are considering: 

* a) Keeping the account and making payments at least equal to the fee each month. Let the account grow. Also save up for school and start paying into IRA mutual fund account.
* b) Closing the account and use the funds for a combination of school fees and IRA mutual fund account. Maybe put some into a retail mutual fund account with an eye to withdraw in 3-7 years to buy a house.

In conversation with a friend today, I was discussing The Unexpected Noo Normal. Remember when cryptos were crazy stuff? Just a rubbish passing fad?

So, there are three elements: gold/silver, stocks, cryptos. And over the past ten years, each day patiently studying the GFC, I’ve seen people come to accept the 2010-tin-foil-hat prediction: 

*Stock prices are/will be out of their minds*. They represent nothing substantial anymore. They are a balloon pumped full of Gubmint Phunnneeee Munneee.

And now gold/silver is creeping up. And here’s the punch line: cryptos – hard-capped instruments like 42-coin – are being seen in a whole noo light: *can’t be Phunnneeee-Munneeed-ed!!*

Bitcoin,Making the case for the Layer-2 Maximalists,"I was in a debate with the Pro/Con on layer-2 and I think I ended up making a better case for it then I intended.  Though you guys might like to read it

***

Although I don't really think the maximalist argument hold water, I can try to make the case.  I used to work with one of the major banks and clearing houses listed below, so that will be most of my lens of observation.

&gt; The lightning network, and scalability... I just cannot accept that 7 transactions per second [TPS] will be scalable in the future. 

A lot of the blockstream development may reference some of the unique environment of US banking.  In US Banking there is a similarly layered approach.  At the lowest layer you have the Federal Reserve.  This is literally a bank for banks.  Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, they all have accounts at the Fed.  When you (banking at Chase) write a check to a plumber (banking at Wells) that will eventually be converted to a Fed transfer from Chase to Wells.  Since nothing is free at the Fed, these banks batch these transfers through something called ""Clearing Houses"" where checks get bundled and (used to be) physically exchanged.

So to reproduce the antiquated US banking system, you would need the Fed Bank-to-Bank layer (Layer-1) and the Visa, ACH, Check, POS layer (Layer-2).  We all know that Visa / Mastercard handle 25,000 TPS and perhaps we can take it on faith that bitcoin-layer-2 (lightning / liquid) can handle this.  The question becomes, ""How many TPS does the federal reserve (us-banking-layer-1) support?"".  Although no one knows, the [last reported data](https://web.archive.org/web/20170727215242/https://www.frbservices.org/operations/fedwire/fedwire_funds_services_statistics.html) (2017) shows about 5.7 TPS ^(\(15,000,000_tran_per_month * 12_months / 365_days / 24_hours / 60_min / 60_sec\)).  Furthermore, this level has been pretty unchanging for the last 7 years that the statistics are gathered.

Therefore, from a maximalist point of view, if bitcoin-layer-1 can support 7.0 TPS, then it can easily meet parity with the us-banking-layer-1.  This assumes you believe that bitcoin-layer-2 can support 25 kTPS like Visa/Mastercard do

That's probably the strongest argument I could make if I wanted to support the maximalist point of view.  In that sense it seems feasible to argue that bitcoin can achieve parity with us-banking-layer-1 and us-banking-layer-2.

To take the minimalist view, I would argue that the 5.7 TPS for bank-layer-1 is over 4 years old and perhaps the new number is much much higher.  Also argue that US banking is the exact thing that cryptocurrency was supposed to be unlike.  US banking relies on centralization, so modeling bitcoin after it is unwise.",cryptocurrency

MachineLearning,Launched a federated learning tool we've been working on for a while!,[deleted],technology
MachineLearning,[D] [P] We made a tool for federated learning - check it out and let us know what you think!,"TLDR; We made [this](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/discreetai) as a tool for developers who want to train models on decentralized datasets (e.g. user generated datasets from smartphones) because we didn't see any alternatives out there. 

Federated learning has recently emerged as an important setting for training machine learning models. In the fed- erated setting, training data is distributed across a large number of edge devices, such as consumer smartphones, personal computers, or smart home devices. These devices have data that is useful for training a variety of models – for text prediction, speech modeling, facial recognition, document identification, and other tasks. However, data privacy, liability, or regulatory concerns may make it difficult to move this data to the cloud for training. Even without these concerns, training machine learning models in the cloud can be expensive, and an effective way to train the same models on the edge has the potential to eliminate this expense.


When training machine learning models in the federated setting, participating clients do not send their local data to a central server; instead, a central aggregator coordinates an optimization procedure among the clients. At each iteration of this procedure, clients compute gradient updates to the current model based on their local data using SGD, and they communicate only these updates to a central aggregator.

Our service provides an SDK to implement the federated learning routine in any application that interfaces with user data, whether on mobile, web or in the datacenter. It's fully open-source, and starting a sample project is free! Check it out and please provide feedback as we're always looking to improve.",technology

Had them start paperwork, then went to farmbureau got approved for car loan, after 4 hours of having to wait on paperwork but when the agent went to print check put it in printer put it wrong messed it up, it was the last check they had, agent said to go to dealership turn in paperwork finsh everything would get them check or payment today, go back to dealer, hand in paper work.  Then the finance guy comes over and then tells her that they wont let her take car home till payment is received,  also telling her that the farmbureau check wouldn't clear till end of next week so she wouldn't get car till then( lie ), then tells her he can finance her at a lower interest rate and get her financed and out the door in 15 min, 
Says they will use chase bank pulls new loan but now it is .10 higher than orginal girlfriend says that is not acceptable and will wait. 
He then says he was able to get the interest rate lowered now down to .01 over farmbureau, turns out that loan is through wells fargo, yep I know many of you just said oooooo fuck.
 Not only is this at a higher rate he asked do you still want gap insurance  she says yes as we had it with farmbureau for 350 dollars, does not inform her that it is 750 dollars, on top of which the car that originally was 14995 and after trade in of 08 300 should have been 13500 now is going to cost her 18500 not including extra fees from wells, the inability to pay directly to principal, and all this was done while i was outside smoking a cigarette and cleaning out car. 
I come back in to them handing her keys saying they worked it out. On the car ride home i find out what happened. 
What are her options in rectifying this i am heading to the dealership before they open to try and solve this. Any advice would be greatly appreciated . She still wants the car as far as farmbureau goes they still think they are cutting a check this morning and have no idea about this, i have already left a message with my agent to call me asap.",finance

investing,"How I finally learned ""You can't time the market""","I cashed out about 40% of my positions a month ago. I bought a bunch of stocks I liked long-term near bottom and my portfolio had made it back to pre-COVID breakeven, but I got spooked by economist warnings of an actual depression, the billionaire investors sitting on the largest cash position in history, the tech stocks hitting ATHs in the middle of a dead underlying economy, bankruptcies starting and epidemiologists warning of major disaster if we reopen too soon. Earning season would be a bloodbath and unemployment hitting record levels since the Great Depression. There's never been a pure v-shaped recovery, so why would this be the first one?

""You can't time the market (as in sell at the peak and buy at the bottom), but you can be rationally optimistic or pessimistic about the overall direction and act accordingly"" I thought. ""I'm going to take profits from this irrational FOMO bubble and keep some money on the sidelines so I can snatch up long-term stocks for well below current valuations when this whole thing inevitably collapses."" Moreover, I didn't want to see my portfolio back down 30% again if could avoid it.

Welp, most the stocks I sold are up \~20% since then. I still hold positions in all of them, but missed out on thousands and thousands of gains.

The reason you ""can't time the market"" is that market is not rational.  The market goes up on bad news and down on good news. Stock valuations have nothing to do with actual values, the underlying economy, etc - only whether investors perceive future growth.  People want to get into positions in good companies as quickly as possible,  and thus it becomes a FOMO race all the way back up or above where you started, like an eBay auction where competition drives a price above where you might have sold had you simply offered a flat price.

Rational economic pessimism has been a disaster ever since the economic reforms in 2009. The Fed is always going to work against any bets against the economy (well, unless you are investing in Berkshire or banks during a crisis, apparently...The Fed is lending money at no interest and bailing out failing companies, leaving no room for such opportunists to profit.) Thus they've detached Wall Street from the underlying economy almost completely.

And you know the second you spend every penny going long on everything, the whole house of cards will finally collapse and you'll be holding underwater stocks at extremely high valuations or with extreme risk of a prolonged shutdown. Because that's what you deserve for being so irrational.",finance

financialindependence,"Mythbusting FIRE taxes (why ""effective"" tax rates are misleading)","EDIT: Something I should clarify is that **this post is not meant to ""solve"" the Trad vs Roth decision.** There are numerous complications and caveats to this decision, including the complexity of Social Security withdrawals, the ability for Roth accounts to hold more tax-advantaged dollars, RMDs, and the effect of Trad withdrawals on retirement costs like ACA insurance or Medicare Part B. In short, this analysis is simply saying that **to the extent that tax rates are a consideration in the Trad vs Roth decision, it's important to consider marginal rates on both sides.**

****

This post is essentially about why considering marginal tax rates (your marginal rate now vs future marginal rate in retirement) is preferred compared to using marginal-effective rates (your marginal rate now vs your effective, or average, rate in retirement) when deciding whether to save your next dollar in Trad or Roth. 

I'm posting this as a top-level post for a few reasons: 

1. There is sufficient controversy and confusion on this topic, and I feel there is benefit to a more detailed discussion with focused back and forth.
2. There are currently no detailed worked examples on the /r/personalfinance wiki or on the [Bogleheads wiki](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Traditional_versus_Roth#Common_misconceptions) about this misconception. 
3. Ideally, the body of this post (and more importantly, the resulting discussion) will be linkable for future daily discussion posts. I occasionally link new commenters in the daily to the [Effective Altruism and FIRE](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/emdqbe/effective_altruism_and_fire/) post I made from a few months back when they have questions about how others think about charity and FIRE. I'm hoping that if this generates good discussion on both sides of the debate the link will serve as a good reference for new commenters in future daily threads.

****

First, some brief assumptions and definitions.

* For the purposes of this post, ""Trad"" is shorthand for Traditional retirement account, which is pre-tax contributions that are taxed at ordinary income rates on withdrawal. ""Roth"" refers to post-tax contributions that are tax free on withdrawal. This post does not deal with regular ""taxable"" brokerage accounts, that are made with post-tax contributions with withdrawals potentially subject to favorable long-term capitals gains tax rates. In short, the discussion of Trad vs Roth is entirely about the tax-advantaged accounts, with no mention of taxable brokerage accounts.

* Assuming equal and flat tax rates, there is no specific advantage to being taxed now vs later: 

  * Saver makes 10k gross. Saves it all in Trad, where it quadruples to 40k. Withdraws it all and is subject to 20% tax (8k) and pockets 32k.
  * Saver makes 10k gross, and instead chooses Roth and has it taxed 20% up front (2k) and saves 8k. It then quadruples to 32k, which is withdrawn tax free. The take-home is the same as the Trad case.

* In a vacuum, the saver prefers a lower tax rate. If taxes are higher now than in retirement, the saver prefers to avoid tax now and pay it later at the lower rate (Trad). If taxes are lower now than in retirement, the saver prefers to pay tax now and avoid it later (Roth).

* Your marginal rate is the tax rate that will be taken out of your next dollar earned. If a singleton makes 75k gross and only take the standard deduction, they are in the 22% federal bracket. If they earn an additional dollar, that dollar is taxed at 22% and they take home 78 cents. If they earn 10k more, they take home 7.8k. 

* Your effective (aka average) rate is the total tax paid over the gross income earned. A singleton making 75k gross in 2019 is taxed $9675, or an effective rate of 12.9%.

****

Now, a worked example of how the US federal tax works, because it is progressive and not flat. First, the standard deduction is essentially 12.2k that is subtracted from gross income and excluded from taxation. This basically makes it the 0% bracket. Here are the 2019 tax brackets for a singleton, treating the standard deduction as the 0% bracket for simplicity and clarity:

2019 Marginal Tax Rate | Income
-------------|------
0% | $0-$12,200
10% | $12,201 - $21,900
12% | $21,901 - $51,675
22% | $51,676 - $96,400
24% | $96,401 - $172,925

In the section above, I said 

&gt; A singleton making 75k gross in 2019 is taxed $9675, or an effective rate of 12.9%.

Here's how that math works out:

* First 12.2k is taxed at 0%: $0 tax
* Next 9700 (21900-12200) is taxed at 10%: $970 tax
* Next 29775 is taxed at 12%: $3573 tax
* Last 23325 is taxed at 22%: $5131.50 tax
* Sum total: $9674.50 (rounds up to $9675)

****

Now let's assume this young singleton is in their first real job, making 75k and trying to figure out whether they should use a Trad or Roth 401k at work. Here's how they think about their problem in effective vs marginal comparison paradigms:

* My marginal rate now is 22%, and if I target retirement on 75k my effective rate will be 12.9%. Thus, I should save in Trad.
* My marginal rate now is 22%. Each dollar I save right now goes into the very ""bottom"" of my retirement withdrawals, since my retirement account is currently empty. As a result, my current marginal rate in retirement is 0% (standard deduction). Thus, I should save in Trad.

There's a very important bit of logic in the marginal-marginal comparison, and that's the fact that the marginal-marginal comparison is time and account size dependent. 

Let's say the saver has $0 in retirement savings and earns 75k. They put 20k into a Trad accounts this year. This quadruples to 80k and they withdraw 4% for every year of retirement (3.2k). Every year that they withdraw 3.2k in retirement, all 3.2k is taxed at 0% because it's all in the standard deduction. Thus, every dollar of that first 20k (and each growth dollar that resulted) is taxed at 0%. However, all 20k that was saved back in 2019 avoided a 22% marginal tax.

Let's say the saver has 1.875M in retirement savings several decades later and is still making 75k. Here's the marginal-effective vs marginal-marginal thought process:

* My marginal rate now is 22%. A portfolio of 1.875M supports spending of 75k on a 4% withdrawal. The effective rate will be 12.9%. Thus, I should save in Trad.
* My marginal rate now is 22%. A portfolio of 1.875M supports spending of 75k on a 4% withdrawal. The marginal rate will be 22%. Thus, there is no specific tax advantage to being taxed now vs later.

So the portfolio size has changed the thinking for the marginal-marginal rationale but not the marginal-effective rationale.

Let's take it a step further and add a 40k/yr pension to this lucky retiree. They're sitting on a nice nest egg of 1.875M that supports withdrawing 75k each year and they're going to get a 40k pension each year. They're loving the fact that they're fatFIRE, and are willing to work a few more years before pulling the plug because they want to be super confident they can truly live it up. Should they save in Trad or Roth?

* My marginal rate now is 22% (75k income). My portfolio plus pension means I will withdraw 115k in retirement, which is a 16.4% effective rate. Thus, I should save in Trad.
* My marginal rate now is 22%. My portfolio plus pension means I will withdraw 115k in retirement, which is in the 24% bracket. Thus, I should save in Roth.

The *crucial* difference here is that regardless of what the saver does, they are already going to be withdrawing 115k in retirement. This means their marginal tax rate in retirement is already in the 24% bracket. 

The dollars saved this year have two potential fates:

* Trad: Avoid a 22% tax (the marginal rate on the 75k earned), but because the money saved sits on top of a 115k withdrawal, every dollar saved that avoided a 22% tax is instead withdrawn at the higher margin, or 24%. You lose 2% in this scenario.
* Roth: Pay the 22% tax. But now, you can withdraw those extra saved dollars on top of the 115k withdrawal tax free, avoiding 24% tax. You save 2% in this scenario.

The saver who only considers their marginal rate now (22%) and the ""effective"" rate of a 115k withdrawal (16.4%) comes to the erroneous conclusion that they should keep saving in Trad, even though it's losing them at least 2% on the taxes every year going forward.

****

Summary

* Marginal tax rates are the more powerful, flexible, and accurate way to assess whether to use Trad or Roth.
* Using marginal tax rates means you need to pay attention to your future tax basis, specifically how large your Trad (or other taxable income streams) will be in retirement.

The examples above are contrived to show a point. But the point remains that the marginal-marginal logic will lead to the correct conclusion regardless of the current income, nest egg size, target FI number, pensions, etc. For the vast majority of early retirees, Trad accounts are preferred *NOT* because effective tax rates are so low, but because Trad account withdrawals are low relative to the marginal rate at which they were saved. In effect, it takes many years of saving to ""fill up"" the marginal brackets to get to where you were in peak earning years. 

**Most importantly,** the marginal-marginal logic remains useful and accurate even once your Trad (or other taxable income streams) gets quite large the Trad and Roth become more of a wash. The marginal-effective logic breaks down once the Trad account gets big, because you erroneously conclude that your ""effective"" rate in retirement is still quite low, leading you to oversave in Trad when you probably should have switched to Roth.

personalfinance,Consistent Highest Interest Rate Savings,[deleted],finance
personalfinance,Am I overly stingy?,"I need advice on how to manage my debts but still enjoy life. 

I owe:
 - $13,000USD car: $300/m for 3 yrs (3% interest)
 - $40,000USD house: $600/m for 15 yrs (10% interest)

I make $1500 month. 

The 10% interest rate is killing me (normal in my country, I know US is very low). My plan was to spend all my money to pay off loans, but with my children and bills (no partner) I have very little left at the month end about $300. 

My biggest problem is I hate INTERESTS! Always have always will. I feel blessed to be able to afford my car and house every month but I’m paying most to my bank. 

It’s almost not worth it to put all my money into that and have no small luxuries (manicures, coffee dates) for myself. I just can’t justify clothes knowing I can put it against paying more interest. I was always a fashionista / make up artist in my 20s and I feel I’m losing my joy/appearance. 

I feel like I could maybe have everything paid off in 5 years. Is it worth it to do this? Should I just suck it up because interest is normal and pay minimum on my mortgage to have spare change?

How would you manage my finances?

I feel like I’m letting my conscious get the best of me, like I can’t treat myself out to anything until I pay it off as quickly as possible, but then I’m truly just working to live. This also isn’t a time issue, I spend every minute with my children they are not in school. 

I also do have $3k savings always (three months) and if I were to lose my job, I’m blessed with parents who can provide food to me and the kids.",finance
personalfinance,"Cash out refi or HELOC, or sell stocks for second home?","Hey all.  I'm looking to buy a second home on kind of short notice (to move into, and to keep my current townhouse as an investment property).  I don't have as much as I'd like in cash for a down payment, but have a lot in stocks from my company's ESPP.  I have additional cash from my girlfriend and her mom, but I don't think it's enough for a 20% down.
 

- My current interest rate for my house is 4.625%; I'm looking to refi anyways since interest rates are low.
- My original mortgage on my house was $301,600.
- I currently owe a remaining ~$262,000.
- My estimated value for my townhouse (on Redfin) is about $598,000.
- I have ~$80,000 in stocks from company ESPP, and ~$72,000 in my vanguard brokerage
- Current salary is ~$135k, with additional income for renting out 2 rooms in my townhouse at $700 each.


I'm not super knowledgeable on HELOC and refi in general. 

1. What are the pros and cons of each in my scenario? 
2. Should I look into either, or just liquidate stocks?
3. is it better to buy points since I am keeping this property as an investment (e.g: long term?).
4. Is 0 point financing typically used for people that anticipate to move to a new house in a couple of years?

She has been paying this consolidated loan herself without any assistance. 

The rate is 6.125%. This is fixed and the lender will not change the rate. She currently owes $8,600. She is still working age, but under the current economic circumstances, I fear her retirement funds will be affected more than mine. 
She makes $~85,000/year gross and has ~$400,000 in various investments for her retirement (pre-COVID). However she has taken a 20% pay cut because of the pandemic.
She will likely work another 10 years or so.
I should add she is also an awesome mom who helped me with my rent and cell phone bill when I was in grad school. 

I make $150,000/year. 
I received a $20,000 (after taxes) starting bonus this year. 
I have graduate school loans current at 0.0% interest totaling $150,000 which I am also paying at $1000 a month.
No mortgage, no credit card, or other debt.

I have my mind set on paying the $8,600. It's the least I can do for her. I'm not sure the best way to do it. Should I pay it upfront? Refinance? Make higher payments? Any thoughts and advice appreciated.

EDIT: Since I just started the job I haven't upped my monthly payment on my grad school loans. Since all Federal Loans are at 0% and all automatic payments are paused until Sept 30th, I want to take care of this $8600 at 6.125% seriously dent the 0% interest loans.",finance

personalfinance,When and how to upgrade cars with twins on the way,"Looking for a little advice here. My wife and I have a lot of options, but we're not quite sure whats the best approach to our scenario.

My wife (27) and I (24) have one child (7.5 mo), and we are expecting twins this November. Currently for cars we have a 2013 Hyundai Elantra (Paid off) and a 2015 Ford Escape (8.1k remaining at 4.94%) both running just fine with no issues and get regular maintenance. Our plan was to pay off the Escape early this summer to get it over and done with, but with the news that we are expecting Twins now so close after our first child, that threw a lot of financial plans for a loop. We live in a Medium/Low COL city in the Midwest. We are both solid in our jobs with no chance of being laid off. She is a Teacher and just got out for the summer, I am a Software Developer and my company has hardly been touched by Covid other than everyone works from home now.

Currently we have \~30k saved up in a HYSA, which includes our 6 month+ emergency fund, savings for house improvements like the carpet that we are planning to put in our basement this summer, and enough to cover our medical insurance deductible and OOP Maximum (8k for a HDHP).

We are in need of a bigger car with 2 more kids on the way, since there's no way we can fit 3 car seats in the back of the Elantra or the Escape. Both of our families live 4-5 hours away in opposite directions, so we travel quite a bit (as do they) to see them. My wife wants a minivan since we are planning more kids after these 3 (and we have a Border Collie).

Our current plan is to swap the Elantra to a used minivan this summer (something 2012-2018 with lower mileage is between 10-15k here) and keep the Escape. Credit Scores are Me (750+), Her (790+)

Where we need input is this:

1. We've been holding off on paying the Escape off and just doing normal monthly payments because of the twins on the way. Is it better to pay that off with what we've got in savings since the interest rate is above 4%? - Savings is essentially at 22k because we're expecting to hit our OOP Maximum of 8k.
2. We are planning to trade in the Elantra and put a decent down payment on and finance the minivan (no more than 48 months), is it better to pay cash for it instead of paying off the Escape? Maybe a combination and see what kind of rate we get on the minivan before paying it or the Escape off?
3. Would it be better to trade in the Escape in this scenario instead of the Elantra? Elantra gets 28-35 mpg consistently, Escape gets 20-25. Escape is newer and worth more as a trade in, but has the 8.1k of debt still attached. Escape has way more cargo space, though with a van we will be travelling in that as a family anyways. Insurance is slightly cheaper on the Elantra, though not by much.

personalfinance,Private vs Federal Loans,"I am a PA student starting this Fall and I have been hearing mixed reviews about different loans. I am expecting to take out around $140k in loans. I have heard the most common option is to max out unsub. loans (20.5k) and the rest with grad plus loans, which both having high interest rates (6.08% and 7.08%). From what I have been researching it seems very difficult to get a job that offers a student loan repayment program- one of the pros to taking federal over private loans. Many PAs seem to go the federal loan route and then reconsolidating their loans to private after finding employment.  

Would it be a better idea to take out private loans with a smaller interest rate? How do you think the variable interest would play out in the next 5-10 years. Any suggestions/recommendations from your experience?

personalfinance,"Student loan, car debt, or save?","(Ontario, Canada) 

So, I graduated last year (April 2019) with almost 30k in student loan debt (all government). I am a registered nurse, and have recently started a permanent full-time position. I started at my job last July, and have been working almost full time hours anyways since then. Since I took a permanent full time, I no longer get in-leau of benefits/vacation time on my paychecks, which translates to losing a few hundred dollars every pay period, but I have secure hours now!

Right now there’s is a hold on my student loan payments/interest due to covid, and these will restart in October. 

My debt currently looks like this: 

29k in student loans ($350 a month in payments starting again in October)

5.3k on line of credit (used it to purchase my vehicle, interest rate is 4.6% until Dec.2020 then increases to 7.5% I believe, monthly payments are $90)


I currently live rent free with my boyfriend (goal is to pay off my debt and then start contributing more, bless him), but I pay for half of utilities (approx $200-$300 a month). I also split groceries, as well as any household purchases etc.

So, realistically my monthly expenses all add up to about $815 ($1165 when student loan payments commence) plus depending on what we spend on groceries and household buys (still furnishing a house) maybe another $300-$500 a month. I make just over $33 dollars an hour. 


My bank account currently has just under 13k, and I am receiving a tax refund of almost 6k in the next few weeks. What would be the smartest thing to do with this money? 

My original goal was to throw down at least 15k on my student debt come October (before payments restart), but my boyfriend thinks I should just pay off the line of credit in full now. I might be able to swing both. I want to keep at least 5k in my account at all times for emergencies (especially if my parents need emergency support during covid).",finance

personalfinance,US - Collections Help - Read the Wiki and still don't quite think I am getting it.,"Hello everyone.  I posted a condensed version of this question in the daily thread, but I think it got buried.  I'll start with my situation.

I am 27, married, U.S.A - Idaho.  My wife and I made around $40k last year.  Our debt is finally under control, and by that I mean we are following the ""pay the highest interest rate first"" method while we pay minimums.  Nothing insane in terms of debt, around $3000 that we plan to have paid off by fall.

My situation is concerning my credit score, however.  I have about $5000 in collections, most from anywhere from 4-5 years ago, a couple more recent.  I read the wiki on collections and I don't think I am understanding a couple of things.

First, I don't understand why I need to send a debt validation letter after asking for a validation notice.  Wouldn't the validation notice fulfill whatever I'd be requesting by sending them a debt validation letter?  I guess what I'm asking is for someone to break this down to me even further, because it's confusing me.

Second, I know that the best course of action with collections accounts is to let them die, but my issue is that the debt keeps being sold and it pops up on my credit report as a month or two old when it's from 2015.  I want to let many of them fall off naturally, but won't the repurchasing of this debt prevent this from happening?

Third, is there a reason a phone call is the preferred method of initial communication rather than sending a letter via certified mail?

Thank you for being such an amazing community. I’ve been learning so much from this subreddit on how to navigate common and esoteric financial situations. Y’all rock! 

Financial Context: I am currently employed as an IT employee for a higher education institution and still receiving a steady income for the near future. I do not anticipate being furloughed or laid off any time soon (hopefully). I’ve graduated from graduate school years ago where I incurred around $33,000 of student debt. Since then, I’ve managed to pay off around $19,500. I’m trying to figure out how to manage the remainder of my debt, $13,500. The interest rate for the remaining debt is 6%. SIDE NOTE: The remaining debt is divided, not evenly but close enough, into two parts. The first part has an interest rate of 6% while the other has an interest rate of 5.8%. 

Situation: I am currently in a committed relationship and hoping to be engaged by this fall and married by late summer of next year. I’ve already started budgeting for engagement ring and wedding costs –although not much has been budgeted for it yet. I have an emergency fund of $9000.


Edit: Spelling errors

gaming,What do you guys thing about Dying Light,"I think the game is a little overrated and starts declining rapidly whenever you get guns, don’t get me wrong I like the game and the first couple of guns you get are pretty cool, but the main problem with the guns is whenever you fight other people with guns, I was never really having fun fighting someone with guns I also felt like the game would be a lot cooler with a block mechanic, I know the enemies can block but I’m pretty sure you can’t, I know you can dodge but I feel like being able to dodge isn’t the same as having an intense one on one fight where you block and attack and so on like a lot of other games like condemned. I do like how the human AI is programmed to be very cautious and not just run at you but I feel like it could have been better. Guns can also mess up the story, after the ambush Rais set for you at the museum is almost over and you have jade next to you, you could’ve shot Rais so many times, idk if this was for a certain level but I had run through the museum and had found at the very least 20 semi automatic assault rifles and picked up a few of them, even if he doesn’t have one, Crane has shown himself many times to be able to throw a weapon very accurately, speaking of Rais he is bad, he is a stereotypical villain who kills his own men, makes bad decisions like sending horde after horde of people with just machetes after you even though you’ve proven yourself to be able to fight them easily, the fight with Tahir could have been over with in five seconds of they had guns, and the end boss fight is a bunch of QTEs and bad mistakes from both sides. On one side Crane let’s Rais live even though he finished of Tahir instantly. Rais doesn’t bring many things to deal with Crane even though he has seen him fight many times he extremely underprepared and (correct me if I’m wrong) only brought a knife up there, even though he has tons and tons of guns that really could have helped he chooses not to bring them. I also felt like the game got kind of boring after a while and the survivor rank I felt was quite flawed, it was either the easiest to level up or the hardest, you could go into the stuffed turtle quarantine zone and get the first three DROPs and grind that for around an hour or two and have it leveled up all the way, alternatively you can find DROPs from crates and things like that and it will take you SIGNIFICANTLY longer to max out. Hope I didn’t skip anything now the positives.

stocks,More Market Downside Imminent. Warren Buffet was Correct to Assume a Large Cash Position.,"I lost out on a lot of opportunity by maintaining a large cash position so as to average down with the expectation of a bearish market and sell on the pops. I’m not worried. There is always an opportunity somewhere and I’m up 47% for the year. But the market is beyond reality at this point. I believe there is plenty of downside left. 

If the economy opens up too soon we’re going to see additional infections. That in it of itself isn’t a bad thing for markets. Indeed there is more profit to be made with COVID-19 running rampant with open markets than COVID-19 brought to a crawl on stagnant markets. 

But the market is way overvalued still. Stocks are propped up on artificial Fed pumping, beating earnings on exceptionally low analyst expectations, and despite market makers getting out to assume large cash positions (See Warren Buffet). 

Despite all of this COVID-19 is still creating record unemployment, lowering company revenues, killing the oil/travel sectors, increasing the costs of goods and services, and disrupting supply chains. Not to mention forever changing the way we interact with each other. To say this is baked in to market value is to be divorced from reality. These events are creating an economic downhill spiral that are in no way yet reflected in the stock market. 

I will continue to maintain a 3/4th cash position, search for one or two plays, average down if need be, and sell the market pops. The coronavirus recession is just getting started. I’m not going to be caught up in it when it slides and I’ll be ready to buy at discount prices. 

Of course I could be wrong. But with so many market makers getting burned by unexpected artificial market forces I’m thinking there will be further reckoning to experience before things get better. In short, though we are not paying the Piper now there must eventually come a time when the bill is due later.

* Total: 50.5k with a 4.64% weighted average interest rate

personalfinance,Auto Loan Denied After Leaving Dealership,"So my boyfriend recently bought a used car from some used dealership in Maryland. He filled out an application, showed his bank statements and that was about it, because he is self employed, he didn't really have much else to show.  The dealership approved him with a high interest rate, collected a $9,000 down-payment and we drove home to Virginia. Several weeks later (I guess just over a month maybe?), the dealership never forwarded any information about how to pay the monthly payments. Then, they called him and said he needs to show further proof of income or he basically has to bring the car back.  He definitely doesn't have further proof of income, we just make money doing real estate stuff and don't have normal jobs right now.  What can he do now?  The dealership manager and my boyfriend disputed about it on the phone and the manager basically threatened him and said if he wasn't more respectful that he'd call the cops and report the car as stolen (because my boyfriend had insinuated that the manager was a liar). He said that my boyfriend can return the car but that he wouldn't get back his full down-payment because there would be depreciation from the mileage.  The manager promised to try and call ""the bank"" (wouldn't tell him what bank) and try to straighten it out.  But we don't think it will be straightened out.  We tried contacting other financial institutions to get financing, but they denied him due to bad credit. He has money but his credit is a work in progress.  What can we do?  Can the dealership really not give the full down-payment back?  And can they report the car as stolen? How would someone go about fixing this issue?

TL;DR: Dealership must have  given ""conditional approval"" (maybe) for auto loan, we kept the car for a couple months, now they are saying financing isn't approved and we either need to show better proof of income or return the car back and lose part of the down-payment.  What do we do?",finance

personalfinance,Trying to figure out how to pay off my student loans,"First time posting here so if somethings not right, I apologize &amp; please be gentle. I will also be explaining things very generally since I myself am financially-challenged and don't know how to really explain the finer details.

For context, I am 31 years old and living in the US (CA specifically). I owe somewhere in the neighborhood of 50k and have been slowly chipping away at them for about 8 years now. In 2018, I was diagnosed with leukemia (almost a year past transplant now so for the most part all good) and while I was going thru everything, I defaulted and got placed into a rehabilitation program. Right when the Covid pandemic started, I supposedly got out of the rehabilitation program (will explain later) and my loan got transferred to another servicer contracted by the gov't. 

During this time, I also came into some money from a trust on my dad's side of the family and placed it into its own trust for medical reasons. What I got was enough to pay the debt off completely, but I wanted to see if I had any other options I could explore, so I reached out to an attorney friend of mine. Here is a general timeline of what he found out:  
\- initial contact to start negotiating  
\- after back &amp; forth with various offers, we get one that isn't terrible (about 38% of what I owed forgiven I think), which they say they will mail out a formal offer letter for deal effective until late July  
\- 2 weeks go by with no letter  
\- attorney reaches out again and finds out that my loan was transferred to another servicer, but has no idea who  
\- attorney contacts gov't &amp; finds new servicer  
\- attorney contacts new servicer and they have no idea who I am as they claim they don't have any info on me  
\- attorney calls 1st servicer to find out what happened and whether or not they will still honor the deal we made with them. they say no. according to them I finished the rehabilitation plan and also didn't finish the rehabilitation plan (neither of us knows what that means or how that works).

\*\*One side note I forgot to mention is that the 1st servicer records all of their phone calls (caller is notified via automated recording and again by agent before a word is spoken) so our initial deal with them is recorded and not something they can deny.\*\*

I just got done talking with my attorney friend and he essentially laid out 3 options for me:  
1) Contact the new servicer and see if they will negotiate with us.   
2) Try and get the 1st servicer (who I should've mentioned is also contracted by the gov't) or the gov't itself to honor the 1st deal we made. If they won't then send them a demand letter and threaten a lawsuit. My attorney friend is doing all of this by himself without a firm and depending on where we could sue, there would be more issues. This is the nuclear option.  
3) Go with the new servicer and just go on an income-based repayment (IBR) plan and wait to see how the HEROES Act plays out. This was his recommendation based on the info he has &amp; where we're at now.

My entire goal with all of this was to completely eliminate my debt as fast as I can but thanks to this trust's interest rate, I could go on the IBR plan and not be losing any money. While I really don't want to stay in debt for another 15-20 years, I do admit that at least for right now that is a legitimate option that I have to look at.

I can provide more info or clear things up if need be, but what would you do if you were in this situation? Is there maybe another idea that we haven't thought of that I should look at? Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,College Freshman with over 38k in federal loans,"I just finished my first year of college and am looking at $38,262 of debt for the first year. They're all subsided loans, but I checked out my Sallie Mae and saw that my earliest debt for first semester had already grown. My interest rates are also very high (lowest Sallie Mae being 8% for 13,600 loan and highest being 9.25% for 4,500). I plan on becoming an SLP and I know that the earning potential isn't super high. It also involves going to 4 additional years of grad school and spending additional time out of school working out licensing. 

All in all, my projections show that I'd have to take out over 260k in loans, and I'm really uncomfortable with that. I don't have many personal expenses (I spent less than $600 on personal things throughout the whole school year and most of it was on one time purchases like a laptop case), so I don't know where to make meaningful cuts for the next year so I don't have to take out so much in loans. I don't even know how a person would go about tackling a supposed 260k with an average interest rate of 8.58% while making the median for SLP which is 78K according to ASHA. 

Does anyone know how I might start now to mitigate some of the future debt I might incur? Are there any lucrative programs or scholarships that you have experience with?  Should I forget about being an SLP and try to do something else that won't sink me in so much debt?",finance
personalfinance,Should I refinance my loan?,"Hey guys, I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this.

For the past 8 months I've been saving up to get myself out of this auto loan that I currently have.

August of 2018 I walked of my local dealership with a 19k loan at 17% for 84 months. At the time, I really didn't know just how fucking terrible of a situation I just got myself in. The past 8 months I've been working a TON of overtime to tip the scales in my favor. As of today the pay off amount is $10000. I've been saving a LOT of money to try and ""recover"" from this and get myself out of debt with this loan. (More than 85% of my biweekly check goes to this loan, can't wait to pay it off)

I've managed to save $7400. My plan is to dump every penny of that into what's left of the 10k payoff amount. My question is after that is all said and done should I refinance my loan? With the ridiculously high interest rate and the other variables, my minimum monthly payment is roughly $380. With owing less than 3k on this loan, is it worth it to refinance?

I'd like to dial back a fair bit on how much money I'm pumping into this, maybe instead of 2k every month I'll do 1k. That'd mean I'd have 2.5 months or so left of this loan. Should I just keep the loan and not have another loan under my name?",finance

Bitcoin,"Interesting change allowing for ""Reciever pays"" TXN fees.","I'm excited about a [new change](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16851) in bitcoin-qt v20.0 (unreleased) allowing for the propagation of zero fee (0 sat/b) TXNs.  Previously this was nerfed by the `minRelayTxFee` requirement.  This would allow the receiver to set the fees (indirectly) by simply chaining a CPFP TXN to the end of it.  Might work something like this.

1. You place a bet at a BTC betting site.
2. If you win, the payout is a raw TXN hex string.
3. You broadcast the raw TXN along with a second ""child"" that pays the fee.
4. Betting site is now no longer paying fees on winning bets.

Could offer a lot of solutions to exchanges that require a ""withdraw fee"" claiming that they need to pay the miners.  This would allow users to request a zero-fee raw-hex withdraw transaction allowing the user to pay the fees themselves.

For the more technical user this would offer up a lot of neat possiblities.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Paying off a charged off loan that a third party company owns,"A little embarrassing for me to post but its a topic I could definitely could use help for. Around the end of college, 2016, I pulled out a loan for a very low interest rate and refinanced some of my private loans with higher interest. I wasnt able to find a decent job after college for the first year so I just was able to get by with side gigs. I ended up defaulting on the loan and the loan seemed to have been sold off to Sarma, a debt collections agency. The total is roughly 20,000 but they sent me letters to settle for half. I defaulted back in 2018.  Today, I purchased a car, with a cosigner because now I have a stable job with fairly decent income but that, now, third party loan came back to haunt me. I prioritized other student loans and paid those off first, as I did not default on them at the time. This is the only loan I have left under my account. It was embarrassing to have that loan come up. Im trying to fix my credit and the only reasonable option I can think of is settling. Ive researched and ive thought about getting some consulting advice but I wasnt too sure. Is the settlement price something that is not negotiable? Is there a way to remove the damage on my credit report? Is the debt often something a third can prove? I feel like I have a moral obligation to at least try to settle but any advice would be helpful. I understand that the total sum is my responsibility but any help would be appreciated. Some things I did find out:

1. On the phone, request a physical copy of the agreed upon amount and on time payment. 
2. Send a physical cashiers check instead of account information. 
3. Have confirmation of the approved payment, in case Sarma sells off the remaining debt so that other third parties can come for me.

I am looking to put a down payment on a house for 2021. I have a large amount of stock (around $800K) but am looking to buy a house around the $300-500K range. I've done some of the calculations, and it isn't in my best interest to cash out the value of the property in stock because of tax implications.

One thought is to liquidate enough stock to fulfill the 20% down payment, take a mortgage out on the balance, and commit the balance towards investment. That's what I'm trying to model with the spreadsheet above. It seems like my model is telling me that the more I borrow, the more I will profit. I'm not sure if my model is correct:

* The interest rate isn't consistent. Stocks are volatile so using FV isn't the most accurate.
* Only dividend stocks provide the compound interest like effect via DRIP. How would I replicate this with stocks or an ETF that doesn't pay out dividends.

I don't need exact numbers, just something good enough to estimate what type of investment vehicle I should look to invest in. Obviously, for a mortgage the timeline is 15 to 30 years (I'm looking at a 15 year mortgage), so I'm pretty confident that this would work since it's a relatively long-term investment.

Living at home is driving me nuts and I’m stuck between deciding if I should continue to get myself in a better spot financially or move out/have more freedom and make smaller loan payments. 

My minimum monthly payment is $350, but My payments are averaging out to $1,500/mo. I’m in a LCOL area but I currently make $20/hr., so moving out will require me to make the minimum payment for the time being, unless refinancing would be beneficial. 

I currently have $11k in savings. I’ve been saving up a bit in case I do decide to move out but, at the same time, I could make a ~$8k payment right now and knock two more years worth of payments on the loan.

The next suggestion was that I have to go to the IRS website and get the AGI that's on my return transcript. To do this I had to make an IRS account. The only item I have, that qualifies for one of the requirements of making an account, is my credit card. The IRS website told me that my information does not match their records; I could not make an account.

The remedy to this, I was told, was I had to get my transcript by mail, which I could do by calling the IRS phone number. I called the IRS phone number.

# **Market could get a boost as states reopen, but new economic data will show just how bad things got during shutdowns  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/22/market-could-get-a-boost-as-states-reopen-but-new-economic-data-will-show-just-how-bad-things-got-during-shutdowns.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks are likely to hang on every medical development and the progress of state reopenings, but there will also be some key economic data in the coming week that should provide a glimpse into the depths of the state shutdowns.
*****
&gt; The Fed’s beige book of economic activity is released Wednesday afternoon. There is also April manufacturing data in durable goods Thursday and April’s consumer income and spending data Friday. While that should provide an interesting view of how sluggish activity became, the market is expected to focus more on May consumer confidence Tuesday and consumer sentiment Friday.
*****
&gt; “The backward looking data is not going to get any attention paid to it,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. “It’s going to be terrible, and that’s not going to be a surprise. Confidence has held up pretty well, all things considered. It’s the PPP and unemployment benefits. People who get some support for income seem to be pretty confident.” Congress is expected to take up changes to the Paycheck Protection Program for small business when it returns June 1.
*****
&gt; April’s economic data is expected to be about the worst of the recession, since most state shutdowns extended through a good part of the month, ahead of May reopenings. First quarter gross domestic product is expected to have declined by 4.8% when a second reading is released Wednesday, but for the second quarter, GDP is expected to decline by a median 33.1%, according to CNBC/Moody’s Analytics Rapid Update, a survey of economists.
*****
&gt; Stocks gained in the past week, though rising tensions between the U.S. and China weighed on the market Thursday and Friday and could become a bigger headwind.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was heading for a weekly gain of 3%, its second weekly gain in three. A big catalyst came Monday, when Moderna disclosed positive data from a small group of patients in an early trial, but it was a wild week of trading for the company’s stock as doubts arose about its limited results. On Friday, however, White House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said the data showed promise and he was cautiously optimistic a vaccine would be developed.
*****
&gt; Astra Zeneca’s vaccine effort got a boost this week when it received $1 billion from the U.S. Health Department’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to develop a coronavirus vaccine from the University of Oxford.
*****
&gt; With investors focused on vaccines and state reopenings, market winners were the more volatile Russell 2000, up 7.8% for the week and the Dow Transports, up nearly 9.1% as airlines and other reopening stocks rallied. Airlines were up nearly 20% on the week. After a batch of earnings reports, retailers were also higher on the week, with the SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF up 6% for the week.
*****
&gt; Retailers are again among the companies reporting earnings in the week ahead, as the first quarter reporting season winds down. Costco, Nordstrom, Ulta Beauty and Burlington Stores are some of the names reporting.
*****
&gt; Keon said he is watching the economic reopenings and says the success really depends on the behavior of individuals, and whether there’s another spike in infections.
*****
&gt; “People are still scared,” he said. “It’s the personal behavior that’s going to make a difference to economic behavior. We’ll get back to some semblance of normal. It’s going to take awhile for people to feel more confident.”
*****
&gt; He expects to see a rebound of economic activity in the second half of the year, but not a V-shaped recovery.
*****
&gt; “By the end of the year, if we don’t get a vaccine, we will have made a lot of progress on a vaccine. I’m still cautiously optimistic that the market can hang in, and maybe end the year a little bit higher,” he said.
*****
&gt; One big reopening in the week ahead will be on Tuesday when the iconic NYSE trading floor reopens.

# Weekly Market Performance – May 22, 2020: Stocks Solid in the Midst of Health and Political Challenges

&gt; # Equities

&gt; US equities delivered solid returns this week. With three hours to go in the week, all three markets were up almost 3% for the week, with the best performer, once again, the technology-heavy Nasdaq. The small cap Russell 2000 Index enjoyed an impressive rally, with the index returning over 9% for the week. The mid-cap S&amp;P 400 Index also had a solid showing, returning almost 9%.

&gt; Amid ongoing COVID-19 disruptions, rising unemployment, and risks associated with reopening the economy, US stocks continued to rebound. The rally was supported by all 50 states easing restrictions, based on improving COIVD-19 trends. Several timely indicators have pointed to a pickup in economic activity, including higher credit and debit card spending and an increase in travelers based on TSA data. Second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) could contract as much as 30% annualized, but global progress in reopening economies combined with massive stimulus measures point to a potentially strong rebound in the third and fourth quarters.

&gt; “The S&amp;P 500 just had the second-best 40-day rally ever, with only the returns off the March 2009 lows better,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Near-term, we have some concerns of a well-deserved pullback, but historically, these huge moves have tended to resolve much higher over the ensuing 6- and 12-month periods.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.22.20-wmp.jpg?ssl=1))**

&gt; In a change of pace, industrials were the top-performing sector for the week, followed by the energy sector. The worst-performing sectors were healthcare and consumer staples, and they posted returns that were slightly negative for the week. Looking at style, large cap value stocks edged out large cap growth for the week.

# Leading Indicators Signal Potential Bottom

&gt; Leading economic indicators are signaling that the pace of economic deterioration may be slowing. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI), a composite of leading data series, fell 4.4% month over month in April. While this is an undeniably abysmal reading, it is an improvement from the -7.4% in March.

&gt; ”The monthly LEI change tends to bottom early in a recession, and sometimes even before a recession’s official start,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Stocks are forward looking, so if investors feel confident that the economic damage will not accelerate from here, they may be more willing to put capital to work. We think today’s LEI number largely confirms April’s strong moves in the equity markets.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Economic-news-5.22.20.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The performance of the 10 underlying components in the LEI does indicate some disconnect between financial markets and the real economy. The two largest positive contributors to the headline LEI number this month were stock prices and the interest rate spread, which were buoyed by a swift and robust monetary and fiscal stimulus. Meanwhile, data series related to manufacturing, unemployment, and construction hurt the index, a reflection of the damage done to the parts of the economy in which workers are unable to perform their jobs remotely.

&gt; As local economies begin to reopen, we look for the industries disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 virus to begin to rebound. While this will likely be a bumpy process, progress will likely become evident in future LEI releases and confirm that the worst of the economic declines are behind us. We think this should pave the way for further equity gains over a long-term horizon.

*****

# What Happens When The Bear Ends?

&gt; The incredible rally off the March 23 lows continues for equities, with the S&amp;P 500 Index now up more than 32% in 40 trading days. As impressive as the rally has been, we do have some near-term concerns, as we discussed in Downside Risk Remains. Higher valuations, US-/China relations, weakening technicals, and the historically troublesome summer months all could play a part in potential weakness after the record run.

&gt; “In 40 trading days, the S&amp;P 500 gained 32%, which is second only to the 40 days off the March 2009 lows,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Looking back at history shows that after the initial surge off of bear lows, stocks tend to correct about 10%, which is something we could see this time around.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 rallied nearly 21% in 30 days after all major bear markets. But once those initial rallies ended, there was a correction of more than 10% on average. Bottoms are a process, and as impressive as this run has been, we think the odds are quite high for some type of pullback or correction over the coming months. Thanks to our friends at Strategas Research Partners for the data points below.

# Bottom Line EPS Beat Rate Below Average

&gt; The first quarter earnings reporting period unofficially came to an end earlier this week, and it should be considered quite a success given how well the equity market performed during this time period. Since earnings season began on April 13th, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has gained more than 5%. Of course, the market's performance over the last month or so has much more to do with expectations on re-opening than how companies reported in Q1, but all things considered, the sky didn't fall when it came to earnings results.

&gt; In terms of how actual earnings reports came in versus analyst expectations this past earnings season, the trend wasn't all that rosy. We've been tracking ""beat rates"" for more than a decade, which measure the percentage of companies reporting stronger than expected EPS and sales numbers (relative to consensus analyst estimates). Our main ""beat rate"" trackers show beat rates on a rolling 3-month basis -- meaning it looks at all companies that have reported earnings over the last three months and tells you what percentage of them beat analyst estimates.

&gt; Below is a snapshot of both bottom-line EPS and top-line sales beat rates over the last five years as displayed on our website at our ""Earnings Explorer"" page. Notably, bottom-line EPS beat rates have been weakening quite dramatically over the last couple of months since the COVID crisis began. Just this week, the 3-month rolling EPS beat rate dipped below its long-term average of 59.37% dating back to the year 2000.

&gt; On the other hand, top-line sales beat rates haven't taken quite the hit yet. The current sales beat rate stands at 60.67%. While sales on an absolute basis fell dramatically at the end of Q1, the fact that sales beat rates haven't fallen dramatically means companies have at least managed to keep up with analyst expectations. A very weak sales beat rate would have meant companies were reporting numbers even weaker than already dour analyst expectations.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/epsbeats.png))**

&gt; We also have a forward guidance tracker that measures the percentage of companies raising guidance versus the percentage of companies lowering guidance. When this reading turns negative, it means more companies have lowered guidance than raised guidance over the last three months. As shown below, right now our guidance spread stands at -16.08 percentage points, which is the weakest reading we've seen since early 2016.

&gt; One thing we've seen since the COVID crisis began is that more and more companies have withdrawn guidance altogether. It's hard to blame them. The ones that have issued guidance have mostly lowered expectations. While this paints a bleak picture for the future, if you look at this from a ""glass half full"" perspective, it actually leaves much more room for positive surprises down the road.

# S&amp;P 500 Down Five Straight Day After Memorial Day

&gt; Our office will be closed for observance of Memorial Day on Monday, May 25. U.S stock and bond markets will also be closed. As you spend some quality time off please consider taking time to commemorate those who have paid the ultimate price while serving in the U.S. military. Additionally, consider taking a moment to acknowledge first responders, nurses, doctors, law enforcement, firefighters, essential workers, scientists and everyone else that has tirelessly worked and sacrificed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

&gt; For decades the Stock Trader’s Almanac has been tracking and monitoring the market’s performance around holidays. The trading day after Memorial Day has a mixed record going back to 1971. Both S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have declined more often than risen on the day, but average performance is still modestly positive. Since 1986, the frequency of gains has improved, and average performance has also risen however, over the last five years S&amp;P 500 has declined. The second trading day after Memorial Day has more advances than declines, but average performance is negative for NASDAQ. The third day after appears to have the best long- and short-term record combined with solid average performance.

# Election-Year June: Candidate Clarity Boosts Performance

&gt; June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 49 years as a rule ranking seventh with a 0.8% average gain, up 27 of 49 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best Eight Months” which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking tenth, but essentially flat (0.1% average gain). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.8% in the month since 1979.

&gt; In election years since 1950, June’s performance improves notably. June is the #5 DJIA month in election years averaging a 0.9% gain with a record of twelve advances in seventeen years. For S&amp;P 500, June is #2 with an average gain of 1.3% (14-3 record). Election-year June ranks #4 for NASDAQ and Russell 2000 with average gains of 1.6% and 1.4% respectively. This performance improvement is most likely the result of presidential candidate field being sufficiently narrowed, and the ultimate nominees being identified.

personalfinance,Saving levels - when to start letting yourself enjoy your money,"So I grew up in a fairly poor family. Seems that every penny was pushed into sending myself and sister through private schooling so never had a flashy life.

A couple of years back I landed an amazing job and my salary increased significantly. I probably have about 15k in a UK ""help to buy ISA"" 20k in a wealthify ambitious fund and 20k in a standard bugger all interest rate savings account.

At the start of the month I throw about 2/3 of my salary into the savings account because I don't want to spend it. 

I just find myself always thinking.. no you shouldn't get that nice think for yourself.. wait until you reach 5-10-15-20k.... In your easy access account.

I'm thinking I should have a system where as my net wealth increases I should have an increasing % of my salary that's should be like my ""go nuts"" allowance.

personalfinance,Advice needed! Where should I put 15k that I want to be fairly accessible in the next couple years? High yield savings? CD ladder? The market? ...,So I have around 15-20 k in my account that I eventually want to use as a down payment on a house. Since the fed lowered rates savings accounts and cds hardly pay much interest. The market seems too volatile- Any other ideas out there? Am I missing something?,finance
financialindependence,More on the 4% rule,"I learned a few things while doing my own montecarlo modeling this morning. Here are the highlights:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The 4% rule is actually pretty safe (95%+), over a 60-year time-frame. I modeled a 100% stock portfolio (not exactly my situation, but I've been less interested in bonds given interest rates). I can get to a 100% safety over 60-year horizon if I model a variable SWR, such that I can go to 60% of projected spend in a year where market drops a ton. 
2. The key assumption is average future returns over the next 60-year horizon. The historic S&amp;P average is around 12%. People that I respect (e.g. Bogle) tend to suggest lower returns in the future (10-20 year timeframe, given current valuations and expected earnings growth and dividends - you know, fundamentals stuff). If I put in an expected 9% return instead of 12%, the modeled safety is around 95%. If I take it to 5% expected returns - it drops to 50% safety (meaning I run I out of money half the time)! I can help a little by having a 5-year cash cushion (in addition to variable SWR - similar to a bond-tent), but that generally only delays the inevitable by a few years.

personalfinance,5 months worth of expenses summarized,"My new year's resolution was to document every single purchase for 2020. So far here's what I have, dates are from Dec 30 2019 (date of paycheck) to May 23 2020.   
Background info: 25, single female, living in a large city. No pets, no children.   
12 months ago I was roughly $20,000 in debt, lived in a one-bedroom apartment that cost almost 2 grand a month, and was spending recklessly. I was making good money, but had nothing in savings and was only contributing $75 a paycheck to retirement. 

In an effort to reduce my monthly expenses, I cancelled my lease and rented a bedroom in a house with 2 other roommates. This freed up over $1,100 in monthly expenses, allowing me to increase my retirement savings, open an IRA, aggressively pay down debt, and actually contribute to a savings account. I also began a very profitable Poshmark account selling items in my closet that I won't miss.  
Today, I have nearly halved my debt. My car and student loan debt are paid off. I currently have $1,000 remaining in credit card debt and $9,450 in personal loan debt, both at very low interest rates. 

It's been incredibly eye opening to document every purchase. I think twice now about everything I spend.

Yes, I still splurge on some things, but that is only after contributing to my retirement accounts/savings/investments and paying off my bills.

I use [personalcapital.com](https://personalcapital.com) and a homemade spreadsheet to track expenses.

personalfinance,Possibly dumb question: Figuring out accelerated loan payment amounts for a mortgage,"Hey all! We are only a few years into a 30-year mortgage but what with interest rates being so low we're being bombarded with offers to refi to get a lower rate. I am trying to do the math to figure out if this would be worth our while. The trick is that the payments for a 15-year are a bit more than I'd want to pay, but I don't want to actually extend the payment period; I'm trying to figure out how much I would need to pay per month in order to, for instance, pay off a new 30 year mortgage in 26 years. Is there a simple formula to this? And if so, what plugs into said formula: the interest rates they're quoting me or the APR? I know there plenty of ""loan calculators"" out there but I'm not sure if they're doing exactly what I want and anyway I'd like to know the math that's going on behind the scenes.",finance

personalfinance,Pay down student loans vs invest,"Hi All,

The better three-quarters and I are finally on the upward swing after 4 years of living on a grad student + medical resident salary. Current situation:

\~2 months cash reserves (working up to 3-6)

\~$250k student debt (Yay med school)

Mortgage with \~$2500 monthly payment (15 year fixed at 3.25%)

\~$3-5000 left over per month after paying necessary expenses. This will go up in \~2 months after we pay off the last of the personal loan we took out to put a new roof on the house (Realtor told us it was brand new! Inspector said it had \~2 years left. Try 2 months. Grr.)

We're shopping around for financial advisor help, I have two guys competing at the moment. Likely going to drop the one because he's commission based. The other is fee-based and while I would prefer fee-only, He comes with good references from people I trust. Still contemplating going fee-only. I want an advisor because I'm terrible at this stuff and need the accountability. I'm good at the numbers. But it's obvious at this point that I'll happily ignore them for years as long as the bills get paid. My wife will be very much less stressed about finances if we stop doing that, which will in turn let me play more stress free with the spending money. Win win.

Anyway. One of the advisors (guess which!) recommended splitting our excess and dedicating a good portion of it to investments vs quick debt paydown. He did some math comparing earnings on an investment to interest paid on a loan that looked really lopsided in favor of investing. I'm not so sure. I can make the math look good either way by tweaking the payoff vs investment ratio, the investment interest rate, etc.

Is this a common trick those guys use to get you to buy products? Is there a student loan interest rate below which paying the minimum and investing is a ""no-brainer"" or vise versa? There's a certain mental freedom that comes with the idea of being debt free, but at the end of the day debt payoff of this scale is a long haul. If doing a bit of investing vs just building the emergency fund and then dumping literally everything into the loans puts us in a better place in 5 or 10 years I'm all for it.",finance

personalfinance,I'm (24) in need of some money/schooling/life advice!,"I  am married and am wanting to go back to college. I mistakenly went to an unaccredited private college at my parents recommendation for three years when I didn't really know what I wanted to really do in life. I was one year from graduation and realized my unaccredited B.S. in Criminal Justice wouldn't get me into the IT/Tech jobs that I was interested in.

I left to go to a local community college and enrolled in their IT/Networking major, attended 2 semesters after having 0 credits transfer (so Junior-&gt;Freshman).

I had to move away though, but my work offered a tuition reimbursement through an online college. This was a big transition period in my life and some tragedy happens during my first semester. I was 3.0-3.5GPA for the first two colleges, but I failed out on my third college and lost federal aid. Coincidentally, I dropped out.

I am feeling stuck in my current retail situation. My local community college now is ~$2,000 for a 15 credit semester. I plan to go for the Network Administrator Cert, which can then build onto the AAS Networking Specialist. 

Should I use student loans to pay for this? My wife nets ~$3,100/mo net roughly ~$1,400/mo (she also has a degree.)

$4,500 combined income.
$1,400 rent.
$300 car payment.
$160 car insurance.
$200 internet/phone.
$150 credit card payment.
$500 groceries.
$150 on the dogs.
$100 power.
$60 gyms.
$150 Uber/Lyft (we share a car and work schedule sucks.)
$100 dining out.

So spending roughly $3500 after some miscellaneous spending and the leftovers go into some savings and upping the debt payments on car and credit card.

Also roughly $2500 in savings but we may be needing that for a down payment on a new apartment in a few months. 

Would I be better off grinding and saving to pay cash as I attend? Or should I opt for a student loan and work on getting the degree sooner/paying it off later?

personalfinance,Pay off student loan or go a different route?,"On a throwaway account, but my father recently passed away and left my sister and I with about a 200k inheritance each. Around 100k is liquid from bank accounts + life insurance policy, and another 100k will be from a 401k. I need some advice.

Current Stats:

* 28 years old
* Income: 97K in Medium-HCOL area (Connecticut)
* Private Student Loan: 90K @ 4.6%
* Federal Student Loan: 20K currently @ 0% but normally ranges up to 4.55% IIRC
* Car Loan: 7.7K @ 5.29%
* 401K: Contribute 6% no match
* My partner has the mortgage on the house we live in, I contribute $1000 into the house account but that mainly goes to utilities/internet/buffer

Tentative Plan:

1. Consult CPA on tax repercussions of inherited 401k - I'm hoping to not have to take it as a lump sum, and will keep it in a HYSA until I understand how to invest it. 
2. Pay off private student loan and car loan (frees up \~1100 of my monthly cash flow)
3. Bump up 401K contributions to 10%
4. Pay off federal student loan within 2 years (considering the 0% interest rate *could* be extended?)
5. I would also like to help my partner pay off his debt more aggressively. He has \~20K in credit card debt and \~60K in student loans and makes \~150k a year. I would like to use my freed up cash flow to contribute more towards the mortgage/house expenses so he can focus on debt. We would like to have a baby within 1.5-2 years (and plan on getting legally married) and I would like to have his credit card debt paid off before the baby. I think we can pay off his student loans within 5 years, if not sooner.

Would anyone do anything differently? I think it is a no brainer to free myself from the shackles of student loan debt, but I am curious.",finance

personalfinance,HSA in California,"Hello all! I am looking for some advice for girlfriend and her current situation. A little about her finances... She is 30 years old.

Current income - $136,500

Debt - $73,000 in student loans recent refinanced to an interest rate of 3.9% (Private loan). She pays $1000 a month on this however her minimum is closer to around $700.

Retirement - Contributes 5% to her 401k and her work contributes 4%. The present value of her 401k is $11,000. She also currently maxes out her Roth at $6,000 a year with the present value of her Roth at $23,000. She will be doing the backdoor Roth this year.  Her allocation is 100% stocks in her Roth and HSA right now. We both got a late start on retirement savings due to our schooling and are really trying to buckle down and get our finances in order.

Emergency fund - $10,000 in a high yield saving account with Goldman Sachs 1.3% interest.

She signed up for an HSA through her work and is on track to contribute $3,500 this year. Her account is with HSA bank and she moves the funds to TDameritrade where she can invest in stocks, ETF, Mutual funds etc... Currently has the money in two ETFs. She is healthy and her only medical expense are yearly check ups. 

Unfortunately, we were both unaware that California does not recognize HSA's. I understand that when she contributes she will still get a federal tax break not a state. It is my also understanding that she will owe taxes on any dividends or capital gains. However, she does not plan on selling any of these assets anytime soon. She is curious if she would be better off increasing her 401k contribution and decreasing her HSA contribution given this tax situation. Of note her 401k is through John Hancock and her she is currently in JFIVX (expense ratio .04) and VOT (Expense ratio 0.13). These were the best funds we felt with lowest expense ratios. She previously was in a John Hancock 2055 target with 100% of her contribution but her new contribution is now only 15% as she wanted to move into the above funds. 

Any advice would be appreciated on if she should continue to max at her HSA or put that money to her 401k. She does really like the idea of  having an account for medical expenses, so even if it may not be the best tax wise that will also weigh into her decision. We also will probably move out of California in 5 years but I am getting loan repayment through my work so we are staying put for the time being.

personalfinance,Using a 2nd mortgage from a relative to pay for downpayment,"Hi, I am a mother and I'm trying to convince my daughter (only 23 years old) that it is a bad decision for my daughter and her boyfriend to purchase an apartment with their current financial situation and I'm worried to death but I just can't seem to get through to her.

&amp;#x200B;

Property price, $500000

25% down = 125000

The interest for the mortgaged amount is at 4.75% ARM (Due to bad credit score from her boyfriend, my daughter is in the 7xx)

Both my daughter and her boyfriend have nothing saved up for downpayment, as a result they've convinced a relative from the guy's side to take out a second mortgage loan to lend them as downpayment.

2nd mortgage loan = 170,000 to cover 25% down and other fees and furniture. This loan has an interest rate of 9.0%

&amp;#x200B;

They have an after tax income combined, 10000 per month.

As they each already have a car payment, so I had her list out all the expenses and food etc.

The expense each month is 8500. (This includes $1275 interest to the 170,000 loan at 9.0%, but does not include any repayment to the principle on the 170,000 loan)

&amp;#x200B;

So their net positive monthly income is 1500.

&amp;#x200B;

Like, I'm not sure how they can ever repay the 170,000 2nd mortgage loan at 9.0%.

Her reply to me was, the apartment would raise for sure and in a few years they could re-finance it and some how repay the 170,000. 

I'm trying to tell her to rent if she wants, but she thinks renting would cost her same amount of money anyways, so why throw money away that way.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really skeptical of them being able to handle this as her bf is the type of people who overspends and actually his networth right now is -5700. (He owes credit card debt...) and they think this is perfectly fine ?!

They think I am old schooled and worry too much. (I already told them lots of What Ifs like, what if either of them lose their jobs due to bad economy, what if they break up\])

They think everybody use debt to buy properties in Vancouver, or else there are no way they could have saved enough money

I personally don't think it is too late for them to start saving up for downpayment. They both are still living at home with parents. No one is kicking them out. 

&amp;#x200B;

They said they will just sell the place if things don't work out and they are assuming the property will go up 2-3% per year so even if they end up breaking up and having to sell the place in a few years they will still gain something or break even worse case scenerio.",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage refinance DTI: monthly or overall,"I have a $200k home with a $160k outstanding mortgage at 4.225% that I’ve been looking to refinance. I’ve been getting rate offers in the low 3% range, but I’ve been waiting to reach 20% equity to avoid PMI. 

Now, my only barrier is my student loan debt. I’m in healthcare so my student loans are currently $300k while my income is approximately $150k per year. I have been working for a non-profit, so my loans will be forgiven in about 5 more years. 

I’m currently on income-based repayment. So my monthly gross income is about $12k and my monthly student loan payment is $600. So my monthly DTI ratio is pretty low, but my overall DTI ratio is pretty high. 

So my question is, when considering DTI, do banks look at monthly DTI or do they consider the whole DTI? 

The reason I ask is because when I got my mortgage a few years ago, it was through a healthcare mortgage program so I got a slightly higher interest rate but did not have to PMI and they did not consider my student loan debt, allowing me to get a mortgage at that time.",finance

personalfinance,"Big financial decision about buying vacation rental, I hope you can help","My wife and I are struggling to make a decision.

We have about $120,000 equity in our house. We have money in an investment account but I don't want to drain that to buy the new property. Our investment account has been returning \~6.5% and the current mortgage has a 3.25% interest rate. We shopped around and found that we can get a mortgage at 3% (thanks covid).

personalfinance,Best way to take over my grandfather's auto loan,"My grandparents have finally made the decision to reduce down to one vehicle. The lease was up at the end of this month on one of the vehicles Before turning it in, he offered it to me to buy since he is aware of my need for a new vehicle (I drive a compact truck and we just had a baby). The vehicle is only a couple years old and in immaculate condition, hardly driven (very low miles), so I told him I was interested but due to the current times (I'm furloughed) I wouldn't be able to secure a loan.

Long story short, he made the generous decision of purchasing (via financing) the vehicle on the terms that I take over the loan once I am back on my feet (and make the monthly payments to him in the meantime). This is where my question comes in, what is the best way to do this?

* The new car loan is $18,000 and payments aren't due until I'm supposed to be back to work in July.
* I currently own the truck I mentioned, KBB values it at $9,500 in good condition and I'm getting offers for $7,000 which I may take.
* I have another $5,000 in savings that I am willing to throw at this loan if it helps
* Credit score is just under 700 and I have some CC debt &lt;$5,000

Let's say I come up with $13,000 after selling my truck and combining my savings. Is it just as easy as contacting a credit union and asking about a loan and using some or all of the $13k as down payment (in hopes for a low interest rate/payment)?

personalfinance,Debt or Down Payment?,"Hi all - I could use some unbiased 3rd party perspective here. I recently got a promotion at work and am making making $90k with a 7% bonus. I have $40k at my disposable in savings. 

I currently max my Roth and contribute to the match for my 401k. I have about $25k in Student Loans and $22k in a 5 year auto loan ($820 a month in debt). Avg interest rate is 4.15% or less. 

I’ve been considering buying a home but am sort of waiting out the pandemic to see what nets out, and in addition I think in the coming months we could see house prices cut with a second CoVid wave as the economy faces more pressure. Right now the housing market still is crazy hot in Cleveland because of low interest rates.

I only pay $825 in rent, with a flexible lease, and live frugally so I can save close to $2000 a month. Should I be looking to save aggressively for a down payment or paying down the auto loan to free up debt? Both have their merits but I can’t seem decide. I don’t love the idea is splitting towards both, as it seems like less progress is being made.

personalfinance,"Refinancing anyway, should I cash out for home improvements?","I'm planning to refinance my home. My situation is a bit unconventional.

When I purchased the home in 2012, I was pre-approved and had a deal arranged. For whatever reason (first home, light credit, crappy bank), the bank kept delaying, and the seller was going to back out. A date was finally set. And on that date, the home found itself in direct path of Hurricane Sandy. The home was undamaged, but my lender backed out pending further inspections; it was the last straw for the seller. A family member offered enough cash to save the deal. I accepted, bought the home outright, then took out home equity to pay back the private loan. The purchase price was 189k USD; it was a 20 year loan for 151k USD at 4.9%.

Now that I have excellent credit, I want to lower my interest rate. My loan balance is 108k, and my home has increased in value slightly, to around 202k.

I've been quoted 2.875% from Quicken, with $4,400 closing costs for a 15 year loan. It seems worthwhile, but I'm debating whether to take cash out. I want to make improvements to my home. It's not in bad shape, but it can use updating. Vinyl siding, central ac; probaly around 10k.

stocks,An Investors Guide to CoVID-19,"Hello All,

I noticed that there's quite a few new redditors / investor / traders. Let set some stuff straight. Plz excuse the shorthand and errors in my text.

Introduction: Basically throw most things you know outta the window. This is a special time and we play by special rules. These are by no means 100% and I take no liability, just some observations I made within the past 3 months or so, basically when the pandemic started.

1. Throw almost everything you know about technicals and fundamentals out the window.
PE, CAGR, Net Income, PC, PB, technicals. None of that shit matters.

2. Brings us to point 2, here's what matters. FED speeches, Fauci, Oil prices, Trump cheerleading (kinda), vaccine updates, NEWS DEVELOPEMENTS.

3. Earnings: If company is benefiting from covid and analyst estimates are bullish. Don't touch it most likely it won't budge or go down the next day. If stocks are beaten down and analyst estimates are bearish, buy in or wait. Basically all good news is priced in. So if earnings are less bad then expected stocks go up. If as bad or worse stocks still go up. Idk why just trust the numbers.

4. Gobble shit up with the future in mind!! Look I'm bullish I know the vaccine is bound to happen. If it doesn't humanity is fucked anyway and money is gonna be useless so meh. Second wave theory is legit, but there is no way in hell Trump gonna close everything down again. Or Bitch McConnell won't let it happen. Deep down it sucks yea, but we just here to trade stocks.

5. Play around COVID! Buy solid COVID winners ie MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, NFLX, TQQQ. And recovery winners think shit that's gonna sky rocket when vaccine news is out: RCL, NCHL, QSR, UBER, DIS, BA?, LUV, DAL. Basically shits that been beaten to a pulp but will rebound very very quickly once vaccine is out.

btc,"The attempted come back of CoinEx, China's forked-Bitcoin exchange","*Written by Shuyao Kong*

*Published by* [*decrypt.co*](https://decrypt.co)

**An interview with Haipo Yang, a crypto OG who’s trying to reposition his Bitcoin Cash-based CoinEx exchange. And more, in this week’s da bing.**

https://preview.redd.it/h5f3i3lldv051.jpg?width=3200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09b8696303ae5c6170753cc438929ebe520d4605

**Haipo Yang**, founder of [ViaBTC](https://www.viabtc.com/?lang=en_US), one of the largest mining pools in the world, and [CoinEx](https://www.coinex.com/?lang=en_US), a crypto exchange known for its focus on Bitcoin Cash-based trading, is a well-known but relatively quiet character in China’s crypto circle. Typically, Yang doesn’t talk that much about his journey launching the mining pool, nor about CoinEx, which launched in December 2017.

And he almost never speaks about his fervent support for [BCH](https://decrypt.co/resources/bitcoin-cash), a hard fork of Bitcoin, and his now even more enthusiastic belief in BSV.

Yet that’s changing of late. Yang has been more active in recent months, participating in interviews about CoinEx and [tweeting more frequently](https://hk.weibo.com/user/yhaiyang) on Weibo, China’s Twitter. He’s been making controversial statements predicting the death of BTC, while supporting BCH and BSV on social media.

Recently, Yang told me that as a developer rather than a business person, he’s never been comfortable speaking in public. However he’s making an effort now to help publicize his renovation of CoinEx. So, for this week’s *da bing*, I decided to chat with him and get a peek into the mind of a veteran crypto entrepreneur who’s trying to make a personal, as well as a platform, comeback.

# CoinEx’s golden opportunity

The first hard fork of Bitcoin occurred in August, 2017 and created a new cryptocurrency called Bitcoin Cash. The fork was prompted by partisans, including Yang, who wanted bigger block sizes on the blockchain — the basic idea was that bigger blocks would enable more transactions per second and make Bitcoin Cash something people would actually use to buy things, rather than Bitcoin’s more commonly perceived use as a store of value.

Yang added a tremendous amount of value to the mining scene in China. As a technical founder with has years of experience in big tech firms such as Tencent, Yang is proud of his #buidl skills. He developed most of the code in the early days of VicBTC, which became one of the biggest mining pools to this day.

Not satisfied with owning just a mining pool,Yang conceived of CoinEx, which was born in December of that year, specifically to carry on the mission of the newly forked Bitcoin Cash blockchain. As he got swept up in Bitcoin Cash enthusiasm, he even said that “[BCH *is* bitcoin](https://news.bitcoin.com/an-interview-with-viabtc-founder-yang-haipo/).”

CoinEx’s strategy was BCH-focused from day one; [BCH was its base currency](https://www.bitcoininsider.org/article/14242/coinex-first-exchange-implement-bitcoin-cash-base-currency), meaning you could use it to buy and sell other currencies, such as Ethereum and Litecoin.

Interestingly, Jihan Wu, the co-founder of Bitcoin Exchange — himself a [famous BCH supporter](https://bitsonline.com/jihan-wu-huge-confidence-bitcoin-cash/) — was a big investor in the exchange. That made me wonder why he, Yang, and many other OG crypto miners, were so passionate about BCH. Was it just about bigger block sizes?

“Bigger block size means more users and use cases,” Yang explained. The move to bigger block sizes was attractive to miners because they would facilitate more transactions. Miners make money on transaction fees, as well as mining blocks. Likewise, the network would arguably be more useful to people, who were looking for digital cash for every day use.

That especially resonated with many early hardcore Bitcoiners. Said Yang: “We really believe that Bitcoin should be a P2P cash vehicle rather than a store of value.”

This view probably sounds outdated to people who believe that Bitcoin’s value as cash is long gone, with solutions such as Lightning Network fulfilling that role. Instead, the new narrative for Bitcoin resides in its value, rather than utility. Yet Yang believed that the forked network would create far more opportunity

“We could invite influential companies to establish nodes and contribute to the network. This cannot be done with the original Bitcoin architecture,” he said.

# CoinEx pivots

But from its inception, CoinEx struggled with adoption and was dwarfed by the bigger exchanges. Part of that had to do with the fact that BCH and “Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision,” another Bitcoin hard fork, were both controversial. Critics pointed out that these networks are centralized in a few big mining pools, and [51% attacks](https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin-sv/) are not out of the question.

So over time, though Yang’s exchange still maintains strong support for BCH and BSV, it began to add support for all the major currencies.

Finally, in January of this year, it announced a major upgrade, of… well, just about everything. It started to offer futures trading, leveraged trading, options trading, and [over 100 token projects](https://www.tuoluocaijing.cn/article/detail-9989578.html) available to traders. It even rolled out its own blockchain, “CoinEx Chain” to support a new DEX, “CoinEx DEX.”

https://preview.redd.it/3okoy5mudv051.png?width=1432&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7099249da4a95db873d268f2dfc95d8db93a368e

The seemingly sudden publicity of CoinEx should not come as a surprise, then. As BCH/BSV was being marginalized, Yang shifted his focus. He’s now trying to ride the wave of building a bigger, more dynamic exchange.

“Crypto exchanges are where value is discovered,” Yang told me.

# CoinEx: TNG

Building an exchange isn’t done overnight, nor is *re*\-building one. CoinEx is still competing with the giants such as Binance.

However Yang thinks his exchange will thrive by zigging when his competitors zag. As usual, CoinEx is taking a slightly different route, he told me.

Like what? “We will be listing 小币种,” he said, using the expression for “small token projects.” I cannot help but wonder if these “small token projects” are simply shitcoins, the trading of which is certainly not new.

Indeed, Yang said that he’s banking on the success of his new, public blockchain. “We are building a CoinEx Chain, a layer one protocol for DEX alone. Using our public blockchain, anyone can issue any token, at any time,” he said. He described the blockchain as “a real decentralized, token-issuance and transaction platform.”

This is the core of Yang’s plan and vision. He believes that centralized exchanges will be a bottleneck for crypto adoption because it contradicts crypto’s nature as a completely free and open infrastructure. Essentially anyone should be able to launch a token and trade it with anyone. Only by building DEXes can we achieve full decentralization, he says.

# The Religious nature of Bitcoin, and forked Bitcoin

It’s his belief that Bitcoin should adhere to Satoshi’s original vision that led Yang to send yet another controversial tweet last week, which I will translate: “The early days of Bitcoin expansion are similar to religion. The religious fervor brings prosperity to the industry.”

By extension, Yang believes that the next generation of Bitcoin should provoke a similar “religious” fervor. That’s why he has slowly become more of a BSV advocate than a fan of Bitcoin Cash. Yang believes that “BSV has more religious connotations, despite its negative image.” (As most crypto people know, the [controversial Craig Wright](https://decrypt.co/25916/craig-wright-vs-crypto-the-current-state-of-his-5-libel-lawsuits), who claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto, led the hard fork which created BSV. Consequently it is often met with skepticism and derision.)

“The early days of Bitcoin expansion are similar to religion,” said Yang. “The religious fervor brings prosperity to the industry.”

Crypto is famous for its tribalism. Many people choose one camp over another not for practical reasons but because of simple faith. Talking to Yang and reading his tweet brings a historic texture to the Bitcoin narrative. But crypto cannot survive on religion alone. One has to build. Hash might have been worshipped in the old days but now the crypto religion is all about the size of the congregation.

personalfinance,"All of the internet says not to rollover our car loan, but in my instance I think that advice is wrong... Am I wrong?","My husband and I got into a BAD car loan two years ago. I mean like $8000 loaned on a car that was probably only worth $3000, and a 22% interest rate. It had 140,000 miles, but we were desperate for a car, and our credit was bad (honestly abysmal is more of a correct term). We had a newborn and were desperately trying to limp back home after I graduated from law school. All we knew then was that this was the only thing we could get and we needed to get back home. 

Now we're beginning to pay for it in other ways. The car is valued somewhere between $1000 and $2000 depending on which tool you use. It has 170,000 miles on it, and going into summer our A.C. wasn't working. We have improved our finances immensely, so our budget allowed an A.C. recharge. We got it recharged and everything was working great. That lasted about 24 hours. We took it back into the shop and they said that the rear compressor (it is a Ford Expedition) was leaking. We were quoted between $650-$1680 depending if we did everything needed and included warranties. In addition to that problem, the car burns oil like crazy. We have to refill it about every 1000 miles. 

My point of view is that paying, give or take, $1000 to put into the car would be a waste. Our payoff amount today is right above $5000. If we keep the loan and pay it off we will pay a total of  $8000 over the next two years. I honestly do not believe the car will last the remaining 2 years of the loan, or 100,000 miles whichever comes first. 

Our credit scores have gone from atrocious to holding at 710 on Transunion, Equifax, and Experion. I'm of the opinion that I would rather roll that $2000-3000 (depending on factors) into a reasonable car loan with a 5% interest rate instead of paying a 22% interest rate on a car that will most likely die within the next year. I know we will need to tires before winter as these won't be safe come November. I just see it as a money pit for us. My husband has no qualms about this as he would rather drive our 2 year old around in something that 1. Has A.C. and 2. He isn't worried about the reliability.

Simply put, Powell plans on continuously infusing money into the economy to attempt to save small business from closing and permanently reducing the number of jobs available. Index futures traded significantly higher the same night.  
2. **The next morning, Moderna released positive interim P1 data for their COVID vaccine, pushing stocks further upwards.** The morning after, Moderna announced positive data on their COVID vaccine. The biotech company demonstrated generation of anti-COVID antibodies in patients without significant side effects. The company plans on starting their pivotal P3 clinical trial in July, which, if successful, will lead to a much faster economic recovery with everyone's concerns of infection put at ease.
3. **On Thursday, over 2M Americans filed unemployment claims, but investors remain optimistic over economic reopening.** As usual, the announcement of an additional 2.4M Americans filing for unemployment claims did not shake the market. Through our small sample size of consumer research, we have found that many are not working because of high unemployment benefits during COVID. Restaurants are worried about reopening because there may not be enough supply of workers to hire from in order to reopen their shops successfully. While more continue to file for unemployment claims, investors are confident that many will be able to sustain on government support and will reengage with the economy as it reopens. 
4. **To date, all but three states have either reopened to a degree or plan on reopening soon.** The final three states that have yet to open and do not have set plans to open are Illinois, Delaware, and New Jersey. As the weather gets better, more people are out and about waiting for takeout at their favorite local restaurants and eating the food in grassy public areas. So far, the U.S. government has not identified any spikes in COVID cases in states that have reopened. 
5. **With states reopening and the weather improving, airport travel jumps to a two-month high, indicating economic activity.** With summer around the corner and COVID concern dying down, travelers are getting back into the air. This Friday, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) recorded a two-month high in airport travelers. While this number is still down 88% from a year ago, increase in air travel demonstrates confidence in ability to combat COVID.

**With the Feds' confidence in the economy and Moderna's exciting vaccine announcement, where does that leave the markets?** WX Capital was confident that positive news would outweigh negative news in May, but now that positive news is relatively commonplace, we believe the market may recover at a much slower pace. We expect a successful economic reopening with limited spikes in COVID cases and believe that vaccine development for COVID is more of a matter of when rather than if. We also believe that biotech will likely be the industry with the greatest return potential in the near future.",finance
personalfinance,Eligibility for PUA or other federal assistance?,"I’ve been unemployed since last year when I left my part-time job for relocation purposes, which never really worked out. I’ve done a little reading about the additional financial assistance related to COVID and unemployment and am curious as to whether I am eligible. I am fortunate that my spouse makes enough money to support our basic needs, however some months are quite tight. 

I can’t seem to find any direct verbiage in the State FAQ related to unemployment/PUA assistance. I know I’m clearly not eligible for unemployment, but unsure about federal assistance.


-North Carolina
-2019 wages ~$8,000 (not including spouses income)
-Left part-time job voluntarily, not COVID-related in 2019
-Was actively job searching however my counties stay at home order directly affected job search/opportunities


Additionally, is there any negative future consequence taking the federal unemployment assistance (if eligible)?
Can taking such assistance hurt opportunities for mortgages in the future?

personalfinance,22 year old college drop out. Please help,"Hello. I have no idea what I am doing financially. I need help in the direction that I should take in life. Quick background info. Im 22, I have 13k in private loans, and 4k in federal loans for college. I have 2k in my bank account. 4k in assets (motorcycle &amp; car). I pay around $500 a month for living expenses (food, rent, netflix). I make $500 a week. 

With that being said what do I do in life right now? I was thinking about selling everything I have to pay off some of my student loan debt. This is my most impressionable years in my life where I figure out what I want to do with my life. I have no degree, and I just want out of these loans. I never want to owe anyone anything anymore. I am past where money and items make you happy, but I still do enjoy stuff like fishing, and riding on the weekend. But those could go. I ultimately want to be free from these loans to make the next major step in my life which would be moving out of my parents. Im sure a lot of people are, or have been in this situation and I would like to hear your thoughts. Good, bad, and ugly!",finance
personalfinance,New grad who just started working: Balancing 401k contributions and paying off student loan?,"I (22/M) started a new job in the software industry ($80K/year) a few weeks ago. I have about $5.1k of debt between two federal subsidized student loans. I do not have to begin payment on them until December 2020. Once the grace period is over, interest will be 5.05% on one and 4.45% on the second.

In terms of existing investments, I don't have any unfortunately and I currently have $1.5k in savings.

My company doesn't offer a 401k match\* but does contribute $500 annually towards an HSA. With that, my current plan is to max out my HSA, putting in $3050 ($254/month) for 2020.  Additionally I plan to set aside $17100 ($1450/month) for my 401k and $6k ($500/month) to max out my Roth IRA.

With that plan, after my living expenses, leaves me about out $400 a month to start increasing my savings and $300 to start paying off my student loans.

The flowchart suggests that I take care of my debt first, but considering the relatively small size of my debt and that I'm at a company with high job security (they are actually aiming to increase the head count in my department substantially during this economic downturn), I thought it would be a good idea to just go ahead and start saving for retirement.

Would I be better off contributing less towards my retirement and pay off my student loans faster, possibly before the grace period even ends? Are the interest rates on my loans high enough to justify that?

I'm also open to any suggestions or advice on my situation in general! Thank you:)

personalfinance,I need guidance towards how to make the best use of my money.,"I’m 23, I work full-time and make anywhere from $1860 to $1900 per month. 
My bills are about $900 a month as follows:

Car payment $174
Car insurance $171
Phone $155
Loan $96 (I owe just over $900 left and then I’m done)
School loan $133 (just started classes so I won’t be done paying this for another 3 years)
Gym $20
Subscription box $13
Health insurance $130

My loan that’s $96/mo has a very low interest rate. I’m actually paid up until July.

My phone plan is so high because I also have an iPad on the plan, I could probably pay that off if it would mean by phone bill could be slashed down. I have tmobile for reference.

I am locked into my gym and sub box for another year, but those two are the least of my concern.

I have about $1000 in savings and I am looking to move out but I’m not going to be able to until I get some of these monthly bills down, so I’m not sure if I should use the savings to pay down other things and build myself up again? I hate to see it gone but something needs to be done.

My car insurance is the lowest I can get it because I live in a city and I have an accident on my record already. 

What’s everyone’s take? What should I do? Keep the money in savings or use it to lower my monthly bills?

personalfinance,"Coming Clean: A Story of Secret Eating, Secret Loan from Dad, and 7 Secret Credit Cards ($24k Total left to Pay Off)","Hello r/personfinance,  
  
I've been following this community over the years on my main account, but disconnected when the following situation started to escalate late last year.  This situation is still rather fresh, but I wanted to share my perspective for anyone else in my shoes or who happens to know someone in my shoes.  This is very much a story about relationships, but I'm sharing here because I would often frequent personal finance communities when trying to find a way to dig myself out without having to come clean.  
  
**TL;DR: Over the course of three years, I ran up a total of $25k in secret credit card debts.  1.5 years ago my balance was up to $13k and my dad took out a secret loan in his name to consolidate $11k of it.  Since then I've built up the accounts back up to $16k.  Came clean to wife a few weeks ago.  Present day formerly-secret debt: $24k.  Wife and I working through it.**  
  
**The Financial Situation**  
$72k single-income household, $17k student loans (mine), $4k car loan (mine), $16k in secret credit card debt, $8k secret loan that my dad took out for me to consolidate secret credit card debt 1.5 years ago.  
   
**The Story**  
I'm now learning how truly awful my inability to communicate about uncomfortable personal matters has been for pretty much my entire life.  This has led me to make poor decisions in an attempt to ""manage"" situations and others' emotions, rather than to face them head on out of fear of disappointing those close to me.  The main victim in this story is my wife of 5 years.  To try and sum it up, the anxiety I experience at the potential of disappointing someone most directly affected my ability to talk about money with my wife.  Early in our relationship/marriage my job was our primary income, but we were both working.  Then when we decided to start a family we agreed to go down to just my income for the foreseeable future.  Started at $45k/year when we had one kid (3.5 years ago), has grown to $72k/year present day with two kids.  I'll lay out more numbers here shortly, but this was a very typical and sustainable situation for many families.  I have a very stable job (civil engineering) and we live in a rural Low-Cost-of-Living area, which is a great formula.  When making these decisions though I don't think either of us truly grasped how dysfunctional my anxiety really was, and how it would lead to a breakdown in critical communication.
  
Until this past week we had separate checking accounts, with one joint account to park our tax refunds.  Instead of saying ""I need help with this"" or ""We may need to save up to buy that"" I would just say ""Yeah, we can get that"" or ""I've got it covered.""  There weren't any major purchases happening, it was just never setting or maintaining an appropriate limit on ever day expenses.  When my income wasn't backing up what I was saying, I started to turn to credit cards.  The first two credit cards weren't a secret, she knew I had them, but she didn't know that I had stopped paying them off each month.  As these early balances started to grow my inability to cope started to show up as well.  I started to turn to secret eating, funded primarily by the secret credit cards.  My secret meals would mostly be on weekdays when on my way to work or during lunch.  $5 Fast Food Breakfast, then a $5-10 Fast Food Lunch.  Sometimes when running errands I'd grab a $3-4 Fast Food Snack.  ""Nothing too wild.""  ""I've got it covered.""  As I got close to maxing these cards out, I started applying for more cards.  About a year and a half ago, my secret credit card balances were up to around $13k.  97-99% utilization.  The only person I was talking to about this was my dad.  My credit score was shot, right around 600.  When I started really feeling the heat my dad offered to take out a loan in his name to consolidate my credit card debt.  I didn't tell my wife and he didn't tell my mom (his wife).  Within a couple of weeks I had $11k of my $13k ""paid off.""  I only had to pay a $60/month minimum on my remaining Chase Slate balance, and send a $200 check to my dad each month to pay towards the loan.
  
Yeah.  You're seeing where this is going.  Not only because I already spoiled the ending, but it's obvious that my issues weren't resolved.  Cold turkey doesn't work for everyone, especially when the problem wasn't really solved, it just had a lower interest rate for the time being.  
  
A little over a year after the consolidation loan (bringing us up to last fall), I had those credit card balances back to the max.  Accelerated by a few grand in medical debt we were paying off, then more medical costs related to the addition of a second child (who just turned 1 this month).  The only thing that really kept this cover up alive was all of the distractions with a highly complicated pregnancy.  I started to really start feeling the heat again late last summer, but then my annual raise came through in a big way.  Instead of 3-4% typical, I landed 8%.  Which was enough to help me maintain minimum payments on 7 maxed credit cards (topping off at $16k), sending that $200/month to my dad, and pay $300/month on payment plans we set up with the hospital.  
  
Over the last few months my anxiety really started to spike as the reality of the situation started setting in.  I wasn't going to be able to fix this on my own.  I was actively lying to the person I loved the most, and started to see how it was going to affect our children's lives.  They didn't deserve a father who was checked out all of the time trying to figure out a secret financial fiasco.  A father who's weight was fluctuating from 210-250 in an endless cycle each year (I'm 6'0"" for reference).
  
Three weeks ago, my wife saw some fast food trash I'd left in my car.  This started a real conversation.  We'd talked about this issue in the past, so she could tell there was something else going on.  I was busted.  I came clean about the $16k in active credit card debt.  A week later I finally came clean about the loan my dad had taken out for me.  
  
A few days after I came clean about everything my relationship with my wife actually started feeling better than it has in years.  We're actually communicating about everything.  We're working through things together.  Of course there are many other aspects of our relationship that would be impossible to add here without it being a mega-post and totally off-topic of personal finance.  Just wanted to share this story from my perspective for anyone hanging out here who might be in the middle of a similar situation.  She is still processing a lot, we still have a pile of debt to knock out, but we're doing things fully as a team again.  
  
Her parents feel betrayed, and scared for what this could mean for their daughter and grandkids if I don't seek to fix my personal issues.  They've also been very supportive over the years.  Her dad has taught me a ton of handy-man type skills.  A few months ago our water heater busted, he offered to split the cost of a new one and them taught me how to install it.  They've bought us a couple of couches, an oven, a dishwasher, he's built us furniture for the kids.  The only sizeable portion of money in a savings account for the kids' future is a few grand that he put towards it.  I have a great relationship with them, and we will be talking face to face about this soon to try and clear the air.  Meanwhile, my parents are trying their best to play this off as if I don't need to be held accountable and this if somehow my wife's fault, also haven't once acknowledged the affect this type of secrecy and dysfunction could have on the kids.
  
I've started seeing a therapist to work on my anxiety, shame, coping skills, and communication.   
  
**The Numbers**  

**Annual Gross Income: $72,000**  
**4-Week Net Income: $4,400** (after health insurance and life insurance premiums, 0% to retirement at the moment)  
I get paid every 2 weeks, since we are paycheck-to-paycheck we just use this for our monthly income and treat the extra check in Jan and July as ""bonuses.""  

*Mortgage: $1,210  
*Electric: $175  
*Water: $50  
*Sewer: $50  
*Internet: $45  
*Streaming Services: $40 (Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, ESPN+, Prime)  
  
*Car Payment: $146 (Her car is paid for, I owe $4,100 on my vehicle, which is actually in her name... another layer to the story)  
*Car Insurance: $75  
*Fuel: $100  
  
*Chase CC #1: $35  ($940 balance, 22.99%, closed)  
*Chase CC #2: $52  ($2,270 balance, 12%, closed)  
*Chase CC #3: $55  ($2,390 balance, 12%, closed)

*Kid-Related (Diapers, etc): $200  
*Other Household Supplies:  $300
*Restaurant Meals:  $600  (yikes...)
  
These are just averages, but typically one of the fields would fluctuate to eat up any remaining amount frostands m each paycheck.  Until recently my Chase CC payments were higher as well.  The three cards listed at 12% are on a negotiated payment plan now.  All 4 Chase CC accounts have been closed, just paying them off now.  Will be exploring options with Discover CC in near future.  
  
I usually am able to earn $100-$200/month in OT pay, which I will be heavily pursuing in near future and trying to boost that number.  Annual raises are announced in June, should be at least 3-4%.  Also looking to start a side gig this summer.  I'm pursuing a drone license and will try and make some money with it.  Will open up some extra OT at work for certain work we are doing, and will try and get some side-gigs for simple photo/video work in area.  Already have a DJI Mavic Mini (which is enough to get started in my area, at least to start getting established and earn towards more professional drone).  Got the drone used by selling a couple of old-hobby related items I'd held on to.   
  
**Moving Forward**  
Will be sitting down with my wife in next couple of days for our first real budget meeting.  We had signed up for the 14 Day Trial for Financial Peace University and watched the first two lessons.  Not sure how my wife feels about the Dave Ramsey Baby Steps, but I also know she is processing a ton of information and feelings right now that I've had a 3 year head start on.  I won't be pushing to hard.  Just going to be going over what the actual situation is, start lining up what our goals as a family are (short term and long term), and then working towards building a budget that will help us reach those goals.  
  
Main purpose of this post was just to share.  I'm open to all comments/input/suggestions/discussion though!

I wasn’t including it in the details because we hadn’t really included it in any planned budget before.  It’s sporadic, but she also had to stop early in this last pregnancy due to complications and had a longer healing period afterward.  She had just started to get back out there when the COVID shutdown happened. She has been earning some from recording online workouts for one of the studios, making around $200-$300/month.  Normal operation has been anywhere from $150-$400/month depending on time of year and how many studios she is active with.  She recently obtained certification to be a health coach as well.  Now that our youngest is 1, she hopes to build this business. The hours coincide with my day job as well, which is really nice.  This line of work is a tremendous emotional/mental/physical boost for her as well.

To his question ""We shouldn't talk about the racial part but, the financial part yes needs to be discussed. We all know legalize of marijuana is a very new legal subject of making money. This is why corporations are rapidly making efforts to create revenue with this tool but, here is where economics governance comes in. Now, I'm no economist. I work in IT and, I am probably speaking out of depth of knowledge. I just believe that a new ""Mass Available Avenue(MAA)"" like the marijuana business should be catered or white-gloved to small businesses by the government. By granting a time allowance to small businesses to be profitable before permitting major companies, organizations, or individuals of certain financial strength from creating a monopoly within infancy of a MAA. If a monopoly emerges from within a few of small business from these actions?We will have address the new monoploy like all other monopolies before. Add bonus this creates close to a free market and nature maturely that could compete with the later permitted entities.
A scale needs to be created by economist nationwide on a federal, state, and county level with general flat agreements across three levels municipalities. Each level can govern as seen fit within their municipality within the general flat agreements.

Like I stated I'm no economist but, this MAA could grant the everyday individuals to pull themselves up and grant themselves individual strength.

 We may have missed the mark on stopping big money from taking this over marijuana business but, this is America. Where we the people can decide to change a mistake, to fix a wrong, and make a better future no matter how many times we screw up.""

Bitcoin,Bitcoin as the hardest money is the most powerful tool in your arsenal.,"Holding bitcoin is absolutely critical in order to protect and grow your wealth due to it being the hardest money.  I would expect anyone giving it serious evaluation to have tons of questions but the only way to really ""get it"" is to educate yourself about the nature of money.  I recomment everyone who is interested in understanding money to read [the Bitcoin Standard](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1119473861/ref=cm_sw_r_em_apa_i_WsEYEb96P0Y4C).

**Hardness in this context refers to the ability for the money supply to be inflated thereby devaluing the purchasing power of those that hold the money as savings.**

Historically the hardest money has been gold however Bitcoin has recently surpassed gold in terms of hardness.  Saifdean covers it in great detail in The Bitcoin Standard however he summarizes the main concept in his [Vienna talk](https://youtu.be/Zbm772vF-5M) (he has a good example of monetary hardness around 11:50).  

Government (Fiat) money is soft money in that central banks have no limits on the amount of money they are willing or able to print and in doing so they reduce everyone else's purchasing power who hold their savings in government currency. 

The US dollar used to be limited in supply because it was pegged to gold meaning you could trade your dollar for a set weight of physical gold.  That is no longer the case which means they have no limitations on the amount of money they are able to print.  Unlimited dollars chasing a fixed amount of goods and services leads to price inflation.  This is reflected in the rising cost of consumer goods, education, health care, housing, etc.  

Eventually with unchecked inflation you get situations, where a society's purchasing power has been [completely destroyed due to devaluation of the currency](https://keripeardon.wordpress.com/2013/06/01/wheelbarrows-of-money-and-the-weimar-republic/amp/) to the point where you need a [wheelbarrow of money](http://chinwag.com/files/images/photos/2342854191_9f4794a1fd.jpg) just to buy goods at market.

[Present situation in Venezuela, money left in the street](https://i.redd.it/5l08hy28rll21.png)

This is what happens when money becomes worthless from hyperinflation and while we aren't there yet in most developed nations it is only a matter of time.  

People who do not take steps to protect themselves from unchecked inflation will find their savings has evaporated in purchasing power even though their bank balance stays the same.  Given the current multi-trillion dollar money printing environment we find ourselves in I don't believe have ever seen a more bullish setup for Bitcoin.

And if you want to talk future projections PlanB's [Stock to Flow Cross Asset model](https://medium.com/@100trillionUSD/bitcoin-stock-to-flow-cross-asset-model-50d260feed12) is really driving the discussion on the recent set point change to $288k with the recent halving.

PlanB also appeared last week on a great podcast with Saifedean Ammous the author of the Bitcoin Standard and person who brought the concept of Stock to Flow properties of hard money to the forefront.  I would highly recommend [giving it a listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2cP8k_QUaw).

personalfinance,Rehab loan and refinance?,"My husband and I have found a home that we plan to purchase. It is in a great town and neighborhood. The house, however, has two additions that have not yet completed. These areas have roofs, subfloor, and walls/studs but need flooring and drywall to be finished. Because of this, our lender said they they cannot give us a conventional mortgage. 

We looked into a 203k rehab loan, but the monthly payment was $500 more than what we budgeted. Our realtor has suggested looking into it again, because if we finished the house and could do the higher payment for 6 months, after the work is done, the house should appraise for about $150k more than it currently does, which would give us at least another $100k in equity, which would in turn drop our interest rate. 

Since the banks are closed until tomorrow, we're still waiting to see exact numbers, but I want to see if there are any other advisable options for us. 

The house is 100% livable as is - the parlor, family room, kitchen, dining room, and two bedrooms are completely finished. It's just the master bedroom and porch/3-seasons room that need finishing. We had originally planned on buying it as-is and having my husband finish it, since he's fairly handy when it comes to all of that, but since we can't get a conventional loan, it looks like that's out of the question. 

Edited to add: we both have excellent credit.

personalfinance,Feasibility of getting a mortgage for a low cost house,"Over the past year or so I've begun saving for an eventual home purchase. I don't have a set timeline, and am still in the wait-and-keep-saving mode, but I've begun some casual window shopping in some areas that I'm interested in.

As a rather handy person, I've been considering the idea of getting a lower cost house, around or below $50,000, which appear to be structurally sound but in need of a lot of cosmetic upgrades. From what I've read, people seem to be fairly commonly in favor of not paying more than the down payment up front for any house due to low mortgage interest rates. But would that same rule still apply when considering such a low cost house, or would people advocate saving to buy outright in cash? The reason a mortgage appeals to me in this scenario is that it could leave more cash available up front to start renovation work sooner after purchase.

However, I've also read that most lenders have a minimum mortgage amount around $50,000+, and that while some local banks might do smaller mortgages, it's fairly uncommon. I'm curious what people's experiences have been with this, and what the likelihood is of finding a place willing to do that. Due to COVID, I haven't gone and talked to any local banks yet, so just kind of curious whether anyone else has been in a similar situation and how they approached it.",finance

personalfinance,(Ireland) Best Savings Accounts for First Time Saver,"This is going to be Ireland-specific, so any advice I can get would be brilliant. 

Like so many around the globe, I have found my job being made redundant due to COVID-19 and the various implications that it has. This comes with an (albeit relatively small) redundancy payout. 

What I'm hoping for now is advice on the best savings accounts. 

Including money already saved and my redundancy, I am looking at \~€9000 (tax dependent). 

Once the redundancy comes through, it's going to be sitting in just a totally normal current account (Bank of Ireland) and I would just prefer to make my money work for me. 

The kind of requirements I'd see are: 

\- Have a good/high-interest rate

\- Be relatively easy to withdraw money from for rainy-day situations

\- Have low to no monthly fees

My general inkling right now is to place the majority of it in this savings account, invest a small portion of it on various stocks, and splurge some of it on luxuries. 

Would really appreciate any advice I could get!",finance

personalfinance,Bought a house and having 2 roomatates move in (long post),"Like the title says, my husband and I just bought a house! It’s 4 bdrm, 2 bath, and is $1200/month for 30 yr but putting money in like it’s a 15 year loan so $1800/month. It’s reasonable size (1500 sq ft plus a good sized garage in the backyard), has a decent sized yard, and in a safe neighborhood. We have 2 close friends that want to move into the bedrooms upstairs. They would also have the whole loft up there and a bathroom. We were going to charge them $500/month plus utilities/WiFi for $100. One roommate will have a cat and the other wants to buy a dog. This seemed like a good price given the rent price of similar houses in the area ($1500-$2000 approx), maintence, pets, and the use of all the home utilities like laundry.

BUT we made the mistake of telling them our mortgage (yes I know, not the smartest move) One of them confronted us about the two of them talking and thinking that since we make more money than them, 400/month would be more fair since the mortgage is only $1200 (approx anyways since we do not have any interest rates locked)🙄 this is true but 1 of our roommates will be making the same amount as us soonish so it seems kind of sketchy to bring that up. Plus it’s not really their business. We were not basing the rent on our morgatge but all the factors listed above. They seemed to think that the “minimum” morgatge is what we should be basing it off of. 

The conversation didn’t last long as it came up abruptly and awkwardly so we didn’t get to discuss too deep but I really want to have a discussion but not fully sure how. They are very close friends and are always hanging out at our current apartment so we know that they should be pretty good roommates but now I’m starting to get a little worried. None of us want to screw this up so we’re trying to figure out the best way to talk about it. 

I would love any advice on how to handle this situation. Do you guys think $500/month is fair? Thank you for taking the time to read this if you’re still here (lol).",finance

One account would be ideal, instead of a split checkings/savings (but seems unlikely). I don't mind having the split as long as I can direct deposit into the savings account, and pay my bills from the savings account.

personalfinance,I have little idea how much real life costs and what home I can afford (SF Bay Area),"**Current:** 30M + 30F, no kids, live in small apartment ($2400/month and under $100 for all utilities)

**My Comp:** 190K Base, 30K+/yr bonus, $60K/yr RSUs, very stable job

**Her Comp:** 150K Base, relatively stable job and could probably find another job easily in the event of a lay off

**Net Worth:** 660K Cash, 138K Investments, 325K Retirement, No Debt, 1 Relatively modern car

**Situation:** We are looking to move forward and hopefully purchase a home in the next 6 or so months.  We got pre approved for $2.3M home price ""conservatively"" on just our base salaries and bonuses.

My question is - how much should we really be looking to spend on a home?

My quick estimate if we purchase a $2M home we:

* Take home roughly $15,500/month after taxes and retirement (Doesn't adjust for tax breaks (\~$1,300/mo?), doesn't include bonuses and RSUs)
* Would pay $9,400/month on Mortgage, Taxes, Insurance assuming 20% down, 3.5% interest, 1.125% Property Tax, $4,000/yr insurance
* Leaves \~$6,100/month (Recently revised this number up from 5,000 to even out my 401K contributions which get front loaded for some reason and got more accurate numbers from my fiance)
   * Food - $1000 (Reasonable for a family of 4?  Both of us get fed at work as well so can probably stay under this.)
   * Upkeep - $1,000 (At 2M mark I hope to get a pretty good place that doesnt require anything major.  Other upgrades we can assume come from the savings)
   * Utilities - $300
   * Transportation - $500 (This can probably be reduced with more WFH and using work provided transportation)
   * Misc - 750
* Future Expenses:
   * Childcare for two - $3,250 (This would be a future expense when earnings are greater because we currently dont have kids, and it can likely be reduced via work from home care or grandparent help certain days each week)
   * Healthcare - $125

I figure if we were to spend 2M on a home it would need to be in the good public school district and not need any major work (Figured $300K minimum to send two kids to a private school for K-High), otherwise we wouldn't want to reach past 1.6-1.7M I imagine.

personalfinance,Refinancing in CA,"Hey everyone,

I'm looking for advice on whether to refinance my condo in the Bay Area. I'm hoping folks can point me in the right direction for two questions: whether my plan makes sense and some places to look for the best rates.

Here are the current numbers. The condo appraises for $860,000 and there's $490,000 left on the loan ($2,387/mo). The current loan is a 10/1 ARM with 7 years left at 3.3%. The property taxes come out to just around $10,100/year and go up 2-3%/year. The HOA fee is currently just around $600/mo but changes yearly (was as high as $680/mo last year). Homeowner's insurance is ~$360/year and earthquake coverage is another $120/year. Our annual household income comes out to around $310,000. Our credit scores are in the 730s - mostly because our bank doesn't report the mortgage to the credit bureaus. Otherwise our credit is clean (though we opened new CCs recently because of the Uber card's rewards change). The rent in the area hovers right around $3,300/mo right now.

Here's the plan. My wife &amp; I are planning on having our first child in the next year. We expect that we'll run out of space in 5-6 years and will have to find a bigger place - which may be outside of California. The current idea is to keep the condo as an investment property and rent it out. So ultimately - **is this a good idea?** I've tried [this calculator](https://www.narpm.org/members/resources/rent-vs-sell-calculator/#) which tells me that it might be - if I can get the rate to 3%.

I've also tried a [refinance calculator](https://better.com/content/refinance-calculator/) which tells me a lower interest rate around 3% pays off in 4-5 years. Given that, I've looked around at rates and here's what I found:
 - [Better](https://better.com/mortgage-rates/refinance/ca/san-francisco) - rates are terrible - 3.25% with points.
 - Sofi - went up until the credit pull - 2.875% rate with no points and $1k to close.
 - [Loan Cabin](https://www.loancabin.com/rates) - 2.625% with points. Looks sketchy and I'm afraid to continue here, but the interest rates look enticing. **Has anyone worked with them before?**
 - First Republic Bank - the 30-year fixed interest rate is the same as what I have now (3.3%). Not worth it.
 - [Provident CU](https://providentcu.org/products/mortgages/rates) - 3.125% - though they seem to use 1/2 points to drop 12.5bps rather than whole points so could be interesting?
 - [Chase](https://www.chase.com/personal/mortgage/mortgage-purchase) - 3% for purchase (maybe 3.5% for refi?). Not interesting.
 - [Wells Fargo](https://www.wellsfargo.com/mortgage/rates/) - 3.5% - not interesting
 - [Bank of America](https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/refinance/) - 3.5% - not interesting

**Are there any other lenders I should check out?** I'm currently leaning towards SoFi though Loan Cabin is an interesting prospect. **Has anyone used SoFi's for mortgages?**

personalfinance,Should I do a 15 year or 30 year refinance?,"Here's the options:

20 yr. @ 2.875% = $988/month

15 yr. @ 2.50% = $1142/month

We currently pay $975/month for our mortgage. 

We also pay $2,500 a month towards student loans and a car payment, and we will be done paying those both in July of this year. It does not ""hurt"" to put that much money towards the debt, so when we get back that extra $2,500 a month, it absolutely will not at all ""hurt"" to pay $167 per month more than we are currently paying on our mortgage.

I've heard the argument that we should just get the 20 year and pay it off in 15 because it would give us the ""cushion"" when we need it. However, this will mean we are just throwing away over $3,000 in extra interest if we get the 20-year interest rate but pay it off in 15. At that point, we might as well just get the 15 and save the $3,000.

Therefore, I am 99% certain we're going to do the 15. I just wanted one last ""push"" here to just go ahead and do it!

investing,Does anyone have a legitimate long-term bull case here?,"Since we're trading fairly close to ATHs now, I feel like it's an appropriate time to ask this question. Does anyone here have a legitimate case for why parking my money in equities at these current prices is a good long-term value investment? (no meme answers please)

I realize that the Fed, FOMO, and various other factors may cause people to feel obligated to buy into equities, but those factors don't increase the underlying value of the stocks in question. Everywhere I look, I still see companies going bankrupt or projecting depressed earnings for a good period of time. **The main reason I see people are buying stocks is that they're looking for returns created by the expectation that other people will pay more down the line.**

Nowhere do I see people projecting great earnings growth and a favorable environment given the now (more) massive amount of debt we have to service. P/E ratios have expanded. With more debt, the risks of stocks in general have also increased (liquidity =/= solvency). The Fed tried to raise rates last year just a little and markets freaked out. It feels like our economy can no longer handle higher rates of any sort. In my book, that's a HUGE warning sign, particularly given that we're already at 0%. 

Sitting in cash, I realize I missed out on the returns of the recent FOMO. But I can't help that the whole equities market is just one massive bomb waiting to blow up, if not now then sometime down the line in the near future.

So, can any of you convince me that it's a good idea for me to buy in right now and be able to sleep well for the next couple of years?",finance

personalfinance,Refinance costs - how to read closing cost worksheet,"I've been shopping around for a  refinance on a home purchased last year.  I'm one year into my current  30 year loan at a rate of 4.375%.

This  is the best of a few offers I've been able to get.  I was able to get  this locked in, but my wife and I haven't signed any paper to go through  with it yet.  I'm reading through the closing cost worksheet and  wondered if my understanding is correct.  I also thought others might  benefit from going over these costs together.

Here's my notes and assumptions in the borders of the screen shot.  I'll number the items to make the discussion easier.

Screen shot:  [https://i.postimg.cc/fbrKrYsN/cost-of-loan2.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/fbrKrYsN/cost-of-loan2.jpg)

Headline  numbers:  On the remaining $199k principle balance of my loan, this  bank is offering a 15 year 2.75%.  Their percent for a 30 year loan was  3.0%, so I opted for the 15 year loan.  I'm comfortable with the monthly  payment.

1. They took out the $1629 ""normal"" fee they usually charge.  ok, great.
2. They  list the appraisal fee, but said it was not needed, and took it out the  bottom #4.  Kind of strange way of listing that on the closing  worksheet, right?  Ok, whatever.
3. The  rest of the $2144 fees are coming mostly from lender's title insurance,  settlement/closing cost, state tax/stamps.  Are those things I can  negotiate?  Are others getting their lender to paid for those things?   Like...why am I paying for their lender insurance?
4. see #2 above.
5. Do  I need to scrutinize the prepaid/reserve section?  They're my escrow  for property tax and home insurance.  I'm going to have to paid these  anyways right?  I'm currently es-crowing with my current loan.  I've  never thought much about these since they're things I'd paid anyways.   Do people ever get ripped off on these?  Like the lender collects more  money than actually was needed?  Does the daily interest make sense?

If  people ever do get ripped off here, I think it would be pretty easy to  do.  It's hard to figure out the exact numbers, how many months into the  tax year, what's left of the taxes/insurance that hasn't been paid for.

6.  So to get down to determining the real cost of the refinance, is it just the $2144 subtract appraisal fee of $475 = $1669?

At the end of the day, I'm paying $1669 for the lower interest rate?",finance

devops,People just don't know how to recruit for Devops and IT,"The majority of Devops and technology recruiters, team leaders, IT managers and engineers just know crap about recruitment.

*""We are understaffed, there's no people""*

*""That guy won't fit to our team, he didn't answer 1 out 100 technical questions right""*

*""There's a shortage of skills on the marketplace""*

That doesn't translate on how people are interviewing, so stop moaning and bitching start hiring goddam people!

I'm not talking just from a job seeker perspective but also being part of teams whose interviewers are hopeless picky people who just don't know what they want, don't know how to interview. They want to create an echo chamber where people must think exactly like them but diversity of opinions is exactly what you need to keep things in check.Sometimes they just don't know they are limited too and want to hire someone just as limited.

I'm sure I'm not alone on this thinking. There's a pretty interesting [article](https://zachholman.com/posts/startup-interviewing-is-fucked/) I read the other day but I think it doesn't apply just to startups. It applies to everything. It shouldn't be like that for big enterprise companies either.

For example I had an experience where a guy who was perfectly knowledgeable on ansible was dropped because the way he was using in his previous project differs from the way we use, even tho it wasn't his option to use like that. The team wanted someone who used it like them. FFS really? It's ansible. You either know or you don't, you can use wherever way you want, it's not rocket science. You can adapt to new ways in 1h.

I wonder how it is around the world, I heard places like Chicago etc are much better on that aspect.

I also have an issue with recruiters (from recruiting companies) I for one I'm done accepting enquires from recruiters for good. That's it.

I gave them a chance in the last year but the truth is that in my 20 year IT career I have NEVER been hired by a recruiter who approached me through Linkedin or other sources. Every single time I've found a new job, it was when I applied for it directly.

Even when the JD seems right and it sounds like it's progressing, it always falls through for some silly reason.

That's gotta mean something. I can't shake the feeling that recruiters are just a waste of time and I don't know why companies contract them. Perhaps because, as said, they are even worse at recruiting and don't know what they want.

I make $35/hour. Work 40 hours a week paid every 2 weeks. So i believe that means 26 paychecks, for a total of $72,800 before taxes. (I live in a state with no state taxes. Only paying federal taxes)

In that $72,800, ~~$60 is deducted per paycheck for health insurance.

my plan for 2020 was to contribute $6k to traditional IRA, $3550 to my HSA, and just enough to my traditional 401k (no employer match at all btw) to get me 12% tax bracket, before finishing off with roth 401k contributions.

this meant, $72,800 gross. $60 per paycheck = $1,560 total. Gross $71,240 before taxes after health insurance.

Take standard deduction of 12,400 so $58,840 tax liability. $3550 (HSA) + $6000 (Trad IRA) = 9550 deduction

$58,840 - HSA - Trad IRA = $49,290. 12% tax bracket ends at $40,125. which means I can put $9,165 to Traditional 401k before Ill be in the 12% tax bracket. After $9,165, i can contribute the rest to my Roth 401k for 12% tax bracket.

So far, I have already made the HSA and traditional IRA contribution. And about $8000 in my traditional 401k. However, it turns out with my income I dont qualify for 100% IRA deductions?

financialindependence,[UPDATE] Future Marginal Tax Rate Estimator,"EDIT: If you have a significantly sized taxable brokerage in retirement this tool is simple too inaccurate to recommend. See [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/gqwkwz/update_future_marginal_tax_rate_estimator/fs1c1uo/) below for more context. I'd go so far as to say that this tool has essentially no reasonable use case for this subreddit, as the majority of savers here will eventually turn to taxable brokerage accounts during accumulation. I'll leave it up for users who only anticipate using Trad or Roth for &gt;90% of their savings, uncommon though that may be. 

****

First, I'd like to thank /u/happyasianpanda for providing invaluable feedback and direct support to make this a better calculator.

This calculator seeks to estimate a conservative value for your marginal tax rate in retirement and compare that to your current marginal tax rate to help you make a decision on whether to make a pre-tax (Traditional) or post-tax (Roth) contribution this year. It is based on the [Estimating future marginal tax rate](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Traditional_versus_Roth#Estimating_future_marginal_tax_rate) subsection of the Bogleheads wiki page on Traditional versus Roth. The steps taken are described below, but **it is highly recommended that the user read and understand the Bogleheads method before proceeding.** The calculator is essentially an implementation of their process. It has its shortcomings, but it's the best approach I've seen. To the extent that the user has an issue with the assumptions of the process I have tried to allow the user to adjust those assumptions.

The Bogleheads process is as follows:

&gt; 1. Estimate any guaranteed retirement income. E.g., pension you can't defer in return for higher payments when you do start, rentals, royalties, etc.
2. Take current traditional balance and predict value at retirement (e.g., with Excel's FV function) using a conservative real return, maybe 3% or so. Take 4% of that value as an annual withdrawal.
3. Take current taxable balance and predict value at retirement (e.g., with Excel's FV function) using a conservative real return, maybe 3% or so. Take 2% of that value as qualified dividends.
4. Decide whether Social Security (SS) income should be considered, or whether you will be able to do enough traditional-&gt;Roth conversions before starting SS. Include SS income projections if needed.
5. Calculate marginal rate on withdrawals from traditional accounts using today's tax law on the numbers from step 1-4.
6. Make your traditional vs. Roth decision for this year's contribution
7. Repeat steps 1-6 every year until retirement

Relevant changes:

* I chose a conservative real return of 5%, as most folks in /r/financialindependence appear to run more stock-heavy portfolios with higher expected returns.
* There is a sheet for calculating this year's result, as well as an advanced sheet for seeing how that result changes in future years as you get closer to retirement. You can see that for constant income and constant dollar contributions, the retirement marginal tax rate steadily climbs as expected. The income and contribution amounts can be user-adjusted to reflect wage increases and/or contribution increases. 
* There is a conditional warning box (currently triggered) if your planned savings this year will drop you into a lower tax bracket if you contribute it all to pre-tax accounts. The calculator cannot reliably tell you when you'd cross over (you may take other pre-tax deductions that the calculator does not know about) but it gives a reasonable estimate and lets you know. If you drop into a lower bracket mid-year, you may want to change your approach regarding Trad vs Roth.
* Separate sheets for Single and MFJ filers. 

****

In terms of why the calculator works the way it does, I can't say it better than the folks at Bogleheads:

&gt; If you currently have very little tax-deferred retirement savings, your calculated retirement tax rate will be very low, so you’ll get a big value by contributing more. In fact, due to the federal standard deduction, the first $13,850 or $27,000 you withdraw in retirement each year (assuming you're over age 65 at the time) should be tax-free. Assuming a 4% withdrawal rate, that corresponds to an account balance of $346,250 (= $13,850 / 4%) or $675,000 (= $27,000 / 4%) that can be accessed federally tax-free, and these figures should grow with inflation.

&gt; As your tax-deferred balance rises, so will your expected tax rate, but as long as it’s less than your marginal tax rate now it still makes sense to contribute to tax-deferred accounts. If your expected retirement marginal tax rate ever reaches or exceeds your current marginal tax rate, and you still want to save more, then additional savings should be done in a Roth account.

personalfinance,"Forbearance expected to be paid back at end of 3 months, or ""call us to modify loan 10 days before the end of the forbearance period""","So we applied for loan forbearance with our mortgage company (Dovenmuehle). We were approved, which was a nice relief (my wife's salary is reduced a bit right now. We could make our payments but with all the uncertainty, figured it'd be nice to set that money aside for now instead).

We got the agreement in the mail and saw that it said you have to pay it back in September. We had heard of this happening, but thought it was too ridiculous and unhelpful to be the reality for us, but here we are.

First, what the hell does that help? You can't pay your mortage but you can pay thousands of extra dollars all at once in a few months?

Anyway, I called them to see if we could do the sane option of just extending the loan term by 3 months, and they said that we can call back 10 days before the end of the forbearance agreement to apply to modify the loan. I said ""okay, so it's not even guaranteed then?"" and she said that's correct but she ""doesn't see why we wouldn't be approved"".

That's not very comforting.

So we were thinking, with interest rates the way they are, we might just refinance now with another company. Like I said, we could make our payments at this point. My job is secure..my wife's isn't in great shape right now, but she's still employed and it seems she will stay that way.

I was also just thinking I might call our company back and let them know that we're thinking of refinancing and will go with another company if they can't help us out this one time. What do you all think their flexibility is here? Are they really unable to modify the loan agreement NOW? She said ""they don't know what things will look like in 3 months, so they can't make the agreement now"". Not sure what that means.

Anyway, sorry this is kind of a ramble, just looking for some feedback to see if this is normal and what you all would do in this situation.

My confusion lies with the fact that the Interest line item, which should account for 18 days of interest accrual on the principal, is higher (by a LOT, not just a few hundred) than my normal total monthly principal+interest payment on that loan.

Can anyone explain why this might be?  Is there a different interest rate that they use for payoffs?  The only other cost/fee shown in the whole payoff statement is a ""recording cost"" of $200 which does not bother me.

personalfinance,"Refi 15 year mortgage to 15 year, or 30 year + extra payments? Looking towards future, first kid and wife stops working","Hello all, I've seen a lot of valuable advice given here over the years and would appreciate any input into my wife and I's specific scenario if anyone has any advice.

I'm 29, my wife is 28, and we bought our first home about a year ago. We've done pretty well for ourselves thus far and were able to put 20% down with 15 year year financing. We bought the home for $442,000, ~$90k down, 3.75% interest rate. At the time, we were each making ~$115k annually for a total around $230k. I've gotten a slight raise, and my wife has switched jobs slightly lowering her income, but we're roughly around the same at $225k. Our mortgage payment every month, after taxes, insurance (escrow), etc, is $3,247. 

Our plan is to start trying to have kids within the next year or two. When the first child is born, my wife is planning to stop working for at least a few years. If we were to take our current financial situation, and remove my wife's income entirely, it would basically work out that half of my paycheck would now be going to the mortgage (my 2 week paycheck is very close to what the mortgage payment is, around $3200). Between the rest of our bills, food, credit cards (no CC debt, no debt in general besides the mortgage), we'd essentially be spending all of my income on life expenses for a few years until my wife began working again a few years down the road (she's a CPA so no real concern that she wouldn't be able to get a job).

We had started looking at refinancing at the beginning of the pandemic, just because rates were becoming so much better. We currently have a 3.75% rate on our 15 year mortgage, and can get a 2.75% rate on a 15 year mortgage - with all closing costs rolled into the cost of the mortgage (no money out of pocket), this still drops our monthly payment ~$200 a month. On the other hand, if we go for a 30 year mortgage, at 3.5%, it looks like the monthly cost is $785 less than the 2.75% 15 year mortgage, and if you tack on the additional $200 we were going to save from the 15 year refi, we would be saving roughly $1k a month to go 30 year, IF we needed the savings. My plan would be to continue paying $3300 or more per month even if we went 30 year, while we still can, because in general 30 year mortgages are a terrible investment where you're getting robbed on interest. My question is, is it worth it to have this fall-back, or should we just push forward with the 15 year re-fi and ""make it work"" when we have kids, with the savings inherent to a 15 year mortgage? Any advice from people who have been in this situation? We're currently all approved for the refi, and just need to sign the final paperwork - only in the last few days did I start debating possibly going with the 30 year for added future flexibility... 

An added wrinkle on top - we have a decent amount of savings. My wife and I have been diligently saving in order to get into real estate investing - I intend to buy a multifamily property to rent out within the next year or two, depending on whether I find the right deal. In terms of savings, we have ~$70k liquid currently that we were amassing to put towards a downpayment on a property, $25k I've put into the market over the past few months, another $50k in a managed stock account I wasn't planning on touching, and then our various 401k accounts. 

If I wasn't determined to move towards financial independence via real estate investing, and these funds were just standard savings, I would be a lot less hesitant to just refi to the improved 15 year mortgage - we're planning to save another $80-100k this year, and these savings could carry us through a few years of my wife not working with kids. But given that we want to use them towards an investment property, one that hopefully will generate at least $1k of cash flow per month (we were under contract on a deal like this 3 months ago but unforseen last minute property issues caused us to pull out during the inspection period), I want to make sure that we get this refi right - we don't plan on staying in this house forever, but 5 to 8 years is probably reasonable... Sorry if I'm just incoherently rambling at this point, just don't want to lock in a refi with back-end costs added to the mortgage, only to regret the decision in 12 to 24 months....",finance

1. **The Fed “preemptively” stated that it will buy assets** \-  This aggressive action leads to a faith in equity investors that the Fed has “got their back” and it removes fear from the markets. So investors start buying stocks.
2. **The Fed flooded the market with Liquidity** \-  [Since mid of March, Fed has printed $1.5 Trillion of money.](https://grufity.com/historical-data-chart-graph/FRBDATABPU@Him/M0-Money-Supply) Which further led to $3+ Trillion worth of liquidity in the market as measured by the [M2 Money Supply](https://grufity.com/historical-data-chart-graph/FRBDATARWL/Change-in-M2-Money-Supply).  A big chunk of this excess liquidity created ends up in buying of stocks and in mitigating the risk factors that impact stock prices.
3. **The Fed is buying High yield Debt ETFs** \-  Usually, the biggest reason for stocks to fall is the fear that companies will default on the loans. So investors start selling “junk bonds” (non-investment grade bonds). This creates panic in the stock market as interests of equity holders are subordinate to that of bondholders. At the same time, the companies are not able to “issue more bonds” to raise more money for surviving downturn as the bond market is “frozen”. **By buying the low-grade bond ETFs, the Fed “un-froze” the junk bond markets and diminished the panic on the street.**

Yet, how do we balance or contrast debt and investment interest rates?

So, is it better to put this money back into the house, and make extra payments.  Such as extra 200 per month to principal, which would be 24k over ten years.  And such as taking my next two mortgage payments that I budgeted, and then making a large $3,000 principal payment?  

Or - is this money best invested.  So that 200 a month for 10 years produces more value - invested at 6-7% annually?  Or that $3,000 from my two skipped mortgage payments - invest it and hope for 6-7% annually - opposed to making principal only payments.

About a year ago, I delicately and with much thought, entered into what I call the Balance Transfer Shuffle (see old reddit post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/d30bra/the_0_balance_transfer_shuffle/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)).

Fast forward and turns out I'm sh\*t at paying off my debt (*actually, I'm quite good at paying off my debt. I'm actually terrible at earning income with which to do the paying*).

I started out with about **$24K** in debt with an average APR (dollar weighted) of **15.64%**. I'm now sitting with **$23,500** in debt with an average interest rate of **2.61%**.

I may be even worse at formulating an endgame strategy before the end arrives and the end is near. The strategy was to  pay down at least one of the $9K 0% balances, let credit rebound, then apply for a loan to consolidate the rest. Then COVID happened, work ceased, and the plan was mangled.

On the upside

* I accrued much less interest in the past year than I would have otherwise.

On the downside

* I'm *still* in the same amount of debt
* **Credit score** dropped *(760 -&gt;* ***670***\*)\*
* Fewer/complicated options to earn *more* money due to COVID-19
   * *(Currently receiving UI benefits that will keep me afloat-but not flush--I'm a hybrid worker and am receiving under-calculated benefits-- until the CARES Act runs its course at the end of July)*.

Those 0% promotions will begin to expire in the coming months (**8/2020** *($9,200)***, 9/2020** *($9,700)***, 1/2021** *($800)*). I'm weighing my options and requesting support / advice.

I *do not* want to continue the 0% shuffle. No more new cards. *The 1/2021 card still has an active 0% balance transfer promo available until 1/21, but with a small credit limit.*

I have been saving all of my UI benefits and have $6K in the bank.

I'm not sure how likely it is that I'll be able to qualify for a loan to handle the $18K+ that will begin to incur. I'm still leaning toward this option with the thought that a lower APR is a lower APR even if it's for a reduced amount. However, I'm concerned about the effect this will have on my credit score.

As for lifestyle changes and choices, there's not much else I can do to spend less. My girlfriend and I live together, are staying home, and not spending money. We're even considering downsizing to a one car household even though we live in LA.

Thanks for making it to the end. I realize that this is merely a plea for help or maybe I just needed to get it off my chest, but I am hopeful that someone has some ideas that I may not have thought about.

My current mortgage is a 30 yr fixed (owe approx, 24 years), 4.58% interest rate, owe $196K, current monthly payment is $1,530 (includes, P&amp;I, insurance &amp; taxes).  I spoke with a local bank who is a broker for Quicken loans.  Thy appraised my home for $295K which is considerably low for the neighborhood where I live.  Zillow estimates the home to be worth at least $342K.  However, I also understand Zillow is not always correct.  I was hoping for an appraisal of at least $330K so that I could get roughly $60K in cash out.  Average home in the neighborhood goes for around $390K but I understand my home does need some updating.

personalfinance,Navy Federal Homebuyer's Choice vs. Rocket Mortgage Conventional Mortgage,Title says it all. I'm a 25 y/o with \~ $10k in savings looking to purchase my first house (\~225k or less and I make 50k base). I have been looking into various loan options and am part of the NFCU. Their Homebuyer's Choice loan was appealing because of the zero down payment option. But this also comes with a minimum of 4.0% interest rate. Would I be better off going with another lender with conventional mortgage options and putting out a 3%+ down payment to save on the interest rate? Or is it reasonable to refinance in a few years and hope that mortgage rates don't skyrocket?,finance
personalfinance,Anything to take into consideration for refinancing mortgage?,"Hello! My wife and I recently purchased a new home and closed in February for a 30 year mortgage at a 3.5% interest rate. With everything going on with COVID, we decided to shop around to see if we could refinance to a lower interest rate. 

After speaking with a few lenders, the lowest we were able to find was a 30 year mortgage at 3.0%. Using a spreadsheet we found online, this would save us \~$30k in interest over the entire loan. 

Is there anything else that we should be taking into consideration before refinancing this mortgage? The only con is that we'd have to pay for closing costs again but we would still be saving in the long run with the refinance.",finance

personalfinance,Should I cash out/refinance to create a fund for possible future opportunities in RE?,"I'm a 48 year old professional. My net worth is around 3MM, consisting of real estate, savings and a retirement account. I owe 240K on my main residence (worth 800K, 10 yrs left @ 3.325%, about $40K left in interest payments) and around 50K on hobby farm under a cooperative farm loan (7 years left, about $7K in interest payments left). I have all my other bases covered: life insurance, college fund, retirement fund, etc. I have no other debt.

I want to replicate something I did during the 2015 ""mini down turn"" which allowed me to buy the farm: cash out/refinance using my home's equity, buy a couple of properties in a low risk area, wait two or three years and cash out for a decent profit, pay back a good chunk of the refinanced loan and invest the balance in a vacation home. However, I'm concerned I might be overpaying on the quoted refinanced loans: 3.125% 15yrs on a 450K loan is marginally better than my current interest rate. Cash flow is not a problem and I can easily afford the higher monthly payment.

I don't have a specific property in mind, but I'm happy to take the risk a new opportunity will arise, at which time I will be a ""cash buyer"". What am I missing?

personalfinance,Looking for saving/investing advice,"Alright, so the market is super volatile right now, so I'm not sure how great any additional investing options will be. The quick summary is I'm in very good financial shape, and very grateful for it. I'm just looking for advice on how to do even better.

Alright, here are the numbers:

\- I make 96k/yr in a medium COL area.

\- I contribute 12% of my salary to my 401k, plus an employer match of 5%. So I'm contributing a hell of a lot into that already. I have $22k in it currently, the combined contribution each bi-weekly paycheck is $633, and I'm 31 years old, so I feel like I'm in good shape here.

\- I bought a house last year. $200k, new construction, put 20% down so no PMI. Making all my payments on time, plus extra principle payments each month. \~$160k in mortgage debt from this. 3.875% interest rate.

\- Only other debt is my car payment. It's $365/month, the interest rate is 3.5%. I have about $12k left, I'm not in any huge rush to dump money into paying it off given how low the interest rate is.

\- I have an Ally bank savings account. It used to have a much higher interest rate, but that rate has fallen (obviously) to 1.25%. Still higher than a lot of other places, but it's less than half of what it was a year ago. I have $52k in my savings.

Like I said, I'm in good shape. With my Ally account being at a lower interest rate, I'm wondering what options I have to grow my money. Ally offers CDs but only at 1.3%, which isn't worth it at all IMO.

I could move my checking account from Chase to Ally and get the 0.1% interest on that. I keep a few thousand in my checking account for bill pay and whatnot, so getting anything at all on that would be cool. But again, that's nothing.

So, do I have any obvious options to strengthen my financial position even more? I'm already putting a lot of money in for retirement, but are there any other decent investing/saving strategies beyond that?

Edit: Ok, so here is an update after the first wave of responses.

\- This morning I bumped my 401k contribution rate to 20%. My math is a little off on this because I haven't fully factored in and pro-rated my earlier contributions at the lower rate, but roughly I feel this will let me get close to the max for this year. I'll do more precise calculations in the near future, that's something I'm better at. I know that for a full calendar year though 20% puts me right at the edge of the max.

\- I'm looking into IRAs. I want to at least take advantage of the fact that I can contribute $12k this year. I would probably do $6k right away to take advantage of the 2019 extension, and then gradually do the other $6k over the rest of this year to take advantage of spreading the contributions across the market at different times.

Not sure if I'm going to do this heavy contributions to an IRA every single year in the future (although I crunched the numbers and it is appealing), but I want to at least get it started here.

New question: how do I setup an IRA? I have my company 401k account with Prudential, but I would want to setup the IRA, not sure if I should do it with them. I would target index funds for a safer investment in this area.",finance

Please tell me if my appraisal makes sense:

&amp;#x200B;

Inventory is low and demand hasn't gone down much.  So prices are staying high for those who do sell.

&amp;#x200B;

If we assume that demand continues to remain high, what evidence is there that housing prices will come down?

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps due to economic conditions, more people will be forced into selling, driving down prices.

&amp;#x200B;

Also possible is that we introduce (further) legislation to halt foreclosures.  Since banks are locked into their unprofitable investments, they will have less available cash to lend.  But since the Fed is printing more money and lending it to banks, the banks can continue to lend, which (the Fed hopes) will promote economic recovery (at the expense of an enormous addition to our national debt.)

personalfinance,Student Loans and Parents,"I hope this is the right subreddit for this type of question.

To give some context, I just finished my freshman year at an engineering school, where I am studying computer engineering. My parents are quite well off and helping me pay for the pricy out of state tuition and expenses (I didn't get any good in-state offers), but not all of it. We made the decision for me to attend the out of state university together, and laid out a solid financial plan, where the total cost would be split 30% from my father, 30% my mother, and 40% in student loans, with maximum federal loans and the rest private loans cosigned by my father.

I recognize this is a huge responsibility and spent many months agonizing over the decision before deciding to attend, but ultimately decided it was the best thing to do for my future goals.

Anyways, we all agreed that this would be doable as my mother and father both work, have a decent amount of savings, and are not financially burdened in any other way besides me and my brother's university expenses (though he is almost done). 

Fast forward one year, and I realized my mother did not pay anything towards the tuition and allowed my father to pay 60%. She works and makes a decent amount of money, but she basically makes my dad pay for most of their expenses, and she doesn't touch anything else. She really wanted me to go with this university and basically convinced my dad that it was the best thing to do, but now does not want to pay a dime. When I confronted her about this and told her it was unfair to my dad, she claims he has a much larger retirement account than her and feels he should be able to pay for my university alone (He is a bit older than her, so nearing retirement). She is not very financially literate, but she does make a lot of money. 

This is putting my father in a tough situation, where he is paying for my university, my brother's university, most of their other expenses, such as a mortgage that is almost paid, utilities, most of the car debt, and trying to max his 401k contributions, as well as cosigning for my private loans. I hate the fact that my dad is in this situation, but I don't know what else I can do. Should I try to convince my mother to pitch in what she can? Both of them are otherwise content and do not mind me going to this university, and so I would really rather not drop out or go somewhere else, especially considering my graduation would likely be delayed another year. I also do not want to go into any more debt than planned just to make things easier for my father. I would appreciate any advice you guys can give me. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Better appraisal than anticipated...does that mean any better terms for me?,"I'm not sure if this is best place to post this, but I had been following along an appraisal value thread and then all this happened.

I just got my appraisal today for our cash out refi and it came in significantly more than I thought it would or that I needed.  Appraised at $213, refi for $145 (\~20k of that cash out).  That being said, should I be expecting or asking for anything BETTER due to the LTV being better than anticipated?  I know (think) there's a difference in terms offered between 85% vs 80% vs 75% etc.  With the LTV being 68% should I be getting a better rate or something?  Most of these finance terms and interest rates are above my head, but I am trying to follow along.  Point is, I doubt the bank is going to be offering me something that would take $$ out of their pockets, but am I due something better being that we have a better LTV?

__________________

Wells Fargo


We added two positions in the quarter. One of them was megabank Wells Fargo.
The COVID-19 crisis caused a lot of pain for bank investors during the first quarter, and Wells Fargo
was no exception. In fact, the stock was dropping even before the virus reached NYC, down about
13% in January while the broader market was flat. WFC then proceeded to fall 47% to its lows on the
year around $25. We invested towards the end of the quarter, with an average price of ~$27.50.
What we saw in Wells Fargo was a bank with a long history of solid, growing earnings that is facing a
number of short- to medium-term problems:


Business-practice issues of its own making.


Potential COVID-19 related loan losses.


Falling interest rates.
We could fill many pages with discussion of the firm’s client relations and HR scandals -- opening
accounts for clients without their permission, putting wealth management clients in unsuitable
investment products, failing to respond to HR complaints, gender bias in hiring and promotion,
illegally repossessing borrower motor vehicles, etc. The market has punished the stock since these


The market has punished the stock since these issues came to light, with WFC underperforming peers by 50% since 2015.
Wells Fargo today reminds us of Facebook in Q4 2018 (which we wrote about here). In both cases,
investors unduly shunned a fundamentally sound company that made mistakes involving breaches of
customer trust. While admittedly reprehensible, the scandals at both FB and WFC are more impactful
to social media sentiment than to long-term free cash flows.


Availability bias causes human beings to place disproportionate weight on this type of story.
Breaches of customer trust rightfully disgust the public, and investors find it distasteful to be long a
company whose CEO is chastised by Congress. Our investment strategy is predicated on identifying
and exploiting these investor biases; we thrive on situations where short-term issues obfuscate the
underlying health and long-term earnings power of a business.


The vast majority of revenue for Wells Fargo is generated by interest on loans, and we don’t see much
evidence that the long-term volume or credit quality of these loans have been a!ected by the
scandals of the past three years.


In fact, Wells Fargo’s relationship with consumers and businesses appears to be healthy. All of the
following key metrics are flat-to-up since 2016: loans (flat), deposits (flat), customer checking
accounts (+3%), debit card purchase volume (+21%), consumer card purchase volume (+17%),
commercial card purchase volume (+28%), and branch visit satisfaction score (+3%). But even these
figures understate the health of WFC’s business: the lack of growth in the loan book is due entirely to
an asset cap put in place by regulators to punish the company for its transgressions. If not for that
cap, loans and deposits would almost certainly have grown.


For this 168-year-old franchise, we paid less than 7 times trailing earnings.
We do expect those earnings to fall in the short term as COVID-19-related loan loss provisions hit the
income statement. However, WFC’s balance sheet and core profitability provides plenty of margin to
absorb these losses. Wells Fargo’s net charge-o!s peaked at 2.2% of average loans outstanding during
the financial crisis. While this level of net charge-o!s would’ve been enough to wipe out last year’s
earnings, it would not have impaired the firm’s book equity (assuming that dividends and buybacks
were suspended temporarily).


Our base case is that the current crisis will be extremely sharp in the short term, but not worse than
the financial crisis in the long term unemployment, home prices, and loan defaults.
For one, consumers are in a better position. In 2008, debt service payments (mostly due to high
mortgage payments) were over 13% of disposable income. Today, that number is below 10%. US
households’ equity in their homes has doubled since year-end 2008, to almost $20 trillion today.
Second, the banking sector -- whose meltdown exacerbated if not caused the 2008 crisis -- is much
better capitalized, with Tier 1 common equity ratios up from about 8% in 2007 to 12% today.2
Interest rates have fallen substantially -- mortgage rates, for example, have fallen by about half a
percent in the last year -- and thus Wells Fargo will generate less net interest income. Current Street
estimates are for $43.9b in net interest income, a decline of $3.3b versus 2019. Given that lower
interest rates are prevalent across the yield curve, we expect this to continue for the foreseeable
future.


However, we believe Wells Fargo has a significant opportunity to o!set much of that lost income by
cutting costs. The firm’s efficiency ratio,” the ratio of non-interest expenses to revenue, has become
one of the worst in the industry in recent years. Partly this is due to the firm’s regulatory problems,
which we estimate have cost $5b per year in legal fees, settlements, and compliance costs. As they
put these issues behind them, we think they should be able to achieve an efficiency ratio similar to
their peers at JP Morgan and Bank of America. This implies they may be able to shed $8-10b of total
costs, which would more than o!set the lost interest income from lower rates. Management has
stated that they are focused on this task.


Over time, we estimate that WFC will be able to generate about $15-18b of profits per year, only
slightly lower than the $18-20b they generated between 2017 and 2019. The stock trades at 6-7.5x the
new earnings level, which we find quite cheap given the long-term stability of the business and the
stickiness of client accounts.",finance

cybersecurity,Why is public wifi terrifying?,"I understand that https has its flaws. For example the attacker can see that it is https traffic.

Downgrade could work but would be visible as there would be no lock in the address bar (and technically it would be http over public wifi). DNS could let attacker get on path, but given its public wifi (and adversary might be the owner), they are already on path. Trying to pretend to be the other website before or without downgrade would not work unless you have spoofed certificates which ( I think) not trivial to get unless major CA messes up (ie it could work while lets encrypt did not revoke certs).

ethereum,How To Maximize Profits From Liquidity Provision,"Jelly Swap releases new market making software in order to maximize the profit from the spreads and to make the market more competitive. It is an automated software is called Butler and comes as an easy to set up desktop application for liquidity provision. To earn as a market maker is one of the most profitable ways in the crypto sphere and Butler works in a different manner than Uniswap and other exchanges which makes things even better.   


Have a look at the advantages of Butler:  


\- As a market maker you will be free to choose the spread (rather than Uniswap where the spreads are fixed) Thus, the rates provided on Jelly will be much more flexible than other platforms.  


\- Market makers will earn bonuses from our incentive program - 12.6% annualy for the first 100k liquidity provided (the highest interest rate out there)  


\- Funds for liquidity provision are used only on demand. This means that market maker's funds will not be locked and he can meanwhile use them for other purposes. (all other platforms will lock your funds for a certain period of time)  


\- Cross-exchange liquidity provision - market makers will be able to rebalance their portfolios on other centralized platforms and thus solve the problem with impermanent loss  


There is one disadvantage we have to mention: every market maker has to operate the node and keep it up and running all the time or with short downtimes.

Nintendo could come out with new hardware, however the Switch in its current iteration is selling so well, Nintendo can't risk ""rocking the boat"", and losing the momentum of sales, or disenfranchising their early adopters. In the same way the almighty US government can't risk ""rocking the boat"", if they were to attempt to ban Bitcoin, they'd send that tech innovation elsewhere to a more favorable jurisdiction. Not only that, but the innovation moves back underground, and Bitcoin becomes is even more of a threat when priced in Bitcoin. US Fed can only do what they know best, and that is to print more money, which is insane in itself, but assures the longterm suitability for a ""hard money"" like Bitcoin. Eventually the things money buy will be priced in Satoshi. 1 Satoshi for a loaf of bread, 666 Satoshi for an ounce of gold. In that way Bitcoin retains it's purchasing power. Even IF a government bans the sale of Bitcoin, we as a community shift the paradigm, and price goods in Bitcoin. The government WILL ban Bitcoin, eventually. Assume this to be true. Get ready in anticipation for said event, and acquire Bitcoin before the exchanges go offline. To me, that's when the real revolution happens. Traders be damned.",cryptocurrency

investing,Easy reading breakdown of DKNG as it soars,"Disclosure: This is not a comprehensive breakdown, and it's not meant to be. Just some key points and context that I thought you'd find interesting. 

**DraftKings is technology stock meets gambling**

Three main products: Daily fantasy sports or DFS, Sportsbook, iGaming

DFS is OG DraftKings. Fantasy sports are where players make fantasy teams and battle each other to win money. However, sportsbook is where the money is: betting actual money on actual sports against the house. iGaming is basically an online casino with some online games you can gamble on, in addition to the classics like blackjack and Russian roulette.

In addition to DraftKings, there’s also SBTech, the online gambling technology company that had an arranged marriage as part of the DKNG merger.

**Landmark Case**

In 2018, the Supreme Court knocks down the federal law prohibiting sports gambling throughout the United States. Pandora’s box is open. Each state has to decide what it wants to do with gambling on its own. 

**The Path to Legalization**

[Map of Sportsbook legality](https://sportsbook.draftkings.com/help/sports-betting/where-is-sports-betting-legal)

DFS legality is more widespread

Currently, 36% of the USA population lives in a state with some form of legal gambling and 24% in a state with legal online gambling. The population living where DraftKings is live or going live is only 13% of the country. There’s a lot of ground to cover. 

NJ is the posterchild for sports betting legalization at the moment, and it’s DraftKings promised land. Generating 30% of DraftKings total revenue, it is a testament to the money waiting to be made if sports betting is made fully legal. 

**The Risks for DraftKings**

Regulation: Gambling is a money-maker, but it’s also a social disease. States will want to cash in with taxes of 6.8 to 36% but it will be a tough battle to make it happen. And that battle will unfold state by state. Just like with the marijuana industry, the fate of the market is undeniably shaped by how legalization unfolds. It could end up being a niche hobby in select states, or it could end up like gambling in the United Kingdom, where there’s a gambling shop on every corner. Or there could be a huge gambling market, but one that is monopolized by the States exclusively. If they’re going to allow gambling, why not take all the profits, right?

Competition: FanDuel and DraftKings once considered a merger before the FTC played tough. Now, together they own 95% of the DFS market in the USA with a slight majority going to DraftKings. However, there will be fierce competition as new states open up, and missteps could be stifling for either company in the early stages. The lifeblood fueling this battle? Cold hard cash burned up in advertising and incentivizing dollars. Maybe it’s not as bad as Uber since gambling has a chance at being profitable, but if you don’t like to see money burning, think twice about entering the online sports betting market over this coming decade. 

Technology: The hardware of gambling is a liability. Paying for the bandwidth needed at the exact moment of a match when everybody checks their bet is expensive. Payment processing, user validation, server hosting, sports data, app store placement: these are all areas of vulnerability and cost that you can minimize but can’t eliminate. With SBTech in the fold, having complete vertical integration is the aim and strength of DraftKings. 

The House Always Wins…Usually: Writing bets means risk. Thankfully, the DFS is player versus player, so DraftKings always wins, taking something like EDIT: up to 15% of what players put in. It's a bookkeeper's wet dream. But Sportsbook and iGaming have classic gambling risks which should be fine over the long-term. 

**The Good Side (and Oh God They’re Beautiful)**

Growth Potential: It’s a technology stock. The PE Ratio is over 600. When you buy DraftKings, you’re buying the dream of an America where gambling is as American as the Ford F150. A matured Sportsbook market in the USA would be around $20 billion, about $85 per adult. It’s a beautiful untapped (and non-existent) market with lots of money waiting to be taken. With Coronavirus, the slice of the sports betting pie that goes digital is bound to be more than ever before, if the sports happen

COVID19: The only thing that can stop a sports betting company from making money is getting rid of sports. Thankfully, new sports like Table Tennis, eSports, and a host of other betting topics have allowed DraftKings to get by. With lots of cash on hand ($450 million plus) and a monthly burn of $15 million, there’s enough to weather the storm. And if sports reopen with empty stadiums, fans may turn to online gambling to get their authentic sport experience. 

Turnaround Time: The largest expense that DraftKings has is conquering new markets. Every time a state opens up, it’s a massive investment. That’s why analysts and executives don’t think DraftKings will run net positive for years to come. However, DraftKings experience in New Jersey has shown an average turnaround time of about two years is all it takes to recoup their initial investment when entering a new market. Some pretty tasty data to have coming in. 

**The Numbers**

Revenue was up to $323 million in 2019 from $226 million and $191 million the years prior. NJ made up $86 million of that, growing by 8.5x after sports betting legalization in late 2018 to make up over a quarter of revenue in 2019.

Net loss however was $146 million in 2019 from $76 million and $73 million the years prior. Cost of Revenue was $103 million, Sales and Marketing was $185 million, Product and Tech was $55 million, and General and Administrative was $124 million of that. DraftKings has never been in the green. They attribute the accelerated burn in 2019 to growth in new markets so whether its aggressive or reckless is up to you. To be fair, if you’re investing in this stock, you should be expecting them to burn every single dollar they get at this point. 

Average monthly unique players was up to 684k in 2019 from 601k and 574k with the average revenue per monthly unique player up to $39 from $31 and $28. As of March 31st 2020, there were 720k monthly unique players with average revenue of $41 per. So continued growths in the midst of the early Coronavirus pandemic. Q2 will be revealing for certain.

The stock just skyrocketed to $34+ yesterday meaning a market cap of over $10 billion and a PE ratio of over 600. Take it for what it’s worth to you.

**Some Quirks**

DraftKings revenue is seasonal. Q4 is the best when the NFL and NBA coincide, with Q3 and Q1 being roughly equivalent, and Q2 basically being garbage. With COVID mainly taking out Q2, perhaps there’s hope for sports by Q3 and Q4 to hit those high-earning months? 

Controlled Structure: You get 1 vote for 1 stock, but CEO and Founder Jason Robins gets 10 votes for each stock. So whatever you do, he has 90% of the voting power. Good for long-term growth in a highly reactive landscape, but being powerless is never a fun feeling. 

SBTech offers B2B solutions for other gambling companies looking to offer online sports betting and iGaming, so there’s that added benefit. In fact, the share of B2B has been growing from 1% in 2018 to 5% in 2019, so some diversification is happening.

personalfinance,Moving back in with my parents and thinking through my financials.,"Hi all, I (25M) live in a high COL area. My roommates and I all have jobs that are WFH until 2021, and since I'm the only one left in the apartment, we have agreed to end our lease. For personal reasons this means I need to move home until the end of summer, at least.

**Salary:** low-mid $60k range, taking home approximately $3,200 monthly post-tax.

**Debt:** $28k in student loans, all federal. Obviously no interest right now, but generally about 4.1% across the board.

**Savings:** I hit $2k in savings last month after starting to budget for the first time in 2020. I have been putting away about $400-500 during shelter in place, and $100-$200 prior.

Here are my questions, since for the foreseeable future my expenses will drastically decline:

1. This looks like the best time for me to open up a 401k. My employer does not match, but has profit sharing. How much should I be looking to put into a 401k monthly? 10%?

2. I have been paying off my student loans a bit more aggressively (15% more than the minimum payment) as I've had the extra cash and it all goes toward the principal. Since this is my only debt, should I continue to do this? Should I start paying double?

3. This situation is only going to be temporary, but my name will obviously no longer be on the lease for my apartment. Should I change my billing address on my bank account back to my parents' address?

4. What benchmarks should I be looking to hit in my savings at this time? I'm positive I can put at least $2k per month in savings while I am home, even if I am doubling my student loan payments. I will eventually need to get an apartment back in my HCOL area.

5. Is there anything else I should be thinking about that I haven't covered in my questions?

Thanks all.",finance

personalfinance,Buy and Sell..... Sell then buy....Rent home &amp; buy.... How to invest in home purchasing the right way????,"Ok.....
Married couple in Phoenix AZ, 1 toddler and 1 on the way. 
Our current home is getting crowded and we're ready for a new neighborhood.

Current mortgage:  $84k ($800 per month) 
Estimated Listing Price: $325k 
Estimated Monthly Rental Rate: $1800.00 

Loan Pre-approval: $510k 

We have zero debt. 

Ideally, we'd like to use the equity of this home for a new home. Approximately 220k deposit. 
But buying with Contingency is almost impossible. 
We have savings and can put 10% down until our home sells, then recast the loan or wait a few months and try to refinance. 

10% down = higher monthly mortgage AND PMI
20% down= nearly unrealistic and would destroy us until our house sold 

In the end, we are aiming for a 15 year mortgage with 2.5% ..... IF at all possible. (220k down keeps our monthly payment reasonable) 

We could sell our home now and rent until something comes along to increase our purchasing power and have a stronger offer than 10%.... But that seems insane with a toddler and a new baby on the way. Moving twice and not knowing how long we could go without a stable home. 

Phoenix market doesn't appear to be slowing down. And interest rates seem stable despite being so low. 
Homes being listed are usually under contract in 48 hours. 
Real estate agent says that SO many people are fleeing CA and coming in with full cash offers above market price and that many homes are gone in 24 hours. 

It's the perfect time to sell.... But miserable &amp; stressful time to buy. 

So I'm not sure if we should continue living in this home and keep saving up for a bigger down payment. And evaluate again in a few months or a year. 

Sell this house now and keep looking. 

Rent this house. ( would be nice rental income, but is the juice worth the squeeze? Upkeep, dealing with renters, foregoing the equity for a deposit) 


We are pretty clueless when it comes to investing. We have money in the bank but it's not earning us anything extra. I figured real estate is the best option....? Especially with the desire to move and rates so low.",finance

That’s despite having accepted government aid as part of the $2.2  trillion CARES Act on the condition they won’t lay off or cut worker pay  rates through Sept. 30.' If you notice though this article doesn't say anything about the airlines agreeing to not cut hours, but only their hourly wage rates. 

...

Democrats, [with the urging of unions](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/17/coronavirus-airline-aid-must-include-worker-protections-unions-say.html),  pushed to give airlines financial support in hopes of supporting an  industry that employs close to 750,000. Providing federal grants to  protect workers was a particularly politically thorny issue. Lawmakers  were criticized for granting airlines similar relief after the Sept. 11.  2001, attacks, only to leave some workers holding the bag. 

... 

""Delta has reduced nonflight attendant and pilot work schedules, such as  ground workers, by 25%. Those reduced schedules are set to continue for  several months. '

...

""House Democrats want Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to explain why  airlines are . . . cutting workers’ hours after they  received portions of $25 billion in government coronavirus relief funds  aimed at maintaining worker payroll.' The answer is because you let them by voting for the bill without reading it. So much for the supposed 'smart party'.

But I personally would like a safety valve on the 50% that’s in. Something more than just stop losses. Something that will save me from taking too massive a hit should the bottom fall out, and I had an idea. So please tell me what you think:

*So first, I buy 50x shares of VIXY and 100x shares of SVXY. SVXY is a half-leveraged inverse VIXY. Then I sell short-term covered calls on SVXY because even though I expect it to rise, I don’t expect it to rise quickly. I can then use that money to buy short-term puts at the same expiry. So if the market takes a dive, VIXY should spike, SVXY should drop half as much, and my puts gain value. The bigger the market drop, the more it makes. And it’s paid for by the calls I’m selling. The loss in value of the SVXY shares I’m holding should be negated by the gain in value of the VIXY I’m holding. And if I do this with the 50% of money that’s currently sitting in cash, I haven’t pulled money from participating in the rally to do it.*

*Am I thinking about this right? Would this be a way to break even/make a small amount of money with this 50% that’s sitting in cash right now during a rally, and get a big payout if the market takes a dive? It seems almost too good to be true, so I’d love some input. If there any holes in my logic please point them out. Is there a way to improve this?*",finance

personalfinance,Question about refinancing from 30 to 15 year loan,"I am considering taking advantage of the low interest rates at the moment and am currently considering my options for a 15 vs 30 year loan. Here are some relevant metrics:

- I have 29 years left on my current loan at 4.375% with 288K in principal remaining.

- It appears I can qualify for 3.875% for 30 year vs 2.75% for the 15 year loan. Note I've chosen these rates because the credits I'd receive mostly pay the refinance costs so switching over is essentially free.

- My current monthly all-in is $1648, the new 30 yr is $1542, and the 15 yr is $2142

I think that refinancing to one of these options is basically a no-brainer considering the cost is mostly paperwork, but what I'm struggling with is the 15 vs 30 year. 

If I were to take the 15 yr loan, I'd pay $63K in interest over the course of the loan. However, if I took the new 30, and paid the $600 difference every month towards principal, I'd end up at $103K in interest. Is the $40k difference in interest worth the flexibility to make lower payments if needed and/or retain cash for other investments or purchases? 

I work for a large corporation in a steady demand field so luckily I'm not worried about job security during these times, but I wonder if the flexibility for a ""what-if"" situation is worth not fully optimizing my interest payments",finance
fintech,Feedback on new investment product,"Hi everyone! I wanted to get your feedback on a new investment idea that we have been working on and that we started to open up for external users: [Lendary](https://www.lendary.net/). 

The product focuses on an interesting niche opportunity, i.e. automated lending of USD to traders on crypto exchanges. Unlike traditional stock brokers, some crypto brokers allow external capital providers (like you and me) to provide traders on their platform with short-term capital so that they can engage in leveraged trading. Since traders can never withdraw the borrowed money from the platform and all of their positions are fully controlled by an automated liquidation system, default risks are almost zero. At the same time, daily interest rates on those platforms are relatively high and compound to \~10-30% per year if your capital is utilized optimally. 

In order to do that, we have written a software that automates and optimizes this lending process 24/7. Our solution works as a managed account solution where users create their own account on a crypto exchange and then sign up for our software. It is sufficient to hold USD so users are not affected by crypto volatility themselves. Also, everyone can withdraw their capital almost on a daily basis because loans run for 2 days maximum. 

Would be awesome to get your feedback on this! 

Thanks, 

Frank",finance

personalfinance,Don’t Pay Off Your House Early?,"I posted this in Financial Independence, which told me to post this here. Go figure. 

Long post with math and a lot of assumptions incoming:

TDLR: It seems like paying the minimum on a home and investing in index funds yields a higher net worth than fully paying off your home and not investing until after you pay off your home. But the figures blur if you want to obtain multiple rental properties. Which strategy do you prefer?

The math,

Attacking the housing expense is important because it’s typically the largest expense, after taxes, in the average budget. Pay it off soon and freeing up the money to plow into index funds makes sense, right?

So the question is: should you buy your own home and pay it off quickly or pay the minimum and plow the rest into index funds?

Side note: Forget house hacking for a moment (renting rooms to lower your mortgage or buying a multifamily house to get others to pay the mortgage for you).

I’m also trying to determine if paying off two houses (one to live mortgage free and the other to use as a rental to fund my expenses) would get me to financial freedom before the traditional index-funds-investing-and-the-safe-withdrawal-rate-of-4% strategy.

So,

Would it be smart to pay off the house first before plowing money into index funds so that you can eliminate the largest expense earlier on?

Say you’re looking to buy a $400k house (California). Plowing $5,000 per month (dual income with spouse and using 50% - 60% of our income to get to $5,000 per month) will pay it off in 6.67 years. It would perhaps take longer due to the mortgage interest rate, but say that you pay nominal interest over the years for paying it off so aggressively, just to illustrate the concept here. Forget for a moment if your situation is different, the math is still interesting.

OUTCOME #1 --&gt; At the end of 6.67 years you’d have a fully paid off $400k house and no index funds. So we'll use this situation as a baseline metric to refer back.

But, if instead you pay minimum, say $2,300 per month, you could put around $2,700 in index funds over the same period.

At the end of 6.67 years, you’d either have one fully paid off $400,000 house (forget appreciation in this example) and no index funds, or $184,092 ($215,908 to go) in house equity (forget the down payment on the $400k home for a moment) and $272,237.60 in index funds (assuming a 7% return after inflation).

OUTCOME #2 --&gt; So in theory you could pay off the rest of the $400k home at that time and still have $56,329.60 left over (ignore pre-payment penalties for the moment)(also ignore if the market does better or worse over that period of time). This yields a higher net worth than outcome #1.

Right here we can determine that paying the minimum and investing the rest is more lucrative because you would have a fully paid off $400K home and $56,329.60, rather than only a fully paid off $400K home. 

The question then becomes: do you pay off your house or continue to pay the minimum and let the index funds grow?

OUTCOME #3 --&gt; It would take another 7.8 years to pay off the rest of the house with minimum payments of $2,300 per month. At the end, you would have a fully paid off $400,000 house plus $791,773.48 in index funds. At the safe withdrawal rate of 4% per year you’d be able to live on $31,670.94 per year with the index funds with no mortgage and you’d have a $400k house. It would have taken you 14.47 years. This is the best outcome for net worth if you wanted to wait 14.47 years.

OUTCOME #4 --&gt;But, if you paid off the house after the 6.67 years and started over, you have a $400,000 house and $707,162.62 at the end of 14.47 years (starting with $56,329.60 and contributing $5,000 per month for 7.8 years). You’d have $84,610.86 less in net worth if you used this strategy over continuing to pay the minimum and continuing to invest in index funds (outcome #3). But there are certainly certain intangible benefits here, such as the comfort of a fully paid off home and less risk in the stock market.

So I guess the math supports not paying off the house and simply paying the minimum if you value the stress of continuing to pay mortgage to be at least great as $84,610.86 (the amount of increased net worth for continuing to pay the minimum).

But,

The strategy becomes interesting after 6.67 years if you buy a second, rental property. Say instead you pay off the $400k house. Then buy a second rental property with the $56,329.60 as a down payment. Say you throw in an additional $3,670.40 from savings or family and you put 20% down on a $300k property and rent it out so that it pays for itself (not even cash flow). It’s a 30 year fixed.

So say at the end of an additional 7.8 years you have an additional 62,400 paid off on property number 2 (30 year loan, 240,000 left after down payment, tenants pay $8k per year x 7.8 years) and total equity would be $122,400 (total pay down plus down payment) (also forget vacancy and cap ex stuff for a moment) (also forget depreciation and taxes for this example).

You’d have $611,678.72 in index funds (7.8 years plowing $5,000 per month starting a $0 after paying off house number 1 in year 6.67), a fully paid off $400k house and $122,400 in equity on house number 2.

Outcome #5 --&gt; If you paid off property number 2 at that time with the index funds, you’d have to pay $177,600. At that point, you’d have a $400k paid off house, a $300k paid off rental property that you could now use to live off the cash flow, plus $434,078.72 in index funds (which will give you $17,363.15 a year at a 4% withdrawal rate). You’d supplement this with the housing rents from your rental property.

So which strategy would you all prefer based on the above options (Numbers 1 - 5)? 

P.S. These calculations ignores taxes. However, I'm sure that there would be profound differences when they are factored in. There would be capital gains taxes on the stock sales, which you would use to pay off the homes. The homes might have pre-payment penalties. Additionally, choosing rental properties would allow you to utilize depreciation expenses and cost-segregation to lower your taxable income plus you could utilize the mortgage interest deduction for longer. Additionally, equity in property could be used as ""springy debt"" so that you could probably obtain a HELOC loan to pay for anything major. Plus there is the intagible cost of the feeling of having a paid-off home and diversification in real estate and index funds (case study: Covid-19). If taxes and emotions were factored in, my intuition says that option #5 would be the best option. 7% returns in the stock market are also not guaranteed, but paying off debt (mortgage) does have a guaranteed return of not paying the interest.",finance

Bitcoin,"I didn't realize what people meant when they said ""When the time comes, you won't have to sell your Bitcoin"", Until Now:","The one thing people don't realize Bitcoin is for. You can take out loans on it. So in 10 years when you want a house, or duplex, or triplex, or apartment, or business; you can take out low interest rate loans for them with your Bitcoin, and buy that house, or rental property, or business you want. Something you could never do before any other way. This is what Bitcoin does for you. It grants you the net-worth and financial access so you can have the ability to get loans you could never get approval for before. Something as small as 20$ a month for 1 year or more, 10 years from now, can get you a loan for that house, or business you want but could never afford, or get an approved loan for.

This is also better than selling your bitcoin for a property too. Because chances are, the Bitcoin will be a better investment value wise in the long run, so collateralizing it let's you keep your coin, and get your property, or business. Preferably a rental property, or solid proven business so it pays itself off.

\&gt;Edit: A little example of how I realized this lesson the hard way. I lost a bit over 100 million dollars worth of Bitcoins in today's value by selling off almost 1.5 times the value of my first rental property that I'll most likely never recoup. The rental property was 3.87 million at the time, and I had to sell over 5 million dollars worth in Bitcoins at an average of 500$ a coin price in 2015 to acquire it. That was a little over 11 thousand Bitcoins I had to sell for the property. I had to sell off that much because I had to pay off the capital gains tax for selling the Bitcoins in the first place, and still have enough left over to pay for the rental property after capital gains taxes were paid. Since then, I learned my lesson seeing what my coins would've been worth today, and am never making that same mistake again. On my second rental property, I used some of my remaining Bitcoins as collateral to take out a low interest rate loan for it, and sold a smaller amount of Bitcoins so I could make a down-payment on the property. I've already recouped the small amount I sold off in Bitcoins for my down-payment on the second property too with the rental income from both properties.

\&gt;The rental income on the second property is 4 times the cost of the mortgage payment every month, so I keep 75% of the rent as profit, and the other 25% that pays off the mortgage. That 25% that pays off the mortgage is a write off too, a perpetual write off at that. It's a write off I get to use on every years taxes that I have to pay on the first property's, and second property's rental income since they're owned under the same entity. And best of all, I still own all my Bitcoins used for the second property, and more now. Unlike the huge loss in Bitcoins I have for the first property's flat out purchase that I'll probably regret for the rest of my life. Learn from me.

 **The consensus out there seems to be, “don’t worry, the Fed has your back.” …There’s only one problem with that is our analysis says it’s not true… I stated earlier that the Fed has increased their balance sheet from four trillion to eight trillion. While they’ve done that, the Treasury Department, I’d say the budget deficit estimate for this year has gone from maybe a trillion a year ago to three-and-a-half trillion… So in March and April alone, the Fed net of Treasury issuance, to pay for the new spending, created a trillion in QE more than Treasury issuance. So it’s the biggest liquidity injection relative to history I’ve ever seen… The problem is as you look forward, because the Treasury deficits are not only still gonna be there, they’re just rolling out aggressively now the financing of them, the Fed front ran this with their actions of a month or two ago and so what the Fed bought was a trillion more than treasury issued. What’s going to happen now is Treasury issuance has caught up with the Fed and if they stick to the schedule they’ve outlined the net difference between those two actually goes to zero in May and net borrowing by Treasury relative to Fed purchases in June very minor, pretty much flat through September. And then liquidity shrinks as far as the eye can see as the Treasury borrowing crowds out not only the private economy but even overwhelms Fed purchases… That leads me to believe… the risk for reward for equities is maybe as bad as I’ve seen it in my career here.**",finance

We've estimated for the past year that with both of our part time minimum wage jobs and our $1500/semester university fees, it'll take my last 3 years of university and me getting a full-time, decent job for us to move out (and be able to pay most of our big expenses while she takes care of her personal stuff with her still meager salary).

personalfinance,Sidegig Tax Implications,"I currently have full time employment with a salary and W2. However, due to COVID-19, I am essentially on fully paid leave and am likely to remain this way for anywhere from 1 to 6 months. I am very fortunate to be in this situation and with all of my free time, I've been looking at getting a sidegig to keep me occupied and earn some extra $$$. I am primarily looking at delivering for a food delivery service (e.g. Postmates) or working online for Lionbridge. I understand that both of these positions are considered contract work and I will get a 1099 instead of a W2. I have a few questions for how this will impact my taxes next year.

&amp;#x200B;

1. What taxes will I have to pay on the money I make? Federal, state, FICA? Any I'm missing?
2. I understand I can make deductions from my expenses related to the work, such as adding up all of my miles driven (in the case of the food delivery) and multiplying it by the rate the IRS deems can be used - I've seen 0.58 listed elsewhere, e.g. 5,000 miles x $0.58 = $2,900 deduction. Am I understanding that correctly? Is there some list of what is allowable regarding deductions that can be linked?
3. Main Question - I normally take the standard deduction every year as it is far more than itemizing. Am I allowed to take the aforementioned deductions for work related expenses from my sidegig while still taking my normal standard deduction? Or is it one or the other? I understand itemizing vs. standard, but I wasn't sure how contract work or ""self employment"" factored into this.
4. At what point would I know if I need to be filing taxes quarterly? (I've seen this mentioned when discussing 1099 but know nothing about filing taxes at a frequency other than the normal once a year at tax time.)
5. I always self file my taxes on my own every year, usually with H&amp;R Block. I assume all of this is still relatively doable with a self filing software?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if any of this is obvious stuff, I just like to fully understand anything I'm getting into, especially when it comes to financial implications. Thank you for any and all explanations!😊",finance

investing,Norinchukin Bank loses $3.7b and halts investing in CLO market,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/japanese-farmers-foray-into-risky-u-s-debt-leaves-3-7-billion-hole-11590582336

&gt;The Japanese bank that was the biggest buyer of debt used to fund private-equity buyouts suffered a ¥400 billion ($3.7 billion) hit and said it would stop investing in that market.
&gt;Norinchukin Bank owns about 10% of the $700 billion market for corporate debt that was packaged into securities called collateralized loan obligations. Other big buyers include Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., which each owned about $30 billion worth of CLOs at the end of the first quarter.
Losses on these investments could hamper the banks at a time when bad loans are rising. They could also sour investors on CLOs, which bought roughly 60% of the debt that private-equity companies used for deals in recent years, according to the International Monetary Fund.
&gt;“We will limit making new investments” in CLOs, Chief Executive Kazuto Oku said.
&gt;Norinchukin’s ¥7.7 trillion ($71 billion) portfolio of CLOs was invested in the triple-A slices of these securities, and the loss dates back to the end of its fiscal year on March 31. The bank, which serves Japan’s farmers and fishermen, said the unrealized losses were offset by gains elsewhere in its portfolio.
&gt;The market has rebounded since the end of March, so its losses on CLOs have likely shrunk since then. Prices for the type of securities the bank owns were trading at 95 cents on the dollar March 31 and were nearly 97.5 cents in mid-May, according to data from Barclays. Neither JPMorgan nor Wells Fargo announced losses on their CLO holdings.

&gt;Until last year, Wall Street veterans had marveled at the outsize role played by the large but little-known Japanese bank in the market for CLOs. It was a sign of how Japanese financial institutions, faced with negative interest rates on their own government’s bonds and limited opportunities to lend, were searching ever farther afield for high-yielding investments.
&gt;Like most investors in the safe parts of CLOs, the banks are seeking extra yield for the same level of risk. That strategy blew up in the financial crisis when supposedly safe securities backed by mortgages caused big losses for banks.
&gt;CLOs have performed better, but as the market boomed, lending standards loosened. When the coronavirus pandemic hit, U.S. companies were carrying significant amounts of debt. What followed were bankruptcies of companies like Hertz Global Holdings Inc. and J.C. Penney Co. Moody’s Investors Service in April placed ratings on 859 securities from 358 U.S. CLOs, worth some $22 billion, on review for downgrade.

&gt;An important risk right now is that the mathematical models that created the safe securities didn’t take into account a scenario like the coronavirus pandemic, according to Rod Dubitsky, who headed U.S. asset-backed securities research at Credit Suisse until 2009.

&gt;Mr. Dubitsky argued back then that subprime mortgage-backed securities were due for a wave of downgrades, and he recently issued the same warning for triple-A rated CLO bonds. He argued in a recent paper that the securities don’t deserve such high ratings because of the impact of the pandemic on the economy.
&gt;“The entire concept of triple-A CLOs goes out the window because there is not much diversification left when the entire portfolio is subject to a global economy that is in deep recession,” Mr. Dubitsky said in an interview.
&gt;In recent weeks, ratings firms Moody’s, S&amp;P Global Inc. and Fitch Ratings have collectively placed more than 1,600 bonds from mostly lower rated CLOs on review for possible downgrades.

&gt;The rising risks in CLOs threaten to limit the biggest source of funding for private-equity buyouts and a source of funds for struggling companies that are owned by PE firms. If too many loans held by the funds are downgraded to the lowest levels, the funds may not be able to buy new loans, further tightening the lending markets.
&gt;Mr. Oku, the Norinchukin chief, sounded only slightly chastened by the losses, saying it was his job to extract return from the bank’s portfolio and pass it on to members.
&gt;“It is difficult to disagree with the opinion that we have to use member banks’ money more effectively instead of investing in overseas CLOs,” he said. “But we have to steadily try to make investments that are profitable.”
&gt;Mr. Oku didn’t say what specifically caused losses in his bank’s portfolio, but he held out hope that his holdings might keep their value even in a bad situation. The bank was stepping away from new investments in that market, he said.
&gt;“We will have to examine risks in two stages: how many U.S. companies will go bankrupt or file for chapter 11, and after that, in how many of these cases we will see AAA-rated CLOs being affected,” he said at a news conference.
&gt;For now, Norinchukin isn’t reflecting the CLO losses on its bottom line. Mr. Oku said the bank still had much larger unrealized gains in other parts of its portfolio and planned to hold the CLOs to maturity.
&gt;Norinchukin acts as a central pool for funds gathered by local farming and fishing cooperatives throughout Japan, and it holds about $600 billion in deposits from member cooperatives. It can use the money to make loans to companies in farming, forestry or fisheries, or it can simply invest it in global markets like any money manager, seeking returns to distribute to members.
&gt;Its problem for years has been a shortage of loan opportunities, leaving the money-management side of the business as the dominant one. The number of people working in agriculture as their main job has fallen 35% during the last decade, and those who remain are mostly over 65.",finance
personalfinance,"For mortgage application, better to pay off auto loan or save for down payment?","Hi everyone, 

I've done some research on this and the available information suggests there's a trade-off here with unclear advantage. In my specific context, I'm hoping to get some decision support. Thanks in advance!  

Summary: I bought a used car with financing in August '19. We want to apply for a mortgage in May '21. In our context, 20% down payment is not possible, but 8-12% will be.   

*Trade-off: Do we aggressively pay down auto loan principal by March '21, or do we save that cash for the down payment?*
  
Details: 
  
+ Auto Loan  
 + Remaining Principal: ~12,000  
 + Fixed Interest Rate (Simple): 4.3%  
 + Minimum Monthly Payment: ~500  
 + Loan Schedule: 11/36 mo. complete.  
 + Interest: ~$550 paid and ~$550 remaining, given we make the minimum pmts to term. (Interest portion of payments is based on remaining principal, similar to mortgage schedules. I.e., despite being less than 1/3 through the schedule, we've paid half the loan's interest.)  
 + Cash required to pay down early (by March '21): +$6k
+ Personal Finance  
 + Joint application, both employed w/ equal pay. Living together with mo. rent lower than expected mortgage. Engaged, will marry 1-2 years after buying home.   
 + Ages: 29 year olds
 + Location: Denver, CO, United States   
 + Debt to Earnings ratio: 10%  *If* we do not pay down auto loan principal before submitting the mortgage application. x&lt;1% If we do pay down principal.   
 + Credit Scores: 800 and 820  
+ Mortgage Info
 + Property Price: ~$500k  
 + Down payment (w/o paying off auto loan early: 10%, i.e. $50k  
 + Down payment (paying off early): 8% = 44k ($50k - $6k)  
 + Note: Regardless of down payment amount, we would not touch our 401k's or take out additional debt. Assume we each would still have a cash safety net equaling half or more of our yearly living expenses.   
  
So, to review - we have the options (i) of putting an extra 2% (6k) of mortgage principal toward the down payment or (ii) paying down an auto loan before the mortgage application.    

Given that we'll only save $300 in interest by paying the loan off early, the real question is this: which option will benefit us more for the mortgage?    

Thank you!",finance

investing,"Why are broad market index funds praised, when there are other mutual funds that have much higher annualized returns?","It is common to see index funds being recommended to the average investor and even some Vanguard and Fidelity are some of the [largest funds.](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/mutual-fund/top25largest) My question is, why do funds such as VFIAX or FXAIX receive so much praise over other funds such as my favorite FSCSX?

For example, comparing FXAIX which is Fidelity's S&amp;P 500 index fund, has an annualized return of 9.67% for the life of the fund. Compare that to FSCSX which has a 15.74% annualized return since the inception of the fund in 1985. A nearly 6% difference is enormous when it compounds, especially over 3 to 4 decades. This is just one example, you can find similar differences with other funds that track the S&amp;P 500 or Nasdaq (although Nasdaq funds seem to do better).

I understand expense ratios are one concern, and reasonably so. The expense ratio for FXAIX is 0.015% which is crazy low when compared to some of the 1%+ expense ratio for a lot of funds. Even so though, going back to my example, the 0.71% expense ratio for FSCSX does not close the gap between it and FXAIX.

Also, my example is not the rule. There are lot more funds that perform worse than the market and charge high fees. But there are options that *DO* perform better even with fees taken into account. Why are these funds not recommended more often?

Edit: So a lot of people have gave some good feedback. Risk is the reason why the sector focused funds aren't recommended as often, risk in the odds against the fund manager being consistent, and the sector outperforming the market in the long term. I think these are great reasons to not rely on sector funds. 

With that said, a lot of people are repeating the same point that an overwhelming majority of funds do not outperform in the long run. I thought I acknowledged this initially but I suppose it wasn't clear. I understand this point, but there are funds that *have outperformed over a long period of time.* I only provided one example, but there are plenty others. I agree the past does not guarantee the future, but I am confused at how quickly these funds are dismissed. These funds are not difficult to find, and the performance has been over decades not just the last 5 or 10. I would agree there are lots of good reasons to stick with Index Funds, but I'm unconvinced the funds I have been referring to are something to be scoffed at.",finance

personalfinance,Forbearance or Refinance?,"I'm in a situation where I need to take a forbearance on my mortgage. My current mortgage is a VA loan at 3.125%. I have already applied for forbearance but I think I would prefer to do a VA IRRRL refinance, as that would defer the first two payments and lower my monthly payment going forward. The issue is my interest rate is already so low, lenders aren't able to get a loan that will meet the VA requirements (reduction in interest rate of .5% or more AND the monthly savings for the first three years must be higher than the cost of the loan.)

I've already received a quote for 2.375% (2.599% APR) but even that is not low enough to qualify me for an IRRRL. So what are the odds we see interest rates lower than that within the next month? Also, my loan servicer said interest will be paused in forbearance.",finance
personalfinance,Fell for a spoofed email scam. What are my options?,"The wife and I just purchased a new home. We reached out to the previous contractor who did work on the home for some quotes on some additional work. The guy came out, surveyed our requests, and provided us a quote via email.

This is a ""good ol' boy"" contractor company here in the south. Their ""business webpage"" is an expired domain. Their ""business emails"" are yahoo and Gmail email addresses. They do have a brick and mortar location but they mostly operate via word of mouth. It still works for them so whatevs. They do good work and I guess their reputation alone has carried them into the modern tech age without having to rely on social media/SEO/etc.

So we look through the quote and decide what work from the list we want to be done. We reply back with this info. Contractor emails back saying that is fine...just initial next to the items that we want done, sign the contract, and send it back.

After we do this, we receive an email back requesting that we make an initial payment to ""cover for supplies"". I reply back saying OK and ask if they take credit cards/have a payment portal. He comes back and says that their payment processor is down and asks for direct bank payment (this should have been a red flag to me but I'm dumb). He requests payment via Zelle and gives an email address for some woman (red flag 2). I ask who this woman is and he says that it is a vendor. So I send the payment and he confirms it was received and that they will reach out to us early next.

Normally I'm pretty good about these things but since this is such a good ol' boy company, I just assumed that this is how they do things.

So this week we decide we want to get a few more quotes on other items from the contractor before he came for the initial work. So we reply back to the same email chain and the guy replies back with a new contract with prices on these additional items. Same letterhead, same format, etc. We tell him that we want a couple more things done and he requests an additional up-front payment to a totally different Zelle address. At this point, I am starting to feel uneasy about this whole thing.

My wife calls up the contractor to make sure nothing fishy is going on and he says that he hasn't heard anything from us in over a week. He said he sent out the initial quote over a week ago and saw us reply to what items we wanted to be done and that was the last he had heard from us.

So apparently someone had spoofed his email, was monitoring our convo, and was waiting for their time to interject in our convo, at which point they took over. We verified that it was the exact same email address. No hidden spaces, typos, etc.

We tell the contractor about what is happening and he has someone come out and check their computers/network out. They confirm with us that the spoofing did occur and we aren't the only clients of theirs that were affected by this apparently. They were completely blindsided by the whole thing.

I have notified our bank and they are performing an investigation. But from what I'm reading online, regulation e may not apply here since I did technically authorize the transaction (despite it going to the wrong person). I am hoping that me being a long-term customer of theirs will play some role but I'm not getting my hopes up.

I have also filed a police report. But I'm assuming that the money is probably long gone and when the police look into those accounts, they will be tied to fake IDs.

So assuming all of this plays out like I think it will, do I have any recourse to go after the business? Would their business insurance cover something like this? The spoofed email came as a result of lack of security measures in place on their end. Being a good ol' boy company using yahoo email addresses, they probably have all sorts of security gaps. And the fact that the email address was spoofed makes me think that a ""typical person"" would likely fall fo this same ploy. And the fact that other clients also affected is a further indicator of that.

Just wanting to know if I should have any hope of getting this money back.

Thanks",finance
personalfinance,Are there any disadvantages to CalHFA? (California),"Trying to buy our first home.

Also, he said that the property generally eligible are in a range that we are not targeting for.

Husband and I are currently waiting on underwriting during our VA backed mortgage application (with USAA) and every time we talk to our loan officer our closing costs seem to increase by about $1,500. Started at about $4,000 then we chose to buy more points to get a sub 3% fixed interest rate taking the estimated closing costs up to about $5,500. Fine, with the drop in P&amp;I with that interest rate it will pay for itself in about 20 months. Last Friday the appraiser came out and he said the house looked good to him for what we offered but we are still waiting on the official paperwork from the VA. Talked to our loan officer the Monday after and in passing mentioned our closing costs would be about $6,500, uhm ok?? Just spoke to him again today and when I asked about closing costs he said they are estimating around $8,000. Excuse me! What in the world?! From the initial paperwork we were given with our estimated closing costs we figured $5,500 was a high estimate because we know some things like the title fees and termite inspection are lower for who we are actually going with.

investing,$DKNG Makes No Sense to Me - Lots of Thoughts,"DKNG has seen huge gains this week, mostly focused on Tuesday and today, Thursday. Both days saw intraday spikes on sports-world news: on Tuesday afternoon a presser with Gary Bettman was announced and on Thursday it was announced that the Premier League would return in June. Oddly, the stock did not move back down at all after Bettman’s announcement turned out to just be an expanded playoff format, and nothing about a return to the ice. The Premier League news didn’t seem to have much impact on other sports betting stocks either.

Both of these events point towards something that seems obviously clear: DraftKings’ stock is hugely overpriced, but seems to keep being driven up just by trading. I think there are cases to be made for short term bull or bear, and for long term bear. I’m already in on the long term bear case with Nov ‘20, Dec ‘20 and Jan ‘21 Puts that have all taken a beating, but debating what the profitable short term play is.

For some context, I used to trade bonds on one of the biggest desks in NY, but moved to be closer to family a while ago and run my own business. My state is not supported by DraftKings, so keep in mind when reading that I am a bit salty towards the company and their ability to sniff out VPNs. Been a long time lurker here, but this is my first post.

The company’s Q1 earnings was pretty enlightening and quite the spin job. I was shocked to see the stock rise that day after what I read to be a pretty poor outcome. Growth in marketing expenses can be written off as entering new states, but seeing no growth in net revenue despite 30% growth in gross revenue means that the company has a growth problem, in other words almost all the revenue growth was driven by giving away free bets and reducing vig. Let’s look further at revenue growth though.

I found it very interesting that the company led with “30% revenue growth” when, in fact, that was only at Old DraftKings, which makes up about 75% of New DraftKings revenue. SBTech makes up the rest and grew at only 3%, giving the public company a 23% growth rate for the quarter, not 30% - spin job.

The company also gave us an interesting insight into coronavirus’ impact on their business, maybe unintentionally. At Old DraftKings, they noted 60% growth through March 10th. If we assume each day through the quarter is equal, that means the last 21 days of the quarter would have been down 70% vs Q1 ‘19, that’s big. However, we know not all days are created equal in the world of sports, and Q1 included 5 NFL playoff days and the Super Bowl. If we assume NFL betting days are 3x a normal day and the Super Bowl is 3x a normal NFL day, you can see your way to revenue post-March 10th being down 95%. A similar look at SBTech’s drop from +19% to only +3% means revenue post-coronavirus is down at least by half.

Another interesting lens to use in looking at the company is how they pitched themselves when the merger was announced five months ago in December. On slide 22 they compare their valuation to a variety of comps, trying to show that the valuation is fair, probably trying to alleviate the fact that the valuation for DraftKings was about 4x what Paddy Power paid for FanDuel 18 months earlier. I’m going to ignore the “EV / 2021E Revenue – Growth Adjusted” multiple that they highlight, because adjusting a forward looking multiple based on your own forward looking growth projections is absolute garbage, and instead look at EV / TTM 3/31 Revenue for those same comps.

At $39 per share, DraftKings has a market cap a bit over $15 billion on TTM revenue of $451 million, giving them a revenue multiple of 33.7x. For those of you that haven’t been around the block a few times, that is outrageously high. The “High Growth Consumer Internet” category that they selected is at 8.1x and “EU Sportsbook Operators” at 3.6x. Their best comp is probably Flutter, which is Paddy Power + Fanduel + Stars, trades at 7.8x. DraftKings deserves a higher multiple than Flutter given that they are pure-play USA vs Flutter which has a lot of retail european revenue that isn’t high growth, but the two companies currently have the same market cap, despite FanDuel being a direct comp to DraftKings with more market share in the fast growing business segments. Even if you said DraftKings should trade at a 50% premium to Flutter, which is being very generous, that implies a share price of only $13.50.

I know what you’re going to say: “this is all about more states allowing sports betting.” Fine, let’s look at what would need to happen at the state-level to get DraftKings’ current valuation to be reasonable. Going back to the December investor presentation, DraftKings estimates their sports book net revenue at $2.3 billion given 25% market share and 65% of the US having online betting, with a 22% allowance for promos from Gross to Net. That let’s us back into $4.5 billion of gross revenue at 100% of the population. Let’s then give them a 30% bump on that for iGaming. Using the company’s current $15 billion valuation and the same 50% premium to Flutter’s revenue multiple above (11.7x) that means they need $1.28 billion of revenue, or $831 million more than they currently have. $831 million more revenue needed means they need 14% more of the population to legalize in the very short term. Of the big five states, CA, TX, FL, NY and PA, none are going to add any population, with PA already online, NY choosing retail-only and the other three being no where close to legalization and widely considered by researchers and lobbyists to be years away. The remaining 46 states, including DC, average 1.3% of the population each, meaning you need a windfall of states to add 14% of the population.

Don’t get started on nationally legalized sports betting, no one is even pushing for that and it is never going to happen. The SCOTUS repeal of PASPA was as much about taking away the Federal Government’s ability to make national decisions like allowing or disallowing sports betting as it was about sports betting itself. Sports betting will roll out throughout the US, but it is going to be a state-by-state slog.

Another thing to consider is what the company might do with its highly valued stock. As we saw with Tesla a few months ago, a big run up in stock price is a great time to do some financial maneuvering. I think there are two very good options for management right now. The first is obvious: follow-on equity offering. In going public via a reverse merger with a SPAC, DraftKings barely tapped the big institutional investors. A follow-on would be a great way to load up the coffers further - anyone that watched TV in 2015 knows they love to spend money on ads - at a very attractive valuation for the company. The problem with this is that new shares coming in, or the follow-on pricing poorly, could be a big drag on the current share price.

Another option might be a little less obvious, but I think could make a lot of sense for the company: Buy William Hill. William Hill currently has a market cap of about $1.5 billion. They have a huge footprint in Europe, a market that DraftKings previously tried and (largely) failed to enter, are a big threat to DraftKings’ DTC approach in the US and have the tech that powers much of the land-based casinos’ sportsbook operations in the US. DraftKings could buy them with their cheap stock, or issue new equity to raise money for the acquisition. DraftKings would add a ton of revenue, could cut lots of duplicated costs, diversify across geographies and sports to temper their seasonality, and replace WillHill’s outdated tech with their much better apps. The big downside is that the CEOs of the two companies seem to really dislike each other.

One reason that I think the stock could be up so much since the “IPO” is that there are a very small number of liquid shares. Remember that this wasn’t an IPO at all, it was a reverse merger with a SPAC, meaning that a much higher percentage of outstanding shares are currently locked up than would be in a typical IPO. That constraint on supply with big retail demand could be a huge driver in the stock gain.

Circling back to be three cases for what I think could happen:
- Short term bull: Sports come back, stock (irrationally) trades up on it
- Short term bear: Correction to a more realistic valuation, bulls taking gains, any of NHL, NBA, MLB announce they won’t play again in 2020, financial maneuvering by the company
- Long term bear: Correction to a more realistic valuation, bulls taking gains, any of NHL, NBA, MLB announce they won’t play again in 2020, financial maneuvering by the company, Q2 or Q3 earnings disappoint/are eye opening, any blip to the NFL cash cow, NBA or NHL ‘20-’21 season delays, lockup ending in October

Just giving my two cents on how I’m looking at this and trading it, and curious to hear any other thoughts or theories on real reasons why the stock is moving and where it is going.

Last thought: for those of you that like DraftKings at this price, you should LOVE Flutter at this price.",finance

personalfinance,IPG charging me more than what the manufacturer sells the device for.,"I had a medical device surgically inserted.  The device was provided by IPG.
2 months later I receive a bill from IPG.  On this bill, they submitted a claim to my insurance company for the contractually maximum allowed amount, roughly $1,400.
My insurance paid ~$1,100 and I am responsible for the remaining ~$300.

I called the manufacturer of the device and a representative gave me a **LIST PRICE** of $1,200.  Given this **LIST PRICE** figure, it's highly likely IPG paid far less than $1,200 per device.  (I actually found another site listing the device for $599!)

Can anyone give me any tips or tricks that I can use to reasonably talk them down from the $300 charge?  Remember, IPG has already received $1,100 from insurance.

As a side note, I'm a little miffed IPG submitted the **contractually maximum allowed amount** to my insurance company.  Almost all providers will submit their own (absurd) charge to insurance, the insurance company will add a discount and then the sum is the amount to be paid to the provider.  This totally smells of IPG doing all they can to receive a maximum payout.",finance

Paid for a new roof on our house, as well as remodels on a kitchen and our attic. The wife and I went through a period of overspending about 5 years ago and have since gotten far more disciplined primarily through the help of YNAB. I've paid off our credit card debt, and now, utilizing the r/personalfinance flowchart, I've moved on to bolstering my emergency savings to 3-6 months. Is it a terrible idea to ""save"" my 3-6 month emergency savings to the HELOC, knowing that I can access it if needed? I currently have around $10k in savings (emergency fund + annual real estate insurance and taxes + some other random savings), and if I put that into the HELOC I'd save about $500 a year in interest. This feels counterintuitive, but it also feels like a better way to use that money, than putting it in my Ally savings account generating 1.25% interest ($125 annually).

I know this is a dumb idea, but help me rationalize in my brain why...

&amp;#x200B;

Update: Well that really didn't take long. Thank you r/personalfinance for once again helping me understand why I rely on all of you for advice. I'll keep my savings and debt separate, and continue paying off the HELOC at the same rate (I've scheduled it so I pay it off at the same time as my mortgage in &lt;5 years) and once I have my 6 months of emergency savings built up, focus on eliminating that debt entirely.",finance

I currently have $210,000 in federal debt from my undergraduate and masters degree. On top of that, I have a credit score of 570s according to two bureaus. I have $6000 to my name. I have made some stupid errors during my young adult life, and took a lot of maturing on my way to being admitted to medical school. Now, I am seeking financial advice in order to overcome my situation. My medical school tuition is about 60K/year. I am applying avidly to many scholarships, and plan to work part-time during my first year of medical school. If I took just the amount in tuition, that's 240K added to my 210K, for a total of 450K, not including the interest that would accrue after I graduate. I assume I would end up with around 550K in debt after medical school. I have a low credit score, and feel trapped. I want to be a surgeon, but I feel that this debt would have me living at the poverty level for most of my adult life. What can I do to begin fixing this situation? I live away from home, so I would have to pay rent.

I am recording a capital gains loss of $3,000 from investments that lost value, so total income goes down to $15,135.

I've entered this info into both Turbotax and H&amp;R block software, and both services tell me that I owe $2,772 in federal tax. This seems way too much for the amount I earned in 2019.

Here's the federal summary Turbotax gives me:

|**Filing status**|Single       |Single|
|**Total income**|$42,941|$15,135|

|**Federal deductions**|  $12,032 |$13,810|

&amp;#x200B;

In 2018 I received a $3,271 refund ($6,844 was withheld, this was W-2 employment income). So that's paying about $3k in taxes on an income of $43k.

Now it's telling me for 2019 I owe $2,772 in federal tax on an income of $15k. This seems too high! Any help would be really appreciated... I'm confused about what's going on here.",finance
politics,Megathread: President Donald Trump signs executive order targeting protections for social media platforms,"President Trump signed an executive order on Thursday designed to limit the legal protections that shield social media companies from liability for the content users post on their platforms.

""Currently, social media giants like Twitter receive an unprecedented liability shield based on the theory that they are a neutral platform, which they are not,"" Trump said in the Oval Office. ""We are fed up with it. It is unfair, and it's been very unfair.""

The order comes after the president escalated his attacks against Big Tech in recent days — specifically Twitter, which fact-checked him for the first time this week over an unsubstantiated claim that mail-in voting drives voter fraud.

personalfinance,Advice please! How can I pay off my student loans?,"I have been following this page and you guys give great advice so please id love the suggestions.

What I need advice on: what should I do to pay off my debts (particularly my private loan) as quickly as I can. 

I have $33k saved up. Taking money out of my savings is always hard because I’ve worked hard to save up that much, but after looking at all my debt I decided I need to make a change. 

Here’s my situation:
$59k in private students at 4.1% ($680/month)
$24k federal (currently 0% for covid) ($288/month)
$10k car loan at 3.5% ($230/month) 

I make $26/hour + OT so I’d say around $3200 after tax a month (but normally more bc of OT) and I get a bonus every year. Yearly ~$60k. And I put 6% of my paycheck towards my 401k. 

I live at home, and have other smaller expenses like grocery shopping, subscriptions, etc. but the debts listed above are my main consistent monthly bills. I’m 24

After following this page I realized having a lot of savings doesn’t make much sense when I have a huge amount of debt, so I’ve begun throwing a lot of extra cash towards my private loans and with my federal loans on forbearance I’ve been taking that payment and putting it towards my private

My main question: how much of my savings should I take out and put towards my private loans? I’m torn between taking out a large chunk and wanting to keep my savings.  

Any additional advice would be appreciated. Thank you :)",finance

However, in January I needed my AGI from 2017 for something and when I asked my dad what it was, he had no idea. He said ""I didn't file your taxes for you. I only claimed you on mine and filed mine. You should have filled yourself and just listed yourself as a dependent."" I started freaking out because I had thought he filed them for me this whole time. I filled out a tax form online and mailed it in to Federal and State in January 2020. I tracked everything via UPS and they were received in March. I received a bill in April from State and paid it immediately. 

I still haven't received a bill from Federal and when I log into my IRS account it does not show anything is pending or that I have a balance. 

I have the money to pay it and really want to just get it over with. I am so stressed about this. 

How long should it take until I receive a bill? Is there a way to find out if they received it?

&gt; Summary
&gt; Uber has a significant cash problem, suffers high interest rates, and lacks a clear plan.
&gt; 
&gt; The underlying growth and future potential profitability do not justify the stock's current valuation.
&gt; 
&gt; CEO's statement and the company's aspiration to become the next Amazon fall short with reality.
&gt; 
&gt; I am bearish on Uber.
&gt; 
&gt; The past two-month rally has doubled Uber's (UBER) stock, which, in my view, is impossible to justify. Even at its 52-week low a little under 14$/share, I felt that its valuation is absurd, let alone at its current $34/share. Investors are pricing Uber under the impression that it's going to be the next Amazon (AMZN), as stated multiple times. Uber's CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has previously compared the company's business model with that of Amazon. By the end of the article, I hope that it will be clear why this is not the case, and why the stock is not worth $60 billion.
&gt; 
&gt; In this article, I will discuss:
&gt; 
&gt; Uber's cash burn rate and its impact on debt and equity
&gt; The company's lack of a clear strategy
&gt; The absence of exciting growth
&gt; The reason the stock's current valuation is unreasonable

I was a full-time college student in all of 2019 while working part-time from January - April 2019 in which my AGI was greater than $4200 (but less than $6K). However, I lived (and currently still live) with my older brother who is 24 years old and can be considered head of household because he provided over half the support for our parents and I in 2019. We are located in Illinois and all lived in his house for the entirety of 2019.

Our dad earned more than $12500 (but less than $20K) in 2019, but he only helped with groceries and otherwise only paid for his own car's lease. Our mom does not work and is a full-time housewife; therefore, she had no income in 2019.

I was wondering should I allow myself to be claimed on my brother's 2019 tax return as a dependent? I believe I am eligible as a qualifying child because I was 21/22 years old in 2019, a full-time college student, living with my brother for over half the year, and he technically provided over half my support (basically the shelter and utilities). Would it be more financially beneficial for me to not be claimed as a dependent so the return money (around $850) goes straight to me? How much would he potentially get from claiming me as a dependent? I have already received the first round of stimulus check money ($1200) because I could not be claimed as a dependent in 2018 and had not yet filed my 2019 taxes, so if I am claimed as a dependent for 2019, would that affect the stimulus check I have already received? My brother is okay with me not being claimed if it is more financially beneficial for us overall. I believe I cannot be claimed as my father's dependent because he did not provide over half my support in 2019.

On the other hand, how should I file my dad's return - married filing jointly? I do not believe my dad can be claimed as a qualifying relative on my brother's return because he earned more than $4200 in 2019, but my mom had no income so she may be eligible as a qualifying relative. Should I claim my mother as a dependent on my brother's return? Would it be more financially beneficial to claim her as a dependent on my dad's return instead, if possible?

Lastly, do you guys know of any user-friendly interfaces where I can file these returns for free? I believe I can file my own return as well as my dad's for free (both federal and state) through TurboTax due to our lower incomes and simple returns. However, in 2019 my brother's AGI was greater than $75K, he had an HSA, and he owned property, so TurboTax is requiring us to update his account to Deluxe for $60 due to the complexity of his return.

Any advice or guidance would be so greatly appreciated, thanks in advance! :)

**TL;DR** \- Family of 4 in IL: 24-year old male is HOH who provided over half the support for everyone, mother doesn't work, father earned &gt; $12.5K, and 22-year old female was a full-time student. How should we file our 2019 taxes and who should be claimed as a dependent on whose return?",finance
personalfinance,Auto loan from my bank at 16.39% (36 Months) where to go from here?,"Ive never bought a car before and I’ve been losing my mind over the past week thinking about the hole I put myself in. I was preapproved for a loan 3.89% I went to buy a car from a private seller.

I didn’t think this was bad until I had it explained to me how I can A: negotiate a interests rate and B: the bank has given others with a 550 credit score 2% interest rate.

investing,"No, Homes Did Not Sell Like Hotcakes: “Pending Home Sales” Plunged 34% in April, a Preview of “Closed Sales” in May","Pending sales of existing homes of all types in April – contracts on houses, condos, etc., that were signed in April but that haven’t closed yet – collapsed by 33.8% from April last year, after having plunged 16.3% year-over-year in March, with the index plunging to 69, according to the [National Association of Realtors](https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/pending-home-sales-slump-21-8-in-april).  

Pending sales are an indication of what closed sales will look like a month or two down the road. So this is an indication of the direction that May’s closed sales are heading into.

We already know how pending sales in March translated into closed sales in April. Pending home sales for March had plunged 16.3% year-over-year. And on May 21, the NAR reported that closed sales in April plunged 17.2%, the [sharpest year-over-year drop since August 2010](https://wolfstreet.com/2020/05/21/median-home-price-does-classic-head-fake-as-home-sales-plunge-and-condo-sales-collapse/), during the Housing Bust.

Based on this relationship, closed sales of existing homes in May might be down by 30% or more, year-over-year. This will be reported in June.

The plunge of the pending home sale index differed by region, ranging from a breath-taking collapse of -52.6% in the Northeast to a plunge of “only” -26.0% in the Midwest:

* Northeast: -52.6% year-over-year to an index level 42.6.
* Midwest: -26.0% year-over-year to an index level of 72.0.
* South: -29.6% year-over-year to an index level of 87.6.
* West: -37.2% year-over-year to an index level of 57.1.

When sales volume collapses to this extent – no matter what the market is – it changes everything. It represents a market that has essentially frozen, with few buyers and few sellers, and lots of uncertainty. This is what happened in many other markets in the US, including otherwise very liquid markets, such as the wholesale market for used vehicles.

In May those markets have begun to unfreeze. Market participants have figured out how to deal with the requirements of social distancing. Keeping everyone reasonably safe during a pandemic that has already killed over 100,000 Americans in less than three months is a primary objective.

In the housing market, this has led to a change in the way business is conducted, including forays into accepting technologies, such as virtual open houses. This technology has been around for long time, but the pandemic pushed it into the foreground – like so many other technologies in so many other industries. And people are finding out that it sort of works.

But the market is facing ferocious headwinds, including 31 million people now collecting state and federal unemployment insurance.

More mass layoffs by big companies are announced every day, such as American Airlines’ message to its employees late Wednesday that it would cut its management staff by 30%. Delta came out with plans today to shed staff via early retirements and buyouts, along with Chevron that said it would cut up to 15% of its global workforce of 45,000 people, and Boeing which said it would cut 7,000 workers. Just one days’ worth of work, so to speak.

These are not restaurant jobs. These are jobs that come with good paychecks and benefits.

And this constant flow of announcements does two things: It creates uncertainty among potential home buyers that kept their jobs; and it removed potential home buyers from the market that have lost their jobs. This is a gigantic unemployment crisis, interspersed with a tsunami of bankruptcy filings, of even large companies such as Hertz, each accompanied by more layoffs.

Eventually – next week or next month or whenever – the job losses will end as more workers will return to work, and employment will start to rise, but from abysmally low levels, and even after rising for a while, employment will still be abysmally low – just less abysmally low.

So the housing market – in terms of sales volume – has two separate things to deal with:

One, the issues around keeping buyers, sellers, brokers, and others safe. The industry is addressing these issues in multiple ways, and is harnessing technologies to overcome the issues, and there is progress, and more deals are happening.

Two, the employment crisis that has already taken millions of potential buyers off the market. Even people who return to work after a stint on unemployment cannot instantly turn into homebuyers because it’s hard to get a mortgage, right after having been unemployed.

So volume will pick up some because the immediate issues of the pandemic are being dealt with successfully by the industry; but volume will not return to normal levels until employment has returned to normal levels – and having lost over 30 million jobs so far, this is just going to take a while.

technology,a quick summary for all you with questions about the CDA (Section 230).,"HEY PEOPLES! I’ve been seeing a lot of questions and misinformation going around about the executive order (not to mention the fake news that’s been trending on r/ POLITICS). So I wanted to do a quick summary for all of you peoples who want a short but in-depth explanation about Section 230. Moreover  my legal thesis in law school was on Section 230 of the CDA  the very law the executive order today is affecting.

Here is a brief explanation:

-A publisher is an entity that controls the content that they present to a user—Think of CNN. Because they are in control of the content being presented (like a news article)  they are legally responsible for it and any fake news that they publish (defamation for example)  even if they hire someone else to write it. The less control they exert over the content they publish  the less likely they will be considered a publisher (and less likely to be held responsible for the content).

-In 1996 Congress passed the CDA which includes Section 230. Section 230 was passed for two reasons  to stop the spread of pornography on the internet and at the same time to allow other speech to live freely.

-Section 230 basically stated that any internet platform which hosts other users is not responsible for the content posted by those users (and therefore not considered a publisher). So  if a user were to post leaked naked pictures on Facebook  then Facebook could not be held jointly liable for hosting those pictures EVEN IF THEY DID NOT REMOVE THE PICTURES. The intent by congress was that if we protect these companies from liability from users then they will avoid taking action by limiting and censoring posts and as such  speech.

-However  Section 230 contains a clause which has been the subject of a lot of legal debate. 230©(2)(A) provides that even if a social media platform exerts control over material that is “obscene  lewd  lascivious  filthy  excessively violent  harassing  or otherwise objectionable”  then it still cannot be considered a publisher (remember that exerting control over content usually makes you legally responsible for that content).

-The problem is that the clause was almost unequivocally referring to violence and porn  but federal courts (who knows why) began interpreting “otherwise objectional” as anything that a platform finds offensive. As such  social media platforms were able to ban and censor speech just because they found it offensive. Thus  exerting control and still immune under the language of 230©(2)(A).

-In addition to the vagueness of the term “otherwise objectionable”. Some promoters of free speech argued that 230©(2)(A) is an explicit condition/clause. In other words  a platform can ban things considered “obscene  lewd  etc…” without being defined as a publisher (exerting control) but as soon as they begin to exert control over content that does not meet these criteria explicitly listed  then they are risking moving into publisher territory and no longer immune from lawsuits based on the content posted on their website.

-Trump’s executive order is attempting to clarify the law and the enforcement of the law. The executive order is basically saying  if you begin to ban or control content that is not under the list in 230©(2)(A) then you’re going to be considered a publisher. So social media companies have a choice  they can back off and allow free public discourse to take place on the internet  all the while enjoying their (very generous) lawsuit immunity  or they can exercise their free speech rights of association and ban everything to hell  but then they no longer have the immunity.

I’ll try to answer as many questions as I can in the comments. Hope this helps!",technology

personalfinance,Last chance to reconsider before refinancing a home in a destroyed neighborhood,"I am literally scheduled to refinance my home today, in a neighborhood that just last night had most of its businesses destroyed in looting here in Saint Paul MN. In a vacuum, the refinance makes sense - my wife and I bought the property with little down payment and the interest rate is 5.5%, so refinancing down to ~3% will save a lot of money in interest payments (although we will still only have ~5% equity up front). I've run the numbers, and although we're planning on moving in around 5 years, it still makes sense - we'd be doubling our upfront investment over that time period since it's such a huge difference in rate. (I think we break even over 2-3 years or something like that).

Before I go to spend the money though, I'm trying to figure out if recent events should change my thoughts on that at all. My guess is that all we can do is hunker down and hope property values recover over 5 years, because we're going to take a hit (considering how many neighborhood amenities just went up in flames). My question is, if we have the cash and/or family help to do so, is there a financial reason to cancel the refinance and sell the home ASAP/move to a burb instead?

There's no guarantee that the area will recover any time soon, and it seems possible that not only will it not bounce back but may decline further if it becomes apparent businesses are not coming back. In that scenario, trying to be one of the early ones to sell and get out of  the area seems advantageous instead?

Again, I know it's probably too late here. I'm just hoping for at least some reassurance that sticking to my original plan (which, again, by the numbers was a financial no-brainer before this) is still my best bet so I can quit beating myself up over it.",finance
personalfinance,Personal loan to pay off student loan?,"Hi Personal Finance,

My husband and I are steadily making progress on our student loans, and we have just one loan left: his undergraduate loan that he received in the United Kingdom (he is a UK citizen, although we both now live in the US).

We owe approximately £8500 on the loan (currently equivalent to \~$10,500) and are required to pay £350 per month. The interest rate is around 1.5%.

The problem is, currency conversion rates are essentially acting as variable interest rates and are constantly changing the balance of the loan and the amount we pay per month in dollar terms. The conversion rate has been as high as 1.70 Pounds per Dollar back in 2015, down to 1.15 Pounds per Dollar during the volatility back in March of this year.

With all of the global financial uncertainty, we are extremely concerned about losing progress on this loan if the dollar loses strength/pound gains strength.

I just graduated grad school (debt-free!) and we were originally anticipating throwing my entire salary at the loan to get rid of it this year—COVID has absolutely decimated that plan, as I am now unemployed and unable to file for unemployment. We’re still able to pay the loan on a normal schedule, just not throw a ton of money at it like we were planning to. We’re on track to pay it off in about 2.5 years at the current rate.

From reading and searching in this subreddit, I understand personal loans are usually a bad option for dealing with student loans. However, in this circumstance is it worth considering a personal loan in the US to pay this UK loan and eliminate the uncertainty with conversion rates and lock in a constant, albeit higher, interest rate (and a loan in constant dollar terms)? How would we even go about this? Any other suggestions on how to approach this situation?

(For context: we both have credit scores 760+)

Thanks all.

TL;DR: Variable conversion rates associated with a foreign student loan are making me nervous, should we take out a personal loan in the US to eliminate this uncertainty?",finance

personalfinance,Refi from 30 to 15 yr fixed,"I'd like some opinions on my refi if someone would be so kind.  My head is exploding with numbers ;)

Current loan:

* 30 Year fixed - 19 years remaining
* 156K remaining balance - 1765 monthly payment
* Interest Rate 4.875

New Refi Quote:

* 15 Year fixed
* 160K new load amount - 1833 monthly payment
* Interest Rate:  2.875
* Closing Fees (estimated):  11,509 (2876 Loan Cost + 8633 for Taxes, Prepaids and Escrow).

The refi quote would require 5919 cash to close which I'd probably just roll into the loan so essentially my loan amount would be even higher if I went zero cost closing.

My question is this even worth it?  I think for my existing loan I'd get back whatever escrow balance is left so that would be applied to the 8633 to reduce that number.  Do I use the 11, 509 as my true closing cost or do I use the 11509 which is Closing + Taxes (125) + Prepaids (3651) + Initial Escrow (4857).

personalfinance,Mortgage Refinance Reassurance/Advice Request,"I am looking for some advice and hopefully some reassurance. We are in the middle of refinancing our mortgage and am wondering if we can do better or made the right choice. Our home recently was appraised at $130,000. Our current mortgage details are as follows:

Started June 2011; 30-Year Loan

Outstanding Principal Balance: $77,483.32

Interest Rate: 4.5% fixed

Monthly payment: $749.98

* Principal: $190.74
* Interest: $290.56
* Tax – County: $126.97
* Insurance: $57.17
* Mortgage Insurance: $72.22
* Overage/Shortage: $12.32

We opted to refinance into a 20-year loan and locked our rate in at 3.375%. This is supposed to reduce our monthly payment to around $659 which is an estimate right now. So far we had to pay $395 up front which is all we have to pay up front. Everything else will be rolled into the loan. So far the closing costs are going to be $4,131 (when I called initially I was told the estimate was $2500 and they have been increased twice since then so I’m a bit upset about this). Also, the loan estimate is for $82,000 even though our current loan is \~$77k. Our goal was to lower the monthly payment. I didn’t shop around because I felt like the rate was going to increase and I needed to get it locked in ASAP. Did I make a good choice? The biggest thing I’m not happy about are the closing costs increasing as this process goes on. I also wonder if I should inquire about a way to remove the mortgage insurance and not refinance. Not sure if that’s possible though. I didn’t want to go with a 30-year loan because we didn’t feel like starting over again and the 15-year loan would save money in interest but it wouldn’t have reduced our monthly payment. Any advice is greatly appreciated. I think I just need some reassurance on this choice. I am worrying I made a bad choice.

As cash savings build up and interest rates remain low, I've been thinking about moving cash into a treasury bond fund like FUAMX.

It seems relatively low risk, continues to yield higher over the long term than a high yield savings account, and has extremely low volatility. I understand I can lose some money, but it seems insignificant since price movements are not large.

I asked my broker to reduce the points to zero so I would have to pay less at closing since there are some things I'd like to fix in the house and don't plan on staying for more than 5 years thinking the interest rate isn't as important to me as the needed up front cash.

I've been reading everywhere trying to understand the loan writing process, and studying the current mortgage numbers and can't seem to draw the correct conclusion. If current rates are 3.5% or so, then isn't that what we should be paying and we should be able to buy that rate down by increasing our points from 1%?

Before Covid, I was taking $700 per paycheck ($1400/month) towards my federal loans. Now, I just put that $700/paycheck into my “loans” bank account ($5869). I will continue doing that until Sept 30th and then do a lump sum payment before the interest goes back. I’m in my grace period now anyway but it gives me an extra month. My mom pays off my private loans around $400-$500 a month. Once I pay off my Fed loans I plan on helping with the remainder of the private to get them gone faster. 

I have a goal of having $10,000 in my savings before I move out anywhere. I live in a high COL area and want to have a 3-6 month backup BEFORE I go out on my own. I started my job back in January so I’m hoping I can just keep pushing money in the savings account until I hit 10K. I’m thinking about moving out in Sept to the city, depending on if my friend gets a job so we can be roommates, so I might be able to obtain this goal. If not, I’ll just continue living at home. If I move out I will probably drop my 401K contribution to a less aggressive number, probably around 10%.

personalfinance,"29yrs old 23k fed. Student Loan, earning 33k/yr as a contractor No retirement/short term money invest, need direction.","I'm 29 yrs old with 6 indvidual Fed. Stu. Loans coming to a total of 23,000 with an average min/max interest rate of 4.5/6.0 with the same company. With payments until 2022 of $130, after 2022 jumping up to $450.

I also have a cosign car loan with 13k but my ex-girlfriend making the payments on. (Not a priority concern since we had another car together that I recently paid off after it being totaled and drastically reducing the amount owed. Her car/my car sort of thing.)

I originally thought after paying my car off, that'll I'll aggressively pay down this student loan in 2 years, taking this Cares Act as a huge stepping stone to reduce paying so much interest rate while it's in effect Then creating an emergency fund thereafter and so forth according the Dave Ramsey's baby step plan.

To keep this short and simple, should I aggressively pay down this student loan using snowball effect paying minimally 3x the minimum payment**then** dip my toes in short term investing and long term Roth IRA investing?

OR

Double down on my student loan payment using the snowball effect, dip my toes in short term investing *(for the purpose of [A] replacing my rinky dinky cash car with another rinky dinky cash car to survive keeping cost down and [B] long term to pay down my student loan balance after 2 years of growth)* and retirement savings *(Roth IRA)* as a way to catch on to the compounding interest I'm missing out on.

Ultimately after I become full time at my current place of employment, and after paying down this student loan, I plan to aggressively save for retirement to minimize the gap had I been saving since 18yrs of age.

Currently doing the 2nd option as my car has several issues and the cost to repair equals the cash price of another car of better quality. Hence the short term investing. A longer term investing would be 2 yrs of growth to pay down the remaining balance owed on this student loan. By the end of this year I should have paid down 1 of the 6 and started on my 2nd one. The short term investing is my understanding of making the money I set aside work for me. This is all beginning after the economic impact of COVID, as stocks seem to start rising back up.

Thank you for your time to read this, I'd like to think I got a good strategy in place but would like the feed back.

Acorns short term stock investing and Acorns/Fidelity as the means for Long term Roth IRA. Two Roth IRAs to diversify my investing. After going full time, I plan to aggressively tackle 401k saving for retirement.

TL:DR - As a contractor making 33k/yr with 23k student loan, should I aggressively pay down student loan then worry about short term/long term goals OR Mixture of both to cover my ass for any mishaps?",finance

The restaurant applied and received a federal payment protection plan loan for the staff at the restaurant as well as all catering employees.  I signed off on the paperwork submitted from my manager to receive the gross weekly pay from 2019.  I received my first direct deposit from them on April 24th and have received this payment every Friday except for today.  I texted me boss asking him to look in to it.

He texted me back later this afternoon and basically said the owner is sick and tired of paying employees who are not working.  My manager said he is putting together a schedule, per the owner, to have the catering staff come in to the restaurant to start cleaning for the reopening and we will continue to get out pay from the loan.

Now, my question to all of you...is this legal?  I don't know much about about the loans given to small businesses due to COVID but my understanding is this money was to pay the employees how are not able to work.  If they are going to make me come in for 8 hours a week to clean, I am essentially making less now than I would if I was not receiving the money from the loan rather than clocking in for 8 hours.

personalfinance,Student loan incorrectly reported on credit?,"Hey guys,

I have some student loans from college (c.2009) and there's some weirdness which may be causing me to have bad credit reports against me when I am, in fact, making payments.

My loan holder is Navient (used to be Sallie Mae before they changed their name to duck a lawsuit) and they held all my loans, fed and personal.

My mother was the cosigner on all my loans. I lost jobs, had issues, stopped paying.

&amp;#x200B;

Few years ago (2016) my mother applies for unemployment assistance and they cancel all fed loans under her name. On my Navient history it shows $61,637.56 combined loans going away as a ""Claim payment"". Cool.

This left me with about $15k which I still didn't pay on. Goes to collections and I end up paying 80$ a month for the last 4 years.

Here's the rub:

Navient's site shows the 80$ monthly payments and that they're being applied to my loans, but the ""Source"" of the payments is blank. It also shows that there are no payments being made to the loans (by me I guess?) and that there is no monthly balance due. Which I guess means they don't expect a payment, BUT there is an ""overdue payment"" amount and that keeps increasing/decreasing as the 80$ payments are applied. The loans also have 0% interest so it all goes to principle.

However, they continue to report these loans to the CRA as ""Charge off"" every month even with a declining balance. My FED loans, which appear to be gone, also are being reported monthly to the CRA as ""Collections"".

So are these being incorrectly reported? Payments are being made on literally the only loans I have with the holder of the only student loans I have yet my credit report says I'm not paying anything and it's really hurting my credit. Couldn't even get a $5k car loan because of ""overdue payments"".

A couple months ago I tried to consolidate my delinquent loans and they reported back to me that they couldn't consolidate them even though the whole process was to consolidate delinquent loans. I assume this is because my remaining loans are private and I have no fed loans left?

Are there any steps I can take? Any way I can get this reported properly? Money is changing hands and people look at the reports and they don't see that. Could I (with a miracle) get the last four years of failed reports corrected? Any help is well appreciated. Though, the cheaper the better. XD",finance
personalfinance,We have $35k in savings and $30k in student loans. How much should we dump into loans vs. keep as emergency savings?,"My husband and I (mid 20s) share joint finances. As mentioned in the title, we currently have $35k in our savings account and $30k owed in student loans (federal \~4% APR). We also recently started IRAs but do not include that in our savings number (about $4k in those from last year's contributions). We are trying to decide if we should dump some of our savings toward those student loans, our IRAs, or some combination of both.

Relevant background: I am a PhD student paid by a federal fellowship, so the chances of me losing my income within the next 5 years are very low. I earn $2500/mo after tax and that's also what we spend in a typical month (could squeeze it down to $2000 in an emergency). We both do some freelancing on the side that earns anywhere from $100 to $1000 extra each month, so that prevents us from dipping into savings. Based on our typical spending, $15k would be a solid amount for a six-month emergency fund. That leaves an extra $20k in savings.

I think the ""official"" advice here would be to either max out our IRAs for the year ($12k) and dump the remaining $8k toward loans, or just put all $20k toward loans. But I'm hesitant to do this. My husband has been job hunting for the past year since he finished undergrad, as he's in a fairly competitive STEM field. He finally had a job offer earlier this year, but then it got nixed due to pandemic-induced budget cuts. With the job market worse than ever due to the virus, it may be more months before he can get a job, though his starting salary should be in the $60-80k range when that eventually does happen.

In theory, this shouldn't matter because we earn slightly more than we spend each month, and we have our emergency savings. So by letting that extra $20k sit around we're unnecessarily accruing loan interest (though this is temporaily suspended) and losing out on IRA gains. I guess my question is, would there be any reason to maintain this extra-high emergency savings balance? Or would we be better off applying it to our loans/investments?",finance

personalfinance,Making the best out of a student loan situation,"I’ll be graduating from graduate school at the end of the year with a wonderful $280k in student loans through the US government. I’ll be going into business for myself (with a partner) and the outlook after the first years expenses is good for a healthy low 6 figure income. I currently have an obnoxious debt to income ratio due to poor financial literacy through my early adulthood and not properly balancing needs vs wants. 

280k student loans (~7% interest rate)
17k car (6% APR)
9k car (9.8% APR — this one stings)
10k credit card
7k personal loan

Not great. Currently my wife is the only source of non-loan income at about 33k/year. My number one goal is to eliminate consumer debt since that’s at a much higher rate than student loans. 

With no income for the past 3 years I would be at a VERY low payment with an income based repayment plan for my first year or two of work due to the initial buy-in and overhead of setting up a business. (Estimating $600 worth of payments over 2 years). I know that if I were to refinance I would be able to pay off the loans at a lower cost (somehow I still have 800+ credit) and in a shorter period of time.

All that background to say, my question is this: should I refinance straight out of school and start working down the major student loans, or take advantage of the two years of low payments to build equity and eliminate personal consumer debt and refinance in 2022/23 when I have a stronger debt-free foundation? Are there any major drawbacks to waiting to refinance other than 7% accrual for each year?

personalfinance,"Had the most ridiculous interaction with a credit reporting agency, what to do going forward?","I'm a 21 year old new grad looking to rent an apartment in a fairly high CoL area.

The oddities came when I was conditionally approved. I have fairly good credit that I've built over the years (member of federal credit union, paid off nearly all of my student loans ahead of schedule, never missed any rent or utility payments, etc.) so I was surprised to see that, especially because I had unconditional approval to rent at the other apartment I applied to rent at. Conditional approval means that I would need to pay a security deposit (which would be waived if I were unconditionally approved). I asked the apartment building rep to send me a copy of the adverse action letter, which she did. I then contacted the third party who ran the credit check. 

The call was immediately extremely choppy, and I could barely make out what the rep was saying. From what I could tell, after going through identity verification and other due diligence, they were ready to access my report. The conversation then went like this:

Me: ""Sure, what kind of form?""

I got out of treatment for meth addiction a few years ago with nothing and was released into a halfway house. During that time I found a dealership willing to work with me when I had 0 credit. They said it wasn't just bad credit, it was no credit. Well with some money down they financed me a 2006 Pontiac G6. Of course my interest rate is horrible but here I am currently owing $296 a month in payments with $3500 left on the note.

Since buying it I rear ended someone and I fixed it myself. Also the transmission is messed up. What's important is that it's unlikely anyone would want to buy it, I figure I'll just keep making the payments until it's paid off and drive it until the wheels fall off as I'm about to go back to college this fall. 


So my dad calls me today and tells me he just bought a new vehicle and that he will sell me his 2012 Dodge Avenger for $1000. This is a considerable upgrade considering my dad takes great care of his cars, drives like the grandpa he is, etc.

I want the car, but obviously I'm locked into the loan on the G6 I currently own. When I say the transmission is messed up, it just doesn't have overdrive. I believe it would last me awhile longer as the engine is still strong. I really don't want to pass on this opportunity because I would also save money on insurance each month by going from full coverage to liability.

It's possible that I could pay the car off before school starts in the fall and my dad is willing to hold on to the car for awhile and be flexible about me paying for it.

personalfinance,What's the easiest and least expensive way to report 1099 investment income under $100 on my taxes?,"So I opened a Robinhood account in 2019 with just a few hundred dollars, just to dip my toes into investing, so to speak. I'm just now working on my taxes with the COVID-19 extension, and I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around the 1099 form sent to me.

I made a net gain of about $85, received just a few dollars of dividends per the 1099-DIV, and have 1 share of Groupon stock received as a referral bonus listed as ""other income"" on the 1099-MISC. I also received a K-1 Form 1065 from one of my investments, Brookfield Renewable Partners.

What's the easiest, least expensive way to make sure this all gets reported correctly on my taxes? I've never invested before beyond my 401k so I'm feeling like I'm in way over my head. Robinhood has a discount link for TurboTax, but they still want me to pay $140 to file my state &amp; federal, which is more than I made on the market! With such small amounts involved, do I even need to report these investments/income to the IRS? Would I be better off going to a CPA/tax preparer that knows what they're doing?

personalfinance,High-yield savings account within Roth IRA,"I've realized that Roth IRA can serve as an emergency fund (you can withdraw without penalty at any time up to the amount you've contributed). It seems advantageous to transfer my savings into a tax-sheltered account, but I haven't found an institution that offers a fixed-interest-rate account within a Roth IRA that rivals Barclays 1.15% APY. Currently, I don't want to invest more than I already do, and I can't afford to max out my Roth contributions. But, I could max out my Roth IRA contributions this by moving chunks of my savings into a Roth IRA savings account.

Why would I want to do this?

1) Avoid taxes on savings interest...OK this is small for me (I made $300 in interest last year), but still...taxes brings my effective interest rate to ~0.85%!

2) Hopefully in 5-10years I'll be in a much higher income bracket (currently a math/CS PhD student); once that happens, my current savings/emergency-fund can become cheap (in terms of up-front taxes) capital for tax-free investing. Right now, I have a target-date fund in my Roth IRA, but it is important to me to maintain a substantial emergency buffer with non-invested funds.",finance

personalfinance,School in September and Rejected for a Student Loan,"My (30f) partner (29m) had been accepted to a welding program in September and as soon as he got his acceptance letter he applied for his student loan with our provincial and federal government. ( Nova Scotia, Canada) 

It was rejected as they report he has delinquent provincial and federal student loans. He paid off his provincial last year and got a receipt in the mail stating it was closed, balance $0. And also that the federal was in collections and delinquent but is making payments these last 6 months. 

He tried to call the provincial loan office,  but are all still shut down for COVID. The recording says they are not pursuing legal action until further notice and goodbye. We’re not sure when they will reopen but he had no way of resolving the matter any further until they do, the problem is the tuition is due in August or he will lose the seat. 

We’re both long clear of making any bad financial decisions but we both had modest incomes (40k each ) until he was laid off in March due to the COVID shutdown here. So we’ve been paying off debts as much as we can over the last few years but some remain which is still hurting our credit. I’m thinking if I co-sign on a loan at the bank with him we might be accepted for enough of a loan so he can get his welding papers (12k tuition + living cost). 

We’re really not sure where to turn or where to start, we don’t have savings, and we come from families who do not have this kind of money and we wouldn’t even dream of asking.

personalfinance,Cash-out refinance for student/personal debt?,"Hello r/personfinance!

I am a long time creeper and a first-time poster, and am looking for advice regarding cash-out refinancing. I hope to gain some valuable insight/tips from people who might have had some history or experience with cash-out refinances. This account is a throwaway due to personal information and me not wanting it to be identifiable. Apologies for the upcoming wall of text!

I(M/31) currently work in the Arch/Eng/Constr field and make a $50,000 salary. I am finishing up my last year of my second Masters, and estimate that I will have roughly $300,000 in student loan debt (undergrad, two grad degrees) when I finish. $100,000 of my debt is with a private company that is currently charging me interest. The current variable rates are $65,000 @ 5.75%, $27,000 @ 9.00%, $5,000 @ 8.5%. While the other $200,000 is with the Fed, and interest payments are frozen at 0% due to the pandemic. 

I am not required to make any payments on any loans since I'm still in school, but I would like to hopefully relieve some of the future debt stress I will encounter by leveraging some equity. My father recently passed away, and now I currently own a property with no outstanding balance and was assessed at the beginning of the year at $500,000. I'm thinking of applying for a cash-out refinance for $125,00 (25% of the appraised value). $100,000 would be used to pay off my private student loans, and $25,000 to pay off high-interest credit card debt. I want to choose a 15-year term mortgage and make payments on those starting now, and the interest rates I see range from 2.85-3.5%. 

I have a credit score of 680 due to my poor young adult decisions on credit cards, but since my father's passing and the beginning of 2020, I have been cleaning up my act and have switched my mindset about money and how to manage it. I've started using YNAB(fantastic app and subreddit), cut up all of my cards, and only pay using debit/cash. I spend less than I take in every month and am almost able to pay next month's bills with this month's paycheck. Hopefully, this is enough background information for others to help me with a decision on cash-out refinancing. Any feedback would be appreciated, and if more information is needed, I'd be more than happy to provide it. Thanks again for all of the work and support this community offers, it's beneficial for someone like me with no knowledge of banking/finance. Cheers!",finance

personalfinance,Am I missing something about the PSLF program? Or is it too good to be true?,"So, I'm a student who was recently admitted into a specialized graduate degree program with only 22 other students at a Big Three ivy league school (harvard, yale, princeton). Cool! (.... or not, considering that all classes have been pushed online for the foreseeable future, but I'm trying not to think about that.)

The issue... *after* financial aid/scholarships, this graduate degree is going to cost me $60k per year in a very high cost of living area (estimated additional $25-30k living expenses annually). For comparison, I paid $20k a year for my undergraduate and only did so by working 40 hours a week all four years. I can't say I had a terrible time, but let me tell you, college was not what it was supposed to be and that was mostly because my chosen field is highly connections/esteem driven (think media, politics, journalism) and I spent most of those 4 years behind a customer service counter, getting good grades, and then collapsing into a bed of alcohol and sorrow for my 4 hours of sleep a night. Anyways.

I as offered direct loans for my entire ""graduate college experience"": housing, tuition, food, fees, and basically whatever else can all be covered. I have known forever that I want to work in government, and I actually have a contract stipulation in my financial aid package stating my first five years out of graduate school is in a very specific branch of government. The financial aid office makes a big show of how you can ""live large"" (not actually, but it certainly feels like it) in graduate school, then do your time paying $4000 or so a year in minimum payments and get your loans forgiven after 10 years in the big house. It seems like most others in my program are living in $1500+ monthly apartments, eating nice foods, taking vacations, and putting it all on ""the tab."" Can I really rack up $100-180k of direct federal debt, start at the bottom of the government agency I've sold my soul to, work my way up paying my minimum payment as determined by Income Based Repayment plans, and it all goes away after 10 years? Basically debt free again at 31 years old?

What am I missing? To me, it seems like the US gov wouldn't just forgive $150k like it's nothing (I read the WIKI, took the entrance counseling, and have googled a LOT, and it does seem rather simple if you prepare yourself correctly). It seems too easy, suspiciously easy, as long as you read and follow the terms.

 I especially want to hear from other ivy leaguers/ex-ivy folks. I'm from a poor family and the idea of ""screwing the government out of six figures for a graduate degree"" seems skeevy to me, despite the fact that everyone else in my program seems to be doing it worry-free.

investing,List of Headwinds the Current Liquidity Rally is Ignoring,"Not sure if these will ever come to a head and affect the markets, but here's stuff that is negative but have not been reacted to:

1. The forward outlook now is much worse than it was before the pandemic at the same equity prices. Market seems to be taking ""better than expected"" news way too far. The current rally is 100% P/E expansion. Otherwise, you would need to argue that the market is pricing in something like 50% earnings growth over the next 2 years, which is a joke.

2. Virus cases are spiking again. We are now seeing a 3rd global wave (past two days have shown record number of new cases). First wave was China and parts of Asia. Second wave was US and Europe. Now, we're seeing Russia, India, and South America getting hammered. Will this ping pong back to us in a 4th wave? Nobody knows for sure. Also, US cases have been ticking up these past couple of days. Will see in a week if reopening will cause another spike.

3. Despite all the Fed pumping, these are mostly loans, not grants. As a result, we're continuing to see bankruptcies, with Hertz being the most notable recent casualty. When these loans come due, and all the deferred rent and mortgage payments get called, we'll see if things will seize up. Also, Fed liquidity will run out at some point. It's kind of a catch-22. If markets are going up, the Fed is not going to do anything. Eventually, that money will run out. We'll need another crash before they step back in. If inflation ever spikes, then the Fed is done.

4. The market is acting as if US/China relations are not worsening. The crazy rally today after no immediate sanctions and tariffs is ignoring the direction things are going. Despite the lack of action, the language used today by Trump made it sound like he was declaring war. The Chinese care a lot about face and won't simply ignore this. Hong Kong is going to become a tinderbox, particularly in June when the Security Law becomes official. The recent language regarding Taiwan is not promising either (a general said earlier today that they would use military force if peaceful annexation becomes impossible).",finance

My goal is to get a low-interest rate and build my credit. Here's what happened.

1. My wife opened credit cards in my name which I never knew about until I received a call from my mother regarding collections. Turns out she put me into $30k debt and destroyed my credit score. I had no use for my credit score over the last 5 years so I just assumed it was in the 700's as it always had been. I'm well aware that it was a huge mistake, but the damage is done.

3. I'm in a position where my brother is letting me stay rent-free to save up. I can comfortably afford a car payment at the moment.
4. My only current credit card is a 13-year-old card with 100% of payments on time since all the other cards got closed.
5. My credit has been damaged by the entire process and is currently around 600.

*****
&gt; The big rotation into unloved stocks, like banks, small caps and airlines, took a break Friday, but it could be a theme that dominates trading again in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Investors will be assessing the progress of economic reopenings against some new headwinds for the market.
*****
&gt; The stock market has been mostly discounting unprecedented weakness in economic data, but the May employment report will still be of major interest Friday. Economists expect it to show another shocking loss of jobs, this time roughly 8.5 million after the 20.5 million lost in April. The unemployment rate is expected to jump to a staggering 19.8% from 14.7% in April, according to Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; Increasingly frayed relations between the U.S. and China reared up at the end of the week as a negative force for markets, and analysts expect that stress to continue to be a concern. The U.S. joined with other nations to condemn China’s new security rules for Hong Kong, which Beijing sees as an attempt to quell protesters. 
*****
&gt; President Donald Trump on Friday said the U.S. would end its preferential relationship with Hong Kong and also exit agreements with the World Health Organization, which he said failed with China to protect the world from the spread of coronavirus. The stock market moved higher after Trump’s afternoon announcement on relief there were no new trade actions against China.
*****
&gt; “Hovering over this is geopolitical tensions. Over the weekend, what do we see out of Hong Kong? What do we see next week? This will be a major test for the west and specifically Washington,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.
*****
&gt; Krosby said the market will continue the tug of war as investors dip into value names versus some of the growth names in tech, and the stocks that had benefited from the stay-at-home trade.
*****
&gt; “We saw this early as the market came off the March lows. You had a very clear barbell,” she said. “The market tried to say what do we need now, what do we need when this is over and health care and pharma started to get a very strong bid. What you have now is ... perhaps intermittent, the value names, the ones that were really beaten up, broadening out the market, including financials.”
*****
&gt; Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy at BTIG, said the social media and tech firms face dual headwinds, and that could hold back the overall market as well since they had been leaders in the move off of the March low.  Trump on Thursday issued an executive order aimed at limiting legal protections of social media companies, after he got into a disagreement with Twitter.
*****
&gt; “There’s a ratcheting up of pressure on technology firms and social media firms, a lot of overlap in big tech in terms of China exposure,” he said. “There’s a lot of headwinds facing Nasdaq names - shelter in place names and China-exposed technology names.”
*****
&gt; Big tech stocks have lagged lately, but they are still a top leader quarter to date, with a 20% gain. In the past week, they were up about a half percent, compared to a 6% gain in financials and 5% rise in industrials. As tech lagged, so did the Nasdaq, gaining only a third as much as the Dow in the past week. 
*****
&gt; “This cyclical rally has longer to run, but what we’ve seen this week tells you the index cannot continue to rise solely with the cyclical outperformance. Tuesday and Wednesday the financials outperformed Nasdaq by 9.3%,” he said. Emanuel said the market usually does better when financials do better but this type of outperformance is rare and it doesn’t always signal positives. 
*****
&gt; “On average, the market is weaker in the medium term when you had that kind of massive outperformance. The message is both financials and technology tend to be weaker in the medium term. Longer term, you go back to the idea the rotation into financials is a positive,” he said.
*****
&gt; Emanuel said the S&amp;P 500 may be hitting the top of a near-term range, after it broke through the 3,000 level, a key psychological point. It also broke through its its 200-day moving average, a widely watched technical level. Some investors see a buy signal when the S&amp;P  is above that momentum indicator, which is literally based on the average closing level of the index over the last 200 days.
*****
&gt; But Emanuel does not see that to be the case this time. “When we look at the frantic activity in the rotation, it leads us to believe the market is likely to fall back into the range in the coming weeks,” he said. 
*****
&gt; The stocks that have outperformed recently are the most sensitive to the economic reopenings leading to a pickup in normal activity. There is a question of how much air traffic or hotel stays can pick up until there is real medical progress against the virus.  
*****
&gt; “These stocks will be a matter of intense debate for months. I don’t think we’ll know the answer until we see if the fall brings a ratcheting higher of the virus, based on reopenings and a change in the weather, or if there’s a change in progress on a vaccine,” he said.
*****
&gt; President Trump’s executive order seeking to limit the federal law that provides broad legal protection for social media and other online platforms is one headwind for that sector. Trump issued the order Thursday after Twitter put a fact-check label one of his tweets criticizing mail-in election ballots. The president accused Twitter of political activism.
*****
&gt; Twitter, Facebook and Alphabet all protested the move, which hit Twitter’s stock hardest.  
*****
&gt; Emanuel said technology’ is at risk in China since companies like Apple have large revenue exposure in addition to supply chain issues.
*****
&gt; In addition to the jobs report, there is important ISM manufacturing data Monday and auto sales for the month of May.

# Weekly Market Performance – May 29, 2020: Equities Continue Run During A Shortened Week.

&gt; # Equities

&gt; US equities delivered positive returns during this abbreviated trading week. All three indexes were higher, with the best performer being the Dow, while the Nasdaq lagged. The S&amp;P 500 finished the week above the 3,000 level for the first time since early March. The small cap Russell 2000 along with the mid-cap S&amp;P 400 Index enjoyed positive weeks, with both indexes returning over 2%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/WMP-May-29-2020.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “The S&amp;P 500 has incredibly bounced more than 35% from the March lows,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Which would be the best bear market rally ever, suggesting this very well isn’t a bear market bounce, but the start of a new uptrend.”

&gt; The story of the week was a sharp rotation in the beaten up value sectors early on, as financials gained more than 6%, closely followed by real estate and industrials. Energy was the worst performing sector as oil price gains stalled, while communication services was the only other sector to lose ground on the week.

&gt; Looking at style, large cap value stocks beat out large cap growth by over 2% for the week.

&gt; Amid ongoing COVID-19 disruptions, labor and foreign policy challenges, along with risks associated with reopening the economy, US equities maintained their strength. Several timely indicators have pointed to a pickup in economic activity, such as an increase in new home sales along with an unexpected increase in consumer confidence. Our research suggests that second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) could contract as much as 30% annualized, but global progress in reopening economies combined with massive stimulus measures point to a potentially strong rebound in the third and fourth quarters.

&gt; # International Stocks

&gt; The MSCI EAFE and the MSCI Emerging Markets Indexes continued its upward quest from the previous week, with the developed markets outperforming emerging markets by over 3%. Given the news out of Hong Kong last week as well as the Hang Seng’s struggles last Friday, its market rebounded modestly to finish up only a fraction this week. With the new changes in Hong Kong’s security laws, many are pondering the future of the nation/state as a global financial hub.

&gt; The action by China in Hong Kong concerning its sovereignty caused Washington to move toward placing actions against Beijing. Moreover, White House Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow added that the US may pay for companies to bring its supply chains from China and Hong Kong to the U.S.

&gt; European markets were higher this week, with the STOXX Europe 600 Index up over 3%. As in the United States, investors are concerned with COVID-19 and the subsequent reopening of the European economy, but European stocks have held steady, as the pandemic has been slowing and countries are opening back up. Fiscal stimulus is in the air overseas, as the European Commission is reportedly set to propose a 750 billion euro recovery package, while Japan is finishing a $1.1 trillion stimulus package.

&gt; # Fixed Income and Commodities

&gt; Fixed income prices were little changed on the week, with the 10-year Treasury yield remaining under 0.70%. Credit spreads tightened modestly as investors appear optimistic about the prospects of reopening the US economy as well as a potential pickup in economic activity.

&gt; Investment grade corporate debt issuance set a new record this week, with total new issues surpassing $1 trillion in just 149 days. This is a milestone typically reached in the second half of the year, as the Federal Reserve programs have suppressed yields, allowing corporations easier access to funding.

&gt; Last month showed a record drop in consumer spending of over 13%, however personal savings enjoyed its largest surge ever at 33%. Once the economy reopens, we should expect these trends to reverse, which would thus help the economic landscape.

&gt; Oil prices contracted modestly with July contracts for WTI crude posting a decline of about 2% for the week. Gold finished up a fraction, consolidating following an impressive rally of nearly 15% year to date.

&gt; # Looking Ahead

&gt; Economic data for next week begins with the Markit Purchasing Managers’ Index data along with the ISM Manufacturing survey and construction spending on Monday. Contractions are expected in both given the present climate. Wednesday is all about the autos, as we get total number of cars and trucks sold in May. The consensus, according to Factset, is that 11 million total vehicles were sold last month.

&gt; On Thursday, we receive new unemployment claims with optimism that the recent lower trend of claims continues. Also, we will get data on labor productivity along with the trade balance. To end the shortened week, Friday’s reports will include non-farm payrolls along with the unemployment rate.

*****

# Strong Breadth Surge

&gt; On Wednesday, the S&amp;P 500 Index closed above its 200-day moving average for the first time since March 4. While that move marks an important milestone for an index that has rebounded more than 35% from its March 23 low, we believe market internals may paint an even more promising picture for future stock returns.

&gt; Technology and growth stocks were undoubtedly the leaders during the market drop, and many of these stocks have recovered to the point of having positive year-to-date returns. Year-to-date numbers for financials and industrials have been less impressive, but that doesn’t mean they’ve been left behind in the recovery. All 11 sectors have gained more than 20% from the March lows, and every sector, except for the defensive consumer staples sector, is up at least 30%, with energy’s 59% advance leading the way. This has led to strong breadth, or market participation readings. Through Thursday’s close, 96% of the components in the S&amp;P 500 were trading above their respective 50-day moving averages, the most since 1991.

&gt; Perhaps more importantly, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, these momentum surges historically have been followed by above-average forward returns. February 2019 was the last time more than 90% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 traded above their 50-day moving averages, and the S&amp;P 500 went on to post a 29% gain for the year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/5.29.20-blog-chart.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; “Breadth surges like we’ve seen recently can signal short-term overbought conditions,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But for longer-term investors, they have historically marked uptrends with lasting durability.”

# DJIA Up Seven Straight on June’s First Trading Day

&gt; According to the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2020 (page 88), the first trading day of June is the third worst first trading day of all twelve months with DJIA gaining just cumulative 304.59 points since 1998 (July is best with 1175.74 DJIA points gained). Over the past 25 years, DJIA’s first trading day of June has produced gains 72.0% of the time with an average gain of 0.04%. Sizable losses in 2002, 2011 and 2012 limit overall performance. S&amp;P 500 has advanced 64.0% of the time. NASDAQ has been slightly weaker at 56.0%. Russell 2000 has advanced 64.0% with the strongest average performance of 0.17%. Following three straight losses from 2010 to 2012, DJIA has advanced seven straight years on the first trading day of June.

# Typical June Trading: Early Gains Tend to Fade After Mid-Month

&gt; Over the last twenty-one years, the month of June has been a rather lackluster month for the market. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have all recorded average losses in the month. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have faired better with modest average gains. Historically the month has opened respectably, advancing on the first and second trading days. From there the market then drifted sideways and lower into or near negative territory depending upon index just ahead of mid-month. Here the market rallied to create a nice mid-month bulge that quickly evaporated and turned into losses. The brisk, post, mid-month drop is typically followed by a month end rally lead by technology and small-cap.

# May's Top Performing Stocks

&gt; After an absolutely amazing April, traders were in no mood to sell this May. Within the Russell 1000, which tracks the 1,000 largest US stocks by market cap, the index's components rallied an average of 5.3% with just over 70% of the index's components trading up during the month. In the table below, we highlight some of the biggest winners. Some of these names may sound familiar, but there are bound to be a few that you've never heard of.

&gt; This month, three stocks in the Russell 1000 gained more than 50%. The best of those three was Twilio (TWLO). After closing out April at a price of $112.3, the stock rallied 73% to just shy of $200 per share. So far in 2020, TWLO has almost doubled. Not familiar with TWLO? The company creates a number of APIs that enable voice, video, and messaging capabilities to their platforms. So when you get a text from UBER telling you that your car is on its way, that message is likely powered by TWLO's software.

&gt; Looking through the list of this month's winners, like TWLO, a large share of the stocks listed come from the Technology sector. Of the 34 names on the list, 14 are form the Tech sector, and the next closest sector - Consumer Discretionary - has just seven stocks on the list. The top-performing stock from the Consumer Discretionary sector has been Wayfair (W), which has gained nearly 38%. Apparently, after being stuck at home for the last several weeks, many Americans have decided they need some new furniture.

&gt; In total, eight of the eleven GICS sectors are represented on the list. The only sectors not making the cut? Financials, Real Estate, and Utilities. Maybe next month.

# Most Stocks Above Their 50-DMAs Since 1991

&gt; As we noted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot, if you were to pick out any one stock in the S&amp;P 500, odds are it would be above its 50-DMA. Currently, 96.24% of S&amp;P 500 stocks are above their 50-DMAs. On a sector basis, Consumer Discretionary, Energy, Industrials, and Materials all have 100% of their stocks above their 50-DMAs. That is a huge share of the index sitting above their 50-DMAs at once. As shown in the chart below, times in which there have been this many stocks above their 50-DMAs have been few and far between. Of all days since the start of 1990, there have only been four other days with a reading as high or higher than the current 96.24%. The most recent of these was March 5th, 1991 when 96.59% of the index was above its 50-DMA. Other than that, only February 11th through 13th of that same year saw these types of readings (97.4%, 96.6%, and 97.8%, respectively).

# Fund Flows Still Show Little Equities Enthusiasm

&gt; The table below gives a summary of mutual and exchange-traded fund flows as compiled by the Investment Company Institute for the week ending May 20th.

&gt; Equity fund flows remain negative. While there’s been lots of anecdotal evidence of retail enthusiasm in the equity market, fund flows are a very different story. This week was relatively modest, with equity fund outflows in the bottom 6% of all readings across mutual funds and ETFs. That totals $13.7bn of AUM out the door, with the worst hits coming for global funds which saw flows in the bottom 3% of all readings. The last 3 months and year have been the worst on record for aggregate equity fund flows across mutual funds and ETFs, and the worst three months on record for world equity funds. ETFs tracking equities have not seen large inflows but they are also not suffering the same kind of outflows as mutual funds.

&gt; Commodity funds and bond funds are a totally different story. The last three months have been the best on record for commodity fund inflows, while bond funds have seen readings in the top 3% of all periods for the last week and month; recent commodity fund flows are slightly cooler than their record pace of the last three months but are very, very strong nonetheless.

personalfinance,Penalty for paying off mortgage early?,"Hi r/PF. From what I understood by reading the posts in this sub, it is advisable to ask the extra mortgage payment to be applied to principal when trying to pay-off early. Currently I have an mortgage with Ally that says ""no pre-payment penalty"". However, as I was doing further search, I found this page: https://www.ally.com/do-it-right/car/understanding-extra-payments-to-your-amount-financed-2/  (this page is for car loan but would it be similar to mortgage?)

It says ""We will not apply a payment only to reduce the outstanding balance. Each time we receive a payment, we calculate and collect a finance charge for the period from the date the last payment posted to your account up to the day we receive the next payment."" The last Q&amp;A question also touches upon this but I am still confused.

Consider the following situation: 110k remaining in current mortgage, 5th yr/15yr fixed. Can I 1) Pay 100k out of 110k and expect the remaining principal to become 10k, and total interest to be charged also reduced proportionally? 2)pay full 110k and fully close this mortgage account?

Another question is, I am looking for a new mortgage for a new home. If I put 400k down, and borrow 150k, the interest rate after points discount is 2.675%; if I only put down 150k and borrow 400k, the interest rate is 2.375%. (Loan estimate offered by the same lender; variations on origination costs due to different points being applied but small difference in comparison; can afford 400k down and do not intend to use what's not put down as other investment- just about 1.5% savings interest rate with 22% marginal tax rate).

So can I borrow 400k to get lower interest rate, and immediate pay 250k to principal in the first couple of months? The loan estimate state no pre-payment penalty, but where else or what other terms should I look for if I would like to do this? Thanks folks.",finance
personalfinance,Should I combine these two credit cards?,"Sorry in advance if this is not the right place for this! 

We have two credit cards that we have been slowly paying down via minimum payments. 

Card 1: $9000, interest rate: 11.99%

Card 2: $7000, interest rate: 15.99%

The credit limit on Card 1 is high enough that we can now transfer the entire balance of Card 2 to Card 1 and pay a 4% transfer fee (~$300). 

Would it be worth moving Card 2's balance to Card 1? Are there any adverse effects of doing this outside of having to pay the balance transfer fee?

Thanks for your thoughts!",finance
personalfinance,Deciding Between 2 Mutual Funds,"$FAGAX (Fidelity Large Cap Growth fund)

$VIGAX (Vanguard Large Cap Growth fund)

&amp;#x200B;

Biggest difference is:

1) $FAGAX has expense ratio of 1.11 and Sales Charge of 5.75% 

2) $VIGAX has expense ratio of .05

Over the past 10 years, FAGAX has had an average annual return of 18.5%, vs. VIGAX averaging returns of 15.85%.   Hypothetical growth of $10,000 at the end of 10 years (Fees included) resulted in FAGAX at $125,606, and VIGAX at $96,372.  The Fidelity fund outperformed Vanguard's similar fund by nearly $30k.  

&amp;#x200B;

However, it is well known that past performance is not indicative of future results.  When I go to [FINRA's Fund Analyzer](https://tools.finra.org/fund_analyzer/report?selected=MzE1ODA3ODM0,OTIyOTA4NjYw), IF over the next 10 years they average similar returns, I will save nearly $8,000 in fees by going with Vanguard (Assuming $10,000 beginning balance, $400 monthly contributions, same interest rate).  

&amp;#x200B;

As for the value proposition, should I (1) Go with the Vanguard and be assured I will get a solid rate of return at virtually no fees, or (2) Go with Fidelity and incur a larger risk that outperformance will not continue, pay higher fees, and not optimize return.

I’m a junior in college, looking to put my emergency fund into an HYSA. Not planning on accessing it whatsoever until an emergency so really it’s just going to be sitting there. Beyond just going for the one with the highest rate rn, what should I look for?

I know that interest rates have taken a dive due to the state of the world recently, but was wondering which are most likely to bounce back over time? Should I go with something with a currently lower rate (Ally, Discover) because they’re trustworthy (already have a Discover cc and Vanguard Roth) or Vio with a higher rate?

personalfinance,Questions about taxes on side income,"Hello! I'm a regular employee at a company and have federal/state tax withheld from my paychecks. However, soon I'll start earning two new streams of income:

* freelance writing income: I'll be paid twice a month and the amounts will be relatively consistent but will vary from pay period to pay period
* Book royalties: these will be paid monthly and will vary widely

I don't have the option of having taxes withheld at the time, and I don't want to increase the withholding from my regular job's paychecks to try to offset the extra income. My initial plan was simply to squirrel away 25% of everything I make in a separate account and then use that to pay any tax liability when doing my taxes. But I'm worried that I'll end up having to pay an underpayment penalty. I have a few questions about making estimated payments:

1. Do they have to be equal? Can I simply pay whatever I've squirreled away for that quarter?
2. This extra income will begin in early June (Q3), so I won't need to make my first payment until September 15. I assume there are no issues with this, since that's when I started earning income?
3. I was planning to put 25% toward federal income tax, but what percentage should I allocate for state?

If it's helpful: I make about $67,000/year at my regular job. I expect to make about $5,000 in freelance writing income between now and the end of the year. I have no idea how much I'll get in book royalties, but, aiming high, let's say $15,000. I live in Oregon.

personalfinance,Interest rate buy-down grant availability,"Hi personalfinance,

I tried to post this in r/Mortgages, but I'm not approved to post there yet.

There's a good chance I'll be getting a NACA mortgage this year. This is a neat mortgage product/option for some people.  It includes an interest rate buy-down option.  The NACA documentation states:

*Grants can be obtained for the interest rate buy-down. Most of these grants are funded by the federal
government and sometimes enhanced by state and local municipalities. Cities and municipalities administer
and provide these grants. These funds—which can be from $5,000 to over $25,000 for each buyer—are used
for down payment and closing costs, and, in some cases, can also be used for buying down the NACA interest
rate. The most effective use of these funds is to access the NACA Mortgage and to buy down the interest rate
from NACA’s already below-market fixed rate. To access these funds for the NACA Buy-Down, you need to
contact your state, county or city officials to get them to work with the NACA Mortgage. NACA can assist you
and others in getting access to government funds for the NACA Buy-Down with the NACA Mortgage.*

Does anyone know what federal, state or local organization in Wisconsin I could contact to find out about the availability of such a program?

personalfinance,(Auto) Should I report Ally financial to the consumer protection agency?,"So long story short, I took out an auto loan in 2017 through Ally, refinanced a year later and they kept saying I owed a balance, which they later admitted was an error.  I have all the records from the bank that refinanced, and had asked Ally’s credit department to amend  all negative aspects from my report, as they were and are still calling it a charge off and shows at 21 months of non payment. 

My appeal was denied yesterday and all they said was it didn’t fit the profile for them to remove. No additional information and when I asked to speak with a supervisor they said no one was available and swore they would get back to me by end of day which surprise, they didn’t. 

I’m so fed up...this has been on-going since earl March. Every time I push they don’t have someone to talk to anymore. I’ve been nothing but respectful and calm, as I work in service but I don’t know what else to do. Should I get a lawyer? Consumer protection board?  I’m assuming that having this fixed on my report will boost my score. 
Thank you

UPDATE:
I figured this MAY help provide some additional knowledge.


They are awful. Every time I show them additional proof that my refi was correct another issues pops up...

Basically, I refinanced, they said that a payment came out of my account, thus making the refi check from the other bank off and they said that is the issue because it looks like I “owe” even thought I don’t. The check my bank sent was more than the payoff amount so there shouldn’t have been any error. It’s insanity.",finance

Further, local reputable mortgage brokers are requesting authorization to share their findings with their 'family of partners.' Everyone and their cousin, basically. Another would grant the ability for those who have completed mortgages to request my information. Which is basically everyone, even those I dont want to do business with.

personalfinance,Credit Union informed me my loan (on auto-pay) has been delinquent since they merged with another CU,"When I initially refinanced my loan with my credit union, I set up auto-pay to debit half of the monthly payment twice a month. This was done in person and I was never led to believe this would be an issue. 

A few days ago I received a call informing me that my account has been delinquent and been hit with a late fee every month for the last two years (since my CU merged with another CU). I went to speak with them in person to get it cleared up, and they informed me that not only is there nothing they can do in terms of reversing the late fees, but that it's my ""responsibility to make sure my account is in good standing."" The next day I was informed that the last three months of late fees was credited to my loan.

Needless to say, I'm furious. I don't know how to proceed though. Do I move my loan to another lender? Do I say screw it and close my savings account with them as well? There's about 3k left on the loan and my interest rate is almost down to 3%, do I bite the bullet and just pay the rest off? Any advice is appreciated.

Edit:

Thank you for all the replies. It's my understanding that it's not enough to just set the auto-pay to come out of my account at another bank without monitoring it still (which is exactly what I did). While it is partially my fault I do still believe they had a good hand in the mistake as well and probably won't choose to borrow from them in the future.

personalfinance,Impossibly draconian estate beneficiary tactics at Wells Fargo??????,"So my two brothers and I are working on my mom's very small estate. She had a brokerage account with Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo is saying that the ONLY WAY they will distribute the funds is for EACH of the beneficiaries to open up not one, but TWO Wells Fargo accounts. One of these would have to be a brokerage account, the other an inherited IRA account for her IRA. We were told that this is because some of the money is in mutual funds. In fact, both accounts are completely in mutual funds. Then, once we each have these two accounts-that is 6 in total-the money will be distributed evenly into the accounts. Then, we were told, we can do 'whatever we want' with them. We are talking about, at most, 10 grand each. I can see that there may be some IRS regulations regarding distribution of inherited mutual funds. It is the notion that it has to be with Wells Fargo that really sticks in my craw.

personalfinance,How many companies can you apply for a mortgage through without it hurting your credit score?,"I've heard from some people that every time you get pre-approved through a lender, it hurts your credit score. Others have told me that you can get pre-approved through as many lenders as you want withing a certain time frame (I've also read this in multiple places) without it hurting your credit score and now I've just recently been told that it's a mixture of both: that you can get pre-approved through 3 or 4 different lenders without it affecting your credit score but any more than that will start to hurt your credit. I want to be able to get pre-approved through as many lenders as possible in order to be able to compare rate offers but don't want to drag my credit through the mud.

personalfinance,Realistic interest rate for car loan,"Quick stats:

* FICO 8 scores: 672 (Experian), 666 (TU), 651 (Equifax), 722 (Auto 2), 680 (Auto 8)
   * Oldest account 13 years, AAoA 6.5 years
   * No current installment loans (paid off student loans in February)
   * Collections account will be removed in about a month, so scores should see a decent increase
   * Aside from the collection about to be removed, only negative mark on credit history is 1 missed payment from 2015
* Annual income of $34k
* Car price will be between 12-15k at most

I know it may seem like a bit of a stretch, but I can spend easily around $400 a month on Uber/Lyft just getting to and from work, so my budget is basically already accounting for a car payment and insurance. If I'm going to be spending that much on transportation already, I may as well put it towards my own vehicle instead of relying on other people every day. I've been preapproved for 12.55% APR through Carvana's lender, but I'm not dumb or desperate enough to take that bait. My CU's best interest rate is 2.75%, but with this being my first auto loan I'm not 100% sure I'll qualify for that even after my collection gets removed and my scores recover.

I know it's a crap shoot with nailing down an exact interest rate without actually talking with my CU or other lenders, especially since it remains to be seen just how much my scores will increase over the next few weeks, but I'm just curious if /r/personalfinance can give me a ballpark figure of what I can realistically expect and/or what sort of interest rate would be acceptable for a car that's no more than 4-5 years old.",finance
personalfinance,Buying a Home at 23,"I am in a somewhat unique financial situation at 23 and this is leading me to consider buying a home within the next year.  
I would love to get some advice from PF and just get a second opinion on the soundness of this plan -- my parents think it would be good for me to buy and I'm inclined to agree.

I am set to graduate this August, and I start working full-time at the beginning of July -- I have been at this company since last May, first as an intern and then part-time while in school.  
My salary will be $80k, and either through promotions or finding another job I am confidant that will increase significantly (25+%) within 2-3 years.
I also have a relatively small amount of student debt (about $26k) at relatively low interest rates (most is at 4.5%).
My grandmother also gave me a number of Series EE savings bonds that she bought in my name (so I am the sole owner), nominally to pay for my college education.  These are worth at least $26k but are not fully matured.
Further, due to the coronavirus situation I am currently living with my parents and after my current lease at my university ends in August, I will be living rent-free until I move to the city my company is located in (both my work and parents are flexible about this, my company is remote-first and I worked remotely while in school anyways).
This will allow me to save up at least $22k, assuming I will not move until at least January 2021.
I am also likely to receive about $5k in cash gifts for graduating.

In summary, I will have a number of cash assets:

* Savings bonds: $26k
* Cash savings, between this July and next January: $22k
* Cash gifts: $5k
* Current savings: $2k

and not too much debt:

* $26k in student loans
* $6k in credit debt **that I am paying off this month (June)**
* no auto loans, but an older car with 200k miles on it that has been pretty reliable

and I will by moving to a medium-high CoL area (Boulder, CO) where I would like to remain and in which it is advantageous to own (e.g. the [nytimes calculator](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html) generally suggests owning is cheaper for properties I have looked at in the area).

This is leading me to consider buying a home next spring (and potentially living with my parents a bit longer to boost my savings for a down payment).
I am considering this with certain self-imposed stipulations, and I would love to get some feedback considering if there are other stipulations I should make or if these stipulations are actually unnecessary:

* I will pay 20% down
* I do not want mortgage payments exceeding 1/3 of my monthly income
* I only want to consider homes I could see myself living in for 5+ years, e.g. no 600 sq. ft. 1 bedroom condos
* I want to keep at least $10k as an emergency fund
* I am currently doing everything listed in the [Prime Directive](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics), e.g. I have an emergency fund (though as a student it was small) and have been maxing out my employer's 401k contribution matching.  I am also going to start contributing to an IRA (though if I decide buying is a good idea, I might postpone that until _after_ I buy in order to build up my down payment savings)

So: does it really make sense for me to buy at 23?  I really want to but don't want to make any colossal financial mistakes this early in my life.",finance

financialindependence,A tool to decide between Traditional or Roth. (Some non-intuitive conclusions),"To the mods: I apologize for posting this repeatedly as I keep tinkering. This will ^(probably) be my last attempt. Thanks for bearing with me.

****

The tool: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18djzfswDcCBcbTNotGX_17hiR2GDE4L7TpHMqjWAtJE/edit?usp=sharing

[As I've already tried to establish](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/goilqx/mythbusting_fire_taxes_why_effective_tax_rates/), when deciding between Traditional (pre-tax) or Roth, it's important to compare your current marginal rate to your best estimate of your retirement marginal rate.

This tool uses the methodology in this Bogleheads wiki page [here.](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Traditional_versus_Roth#Estimating_future_marginal_tax_rate) This tool should accurately estimate your federal marginal tax rate in retirement up to an AGI of around 200-250k (it doesn't account for NIIT, and I assume if you're planning to retire with an income of &gt;200k you can afford a financial planner to do the detailed math).

I've tried to make the instructions, assumptions, and limitations as clear as possible. 

Below are some examples of how the sheet can be used.

****

A 20-year-old singleton making 85k gross has a 401k with 25k in it and a taxable brokerage account of 5k. They're looking to save 20k this year and want to know whether they should use Trad or Roth. They plan on retiring at age 50. This is what the tool reports as [This Year's Recommendation](https://imgur.com/zGjfNnc).

In the Outputs, we can see that the current accounts (401k, brokerage) will grow to 108k and 20k, respectively. With a 4% withdrawal from the 401k and a 2% qualified dividend yield from the brokerage account, they're in the 0% bracket because they don't even make enough income to clear the standard deduction. At this point, making a Trad contribution defers 22% (their marginal rate) and gets withdrawn at 0% (their estimated retirement rate if they make no additional savings).

But what if they do make additional savings? For this, we look at the [Future Year Projections](https://imgur.com/YpOmshy). Here, we look at the case where the singleton continues to make 85k through their career (in real, inflation-adjusted terms) and continues to contribute 20k to pre-tax and 10k to a taxable brokerage. Note a few observations:

1. At age 20, the projection matches This Year's Recommendation. The current marginal rate is 22% and the expected retirement rate with no additional contributions is 0%.
2. If they keep making these same contributions until age 50 (retirement), their projected retirement marginal rate rises to 22%, matching their current marginal rate. In the later years, they could stop Traditional contributions and have the Trad 401k rise in value until the withdrawals fill up the 0-12% brackets. 
3. An awful quirk of the tax system leads to a ""[tax bump zone](https://www.kitces.com/blog/long-term-capital-gains-bump-zone-higher-marginal-tax-rate-phase-in-0-rate/)"" where the marginal rate in retirement will be 27%. This is because ordinary income in retirement in the 12% bracket is pushing capital gains out of the 0% bracket and into the 15% bracket. Every ordinary dollar earned in the 12% bracket is not only taxed 12%, but also causes another capital gain (or qualified dividend) dollar to be pushed into the 15% bracket, for a net marginal rate of 27%. This effect goes away once all capital gains (or qualified dividends) dollars have been pushed into the 15% bracket.

Here's an example of what happens when the user switches from Trad to Roth at age 36: https://imgur.com/9n4ncWv. Unless they do something, they are expected to be in the ""bump zone"" throughout retirement, which is suboptimal. Any extra 401k withdrawals or side gig income sees a marginal rate of 27%. If they instead continue to contribute to Trad until age 43: https://imgur.com/rfaPHS7. The account will now grow large enough that all qualified dividends are ""pushed out"" into the 15% bracket, dropping their marginal rate back to 22% in retirement. 

**** 

Finally, let's look at the canonical exception to the general wisdom that you should contribute to Trad when your estimated marginal rate is low: the medical resident. This worked example shows why medical residents (and folks in similar income trajectories) are an exception to the conventional wisdom.

Here, we have a medical resident who makes 55k/yr and can save 5k/yr during residency. Afterwards, they'll earn 300k and be able to save 100k/yr (40k into pre-tax accounts such as a 403b and 457b and 60k into taxable). First, we can see the Warning box has popped up. If they save the entire 5k in Trad, they'll drop into a lower bracket, so they should be mindful of that. We can see that if they follow the conventional wisdom and contribute to Trad in residency, they still end up withdrawing in the 24% bracket in retirement compared to the 22% they were in during residency: https://imgur.com/QNus3ho. We can see that by contributing in Roth during residency ($0 in pre-tax from age 25-29) they can pay 22% and save 24% down the line: https://imgur.com/rfCw5fX.",finance

personalfinance,Is buying a house even a reasonable thought for us within the next 5 years?,"Edit: Thanks for everyone's advice, this is what I came here for! I realize buying a house in the next 5 years is really not doable. But I will find ways to save so when the time comes it'll be a much more financially sane decision.

My partner and I (we are both 24) would like to buy a house soon (to me in the next 5 years, for him he wants one in the next 2 years) but we are not stable financially yet. I am looking to go to medical school (I'm applying this year so I haven't even been accepted yet and it really is a gamble), and I know those loans will be outrageous. In addition I already have $20k in federal student loans from undergrad.

My partner has no debt but horrible credit as he did nothing to take care of finances the last couple years due to depression (like his credit score is 560). He's working on raising the score now but it's obviosuly going to be a slow process. He honestly just got back into the workforce and is making minimum $28k/yr.

I have just been hired for temporary work making about $52,000/yr. And I'm looking for other work around 50-60k/yr when the temporary work is over. I have a car loan that will be paid off this year and my credit is just over 700.

We are living rent free so obviosuly we are in a position to save. But with his bad credit, low salary, and my unpredictable future I wonder how reasonable it is to even think about buying a house.

We are aiming to save $25-30k this year, I could probably swing more if I budget. We grew up in Southern California and definitely want to raise our family here. But I don't even know if I will be here for the next 4 years, depending on where I get in for school. My partner really wants to buy his grandmother's house off his family, they are currently renting out the house. And according to zillow estimates it's worth around $560k.

How do we get ourselves in a position to afford a house in that price range? I know the best answer is to get more income which hopefully if medical school works out then our income will be substantially more. But I am thinking along the terms of our current finanical situation, is it even possible?",finance

personalfinance,How should I handle med school loans?,"Hi all. This is an alt account.

I'm planning on beginning medical school in the Fall, and I was hoping to get some advice on how I should handle the huge amount of debt (circa 300k across the 4 years) that I am about to take on. For some background, I'm 24 y/o and have a small amount of savings (\~15k) that I've earned working over the last couple of years and a 401k with about 3k in it. I also still have \~21k in student loans from undergrad.

I know I won't be able to do much about the med school debt while in school... my school doesn't allow students to have a job and any job I did take wouldn't make much of a dent anyway. So my question is more geared towards what I can be doing with what I have now. Should I use a portion of my savings to pay off some of the undergrad debt? Should I move the savings into another type of account (i.e. IRA, index funds, etc.) and have it sit there while I am in school? Keep it as an emergency fund while in school?

Also my 401k is through my current employer. Will I be able to keep the account when I leave or will I need to move it somewhere else?

I really don't know that much about finance so I'd appreciate any detailed advice that will help me learn.

Thanks!

3. If lien against the business, then borrower cannot obtain any additional financing on the same business.  Lender may not provide additional funding on top of SBA loan.
4. If borrower is a real estate company and if there is an existing mortgage against the property, then receiving SBA loan can be a default on the mortgage already against the business/property.   
5. If Borrower fails to pay the loan then, borrower’s credit rating will be effected, thus preventing borrower to obtaining additional funding. 

**Penalty:**

1. Borrower shall be civilly liable in an amount equal to one and one half times the original loan amount.
2. False statement or misrepresentation to SBA may result in criminal, civil or administrative sanction, including fines or prison or both.",finance

Reopening has been successful with the help of government relief and additional players joining in the effort to develop COVID vaccines and treatments.

1. **Novavax (NVAX) starts P1 COVID vaccine trial and Merck (MRK) announce development of two vaccines and one treatment.** At the beginning of the week, two biopharma companies announced progress in the fight against COVID, with NVAX starting a P1 trial and MRK initiating vaccine and drug development. These two companies are only the latest to announced positive development against COVID. Merck, well known for their production of penicillin to help keep soldiers healthy to win WWII, is now taking on another war, the COVID pandemic. 
2. **General consensus seems to say, ""the worse is over"", as economies have demonstrated successful reopenings to-date.** Now that all states but New Jersey have plans of reopening, signs of economic life are re-emerging. Spending on hotels, restaurants, and flights have started picking up. “If this is the only wave \[of coronavirus\], it looks like we’ve bottomed out and the normalization process has begun,” said Beth Ann Bovino, U.S. chief economist at S&amp;P Global Ratings.
3. **However, COVID relief has been so great that the U.S. government is considering financial incentives for people to go back to work.** A new study by the University of Chicago show that two-thirds (68%) of jobless workers may earn more money from their state unemployment insurance plus the $600 weekly supplement from the federal government than they would have on the job. In fact, one in every five eligible workers would receive benefits that were double their lost earnings. Because benefits are so great, the U.S. government is worried that citizens may be disincentivized to go back to work.

4. **Furthermore, riots across the U.S. after the tragic death of George Floyd demonstrate instability across the U.S. and is a wild card for the market.** Protests over the tragic death of George Floyd in Minnesota, New York, etc. have resulted in violence, arson, and looting. Political and cultural instability never benefits the economy, especially as it's recovering from the devastating COVID blow.
