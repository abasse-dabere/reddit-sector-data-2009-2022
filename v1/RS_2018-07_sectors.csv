personalfinance,Pay off debt vs longer credit/payment history,"I have 3 remaining private student loans that I am tackling very quickly. $1700 @ 11.125%, $7700 @ 11.125%, and $8300 @ 10.5%. To be clear, the rates are insane and it is my goal to pay them off ASAP. I just paid off a loan that was at 11.5% (I'm doing the avalanche method), but paying it off dropped my credit score by 15 points overnight. So, I'm considering paying down the first remaining loan to about $1k, then going back to the minimum payment and throwing extra money at the 2nd loan until it is around $1k, then paying down the last loan to $1k, then paying them all off together. I realize I will pay a little extra interest (not more than $13 total) doing it this way, rather than doing the pure avalanche method, but the potential boost to my credit is worth it to me. Based on my calculations, I should be able to do this within the next year.

This would allow my average length of account and payment history to be greater, which would increase my credit score. But I'm not sure if paying off (closing) 3 student loans within a short time frame would impact my credit more negatively than the good from the added history. These accounts are the oldest accounts on my credit. Does anyone have experience with anything like this?

I AM paying these off as quickly as possible. That is not my question. *My question is: is it better for my score to have the extra history from all 3 accounts by paying each of the balances down but not completely off until the very end of my avalanche (I will ALWAYS be making extra payments on one of them), OR, should I stagger the closing of accounts (traditional avalanche)?**

The 0.6% difference in interest rates on &lt;$2k is a price I'm willing to pay for better credit.",finance
personalfinance,Considering filing for bankrupcy but looking for more educated opinions.,"Hey guys and gals. Thanks in advance for the wise council.

I’ll try and make this as short and sweet as possible. I’m trying to figure out just how detrimental or helpful filing for chapter 7 bankruptcy could be for my specific situation. Here it is in a nutshell:

I’m 24. Renter with no plans to buy anything but potentially a used van to live out of in the next 10+ years (spare me the “things could change” line because I am aware but it is unlikely). I am a freelancer who makes pennies doing writing work online. Around 16k a year. Before I settled into this new life rhythm, I worked a fancy sales job in the city making around 70k a year. I hated myself and thought about jerking the steering wheel into oncoming traffic regularly during this brief foray into 9-5 life so I quit and learned to eek out a living online. Now, I’m working on starting up a wedding videography business on a grassroots basis (while continuing writing work). I have a few clients and things are going very well so far. I do not need any business loans and likely never will due to the nature of the work.

My problem: during my high-flying sales life, I bought a 2012 Honda Civic at a 20&amp;#37; interest rate (worst decision my 19-year-Old self ever made, wish I’d consulted reddit for THAT one). Unsurprisingly, I’m still very upside down on it with a maturity date of 2020. The payments are not easy to make at $400/month.

In addition to this, I have around $4000 in medical collections from an unfortunate ER visit about two years ago. My credit score is around 520.

So here’s the question; is bankruptcy the way out of this whole mess? I’m not making enough money right now to pay off my debts, and my car just sits in the driveway all day because I never go out and don’t have a commute since I work from home. My plan once my income grows a bit would be to purchase an inexpensive used vehicle in cash.

I see very few downsides so I’m hoping you can illuminate some I’m not seeing. I don’t have credit right now as it is so I’m not missing anything there. Conversely, removing the several collections I have seems like it would do wonders for me, not to mention getting rid of the $17,000 Honda yard decoration.

I have no plans to convert to a nuclear way of life in the next 15 years. No kids or marriage. Tell me reddit, should I consider bankruptcy, or is it truly the end of the world?",finance

personalfinance,Got several letters about student loan consolidation and auto lease termination,"Hi PF folks,

So during the past several weeks, I have gotten quite a few letters that go like this:

""As a federal student loan holder you may be eligible to convert your current high-interest loan into a federally-backed consolidation with a lower rate.""

""Our records indicate that your &lt;insert car model&gt; lease will be ending in a few months.""

""Records indicate you have less than 12 payments left with a month payment of &lt;insert monthly fee&gt; which makes you an excellent candidate for our Lease Termination Event.""

I obviously won't sign up for any of these. But my concern is: How in the world do these solicitors have my financial information? They even have accurate amount of my student loan as well as my monthly car payment. Is this an indication of identity theft? Does that mean my student loan provider and auto dealership is selling my information? Or are they actually publicly available?",finance

personalfinance,Question about 0% APR debt,"So my mind was wandering today, and I began thinking about a 0&amp;#37; balance transfer I had done a bout 6 months ago which I just paid off.  I generally carry no balance from month to month on my cards, and only do if I can do it interest free.  I wanted to finance a home repair without opening a new credit card at 0&amp;#37;, so I chose to go with a Discover balance transfer which is 0&amp;#37; for 18 months but which charged a 2&amp;#37; fee up front.  

I was thinking today about how the fee is technically the interest rate, and then I began thinking about how that rate would be variable based on how much time I chose to pay the balance off over.  For instance, if I took a $5k transfer, paid 2&amp;#37; on it and then paid it off over one year it would equal a 2&amp;#37; APR.  Is that the correct way of looking at it?

The reason I ask is because when I am carrying a balance, every fiber of my being wants to pay it off ASAP, so I will usually aim to pay down the balance over just 3 or 4 months.  However, wouldn't this technically make it more expensive for me?  Would it be better to pay off less monthly over the entire amount of time allowed?  If I do that, I can put the extra money to work in some other capacity that is hopefully beating the 2&amp;#37; fee I paid.  In fact if I paid it off over the full 18 months the effective rate would be even lower 2&amp;#37;, right?  In that case, had I been paying less per month and using the extra amount available to put in account that is making 5&amp;#37; (as the Insight savings account was...but no longer is :-(...) I would essentially be getting the loan for free.

personalfinance,"20k in debt, is personal loan the right path?","I'm 25 and live in NYC area. I work in food service at $17/hr. I live in a tiny apartment for $775 a month. I used to live with my parents and was debt free, but the 2.5 hr commute each way got to me and I decided to venture out on my own. I also got a serious boyfriend around that time and we throughly enjoyed the luxury of the city. Well, three years later I'm now about $20k in debt. We've broken up and I'm living closer to within my means, but the debt is making me panic. Im able to make the minimum payment, but I know the interest will fuck me the longer it hangs around. I've been getting a lot of mailers about personal loans recently. Normally I would ignore those as spam, but I'm wondering if they would actually be a good idea for me. The debt is affecting my credit score and I really don't like that.

 Obviously I was living well above my means and wasn't really paying attention to my financial health. I worked at a restaurant, which if anyone is familiar with, is a very stressful environment. That's not an excuse for my neglect of my finances, but I was very depressed and felt overwhelmed just going into work everyday.  I just ignored my problems and hoped they would go away. Finally I moved to a new job that paid a lot more, which removed some of the stress, but it's still not enough to erase my debt. I started going back to school part time so I can hopefully move into a different field, preferably one that pays better. But until that time comes in stuck on my shoe-string budget. It'll be 3 years before I graduate, and I don't want to let the interest pile up in that time. I'm going to a cuny school, so my financial aid pays for my classes, and it doesn't add to my bills. It does, however, mean I don't have the time to get a second job.

If I got a personal loan to knock out my debt asap, what are the best options? Are there larger cons to this that I haven't thought of? Any help or guidance on this subject would be very much appreciated. The interest rate on my credit card is 14.5%. I feel like that's pretty low but I don't actually know for sure.

And if loans are a terrible idea (which they probably are), what is the best way to get out of debt as quickly as possible when you already live paycheck to paycheck?

personalfinance,"What government/banking paperwork is involved in a family loan, or can you just loan the money?","Just doing some research, but it looks like a family member can loan another family member money without the government and banks involved (other than the bank taking the check from person 1 and having it deposited in person 2's account). The family members set up the loan terms and payment, like on a notarized promissory form, but really the lender just keeps that for their records in case the other family member defaults. That form would include an interest rate that meets IRS minimums of course.

personalfinance,Transition from HCOL to BaristaFI after layoff to improve quality of living?,"**TL;DR - ~500k net worth, disillusioned with the job market, how can I set myself up for happiness for the next 20-50 years?**

**Background Information**

I'm a single 31 year old male living in a HCOL area (DC). My background is in Engineering, and I've worked in a variety of Engineering/PM/Sales jobs, typically as a contractor. For the past few working years, my salary has been between around 120-130k, which is partly due to a strong engineering job market, me switching jobs frequently, and decent negotiation skills.

 Assets are as follows:

Source | $ (thousands)
---|---
Robo-Advisor | 126
Roll-over IRA | 123
Roth IRA | 26
Simple IRA | 10
Solo 401k | 10
E-Fund | 10
Home Equity | 200

Only debt is home mortgage @ 166k, 3.75% interest rate.

Total assets ~665k, total liabilities 166k, NW ~500k. My robo-advisor is set to 100% stocks, with the lion's share of my retirement accounts in VTSAX. 

Not included here, but for completeness there's a very good chance of a 100k-250k inheritance coming in ~5-10 years.

My spending is pretty well controlled, and I don't think I need budget help, but here it is anyway:

Source | $ 
---|---
Mortgage | 850
Other Housing| 900
Auto | 100
Food/Going Out | 250
Everything Else| 400

For a total monthly expenditure of ~$2500. Before any comments on ""OMG Other Housing"", this includes a roll-up of my RE taxes, ALL utilities (HVAC, Water, Trash, Internet/TV), HOA Fee, and planned unit maintenance, so while it's definitely high, it's not astronomical, especially for the area. 

Hobbies and interests are generally low cost/free - gym 4 or 5 times a week, I read heavily, like hiking and playing volleyball and I don't drink or party much. 
 
**Where I'm at now + what I'm looking for**

Got laid off last week due to contract cutbacks.  Trying to figure out my next steps. With my small severance and e-fund, I should be totally fine for the next ~6 months, if needed, without dipping into any savings.

In my fantasy land, the perfect job is one that would give me high levels of independence, autonomy, and flexibility, allow me to work closely and interact with other people, free me from repetitive routines and too much detail-oriented work, and allow me to make decisions. Ideally there is an analytical component as well.

While still in fantasy land, there are quite a few 6 month+ trips that I want to take (hike the PCT, central Asia overland, etc.) and while it's *possible* I could wait for retirement to handle these things, I would like to do them in my 30's while I know I still have my health and the specter of a family/children is far off. So some sort of job/career flexibility where I can take off for extended periods of time, or work seasonally, sounds magical.

**My Options**

* Option A: Continue path of being a government peon, travel in between jobs, aim for retirement at ~40.

  This is the path I've been on, but I'm starting to doubt the long term viability. I see posts on this sub all the time ""I hate my job but the pay is great, should I stick it out for $X more years?"" The main reason I'm worried about this path is because: 
 * I hate the feeling of coming home from work and feeling like I am a total leech, sucking up money and not providing any valuable service at all
 * I know I will be bored shitless once I hit early retirement, at least with my current lifestyle. I can handle 4, or 6, or maybe even 8 hours of freedom a day, but to have ~16 hours free every day of the week? I definitely need something besides my personal hobbies to stay engaged in (or maybe I need to find more hobbies?)

* Option B: Spend more time finding the jobs that match my skillset + interests, don't worry about the ""RE"" in FIRE, and try to make day-to-day work life more enjoyable so I don't feel the need to escape.
  * **None** of the ~8 jobs I've had have ever given me any degree of personal satisfaction. It's either a combination of doing menial work, not having autonomy, or feeling like I'm in a zero sum game (with Sales in sarticular)
 * With my last job (that I just got laid off from), I spent a significant amount of time in the job search process trying to identify and communicate to the hiring managers the things I need to be happy (e.g., ""I'm a very social person at work and customer interaction is important to me""), and I still feel like I totally got snookered. Now maybe this employer was just a bad apple, but considering the whole job search process can take ~6 months, this is a huge personal investment to not get right.  
 * I get bored super easily, so in general I'm worried I'll ever be able to find long-term satisfaction at work.
 * Even though I have ~10 years experience, most of my job duties have fallen under Business Analyst/PM (think managing requirements, understanding scope, dealing with customer issues, etc.). While I think I have many talents and am great at what I do, this is by no means a niche field and I don't really have any specialty. (It seems like every 5th person in DC is some sort of Analyst.) 

* Option C:  Barista-FI  
  Considering the carrying costs of my apartment, this would probably precipitate selling my apartment in DC, and then either finding a LCOL location, or renting for a while, or being a bum overseas for a bit and knocking out some of my bucket list before finding a Barista-FI job. 
 * Considering my non-housing costs are &lt;$1,000, there are plenty of cities where I could buy a house cash with the proceeds from selling my apartment and live a very cheap lifestyle. As long as I'm a good steward of my budding nest egg, I really wouldn't need to work full time or worried about continuous employment.
 * While I love my apartment and enjoy DC living overall, I don't really need much to be happy. The things I would consider a necessity are a gym and grocery store nearby, a decent downtown or city core, walk/bike friendly, and some outdoor activities. There are probably 100 cities that fit this criteria.
 * My main concern is that if I can't find a job I like with 2 engineering jobs, why in the hell would I find satisfaction competing in jobs that are typically lower skilled with a larger pool of competitors? 
 * Another thing I've heard recommended is to find a job in an area where I have hobbies. This sounds like an absolute nightmare to me. I volunteer as an Ambulance Driver at a Fire Department, but doing this for money sounds draining and miserable. The same with outdoors jobs - if I want to go hiking, I want to do it on my terms. 
* Option D: Supply your own adventure!


**My Questions**

This amount was low but it was sort of offset by having my housing and utilities provided by my employer, so I did not have any rent expense. I am now making $66,000 with a promotion to $72,000 coming in a month and a raise up to around $75,000 shortly after. Looking at my 2018 spending, my main expense is rent which comes in at 22% of my gross income (26% of net). 

Clothing expenses were higher than expected due to changing from a jeans and polo workplace to slacks and button down and losing around 40 pounds which made me have to replace some of my wardrobe.

Depreciation expense is just a straight line deprecation of my car (paid off in May 2018) and my bikes (my cap limit is $1,000).

The main category that I need to watch myself on is restaurants and bars which I have spent about $300/month and I want to bring that down to around $200/month by bringing lunch to work.

[Here is my current budget based off of my $66,000 income](https://imgur.com/a/u5lnHFV). Once my promotion is applied, I will be increasing my 401k contribution from 9% to 15%. My budget will remain the same and the increase in income that isn't being routed to my 401k will go to my cash savings.

[My three year comparative balance sheet](https://imgur.com/a/if1Yq2x). My main focus over the last twelve months has been increasing my cash holdings, paying off my car, and increasing my investments. 

My goal for cash is a $10k emergency fund and then I will be devoting 10% of my income to a house down payment savings account. Most of my cash in at Ally in a savings account/interest checking account except for some quick access cash at US Bank so that I can have access to a brick and mortar bank.

Starting with my switch to my new job, I kept my budget the same from when I was earning $25,000 (except for the obvious increase in rent expense) and funneled the increase in cash flow to paying off the remaining ~$10,000 on my car loan which I did. 

I rolled my previous 401k into my IRA (Vanguard) that I opened and I have almost maxed out my 2018 contributions with only $550 remaining which will be taken care of by the end of July. 

Overall, since I started tracking my expenses, [I have seen an increase in net worth](https://imgur.com/a/u4sYP2v) and I've been able to notice that my car was a major money sink. While I was able to afford the payments, basically all of my ""spare"" money was going to the loan payments leading to a nearly horizontal net worth line from 1/1/16 to 6/1/17. The large jump around July 2017 was from a gift of savings bonds that I received that I have been cashing out as they mature (interest rate below 2%, not the bonds that have a 4% rate) and putting that money into my IRA. At the same time, the slope of net worth increased due to earning a higher salary with my change in jobs.

Now that I am settled into my current apartment (might change apartments in the near future) and job, I expect that I won't be spending as much on furnishings and clothing which will then cause my net worth to grow at a faster rate (aided by having more money already in investments and another increase in salary coming soon as I mentioned previously).

**Review of 2018 Goals**

At the beginning of 2018, I posted the following goals in the thread of 2018 goals:

* **Save $10,000:** I will reach $10,000 in cash savings this year, but I won't reach $10,000 added to cash savings this year like I was originally intending unless I sell off some stuff around the apartment that I no longer need/use. This is because I was putting more money into investments and paying off my car (and maybe because I was spending a little too much chasing girls earlier this year. I'm young, cut me some slack, I'm allowed to have fun)

* **Max out IRA and make 6% contribution:** As mentioned previously, I'm $550 away from maxing my contributions and this will be done next month. I am also making a 9% contribution to my 401k and will be increasing this up to 15% shortly. So this goal is completed.

* **Pay off remaining $5,000 of car loan:** This was paid off as my birthday present to myself back in May. That was my only debt and it felt so good to be debt free

personalfinance,"200k School Debt, just graduated, need a plan","I graduated with a debt a bit over 200k. I was at a SUNY School for two years which was I believe 7k or 8k a semester and transferred to a private school to which I- obviously stupid and young- didn't realize  the gravity of the situation. It was 53-57k a semester. Overall I spent five years in school, two in the SUNY, the rest at the private school. I just graduated this summer with a September undergraduate degree in geography with both focuses on the human aspect and the physical earth/environment aspect. Not true 100% hard science but some. 

I am currently in a situation where I am not yet due for the loans (which were all federal- unsubbed, subbed and parentplus- no private loans at all). They are all under my mothers name and unfortunately she is out of her job temporarily due to an injury. So she has no true income, and neither do I fresh out of school. I am job hunting. I live in NewYork-Long Island-  currently but I will also job hunt in North Carolina as my grandparents and aunt live there, so I will have a place to stay for a while. Also it is a bit cheaper down south if I do decide to go there. 

But for right now I need a plan. My mother will help me pay off the loans when they do start coming through. I do not have an exact number but looking at similar threads I'm sure it will be over $1000 a month. I'm sorry I don't have exact numbers but I was hoping that I could get some advice preparing for this monster of debt. Rent is already high here- nearly 2k- and my mother is a single mother.

They don't have to pay rent (living with other family) and they are job hunting, but when they do finally get a job their pay rate is going to be in the $15-$20/hr range, which isn't going to put a dent in that debt given the interest rates.

They haven't missed a payment yet (because myself and other family helped out last month). I think they need to file for bankruptcy as soon as they get a job (because the situation doesn't look salvageable), but that ultimately isn't my call to make and I don't know anything about the process.

investing,GM says new wave of tariffs could force US job cuts,"[Source CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/29/gm-says-new-wave-of-tariffs-could-force-us-job-cuts.html)

[General Motors](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GM)  warned Friday that another wave of tariffs being considered by the  Trump administration could force the company to scale back its business  and cost American jobs.

In comments submitted to the Commerce  Department, the automaker said that the tariffs, if approved, could  drive individual vehicle prices up thousands of dollars, stifling  demand. Such costs would need to be borne either by consumers or the  company.

Last month, President  Trump ordered an investigation into whether imported cars and automotive  components could pose enough of a national security risk to warrant  tariffs of as much as 25 percent. If he goes ahead, it would intensify a  global trade war that has engulfed allies and adversaries. In recent  months, the administration has imposed tariffs on imported steel and  aluminum, along with measures targeted at China.

Carmakers, in particular, have  been caught in the middle of the trade fight. They rely heavily on  metals to build their cars, including parts from overseas. The  president’s threat to pull out of the North American Free Trade  Agreement could also hurt the industry supply chain.

Several other automakers  and manufacturing organizations, including the National Association of  Manufacturers, BMW and Volvo, have also submitted comments on the  tariffs under consideration for foreign automakers and part suppliers.

“Increased import tariffs  could lead to a smaller G.M., a reduced presence at home and abroad for  this iconic American company, and risk less — not more — U.S. jobs,”  General Motors wrote in its comment.

The tariffs would result  in “broad-brush trade barriers that increase our global costs, remove a  key means of competing with manufacturers in lower-wage countries, and  promote a trade environment in which we could be retaliated against in  other markets,” the company said.

General Motors pointed to  other potential consequences, including “less investment, fewer jobs  and lower wages” for its employees.

“The carry-on effect of  less investment and a smaller work force could delay breakthrough  technologies and threaten U.S. leadership in the next generation of  automotive technology,” the company wrote.

A G.M. spokeswoman, Dayna  Hart, said that the company had no contingency plans calling for job  cuts, but that it was “something that could happen.”

“We are still assessing the impact,” she added.

General Motors wrote in  its comment that it has 47 manufacturing facilities, 25 service part  facilities and 110,000 employees in the United States, where it conducts  most of its research and development, design, engineering and other  work.",finance
personalfinance,How aggressively should I be paying off student loans? (OSAP),"Hey

Asking in r/personalfinance vs r/PersonalFinanceCanada because I am living in the USA.. while paying off Canadian student loans.

I recently moved out here for work. I live in a high COL area. I have about 38,000 in student loans (CAD), with an effective interest rate of 5.5&amp;#37; (I have no idea what this means.. please help). 

I used a site called [unbury.me](https://unbury.me) to try and figure out how I can pay it off in a year, and it seems like if I pay around $2500 CAD per month, I can pay it off. I did the math, and it's doable if I cut down my rent.

  
Monthly take home is around $6k. My living expenses currently hover around \~$1100, not including rent. I don't have a car. My largest expense is my rent, which is around $2300.

Here is my current plan:

\- Cut down rent from $2300 to $1500-1700

 \- After saving around \~20&amp;#37; of my monthly income ($1200), that leaves me with $1800-1900 I can pay back on OSAP

My question is, is it smart to aggressively pay off OSAP? Worth sacrificing for?

Background:
I'm speaking of 5 federal loans:
Three of which in the $1.5k range, one in the $2k range, and one in the $3k range. All of these were taken out back in 2008. All at 6% interest rate.

Over the years I was irresponsible and they defaulted, but I was able to get back onto rehabilitating them back in 2016. All are considered ""current"" by now.

Fortunately these are so small and I was thinking about easily paying off two of the $1.5k loans.

What is ""too early"" and should I zero out the ones I easily can to improve my score?
Or would I be better off continuing to satisfy the total minimum payment ($150/month) ?

I know it seems like a nobrainer to NOT carry a balance that can easily be paid off just for the silly sake of credit score, but I'm looking to buy a house soon. Tired of renting.

personalfinance,Inheritance and savings,"Hey guys,

First off, throwaway for obvious reasons.

My father passed away a few years ago due to cancer, left me an inheritance in dollars and the local currency (I don't live in the US or Europe). My mom back then since I was underage put all the money in something called a Certificate of Deposit which freezes the money but gives a certain interest annually paid each quarter of the year. It was a fixed rate of 3.25% for the dollar certificate for 3 years and 10% for the local currency for 3 years which increased every year. Meanwhile, my mom handled the family expenses from her own money. 

These certificates expire soon and I am no longer underage so I can handle these things on my own now. The interest rate has now risen to 17%  for the local in the bank if I want to get a new certificate and 4.25% fixed for the dollar certificate. First off I was thinking of converting the money I have in dollars and using this certificate to gain 17% rather than just 4.25%, but seeing as the economy in my country right now sucks and the local currency keeps fluctuating, I'm very hesitant to do that.

I have no debt or loans to pay, but I have 1 more year of university which I will probably pay for and a few stuff I need, because I'm trying to be independent and actually want to help with the finances of the family when I can. So I'm also looking for a job right now. But that's another story (any job hunting advice is also greatly appreciated.

**Things to note: **

1- I just moved back to my home country and I currently live alone in an apartment we own, my family lives in a nearby country (my parents come from different countries). Any advice for living alone would be appreciated.

2- If I get another certificate of deposit, I can't break it till after 6 months and if I do I'll lose whatever % the certificate is for from the money deposited. So in this case 17% local currency or 4.25% for the dollar deposit. So if whatever emergency happens I'm gonna lose money on the deposit + whatever emergency comes up. So I guess I have to have a separate amount of money for an emergency fund.

3- I don't want to specify my age but it's early 20's

Any help and advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

Edit 1: I also want to mention that I've been historically shit with money, any budgeting and generally being frugal advice would be appreciated.",finance

worldpolitics,"An Agenda for the Trump-Putin Summit To forge a better relationship, Washington and Moscow need to work through the issues that most sharply divide them.","By Doug Bandow
Doug Bandow is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute. A former special assistant to President Ronald Reagan, he is author of Foreign Follies: America's New Global Empire .
___________________________________________


President Donald Trump will meet Russia's Vladimir Putin next month in Helsinki, Finland. President Trump long sought this summit and talking is better than silence. However, without a change in U.S. policy it isn't clear what positives will result.

Much of Washington has fixated on the Russian Federation as America's most dangerous enemy. Democrats who dismissed Mitt Romney when he fingered Moscow in 2012 now treat the White House as Russian-occupied territory. Republicans outraged by any nation which resists U.S. authority see Putin as a leader of the global resistance. American policymakers bizarrely treat Russia as the threat it wishes to be.

The president should approach the summit with a realistic assessment of Moscow's capabilities and intentions. Putin is no friend of Western-style liberalism, but then, many U.S. allies are no less authoritarian. There is no evidence that he bears any ideological animus toward America or Europe. KGB officers were among the most worldly and cynical Soviet officials. Although Putin regrets the geopolitical wreckage left by the USSR's collapse, he has done little to recreate the Evil Empire. Retaking Crimea and gaining influence in Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and the Donbass don't count for much.

Putin's policies suggest that his ambitions are those of a modern-day czar. A globe-spanning empire is unrealistic and unnecessary. Instead, he insists on respect for his nation's interests, expects secure borders, seeks to deter potential military threats, and desires to sit in global councils of power. Nothing suggests plans for aggression against Europe. And the Europeans don't believe so either: even the countries squealing for U.S. troops spend barely two percent of GDP on their militaries, ludicrous levels if they really fear attack.

The United States might prefer the embarrassingly weak Russia of the 1990s, but it is gone forever. Moscow no longer is a superpower-it lacks the necessary population and economy. Russia is, however, capable of asserting itself, as evidenced by its confrontational policy toward Georgia and Ukraine. Yet even there the Putin government's ambitions were limited: seize control of select territories and freeze conflicts to prevent the two nations' admission to NATO. In this Putin's behavior has been ugly but effective, and no worse than that of such U.S. allies as Saudi Arabia, which is waging a brutal and self-serving war, with American support, against Yemen.

While many in the West deride Moscow's security fears, that perspective is easier to maintain with America's history than Russia's history. Add to that Washington's widespread attempts at regime change, support for ""color revolutions,"" and calculated mendacity concerning NATO expansion: Russian skepticism of Western intentions is understandable. What Moscow views as offenses might not justify its actions, but its bill of particulars certainly helps explain Russia's aggressiveness.

Relations, though bad, have not yet turned into another Cold War. To improve bilateral ties the two leaders should start by comparing national objectives. There are no essential conflicts. Even where the two governments appear at odds, such as over Syria and North Korea, the differences are manageable. Moscow wants in on the action and Washington cannot deny Russia a role.

Indeed, Syria demonstrates how U.S. policymakers too often succumb to the interventionist temptation, meddling around the world even when doing so is not in America's interest. Moscow long allied with Damascus. A continuing Russian beachhead there does little to diminish Washington's influence: after all, the United States is allied with Israel, the Gulf States, Jordan, Egypt, Turkey, and just about everyone else in the region. Washington policymakers simply want everything, but that is not always possible.

Presidents Trump and Putin also shared interests open for cooperation. Terrorism is one area. Perhaps Syria and North Korea if the United States is willing to share the stage. In fact, President Trump reportedly is interested in using the upcoming summit to make a deal on Syria that would allow a U.S. exit, a worthy objective. Perhaps there is an accord to strike on Iran, since Moscow appears interested in edging the latter out of Syria.

Even more important would be working together to constrain China, that is, moderate its ambitions and influence. The United States has needlessly pushed Moscow toward Beijing in a foolish though inadvertent reversal of President Richard Nixon's geopolitical strategy. Tensions between China and Russia, the junior partner in any relationship, are evident. Moscow might prefer to look Westward, where its economic and territorial interests are less likely to be overwhelmed.

To forge a better relationship, Washington and Moscow need to work through the issues which most sharply divide them. Since Putin is unlikely to admit to interfering with America's election, the two presidents should agree to stay out of each other's internal affairs. In fact, the United States is a more active meddler than Russia-Washington has intervened in at least eighty-one elections worldwide, including the 1996 Russian contest. And that doesn't include coups and other forms of coercion. Acknowledging its past misbehavior would give Washington greater credibility to complain in the future.

Any agreement should include a plan to fully staff the respective embassies. That is a necessary step toward normalization. It would encourage increased contacts and perhaps expand areas of cooperation.

Even more necessary is resolving the stand-off over Ukraine. Russia won't yield Crimea absent a catastrophic military defeat, so on this issue the two governments should agree to disagree. The United States and Europe could formally refuse to recognize the annexation while effectively dropping the issue. Applying sanctions today is about like Mexican imposing an embargo on America as punishment for seizing half of Mexico in 1848.

As for Ukraine and Georgia, the Western allies should trade a commitment not to enlarge NATO with an end to Russian subversion of Ukraine. The Minsk accord offers a way forward, but has yet to be fully implemented by both sides. Georgia and Ukraine should remain militarily neutral while left free to go either way economically. Tbilisi and Kiev might not like this deal, but America's and Europe's top priority should be their own security. The unattainable perfect should not be the enemy of the possible good: reaching a modus vivendi to end the shooting and allow the countries under attack to move forward.

As with North Korea, the summit is proceeding backwards. Instead of detailed staff work to start, allowing the parties to forge serious agreements to be finalized when the principals confer, the presidents will meet, with something to follow. That something should be more than generic diplomatic boilerplate.

Nevertheless, the president's willingness to meet with nations at odds with America deserves praise. He need not befriend foreign leaders. However, he should communicate with them. If nothing else, the president needs to ensure that both Americans and Russians better understand each other and the issues which unite as well as divide us.",finance
personalfinance,Student Loan Lump Sum Payoff Question,"Hey all - I graduated from college 2 months ago and I was fortunate enough to accumulate some savings throughout my time in college and am going to make a lump sum payoff of my loans - I am wondering if it would make sense to do that and if it would be financially responsible to do so.

personalfinance,In Need of Dire Financial Advice,"I guess the title is a tiny bit misleading considering I’m not really the one that needs help, it’s more so my parents that need help. I’m currently 18 years old and will soon head off to college. With scholarships and working during the summer, I will only be taking out about $5,000 per year in loans for school, and that’s not even including parental contributions. I say that because I’m not sure if I even want them to contribute.

Between my personal finance teacher and this subreddit, I have learned to constantly think about what I’m buying and how bad paying interest is. My parents on the other hand, have not learned these lessons. Once I started asking questions about the types of loans we have, I could not believe what I was hearing. 

Before I go any further, allow me to give some background information on my parents:

Soon after they got married, my dad decided that they wanted to build their own house. In doing so, they took out a $300,000 30 year fixed mortgage. Even worse, our house is far from being finished and now it is worth far less that what it was planned to be worth. In addition to that, we own 80 acres of land as well as a dilapidated farm that we only keep running so my sister and I are allowed to take out government loans(at least that what my dad says). Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that my sister is also in college. My mother also had 6 children. 

With all of these factors combined, my parents have been building up a lot of credit. I found a credit card statement today that’s for $9,000, and they’re paying $54 a month of interest. They have another credit card that’s for $2,000. I actually just paid off one of their other credit cards that was for $1,600 with my graduation money because it disgusted me immensely how high the interest rate was.

My parents relationship also isn’t the best, mainly due to finances. My dad spends a ton of money on the farm, and my mom spends money on a lot of random things, and then they turn and blame the money problem on each other. My mom also hates living on a farm and she’s super embarrassed by the fact that we live in an unfinished house, and if I’m going to be frank, I can’t blame her.

Basically the point of this post was to gain some completely objective advice because any advice I try to give to them...well they just blame each other for it but then do nothing about it. I want to be able to show them this post with random people giving them unbiased advice, so literally anything would help. 

I’m truly at a loss because I am concerned for their future, mainly financial, but also their marriage. I really hope this works because I’m not sure what else will.

Edit: I forgot to mention that my dad has also taken money from my savings account to help pay for the farm and he has also drained some money from his retirement fund, and honestly I don’t even want to know how hefty of a penalty he paid for that.

personalfinance,Paying off car AND Building an Emergency Fund - Am I doing this right?,"Hey everyone. So here's my situation: I'm currently working overseas. My take home pay is around $145k per year, and I have less than $500 per month of recurring expenses. So far, i've managed to pay off all of my credit cards and save up $26k for my emergency fund. I'm also contributing 10&amp;#37; to my 401(k) with a 6&amp;#37; employer match. 

Right now, my only debt is a car loan with $21,000 and 36 months of payments left on it. My interest rate is 2.79&amp;#37;. My plan right now is to aggressively pay the balance off while still saving for my emergency fund. I can pay $2,000 per month and have around $8,000 per month to throw in my savings account. 

My other option is to use my emergency account to pay off my car, with the ability to recoup that money in around 2 1/2 months. 

I'm thinking option A is the safest option, because shit happens and I want to have that emergency fund to fall back on if necessary and 2.79&amp;#37; interest isn't bad at all. Just looking for other opinions or maybe something I haven't thought of before. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Should I be panicking? I am a 25 year old that just graduated with a Secondary Education: Biology degree. My new salary is 36k. My grandpa left me a house that I rent to my uncle for 650/month. I live with my parents. I owe 50k in student loans and 25k to my parents. I also just financed a 13k car.,"I am currently in an overwhelming financial situation so this might be a tad long but I really need some advice. Here is my situation: 

I turn 25 in August. In may, I graduated with a Bachelors degree in Secondary Education: Biology. I start the first real and meaningful job of my life in August (on my Birthday :) ).I will be receiving a salary of 36k. I am guessing that my monthly checks will be 2200-2300 after insurance and taxes.  

Last summer, my grandfather passed away and left me his house. It is still in my mothers name but everyone knows that the house is mine. The house is worth around 200k as is. After finishing the basement and completing some other work on the house, it should be worth between 250k and 300k (completing this work on the house is a long term goal). I currently rent the house out to my uncle for 650 (I would charge a stranger around 1100). 

Now this is where it gets a tad tricky... My mom owes around 45k on a loan that is currently leaned against my house. I'm not sure what the rate is, but I know it is wicked low. I owe 50k in student loans. Part of this debt is through Sallie Mae (~30k) and the other portion is through the Federal Government (~20k). I also owe around 25k to my parents for money/bills that they have helped me with since I graduated high school. The other night me and my mom had a discussion about her paying paying off (in cash) the difference between the loan on the house and the money I owe her and me taking over the loan that is leaned against the house as repayment to her and my dad. I would like to consolidate my school loans with that loan (if possible?) and have this one new loan leaned against my house so that I can have the lowest rate possible. Also, I am a middle school science teacher, so a good chunk of my student loan debt should be relieved by the government unless I am mistaken. 

Finally, I just recently financed a 13k used Subaru. My rate is ~10% and my payments are 263/mo. 

Other than helping out my girlfriend who is still in college pursuing an education degree with a little cash from time to time, and not having to pay rent or mortgage, all of my other bills are pretty standard.

I need general advice about what decisions I should or should not be making in the coming months and years. I need advice about consolidating my loans. I need advice about getting as much of my student loans relieved by the government as possible. I am feeling very overwhelmed by my current situation. I don't know if I am in a good or bad financial situation. In spite of my debt, I believe thy I am in a position to save money due to the fact that I don't have a mortgage bill and am currently collecting rent. 

Any information or advice is very very appreciated. Thank you in advance! 







Edit 1: My mom is adding my name to the house in the next week or two. And the plan has always been to take her name off when I am financially stable. 


Edit 2: For clarification, there is no mortgage. The payment for the loan that is leaned against the house is ~400/month.",finance

I have since left teaching and landed a job in tech making around 80k with bonus.  I live in NYC where I have a studio for $130k, where 20% was put on the down payment, and the other 80% was taken out as a 20-year mortgage with 3.875% interest rate.  Been living there for two years.

Right now my monthly mortgage is around $600, and my co-op maintenance fee is around $400.

I have good credit (800+) and, now that I make more money (around $4500 per month after taxes), is it worth refinancing the loan to a 10-year loan to pay it off quicker?  Do 5-year loans exist?  By refinancing, can I get a lower interest rate?  Are there any other costs associated with refinancing that I need to be aware of?  If I can afford the higher monthly payment, is it worth it?

personalfinance,Struggling with a loan payoff decision,"Hey everyone, 

Going to keep this real simple. I'm &lt; 30 y.o. One of my student loans (variable) has hit 6.75&amp;#37; interest. Am I crazy to pull out 1/3 of my Roth IRA contributions I've made over the last 5 years and pay it off? 

I will have if I pay off that one, another at 6.75 and one at 4.75 which I'll refinance. I can't get to a low enough (fixed, no more variable &gt;:O ) interest rate without lowering the payoff period and if I refinance all three the monthly payment will be higher than I'm comfortable committing to. I'd rather have the option of contributing extra or saving money each month. 

I feel like the money in the IRA is pointless if I'm at 6.75&amp;#37; and honestly I should have just been paying off these loans with the IRA contributions to begin with but the rates were lower before and as the economy has rebounded they've gone up. 

Tried to keep this pretty light, if you need more specifics I can provide.",finance
investing,Considering a leveraging strategy in my Roth IRA. Opinions/criticisms welcome.,"Traditionally I've been a simple 3 fund Boglehead type of investor, but after reading this sub and other material for the past several years I'm considering transitioning my Roth into a strategy that implements leverage and modern portfolio theory. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/430bn6/maybe_someone_will_find_this_useful_basic/) by u/hydrocyanide really started to change my view of risk and return along with following other professionals that post on this board, mainly u/MasterCookSwag, u/hedgefundaspirations, u/hydrocyanide and u/cb_hanson_III, so before I start I'd like to thank you guys for contributing to this board and making it a wonderful place to learn.  I am not an investment professional and therefore don’t recommend anyone following the strategies that I talk about without consulting someone who actually knows what they are doing.

The portfolio would be constructed similar to Larry Swedroe's ""no fat tails"" portfolio.  This portfolio invests 30% into equity asset classes that have a very high systemic risk (small cap US stocks and international emerging markets) and the remaining 70% into something like treasury notes or bills that would be inversely correlated to equities during times of crisis. By doing so you hope to eliminate the extreme left and right tail return events, both good and bad, and achieve a very reliable sequence of returns.  [Historically you would have achieved a very high sharpe ratio and even unleveraged would have a decent compound annual growth rate](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2018&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;endDate=07%2F01%2F2018&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;sameFees=true&amp;symbol1=VEIEX&amp;allocation1_1=15&amp;symbol2=NAESX&amp;allocation2_1=15&amp;symbol3=VFITX&amp;allocation3_1=70).  

The idea of leverage always seemed distant because as a small investor it seemed too expensive.  However, I recently came across the [Direxion](http://www.direxioninvestments.com/mutual-funds?filter=monthly-leveraged-funds#!/) mutual funds that offer leveraged funds for these asset classes with monthly resetting (to avoid leveraged decay of daily funds) and an expense ratio (1.49%) far below what it would normally cost to use leverage normally.  [I was surprised to see that these funds were implemented before the financial crisis, so we can test this strategy through that very volatile period.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2018&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;endDate=07%2F01%2F2018&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;sameFees=true&amp;symbol1=VEIEX&amp;allocation1_2=15&amp;symbol2=NAESX&amp;allocation2_2=15&amp;symbol3=VFITX&amp;allocation3_2=70&amp;symbol4=DXRLX&amp;allocation4_1=15&amp;symbol5=DXELX&amp;allocation5_1=15&amp;symbol6=DXKLX&amp;allocation6_1=70).  We see that over the past 12 years, using 2x leverage with these funds and annual rebalancing this strategy beat the S&amp;P 500 with significantly less risk.

Caveats:

1.	This strategy absolutely depends on rebalancing.  Annually seems to produce the best outcome but I don’t have any literature based evidence of that.  I find it remarkable how much excess return annual rebalancing provides.  [By doing so, you outperform the best performing fund of the 3 by 4% CAGR!](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2018&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;endDate=07%2F01%2F2018&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=-1&amp;benchmarkSymbol=DXKLX&amp;sameFees=true&amp;symbol1=DXRLX&amp;allocation1_1=15&amp;allocation1_2=100&amp;symbol2=DXELX&amp;allocation2_1=15&amp;allocation2_3=100&amp;symbol3=DXKLX&amp;allocation3_1=70)

2.	Along with point 1, the initial buy in is significant for a small investor.  The minimum purchase for each of these funds is $25,000, so you’d need at least $167,000 to have enough to buy in each of the funds with the proper allocation.

3.	Doing so in a tax advantaged account seems crucial.  Otherwise, taxes would eat you alive when you rebalance.

4.	I wouldn’t put all of my money into this.  I am a government worker and I’d likely keep my TSP money into the traditional TSP investments as a hedge.  Barring a market meltdown my Roth IRA should have enough to employ this strategy in a couple of years so there is plenty of time to consider alternate viewpoints before I jump into this.

Pitfalls as I see them:

1.	These Direxon funds are very small.  According to Morningstar they only have $8 million to $25 million AUM.  I’d worry about them folding shop with amounts that small.

2.	The volatility of the individual funds would be insane.  During the financial crisis the equity funds lost over 90% at one point.  You’d have to be a very stoic investor to hold to the strategy when faced with that, and it is easy to say you can do that when looking at the past.  

3.	The number of asset classes is admittedly low.  By excluding so many potential asset classes there is risk of suboptimal returns.  Something like the 7/12 portfolio is much more attractive in this regard, but historically it has been much more volatile and therefore not as attractive to leverage.

4.	This point is entering the space where my knowledge is admittedly limited.  These funds use swaps and future contracts to achieve their leverage.  As interest rates rise and if inflation ticks up what would that do to their expense ratios? It is 1.49% right now when money is still historically cheap, but what happens when that is not true? Would the expense ratios become prohibitively expensive?

So there you have it.  I’d like to elicit the thoughts and criticisms of reddit.  What am I missing?  Thanks everyone.",finance

personalfinance,"PNC deactivated my account because I hadn't visited a branch in 18 months, said it's a federal law?","I keep some money in my PNC checking account even though it's not my primary account, and I keep the debit card with me for emergencies. 

I just tried to use the card at an ATM and it said my account was deactivated. The card does not expire for a few more years and I know there's money in the account.

I called PNC and they confirmed I have money in the account, and it's not the card that's deactivated but the entire checking account. She said the only way to reactivate it is to go in person to a PNC branch and make a deposit or withdrawal, and that this will happen every time I don't visit a branch for 18 months. She said ATM withdrawal and other transactions don't count, I have to physically visit a branch to keep this from happening again.

Is this just a PNC policy or is this really something I will encounter at any bank? My main bank is capital one 360 which is all online so I've never had to deal with this. I have a few debit cards from physical banks where I keep some money in case of emergency, but if they are all deactivated then the debit cards I'm carrying around useless.

Update: I just checked the PNC account and I made a deposit via transfer from another bank in October of 2017, less than a year ago. I can't find when they deactivated my account, so I'm not sure if this deposit was before or after. My last ATM withdrawal was November 2016.

When I was young I had a game that I've been looking for lately, but can't seem to remember much about it.  
What I 100% remember about it:  
- it was a pretty gory shooter  
- the setting was quite dark  
- **the first level started off in a subway train, and moved on to a subway station at some point (it's not Max Payne, gameplay actually started inside a subway car where you were killing peeps)**  
- there were both civilians and armed enemies in the first levels, you could shoot either  

What I **think** I remember, but I'm not 100% sure it's accurate:  
- I think the protagonist had some kind of rather long fedora, I believe it was deep blue  
- the protagonist had a [Deus Ex-style coat](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/deusex/images/b/b8/JCDenton.png/revision/latest?cb=20110906201514&amp;path-prefix=en), I think it was deep blue as well  
- the health on the lower part of the screen was accompanied by the protagonist's face, [Doom style](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nio1jZUaLL0/maxresdefault.jpg)  
- I think the font of the stats (health, ammo) in the lower part of the screen were written with a bloody and sharp font  
- I think it was an FPS with 3rd person cutscenes  
- I remember you could gib your enemies if you shot at their bodies, Quake style  

Anybody recognizes any of these traits? I had this game when I was really little, I'm thinking it was something from the 90s (I was born in '91 and got a PC in '96).

financialindependence,Made it - Last conservative FI milestone. No more goals.,"I've been tracking a monthly spreadsheet since January 2014. Mostly tracking assets/liabilities, but also goals, asset trajectory estimates (based on historical growth), college cost estimates, all sorts of things. Little hobby I look forward to updating every month.

We calculated our expense rate (occasionally refreshing the calculation to double check), with some added buffer to cover things like medical costs after retirement. Then I projected a 4&amp;#37; withdrawal rate goal, a 3&amp;#37; withdrawal rate goal, and a 2.5&amp;#37; withdrawal rate goal being our final conservative goal we'd save for. 

We hit our 4&amp;#37; goal awhile ago, hit our 3&amp;#37; withdrawal rate near the beginning of the year, and in this last July 1st update, just hit our 2.5&amp;#37; withdrawal rate due to a nice stock vest. Our 2.5&amp;#37; withdrawal rate goal was the last goal in my spreadsheet. By any conservative definition of ""FI"" I've come up with in the past, we're there. It's somewhat anti-climactic, because nothing in our life will change immediately, it's just that I have no more milestones left :)

**Caveats/disclaimers/info:**

1. We're privileged to have a (very) high income. I just calculated and over the last 10 years my income CAGR has been approximately 27.5&amp;#37;. My wife also works and while the income growth is a bit less incredible, has made 6 figures for awhile.
2. We're privileged to have our in-laws live with us and take care of our children while we're at work. So we avoid standard expensive child care costs. I'll note this has the trade-off of us not having a ""private"" home, something I've heard plenty of people say they wouldn't be willing to do.
3. I'm very privileged to have a wife who is morally offended by spending money on things which are not necessary and don't add to our happiness. We currently make 7 figures. We just sewed a missing button back onto a 10+ year old shirt of mine. Our kids are almost entirely clothed through freecycle. Our cars were all bought with 60k+ miles for cash, we do our own oil changes, and we just replaced the starter in our 150k+ mile car ourselves. Our home is often 60 degrees in the winter, and 80 degrees in the summer. When we have a free weekend, we might go on a driving vacation, where we always sleep in the car and/or tents. Restaurants are perhaps monthly, if that.
4. We do spend money on things which make us happy. We spend at least $15-20k per year on flights/airbnbs (always the cheapest flights/accommodations available, we just have a lot of people to take with). We have spent many thousands on computer/camera equipment. Our pork is locally raised, our beef is grass fed, our produce is usually organic, etc. We have some pretty awesome hiking gear :) I have \~20 what I'd call hiking knives, much to my wife's chagrin.
5. We paid off our house a few years ago due to the stock market being so inflated, I figured it was a good time to effectively buy a fixed return investment. Considering how much the stock market has continued to rise since then, it's yet another datapoint towards not trying to time the market. On the other hand, I love how small our monthly expenses can be since we have no loans.
6. We have $3MM in umbrella insurance. Feels cheap compared to the potential benefits.

**Next steps:** Around the end of the year I'll be taking some time off work to spend with our kids. However, I enjoy my job, and my wife doesn't mind hers, so we're in an odd state of ""What now?"". We aren't trying to run away from our jobs, so we're trying to figure out how we can take advantage of the additional freedom, without blindly quitting work just because we can. I'm trying to figure out a new suitably ambitious goal now that the goal of ""save a ton of money"" has pretty much been accomplished :)",finance

I loved this car, but moving on...I can't decide what to do next. Here are my stats: 

* 26 year old female making $76,000 per year. Located in SoCal
* Low rent in suburbs...$900 per month
* Additional expenses total about $600 per month
* Less than $5k left on student loan (very low interest rate...not worth paying off early)
* A little under 40k in savings, the start of a house downpayment fund

So my financial situation is pretty good. The question is, do I buy a 5-10k car that may have issues, or get a CPO that's more expensive but more reliable? Also, do I pay cash or finance? It will hurt to deplete my downpayment fund, but that's life I suppose. 

Prior to the accident, my LX had been acting up and causing all sorts of hassle. I might just take this as an opportunity to upgrade to a new CPO Lexus and drive that for another 20 years. What do you think, Reddit?",finance

Traditionally I've been a simple 3 fund Boglehead type of investor, but after reading this sub and other material for the past several years I'm considering transitioning my Roth into a strategy that implements leverage and modern portfolio theory. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/430bn6/maybe_someone_will_find_this_useful_basic/) by u/hydrocyanide really started to change my view of risk and return along with following other professionals that post on this board, mainly u/MasterCookSwag, u/hedgefundaspirations, u/hydrocyanide and u/cb_hanson_III, so before I start I'd like to thank you guys for contributing to this board and making it a wonderful place to learn.  I am not an investment professional and therefore don’t recommend anyone following the strategies that I talk about without consulting someone who actually knows what they are doing.

The portfolio would be constructed similar to Larry Swedroe's ""no fat tails"" portfolio.  This portfolio invests 30% into equity asset classes that have a very high systemic risk (small cap US stocks and international emerging markets) and the remaining 70% into something like treasury notes or bills that would be inversely correlated to equities during times of crisis. By doing so you hope to eliminate the extreme left and right tail return events, both good and bad, and achieve a very reliable sequence of returns.  [Historically you would have achieved a very high sharpe ratio and even unleveraged would have a decent compound annual growth rate](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2018&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;endDate=07%2F01%2F2018&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;sameFees=true&amp;symbol1=VEIEX&amp;allocation1_1=15&amp;symbol2=NAESX&amp;allocation2_1=15&amp;symbol3=VFITX&amp;allocation3_1=70).  

The idea of leverage always seemed distant because as a small investor it seemed too expensive.  However, I recently came across the [Direxion](http://www.direxioninvestments.com/mutual-funds?filter=monthly-leveraged-funds#!/) mutual funds that offer leveraged funds for these asset classes with monthly resetting (to avoid leveraged decay of daily funds) and an expense ratio (1.49%) far below what it would normally cost to use leverage normally.  [I was surprised to see that these funds were implemented before the financial crisis, so we can test this strategy through that very volatile period.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2018&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;endDate=07%2F01%2F2018&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;sameFees=true&amp;symbol1=VEIEX&amp;allocation1_2=15&amp;symbol2=NAESX&amp;allocation2_2=15&amp;symbol3=VFITX&amp;allocation3_2=70&amp;symbol4=DXRLX&amp;allocation4_1=15&amp;symbol5=DXELX&amp;allocation5_1=15&amp;symbol6=DXKLX&amp;allocation6_1=70).  We see that over the past 12 years, using 2x leverage with these funds and annual rebalancing this strategy beat the S&amp;P 500 with significantly less risk.
Even taking into account the financial crisis, this method results in a much more reliable stream of income.  For example, say you retire and implement a 4% withdraw strategy.  [Comparing this portfolio to a conservative, moderate or all stock portfolio over the last 12 years, the income was much more consistent and you would have ended up with more money.](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?ar=2018&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;endDate=07%2F01%2F2018&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=3&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=4&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=VFINX&amp;sameFees=true&amp;symbol1=DXRLX&amp;allocation1_1=15&amp;symbol2=DXELX&amp;allocation2_1=15&amp;symbol3=DXKLX&amp;allocation3_1=70&amp;symbol4=VTSMX&amp;allocation4_2=39&amp;allocation4_3=26&amp;symbol5=VGTSX&amp;allocation5_2=21&amp;allocation5_3=14&amp;symbol6=VBMFX&amp;allocation6_2=32&amp;allocation6_3=48&amp;symbol7=PIGLX&amp;allocation7_2=8&amp;allocation7_3=12)

Caveats:

1.	This strategy absolutely depends on rebalancing.  Annually seems to produce the best outcome but I don’t have any literature based evidence of that.  I find it remarkable how much excess return annual rebalancing provides.  [By doing so, you outperform the best performing fund of the 3 by 4% CAGR!](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;timePeriod=4&amp;startYear=1985&amp;firstMonth=1&amp;endYear=2018&amp;lastMonth=12&amp;endDate=07%2F01%2F2018&amp;initialAmount=10000&amp;annualOperation=0&amp;annualAdjustment=0&amp;inflationAdjusted=true&amp;annualPercentage=0.0&amp;frequency=4&amp;rebalanceType=1&amp;showYield=false&amp;reinvestDividends=true&amp;benchmark=-1&amp;benchmarkSymbol=DXKLX&amp;sameFees=true&amp;symbol1=DXRLX&amp;allocation1_1=15&amp;allocation1_2=100&amp;symbol2=DXELX&amp;allocation2_1=15&amp;allocation2_3=100&amp;symbol3=DXKLX&amp;allocation3_1=70)

2.	Along with point 1, the initial buy in is significant for a small investor.  The minimum purchase for each of these funds is $25,000, so you’d need at least $167,000 to have enough to buy in each of the funds with the proper allocation.

3.	Doing so in a tax advantaged account seems crucial.  Otherwise, taxes would eat you alive when you rebalance.

4.	I wouldn’t put all of my money into this.  I am a government worker and I’d likely keep my TSP money into the traditional TSP investments as a hedge.  Barring a market meltdown my Roth IRA should have enough to employ this strategy in a couple of years so there is plenty of time to consider alternate viewpoints before I jump into this.

Pitfalls as I see them:

1.	These Direxon funds are very small.  According to Morningstar they only have $8 million to $25 million AUM.  I’d worry about them folding shop with amounts that small.

2.	The volatility of the individual funds would be insane.  During the financial crisis the equity funds lost over 90% at one point.  You’d have to be a very stoic investor to hold to the strategy when faced with that, and it is easy to say you can do that when looking at the past.  

3.	The number of asset classes is admittedly low.  By excluding so many potential asset classes there is risk of suboptimal returns.  Something like the 7/12 portfolio is much more attractive in this regard, but historically it has been much more volatile and therefore not as attractive to leverage.

4.	This point is entering the space where my knowledge is admittedly limited.  These funds use swaps and future contracts to achieve their leverage.  As interest rates rise and if inflation ticks up what would that do to their expense ratios? It is 1.49% right now when money is still historically cheap, but what happens when that is not true? Would the expense ratios become prohibitively expensive? ETA: financing costs wouldn't increase the expense ratio, but they would increase the unseen expenses and drag of the funds comprising the portfolio so this will be something to monitor.

So there you have it.  I’d like to elicit the thoughts and criticisms of reddit.  What am I missing?  Thanks everyone.",finance
personalfinance,Should I cash out a small 401(k) to pay off a credit card?,"I have a (very small) 401(k) balance of about $3,600 from an ex-employer. This is not money I contributed; it is entirely funds from bonuses that were paid out to a 401(k) rather than distributed in a paycheck. It is fully vested. 

I left that job about a year ago for my current employer. 

I have two credit cards with balances I have been slowly paying down. One has a balance of ~$6,000.00 with a lower interest rate, one has a balance of ~$3,300 left (out of a $3,500.00 limit) with a higher interest rate (~26% APR). 

Rather than roll this tiny 401(k) into one with my current employer, I have been toying with the idea of just cashing it out, taking the tax hit, and completely throwing it at the $3,300 credit card balance. My reasoning is that yes, I will take the hit, but the peace of mind of being DONE with that card is worth it. Plus, it frees up the $115+ I have been paying on that card monthly for me to throw at the other credit card/build up my savings account. Finally, it leaves me with $3,500.00 open for any extreme emergencies that might arise (definitely a last resort, but it would be nice to know I have the cushion should I desperately need it). 

Is there something I am missing here that would make this an incredibly stupid idea? My mom has been saying I will regret this when I retire (35-40 years from now), but I feel like $3,500.00 extra in my retirement account will not make a huge dent in my monthly distributions at that point.",finance

Now, I'm going to be starting graduate school in the fall, and this year is fully funded by grants so I'm not going to have to take any thing out for tuition and I was just going to pay for class materials on my own avoiding student loans. This is where my question comes in. Should I take the subsidized student loan just for the amount of my car to pay it off. My interest rate on the subsidized loan will be 6&amp;#37;. The interest on my car loan is killing me and I feel like I've been getting no where. I've been trying to make more then the minimum payment, but living in the bay area has made it a struggle to make more then the minimum.

personalfinance,Recommendations for banking IN TEXAS?,"I know there's a wiki with banking recommendations, but the majority of those listed are not in Texas/don't have ATMs in Texas.

We have our car loan through Security Service and our mortgage is with Wells Fargo. 

We hate BofA, as does everyone. Security Service have always been okay, but when we make our car payment there is always a non-teller withdrawal fee so we always drive to one side of town to get cash out then drive to the other side of town to make the payment in cash to save that $10 a month. Their internet banking kinda sucks and we've never been able to set it up as a result of errors on their system (something we still need to go in and figure out with someone who works there).

personalfinance,Looking for advice on asking (or not) about another raise.,"Warning, LONG:

Was working in a somewhat technically challenging field as of last year. IT Director asked me to take a position with the parent company across the hall (3 child companies, 1 parent, same building) for a position that was a fair step backwards in my career path (NOC to Desktop Support). I asked for 10k they said no chance in hell, lateral move. Sole guy doing the desktop support for all 4 companies here got deported. Dec 16th (A Friday) IT Director called me and said if I didn't accept, they would be screwed, so he offered 5k and then a positive review and cost of living which would round up to 6k. I accepted.

Excuse my language but I inherited a fucking mess. Supporting almost 300 users, our MDF/IDF closets are trashed, last guy was playing network engineer (badly) and there are cables going everywhere, nothing is tidy. The desktop workroom is completely trashed. Cabinets stuffed to the gills with pc parts, cables, monitor stands, old user badges, tools. Ive been doing at least 10 hours of overtime a week since December just trying to keep my head above water. Thankfully everyone here has been super understanding of my predicament, I'm the only guy here for a location of almost 300 users that is growing every week. Everyone starts off their request to me with ""Hey b4dkarm4 I know you are super busy but ....""

We got word that this location is going to be the parent companies HQ moving forward, people have been relocating from all over the US and setting up shop right here. I've been begging for another tech to help me out for months now, everyone that interviews with us is just a total failure by either being super socially awkward or just clueless with technology. HR moved down to my office as well, I found out after the fact that the HR rep that's here was originally pushing back on my old IT Director on what to offer me as far as a raise (trying to talk him down).

HR now keeps telling me how they are kind of taken aback at the volume of work I am busting out.

My old IT Director quit 2 months into me starting this job. They lumped all his responsibilities on my direct supervisor who quit about a month after the IT Director. That leaves me with two team leads. One of the leads is leaving in 2 weeks and they just recently volun-told a supervisor at one of our sister companies to do the IT Director and Desktop Supervisors job going forward, so its probably a matter of time before stress makes him quit too.

The lead that's leaving in a few weeks recently came to visit me and help me bust out inventory for the entire building. After he saw my situation here he realized I wasn't embellishing in the slightest, I do constant overtime because if I don't I will be under water within a day.

The end: I really don't feel like I am being compensated fairly for what I have been doing and what it looks like I am going to be doing in the near future. I am basically the ONLY IT guy here for a company of almost 300 that is hiring about 2 to 4 people a week. Honestly I think if they have given me the entire 10k I was originally asking for it would have been almost enough to justify never being able to take time off or call in sick. They finally got my 5k increase applied around Feb and the 1k cost of living/good review whatever shortly after that. Should I ask my boss barely 8 months into this job for a second raise? If I asked for and was granted say another 6k it would make me the highest paid non manager desktop tech probably in the entire company. Should I bite the bullet and just ask for another 6k now? or go big/go home and ask for some large number like 10 or 15k? Should I wait until my review in December to jockey for the raise?

I'm worried that if I wait until December to broach this subject, they might have finally gotten me some help, and then my position will have eroded.

personalfinance,Windfall - Use for student loans or starting retirement?,"My wife (33) and I (30) recently received a gift of $8700. I'm looking for input on where to best use those funds.

For background, we're both decently employed, with our budget (counting plenty of ""discretionary"", non-essentials) lets us normally chip around $1000 into savings. When all bills are paid at the end of the month, we keep a $2500 balance in our checking account and currently have $7500 in an emergency fund in high yield savings (Ally Bank). Debt is $9350 in an auto loan @ 2.24%, and $21,000 in federal student loans at an average of 6%. We have no retirement savings currently -- we've worked in the past few years to build our emergency fund, then had to use it &amp; build anew. Right now we have no employer-matching retirement opportunity.

I'm immediately going to use $3500 of our gift to pad our emergency fund to $11K, which covers 3 months of my wages (I'm the higher earner, ~65% of our monthly income). That leaves $5200 to allocate.

I'm familiar with the Prime Directive flowchart &amp; my gut instinct is to use it to attack the student loan debt, but with our situation I'm tempted to consider two other options:

* Start a retirement savings account. I know we're behind on doing this (our financial situation only became comfortable enough to save decently in the past 2-3 years), and could use this as an opportunity to play catchup.

* Pay off most of the auto loan balance. This eliminates a monthly bill, letting us better snowball the student loans. I'm less inclined to do this, especially with the low interest rate, but crossed my mind -- the reason being that as federal loans, we have the protection of Income Based Repayment in case our income changes, but don't have that luxury with the auto loan.

My gut is still leaning towards making a dent in the student loans, but a few other opinions would let me sleep more soundly on this one.",finance

personalfinance,"Seeking A Steadfast Plan To Pay Off $126,000 of Student Loan Debt","Over the past two years I have been diligently working to lower my student loan debt, and ever so often I will log in to my lenders websites to check the progress only to become mortified at the numbers staring back at me. I pay around $20,000 a year between all my lenders and some numbers just continue to rise. 

I have organized all of my loan information below, and am reaching out to hopefully gain new advice and insights from this community. I am ready to be freed from my debt and finally feel like I can begin saving comfortably for my future.

personalfinance,Got a collections notice for the first time regarding delinquent per capita/occupation tax - no prior notices received but they claim it was sent. How do I proceed?,"Hi r/pf, 
I've been a dedicated reader of this subreddit, and have used the tips to bring myself out of debt, and am on the way to recovery (Credit scores ~780, no collections etc) 

I just got a notice in the mail from a Collections Group (Keystone) about delinquent Per Capita and Occupation Tax to teh amount of $300 including penalties for the 2017 year. 

1. They claim they sent me a previous notice, but I never received anything. 
2. This notice is postmarked June 27, and I just got it in the mail July 2, but the due date on it is June 30 ..... how did they expect me to pay this at all in time? 

How do I proceed with this? I have a full-time job wiht my taxes getting withheld (State and Federal) by my employer - I filed both state and federal within the deadlines this year. My city tax also gets witheld at work. So I'm not sure where this debt is coming from? 

How do I proceed with this? They say I can dispute the amount in 30 days by submitting in writing and request verification, and they'll provide it. Should I call them first? Or just send them a certified mail asking for clarification??? 
I'm somewhat proud in not being in debt/not having any derogatory marks on my credit report, so really don't want this going on my report... Any advice appreciated.. Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Financial Planning and Debt Reduction,"Let me preface by mentioning I am horrible at financial decisions and budgeting and am an idiot. I have a limited knowledge on anything in finance, and have been too embarrassed to reach out. I have read into some of the wikis on here and hope I can get some more pointed advice. I would like an overall viewpoint on where I stand, how I can improve my budget situation, and pay down my existing loans. 

I currently live in California. This was a recent move so I definitely have no idea what I got myself into. 

Gross Income:

- $27/Hr.

- $4,680/Month

- $56,160/Year



Okay lets get on to the damage.

Rent (please dont make me move, its the only thing that keeps me somewhat happy)

- $1,650/Month (This includes a single car garage and utilities; electricity, water, trash, and cable/internet)


Car

- 2016 Ford Escape ~26,000 miles. $11,085 remaining on the loan, 3.6% and $189 a month
- Gas: My travels have been atypical lately (long &amp; out of the way), but I would say ~$150 a month

Insurance

- $130 a month (Auto and mandatory Property Insurance)

Loan #1 

- $7,303 remaining on the loan, minimum payments of $117 a month. This loan consists of the below:

- $1,887.64 at 5.6%

- $3,744.86 at 4.5%

- $729.40 at 3.8%

- $941.99 at 3.8%


Loan #2

- $11,760.58 remaining on the loan, 6.8% and $104.73 minimum a month

Loan #3

- $2,948 at $42.41 (I do not know the interest rate, Perkins Loan)


Medical/Eye/Dental 

- ~$20 a month

- HSA $15 a month (I believe I have about $500 in the account, have never used it)

Retirement:

- 401K: Recently adjusted to 5% (I do not know company match at this time)

- Roth IRA: This one has been sitting at 8% for a few years, last year I selected for it to increase 1% every year until 12%
- I wont pretend that I know what any of the above means, but that is how I have it set up in Schwab.

Entertainment

- Netflix, Spotify, Amazon Prime: $34 a month total

Credit Cards

- I dont have any - hopefully I can get some advice on this for a different thread. 

Food

- Too much: I dont have a good estimation. I am down to work off of whatever is reasonable. Plus side - my work has a mini-market, and it is pretty cheap. Sandwiches/wraps/pita sandwiches/fruit/shit like that for about 3-4 bucks each and another buck for a bag of chips. Free coffee/tea/filtered water, which is also nice. 

Savings

- what savings? I have about $5,000 in my checking at any given time, and I try not to be a piece of shit and buy things I dont need. I want to save money, and I want to have some pocket change to travel back home to see family and friends a few times a year, which I havent been able to do, and am sitting on 120 hours of PTO burning a hole in my pocket.


The only positive I have going for me, is unlimited overtime for the time being. I did not calculate OT in my budget, but man I am bad at math. I have been hitting 70 hours a week minimum every week. I use the spare change and double random payments. $500 on my car, or 400 on a student loan. BUT this wont last forever, I am betting maybe another 3-4 months for unlimited OT. To be quite honest I will burn out after about 3-4 more months anyways. (I have gone through a similar cycle before) However, I am trying to take advantage of this as MUCH as I can and as LONG as I can. If unlimited OT continues past my estimate, I will hold out until it goes away. 

I am 100% up to date on all accounts, and I have never missed a payment for anything. However, I have no fucking clue what is going on please help.",finance

I'd like to think I'd be able to keep this income in retirement but realistically I'll fall to the 22&amp;#37; bracket.",finance
personalfinance,"Should I just aggressively start saving, sit on cash, buy a home? How's my plan?","To get more clear cut answers, my goal for my finances is wealth preservation. I just recently graduated from college and expected to work for the NYPD due to the prestigious reputation and job security it provides as a wonderful career. This is something that I see myself doing and enjoy.

That being said, I'm living in NYC which is incredibly expensive, especially the real estate. I really want to own a home and it aligns with my priority of financial security. Having a place you can call home is important to me and I plan on saving aggressively to meet this goal. This means I'm probably not going to put money into my retirement funds or chase other money making opportunities. 

Now, before people say, ""WELL, THE STOCK MARKET IS DOING GREAT RIGHT NOW, INVEST AND MAKE YOUR MONEIEZ"", I want to reiterate that investing isn't my priority because:

1.) I am not familiar/comfortable/have the funds to invest.
2.) I am content with building my wealth in these early stages of my career by earning salary + overtime.

So I do plan on renting for 3-4 years until I have a sizeable downpayment to outbid people for certain properties. Yes, interest rates are rising and real estate prices are at all time highs, but that doesn't discourage me from buying because I HIGHLY doubt, NYC RE prices will dip or drop, and even if they do, they will correct themselves (pure speculation, my opinion), and also I want to own a place called home. 

I've spoke with a lot of my friends, most of them are Asian people in their 30's/40's who believe cash is king and basically sat on 200-300k cash stashed somewhere and when '08 happened they saw an opportunity to buy a home (for the purpose of home ownership, not creating wealth), and ended up becoming ""rich"". 

Given my situation, I think my job is very secure and I want to focus primarily on my career vs. working this job AND side hustle via investing/running a business, etc. I wouldn't have a problem living well within my means, especially with pay raises every year. 

NYPD Pay BASE salary pay grade from years 1-5 :

1st year: 41k
2nd year :43k
3rd year: 48k
4th year: 51k
5th year: 85k

I plan on being pretty frugal, eat at home, live with my parents, and save pretty much 80% of my paycheck or so for 3-4 years. 

Once I buy a home that I feel is right for me, I would plan on using my 5th year pay raise to start maxing out my 401k plan equivalent and Roth IRA. Then every year therefore, I was planning on paying down the mortgage of my newly acquired home and try to get it paid out as soon as possible. 

I don't personally have any reason why I should invest, but I would definitely be open to the idea since my main priority of owning a home would be accomplished by this point.

Now, before people say ""IF THE INTEREST RATE IS 5% AND THE STOCK MARKET IS YIELDING 20%+ RETURNS, Y NAWT INVEST IN STAHKS?""

Well, besides the reasons listed above, while it does seem like an interesting choice, I am very risk averse when I don't have much to begin with. I may dabble into stocks, but I wouldn't consider it as a way to grow wealth as I find the idea of Real Estate much more appealing to me.

My plan would be to pay off my property as soon as possible, maybe 7 years or so, and try to sync it into a timeline where I would promote to get a higher base pay, AND perhaps buy another home that I would seriously consider living in for the rest of my life. This would free up my current residence, and I could rent it out. Some of you guys may see the net rental income I get as build-up to break even for the principle I paid down early, so I'm not really ""growing wealth"". But I see it as a way to pay it forward, since I'm young and pretty much capable of working as much/hard as possible. (To give perspective).

That's pretty much the general outline of my plan, who knows what the market will be like with rising interest rates and all time high prices. NYC property always appreciates every so slowly, and cost of living is an expense that is very difficult to eliminate/diminish. 

My perspective is that I'm living a very realistic, comfortable, meritocratic lifestyle, so don't go thinking of posting an optimized or efficient way of doing things unknowingly of what the future may entail. (I mean look at the week before the beginning of the 08 crash. Everybody had diversified portfolios, active investments, and all that stung people financially very bad, and the people who had cash/most liquid came out on top of it.)",finance

**\*\*What recommendations do you have in terms of what loans to take out now?\*\***

Is there any way I could get my sister to co-sign? She makes more than my parents combined (\~$80k), but has a lower credit score (\~650), less than three years of credit, and her own student loans. My mom has a really good credit score (\~800). My parents have deferred the parent PLUS loans in their names and have told me that, much like the rest of my college expenses, are my responsibility to pay. I'm nervous to have them co-sign due to their previous financial decisions

**EXPENSES:**

* tuition: $17,776/semester
* rent: $675/month
* mandatory dining plan: $1,000/semester

**PRE-EXISTING LOANS:**

* **Federal Direct PLUS Loan: $1,200**
* **Student Total All Loans Outstanding Principal:$35,657**
* Student Total All Loans Outstanding Interest:$1,495
   * Total DIRECT STAFFORD UNSUBSIDIZED Outstanding Principal:$14,523
   * Total DIRECT STAFFORD UNSUBSIDIZED Outstanding Interest:$1,495
   * Total FEDERAL PERKINS Outstanding Principal:$10,873
   * Total FEDERAL PERKINS Outstanding Interest:$0
   * Total DIRECT STAFFORD SUBSIDIZED (SULA ELIGIBLE) Outstanding Principal:$10,261
   * Total DIRECT STAFFORD SUBSIDIZED (SULA ELIGIBLE) Outstanding Interest:$0

**Side questions:**

1. All of my bank accounts were opened jointly with my mom. After reading this sub for awhile, I am looking to open a bank account of my own. I want to start building my credit and my friends have suggested opening a credit card by entering my parents' income in the application. If I use it to pay for rent (my landlord allows credit cards) and food, and pay it off with loan money, is that a bad idea? Any suggestions for credit cards?
2. I'm debating dropping my school's health insurance ($3,191 annually) and just using my parent's. However, I go to in a remote area and I'm afraid my local health insurance won't cover if I get sick. I frequently get sick.

**\*\*THE LONG VERSION:\*\***

I was really sick last year and failed the same class two semesters in a row, so I need one more credit to graduate. Because I am now on poor academic standing, I have to take a full courseload, regardless of how many credits I need. I am looking into taking this credit at a different **(read: cheaper)** institution, but I need to be back at school by January. However, I imagine I would still be looking at financing that without financial aid.

My parents told me that they would be paying $0 for me to attend college, and they have kept this promise. I receive almost full financial aid from my school typically, with the exception of my parents' expected contribution which is what I take out in loans. My mom started working two new jobs and is making more money; as a result, the calculated contribution and my loans have increased over time.

I read the Wiki and saw that I am not responsible for paying Parent PLUS loans, but my mom has made it very clear that they are my responsibility. She deferred them to extend until after I graduate. Her argument is that I will graduate as an engineer and should make enough money to pay them back, so she doesn't want to waste her money paying them. My parents are still paying the mortgage on our 15 year old house and maybe even my dad's student loans. Neither of them graduated college. My dad believes student loans will ultimately help me build my credit and get a larger tax return, regardless of how I tell him otherwise. I think my parents, however, are benefitting from the Parent PLUS loans on their taxes, even though I will be paying them. I file independently with a lot of very low numbers to enter.

I'm currently living off of $1,000 i got from my tax return (AOTC). I have some support from my sister and boyfriend for now. I am aggressively job hunting and scholarship-searching. 'm having trouble finding work for the rest of the summer because I move states for school.I will be at a different school after this semester, and I will have financial aid there. I will be a full time student until next spring.

Thank you.

personalfinance,Property investments in Brisbane in early 20s; general advice please,"Recent events have provided myself with $100k overnight, I want to take advantage of the slowing property market in Australia and purchase either 1 or 2 ""cheap"" investment properties in Brisbane.

Please rip apart my plan; I want to purchase a 1Bed1Bath apartment in the CBD for $300k~ and an established house in the outer western suburbs for $400k~ both on 30 year mortgages being rented out for the foreseeable future (I live and work in a city with a substantially better earning potential, currently on $92k p/a). My plan is to maintain a positive net income from these properties that is fed straight back into the overheads like maintenance and strata fees whilst making my own contributions, the end goal here is equity, not to own the entire thing right. Given the amount I have I won't be able to make a full 20% down payment however absorbing the increased LMI is perfectly doable given my current financial situation (some thoughts specifically on this would be great), I'm not too sure about how a bank will view this however. 

I'm going to avoid heritage listed properties due to obvious reasons as well as those ""hotel apartments"" in the valley that seem to attract drunk people on weekends (cheap for a reason I suppose). My thinking here is that CBD property is as blue-chip as you get with guaranteed returns whilst playing in the outer suburbs is a more calculated risk (gentrification, public housing re-zoning can really affect your property value). That being said owning acreage even further out gives me the chance to sub-divide if the area is developed but again, major risk especially if it's not generating income.

Some general advice from Brisbane/Australia investors would be great, out of all cities in Australia it appears to have the best investment potential right now given what the influx of new apartments has done.",finance
personalfinance,Advice for lowering $1500/month student loan payment?,"Looking for advice on lowering my exorbitant monthly student loan payment. I have 4 loans at around 8% interest with NJCLASS, that monthly payment is $1200. A few other Navient loans total $300 a month at similar interest rates (7-8%).

So I’m paying $1500 a month in loans alone, fresh out of college, barely making $40k a year (really more like $32,500 after taxes).

Given that I'll be unemployed I wanted to see if it was possible to put my loans in deferment during that time (because technically I'll be unemployed).  The reasoning behind this is that I'm trying to save up an emergency fund, and if it's possible to put my loans in deferment temporarily while I finish saving up an emergency fund it'd help me build it up faster.

After I save up my e-fund I'm planning on refinancing my loans to cut the interest rate in half, so the sooner I save up the e-fund, the sooner I can refi.

- Saving for a home/down payment
- Emergency/general savings
- Travel savings (I really would like to travel more as I've never been out of the US, but realize this is the lowest priority)

personalfinance,Invested in a friends business. Bad move. Need to understand how to take care of the debt or make $$,"Hi guys.

At the end of 2016 I loaned money to a fairly well off older friend for a business venture. We lived in a set of four houses around a pool. One house was going to be used as a co-working space with monthly renters. Another as a living space. I loaned this guy around 10,000$, with a contract saying he would pay the interest because I used my credit card to pay him. ( I like points)

Him and the owner of the properties ended up getting sued for a party they had thrown before I move in and invested. This scared tenants. People left, the business Ideas failed since it was zoned residential. I seemed to have been played. His customers have sued him. Previous tenants have threatened him. His Ex who loaned him money said he's at rock bottom and defeated. I have enough to take him to court, but without money to pay me back, is it worth it to rack up court costs and attorneys fees?

There where 2 contracts. I've lost the signed copies. They were not notarized. I have texts, emails and phone recordings of him confirming everything, plus statements from other people who dealt with him in writing. 

1. **$5000 + interest due back after a year ( which would be November 2017)**

**2.** **~~$2500 + interest due after 6 months. ( This amount I got back after disputing the charge with my bank)~~**

$3300 that he owed me for paying bills and other shit. 

I've got this debt spread across two credit cards. I pay to both at once. The interest charges for either card is about $200 a month which negates probably half of what I pay. I've looked at Consolidation as well. I've never done such a thing. It seems the lowest interest rate I can get is 16&amp;#37; which is lower than the 23&amp;#37; for either credit card.

personalfinance,"$137,000 in student debt, looking for repayment advice","I realize there is an abundance of posts on this sub concerning student loans, but I was hoping to receive some subjective advice on going about repaying mine.

A little background. I am a 24 y/o who recently completed 6 years of undergraduate/graduate programs at a private University in the Midwest region of the United States that required several Federal loans totaling $137,270 to complete. The loans, amounts, and interest rates are as follows:

**Federal Direct Subsidized:**

\-$3,510 at 3.4&amp;#37; interest

\-$4,514 at 3.9&amp;#37; interest

\-$4,500 at 4.7&amp;#37; interest

**Federal Direct Unsubsidized:**

\-$22,285 at 5.3&amp;#37; interest

\-$21,308 at 6.0&amp;#37; interest

**Federal Direct Graduate PLUS:**

\-$52,930 at 6.3&amp;#37; interest

\-$28,223 at 7.0&amp;#37; interest

Although I am not yet employed, it is fairly easy to getting a job in my field in the city that I currently live in. The average starting salary of the job I will likely get is usually around $65K and includes a $2K signing bonus.

I was advised to use the federal Pay As You Earn (PAYE) method of repayment during loan exit counseling, but everyone else I knew advised me to consider the standard 10 year repayment plan or to pay them down as aggressively as possible. I am fairly illiterate in terms of finance so I am unsure how to go about it (I apologize in advance for any glaring financial ignorance in this post).

Under the PAYE method, assuming I get the job and the salary that I previously mentioned, I would pay $390 the first month and $1,131 the last month. After a 240 month period I will have paid $168,958 and have a forgiven loan balance of $133,867 that would be taxed as income that year. Under the standard 10 year plan, I would pay $1,526 a month for 120 months and will have paid $183,145 by the end, with no remaining balance.

I have a pretty good living situation in a city with a relatively low cost of living and would pay no more than $600-800 a month in bills (includes rent, utilities, food and transportation).

The lower monthly payments of the PAYE method are attractive because it would leave me with more money in the present and I would like to travel and have fun. However the thought of having debt for that long makes me uneasy and as I said before, I am not very financially literate and may not be considering something that will lead to trouble in the future. On the other hand, the idea of straining with high monthly payments for 10 years under the standard method is worrisome as well. Some have told me to consider refinancing but I haven't done much research on that front.

What are your thoughts, do I buckle down and repay aggressively? Do I consider the PAYE option? The standard option?

I welcome and appreciate any/all advice on the matter and thank you in advance.

* Rent - $620

* Phone,electricity,wifi etc- $ 70

* Groceries: $100

**Other Expenses**

* Student loan: $1100. ($24,000 with 12% interest rate, I really don't want it hanging over my head for long. I am getting some help from my parents as well to pay this off in the next 24 months)

* No car, health insurance is covered by my university. I don't eat out much and cook mostly at home. 



With this budget, I am barely able to keep any money aside for emergencies. I am also not sure if it is wise of me to keep aside $200 monthly and invest while having this student Loan.

I plan on holding these for at least another 5-7 years. 
I feel it may rather make sense to pay the loan off with the money instead (After paying $1300 monthly, I'll be able to get rid of the loan in 22 months instead of 24 months) and keep investments on hold. 
I am not able to weigh the value of the $4400 worth investment I would miss in these 22 months v/s the high-interest loan I get to repay 2 months in advance. 

What are the pros and cons of this? Also any idea what I could do to cut down on my expenses monthly?

""The Journal also hits on health costs in retirement, which are, to be sure, a matter of concern. But rising health costs are a matter of much bigger concern to the states and federal governments, which foot most of the bill for Medicare and Medicaid, than for retirees themselves.

Yes, examples of extraordinary health costs can easily be found; we’re a country of 300 million people with a highly-flawed healthcare system, so you’re going to see some very difficult individual cases. But again, there is no broad crisis. Data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey show that out-of-pocket health costs are about the same percentage of retirees’ incomes today as during the 1980s. While health costs have risen, retirees’ incomes have risen at least as fast. And, like the CPS, the Consumer Expenditure Survey tends to underestimate retiree’s incomes, so it is likely that true health costs have declined as a percentage of retirement incomes over the past several decades.

Other research on long-term care costs from economists at the RAND Corporation finds that – in good part to due to Medicaid and Medicare footing the bill – the average retiree household spends only $7,300 on long-term care over its entire retirement. Ninety-five percent of households spend less than $47,000 on total long-term care costs throughout retirement. Long-term care insurance makes sense for many retirees, but the fact that bankruptcies are lower among retirees than among working-age households tells us that truly catastrophic health costs are relatively rare.""",finance

**Additional question**: I am planning on purchasing a new (to me) vehicle in 2019. I estimate it will cost around $20,000 and I will put at least half down. In order to finance the remainder, I assume I will have to prove my income. What is the best way to prove income from a self-employed online business such as this? Do I need to give myself a paycheck? Something else?

I have been calling to meet with tax accountants in my area, but I haven't found one yet who seems comfortable advising me with an online affiliate business.

personalfinance,"Buying first car, confused about titles and loans and registration","I'm in my early 20s, living in rural Wisconsin, and I need to get a car for school and work (I've been borrowing a car but that is no longer an option). My grandfather (who lives in Illinois) offered to help me find a good deal and put $1000 toward the purchase, but we didn't really discuss budget beyond this - I thought we were going to talk again but he went out and found a car already for $2200, so $1200 is my share. (It's a garage-kept, low mileage older car - basically a grandparent car that was well-maintained and only driven infrequently, by all accounts it seems like a great car at a great price.) My grandpa has given the seller $2200 cash, and the car is now at his house.

I currently don't have $1200 in my bank account. I have okay credit (690, pretty much all student loans in deferment), so I thought about getting a car loan. I went to my local credit union and they approved me for a 36 month loan (for the 1200 plus title fees and the like) at 7.5% interest. My main concern was getting payments under $50/month. (I'm going to do more shopping around, but I think I'm going to be tough to underwrite a loan for because I'm currently self-employed (not receiving a W-2), though I hope that will change soon. And I also plan to pay it off early.) But my question isn't really about the terms of any specific loan, it's this:

How do I actually go about paying my grandfather for this without lots of unnecessary fees? The bank said they only will write a check to the seller listed on the title, but my grandpa has already paid him. (I assume all banks will be like this.) Does my grandpa have to transfer the title to himself and then transfer it to me (pay Illinois title and then Wisconsin fees back to back)? If so would he have to register it in Illinois and then I register it in Wisconsin? The double set of fees seems pricey.

Or, should I try to get a personal loan instead? I think the interest rate would be 9.5%, if it would even be approved. (If the title is listed with me on it and I title it in Wisconsin, can I put this up as collateral on a personal loan? Is that even something that happens?)

I've had friends helping me understand the loan parts, budgeting, etc., but I'm really lost when it comes to this actual purchase, and my friends aren't sure either. What's the best, least-costly, legitimate way for me to get a loan for this car?",finance
personalfinance,is it a bad idea to elect to do graduated student loan repayments with federal loans?,"after 4 degrees combined (wife and I both have grad degrees for relevant fields) we will have around $70k in debt. 

I threw in $70k at 5% interest for federal loans into a repayment calculator just to get an idea what we would owe, and at a standard plan, we would pay $742 a month for 10 years for $89,095.

for graduated repayment plan, we start out paying $420 a month and finish at $1,260 a month for a total of $94k. 

I once saw someone here say don't assume you'll increase income, but we are looking at starting out combined 96k or so, and that could nearly double 10 years in. I'm in a more lucrative field than she is, but her promotion opportunities are good, and I'll be in an industry where promotion and advancement is standard and yearly. Obviously $94k is more than $89k, but accounting for the time value of money (plus we would put more with $460 a month) could graduated repayment be a good option?",finance

personalfinance,24 Yr Old Needs Financial Advice.,"Hey everyone, 9 months ago I decided to move home to get my life in order. I've cut expenses as much as possible. Unfortunately, my auto expenses, maintenance, gas, and added travel costs were a suck, so I purchased a used car for $16K with a 4&amp;#37; interest rate across six years. I don't regret it, yet. But It needed to be done. I just started my 401k 6 months ago, so it's still small. I have $39K of student loan debt.

My driving record is nearly flawless minus a fender bender 8 years ago. My car was vandalized or hit while parked in my college town 3 or 4 times. I reported it. I'm not sure if that matters, but **am I overpaying for full coverage auto insurance?**

I want to get out of my family home (living in a home with grandparents and mom). I've only been making interest payments with my primary student loan servicer for two years.  I've cut my second student loan in half in just over 8 months. **Would draining my savings to pay my $1,100 loan be a good move?**

I'm building myself up from nothing... Unfortunately, what my core family unit doesn't have much so I can't invest or take any risks with our existing assets. My mom has over 100K of student loan debt. She will die with that debt at her age. **How can I protect myself from her debts?**

Working on a 39,500 salary with 39,500 in loan debt is draining to my psych. I'm ready to grind out of this debt and have even considering switching careers from digital marketing and advertising to information technology, web development, or finance (requires a new degree which I'm not sure is work the cost).

personalfinance,"Recently offered a free older car (2007 Volvo C70), have about 1 year left on my current car loan for a 2014 Ford Focus. Does the increased maintenance cost of an older vehicle outweigh no longer having a car payment?","Per the title, I was recently offered my mom's older Volvo C70 as she just received confirmation of delivery date on the Model 3 Tesla she ordered. I purchased a Ford Focus brand new a little less than 4 years ago before I knew better and have 12 payments left on it. The interest rate on the loan is low (~3%) but the prospect of selling the vehicle and using the gains to pay off the rest of the loan and have cash in hand seems appealing for a couple reasons:

* I don't drive much, so the decreased milage doesn't affect me as much
* It had a recent engine rebuild
* Reported issues with the 2012-2016 Focus clutch (hasn't happened to mine yet)
* Well maintained (Meticulous owner, which I appreciate in this case)
* Less important, it was fully loaded so it's got leather seats, hard drop top etc. where as my current vehicle is very much a base model

My main concerns are that:

* It's got 127k more miles than my current vehicle (167k vs 40k)
* I'd need to transport it from CA to AZ
* It bluebooks for $2k less than my current vehicle
* May be more prone to need major service in the future

The insurance costs are roughly the same. The Focus is ~$15 more per month to insure. My current payoff is about $3700 and I'm estimating the sale price of the vehicle to be about $6000. Basically I'm looking at getting ~2k to no longer have a car payment and take on the risk of an older vehicle. Good idea, bad idea?",finance

personalfinance,Should I refinance my private student loans?,"To sum up, I am a fuck up, but slowly trying to get back on track financially.

Since finding this subreddit, I am slowly trying to get things on track with the wealth of knowledge here (intend to track all my spending this month, have tried budgeting in the past but always got lazy with it).

I currently have a decent paying job (80k last year), but up to my eyeballs in credit card and student loan debt from 4 years of supporting a young family through grad school (phd physics).

Perhaps since my overall finances are still a wreck I may be getting ahead of myself, but I am wondering if it is worth refinancing/consolidating my private student loans (have federal loans too but they are a whole nother beast; currently on income-based repayment).

Total: $29048, 6.31&amp;#37; Weighted average APR, 291.13 Min payment. Estimated Payoff Date 1/22/2030

Basically it is the standard payment that started once I graduated

I checked rates with the 6 banks recommended here:   [https://studentloanhero.com/featured/5-banks-to-refinance-your-student-loans/](https://studentloanhero.com/featured/5-banks-to-refinance-your-student-loans/)

and the best one offered the following rates:

Fixed Rates:

10 Years - $313.24, 5.39&amp;#37;

15 Years - $239.36, 5.65&amp;#37;

20 Years - $205.36, 5.85&amp;#37;

Variable:

10 Years - $312.09, 5.31&amp;#37;

15 Years - $235.05, 5.37&amp;#37;

20 Years - $205.69, 5.87&amp;#37;

They all include a 0.25&amp;#37; discount for autopay.

I would prefer a lower payment, primarily because my credit card debts are higher APRs so I know I need to deal with them first. I also think I need to do fixed rate, so it is easier to budget and I wouldn't have to worry about it going up. But perhaps extending the repayment period another 8 years might not be the right thing to do, either. I could probably afford the 10 year rate; but again, I have much higher interest debts to tackle first.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Hastily opened a new credit card.,"I'm only now realizing repercussions of what I did, but I'm not entirely sure what could happen.

Before I explain what happened: 20 year old student, in Canada, have one sole credit card that I've held very good practices with: full payment, payment on time, my limit is increased every six months (currently sitting at $3000). I more or less do everything with my credit card - be it bills, purchases, etc. I know I'm going to pay it off, so it makes sense to me.

On to what happened today:

I was at Hudson's Bay, a Canadian department store, think Macy's or JC Penny's, shopping around when I'm asked if I want to open a Mastercard to save an additional 15 per cent off my purchase. I didn't really think much of it as I filled out the form. I skimmed through the pamphlet: no annual fee, typical interest rates, details about minimum payments, etc. I don't really have an income as a student, but the portion that asked for income was required so I put in the first number I could think of which was $8800. As the associate was doing things on her end, she exclaimed when she found out I was approved. She mentioned a lot of people not being approved recently which I found odd. Again, I was in a stupid state of mind, and thought nothing of it. I took the Rewards card that I immediately got, and my receipt that acted as the credit card until I got my physical one. I noticed that my approved credit on the card was $6000 - double the limit of my current card.

Is there anything wrong having done this? What ramifications could lying about my income result in? Do I cancel the card or should I just keep it?

I realize these may be a really stupid questions, but I'm concerned as this is the first time I've done this, and definitely the last if it was the wrong thing to do.

TL;DR: Opened a new credit card hastily, lied about my income as a student, and was approved with a limit double what I have. How to proceed if at all?

investing,The IMF officially green-lighted the acceptance of China’s currency – the Yuan – into the IMF’s foreign exchange basket.,"The IMF officially green-lighted the acceptance of China’s currency – the Yuan – into the IMF’s foreign exchange basket. According to Reuters, this move paves the way for the IMF to place the yuan on a par with the US dollar. This is the latest in a series of global developments that threatens to eliminate the US dollar as the world’s reserve currency. 

Experts predict this announcement will trigger one of the most profound transfers of wealth in our lifetime.  So if you want to protect your savings &amp; retirement, you better get your money out of US dollar investments and into the one asset class that rises as currencies collapse.

*The IMF Holds Supreme Power*

The International Monetary Fund, or IMF, is one of the most secretive and powerful organizations in the world.  They monitor the financial health of more than 185 countries. They establish global money rules and provide “bail-out” assistance to bankrupt nations.  Some are warning that any move by the IMF to supplant the US dollar could be catastrophic to American investments.

And now, the IMF has made the first move.  As reported by The Wall Street Journal, the IMF officially green-lighted the acceptance of China’s currency – the Yuan – into the IMF’s foreign exchange basket.  This marks the first time in history the IMF has expanded the number of currencies in the foreign exchange basket. This means that the Chinese currency will now become a viable global alternative to the US dollar.

According to Juan Zarate, who helped implement financial sanctions while serving in George W. Bush’s Treasury department, “Once the [other currency] becomes an alternative to the dollar, rules of the game begin to change.”

Leong Sing Chiong, Assistant Managing Director at a major central bank, said this dollar alternative “is likely to transform the financial landscape in the next 5-10 years.”

Currency expert Dr. Steve Sjuggerud warned, “I’ve been active in the markets for over two decades now, but I’ve never seen anything that could move so much money, so quickly. The announcement will start a domino effect, that will basically determine who in America gets rich in the years to come, and
who struggles.

Dr. Sjuggerud says if you own any US “paper” assets - and that includes stocks, bonds, or just cash in a bank account – you should be aware of what’s about to happen and know how to prepare.  A number of experts believe a recent spike in gold and silver prices is a direct result of the IMF’s action. Precious metals notoriously rise when the US dollar falls.

*The Death of the US Dollar in One Frightening Graph*

For the last 600 years, there have been six different global reserve currencies controlled by world superpowers. The latest – the US dollar – has dominated world currency for over 80 years. The alarming fact is, global reserve currencies have collapsed every 80-90 years for the last six centuries! What does this mean for America and the dominance of the US dollar? Based on recent evidence and long-standing historical trends, experts predict the imminent collapse of the US dollar! What’s more alarming? Many Americans aren’t yet doing the one thing that will save their savings &amp; retirement from US dollar collapse.

Just take a look at the graph below. It shows the lifespan of dominant currencies going back 600 years. Notice that the US dollar has now been the dominant currency for 88 years, about the same length of time as its predecessors.

It’s obvious why experts say that the US dollar’s days as the world’s reserve currency are coming to a climactic end.

*All Fiat Currencies Collapse*

“Fiat” currency is paper currency backed by nothing tangible. As opposed to “sound money” which is backed by gold or some other valuable commodity, a fiat currency is backed by nothing more than faith in the government. The US dollar has been a fiat currency since Nixon closed the gold window in 1971 in what was the greatest heist in American history. The scary fact is, the average life span of a fiat currency is 40 years, and the US dollar has now exceeded 40 years as a fiat currency!

Prior to 1933 and for well over 100 years, the dollar was backed by gold, and $20 bought you an ounce of gold. But after the government stole all US citizens’ gold in 1933 for a $20 paper certificate, gold was revalued at US$35, meaning the dollar was devalued by 43% overnight and all foreign and domestic holders of dollars were effectively robbed.

After Nixon closed the gold window completely in 1971, it took $67 to buy an ounce of gold, devaluing the US dollar by 50% again. Today, it takes well over a thousand US dollars to buy that same ounce of gold. Why? Because the US dollar is now nothing more than a fast declining Federal Reserve note backed by a corrupt government that is saddled with $18 trillion in unpayable debt — growing by $10 million per minute!

*Protect Yourself Before It’s Too Late*

This “Paper Money Experiment” has run its course. The Federal Reserve, the US government, and Wall Street crooks have misused their power by
mismanaging the dollar, and now there are global repercussions. The debt load sitting on top of the US dollar is unsustainable and will continue to crush the dollar’s purchasing power until no one wants to hold US dollars, and they are _no longer_ accepted for global trade. The dollar’s collapse means that every single one of your paper investments that are dollar-backed – stocks, mutual funds, money markets, cash accounts, etc – will go down right along with the dollar! Meanwhile, the government and the banks will find a way to protect themselves at your expense ... !! 

So as we say goodbye to the U.S. dollar’s dominance, it doesn’t have to mean goodbye to your savings &amp; retirement. Remove at least some of your savings &amp; retirement from the dollar-backed, paper-based financial system and protect it with the one asset that has outlasted every fiat currency ever invented for the last 5,000 years: Gold.

My priority was debt, but it's unusual that I qualify to contribute to retirement accounts so I wanted to take advantage and max out my Roth for 2017 while I could.

**Starting Stats - 1 January**

* Debt: $21,355.58
* Assets: $1,362.33
* Net Worth: -$19,993.25

**Current Stats - 3 July**

* Debt - $810.66 (current spend)
* Assets - $7,629
* Net Worth - $6,818.34
* Credit score increase - 175 points

**My Situation**

I am a 1099 consultant living outside the USA so I qualify for the FEIE. That means I don't have to pay state or federal taxes. I just have to pay my self employment taxes.  I also don't have to pay local taxes because I don't stay in one location long enough to establish tax residency. My job is steady part time work (30h/week, recently increased from 20h/week) which brings in @$80k/year, but I frequently work more hours so it's closer to $85k.

**My Process**

- I added all of my debts to undebt.it and tracked it all religiously. I started out with 5 credit cards ranging in interest from 21-25%.
- I did a hybrid payoff model. I had one debt that I could pay off with a single payment so I paid that first even though it was higher interest than other debts. Once that was paid off, I focused on highest interest rate debt first and paid minimums on everything else.
- My spending was already very frugal (I got into debt by being out of work for an extended time) so there wasn't a whole lot to cut back on, but I did tighten up where I could. I don't believe in budgets though so I didn't develop one of those.
- I created a thorough spreadsheet with a column for each paycheck, what bills I was going to pay that period, and allocated any excess to the priority debt.
- This was my first year doing 1099 so I didn't need to pay quarterly taxes. So, I've been putting all of my tax money towards debt and now that I'm debt free I'll backfill the tax savings so I'm ready to pay next year.

**Going Forward**

Now that I'm out of debt, my focus is on saving and investing. 

*My current plans are:*

1. Max out my (limited to $2300) Roth for 2018. This will be done by end of July.
1. Backfill my taxes so I have the money available when it's time to pay next April. This will be done by end of the year.
1. Buy a condo to use as a base and live in it part time while renting it out when I'm not using it (which is that area's high season).  I should be able to pay cash by May of 2019.
1. Start gathering the paperwork to qualify for EU citizenship.
1. Buy a small boat to live on when I'm not in my condo. Targeting fall of 2020.
1. Continue to increase my dividend stock portfolio.
1. Start building a bond ladder.
1. Pile everything else into Vanguard ETFs.
1. FIRE in 6 years.

Based on my projections using a 4% return, a 4% SWR, the minimum hours I will be receiving, and my current savings rate, this shouldn't be a problem and I'll actually likely reach my FIRE goal early.

My r/leanfire goal is $300k, exclusive of the condo and boat. This is 25* my current spend. This spend should drop quite a bit with the addition of my condo and boat so $300k should be plenty for my needs.

*I'll also have the following sources of income:*

1. Rent from the condo - This will likely net $1-2k a year unless the area just explodes, which it has the potential to do. I don't want to be there during the area's high season, so rather than sitting empty it'll bring in some cash.
1. Rent from the boat - This will be maybe $1-2k a year. Again, I won't want to be on my boat during the high season in the region so I'll rent it out during that time. I will also rent it out when I decide to go traveling. I already have people who are interested. The money I get from rent will mostly go to cover my maintenance expenses/upkeep for the boat (10% of the cost of the boat/year) so it'll be pretty self sustaining.
1. Dividends - I'm hoping to get this up to $100-200/month.
1. Bond Ladder - This will probably be @ $200-300/month when they start to mature.
1. Social Security - Using the govt website and knocking 25% off of their estimate, I should get in the $900/month range.
1. I'll consider working on just specific projects, no more than 2-4/day, if that, to keep some income trickling in and not get bored.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Distributed Credit Chain (DCC),"It's no secret that the modern banking system exists only to rob us, ordinary people. This system is designed so that people have to pay for something every day, we are a kind of machine for transferring honestly earned money into the bottomless pockets of the ruling elite. More than 70&amp;#37; of Russians are debtors to various banks and monthly repay the last earned loans. And if you do not pay the bills, then the system has the right to take away an apartment, a car or even put in jail, so there is no particular choice. We are accustomed to consider democracy what is essentially a legal and cunning form of slavery.

But with the advent of the blockbuster and such projects as Distributed Credit Chain, which are able to completely destroy the existing world order and return power to people, we have a chance to restore justice.

Distributed Credit Chain (DCC) is a platform solution that in the future will be able to provide financing services to all those who wish on the basis of blockchain technologies in a decentralized system. The company's plans are grandiose, they intend to become the world's first distributed financial banking providers of financial services. In the future, when people realize that the traditional banking system is much inferior to the decentralized system of Distributed Credit Chain, this company will have its own bank to provide financial services worldwide Distributed Banking.

The main objective of the Distributed Credit Chain is to destroy the monopoly banking system that is flourishing today, to fool people in need of financial assistance. After all people go to banks not from a good life, and all financial institutions use this and drive into even greater debts. Using the DCC platform, you can borrow in any country in the world, choosing the lowest interest rate. For example, in Europe there are banks, lending terms in which are 4 times lower than in Russian banks. Such a decentralized scheme will completely change the corporate monopolies of existing banks, now they will compete in whoever will provide the lowest interest rates to borrowers in order to become the most sought after worldwide in the DCC world ecosystem. This will put an end to monopolists and those who for decades have dictated their rules in this market.

In addition, the whole process of lending is optimized and will begin to pass much faster, credit histories will be in the locker and be checked in minutes. Thus, various kinds of bureaucratic delays will be ruled out with the signing of a heap of papers. Distributed Credit Chain technologies will reduce the costs and possible risks of service providers while reducing the additional costs and commission costs of users.

It will be a self-moderating ecosystem, users of which will be able to find errors and receive for this the internal currency of the platform - coins DCC.

 I would like to note at once that the project has already collected a hard cap of $ 49 million, and this is in the conditions of a general recession in the crypto-currency market, when many companies extend their ICO for an indefinite period. And they collected it in only 20 minutes, so long the public sale of coins. The coin standard DCC - ERC-20, is compatible with the etherium protocol.

personalfinance,Is there somewhere to find out what the auto lender gave me as a rate before dealer markup?,"I had a bad experience with a dealer and I have a pretty good feeling they marked up my interest rate substantially. Is there any way to tell what rate I am paying to the actual lender, Ally, and what the markup at the dealership was?

personalfinance,Student Loan repayment - American living in UK,"I just got married in the UK and now reside in the UK with my English husband. The time has come for me to re-certify my federal student loans on an IDR plan and I am really stumped. Because my income has changed since my last tax return (filed as single as I was not married during the previous working year), I need to fill out the ""alternative document"" form. This requires me to enter my spouse's SSN and tax return info etc but he obviously doesn't have either. Right now I am not working and I live in the UK, and he is a non-resident alien for US tax purposes.

What information do I need to provide the loan servicer? A cover letter explaining the situation? If I need to show proof of his income, what form should that take? Or should I just select the option to base my student loan payments for this year on last year's tax return and keep the payment amount I had this past year, even though I'm not working anymore, and sort this out next year?",finance
personalfinance,Additional mortgage payments (Affordable housing unique scenario),"Hey Reddit,

I have a great question for you.  I was able to purchase a home with some help from a new affordable housing program in the midwest, realtor did all of the work and filled everything out.

I bought a $175k 1 year old town home, with $1,000 down, 4.75% interest rate (30 years).  I do not have to pay PMI and my mortgage payment (with the escrow) is ~$1,300 a month.  All of the houses around me are worth $400k+.

I can pay this comfortably (as my rent was actually higher), my question is should I step up the payments so that I can pay the mortgage sooner?

You may be asking why would I want to pay my mortgage sooner, well.. since I didn't have to pay anything down for the town home, part of the program is that if/when I sell the town home I only get back what I have paid off in principal for the home.  Hence if I pay more of the home when it's time to sell it, I'll get more out of the program/money back.

I ran the numbers and if I pay an extra $1,000 every month to principal I can shave almost 20 years off of the mortgage.  Should I pull the trigger?",finance
personalfinance,Pay Off Mortgage Early or Invest Extra Income?,"Hey all,

The only debt I have now is my mortgage which feels great. I currently owe $174,000 on it. I have a 9 month emergency fund set aside. I maxed out all my 401K contributions (18k) a year and my Roth IRA (5500k) a year.

After all my utility bills, mortgage, and spending cash, I have $4,300 extra a month to either contribute towards my mortgage or to invest in stocks, indexes, and or mutual funds.

My mortgage interest rate is 3.63 % on a 30 year fixed rate. So my question is do I use some or all or none of the $4300 to pay off the mortgage faster or do I invest that extra money into the above accounts where I could see an average return of around 6 to 7% ?

personalfinance,Planning to buy a home soon...,"Hello all, first time poster.  I'm looking to buy a house in the next 2 years or so and I wanted to get some input.  I'm 21 and currently work as a computer technician making 40k a years, however in 2 weeks I start my new position as a network administrator for the same school district making $50k a year and in 6 months I have a performance review for a 10-15k raise.  I have good job security and I'm not worried about doing poorly on the performance review.  I do not have a degree. My current expenses are as follows:

$37.81 for cell phone for 1 more year

$48.80 federal student loan for 7 more years

$415 car payment for 3 more years

$93 personal loan (bad decision) for 1 more year

$264.52 car insurance for 3 vehicles

$90.69 misc (gym memberships, spotify, etc.)

Starting November 2019 I have a $250 a month student loan payment for 15 years as well.

$600+ to savings each month (I send as much as possible, I try to exceed 600, most months I am able to send near 1k)

I pay more than the minimum payment on all debts.

I currently live with my parents who are kind enough not to charge rent and let me eat their food.  I would say I spend about $400+ per month on gas/food/alcohol, etc.  I also own and operate a small landscaping company, this is the first year in business and should clear about 7k profit, expecting to double-triple in size next year.

Any house I do buy I fully expect to have to do some work on.  My family wasn't well off when I was growing up so I learned a lot of DIY and got pretty decent at it.  The house would have to be in Southern New Jersey.

My questions: What are things to look out for when buying a home? 

What should my down payment be? I always see 20&amp;#37;, what are the benefit and harm of going over or under?

What should my credit score be?

In your opinion what should be my budget and why?

Things you wish you knew before buying a house?

Anything else you feel would be pertinent.

personalfinance,22y/o grad school student--unsure of what to do with savings,"As the title says, I'm 22, enrolled full-time in grad school (for physical therapy), and unsure of what to do with my savings. Here are the facts:

* By the end of this summer, I'll have $20k. I have no investments, cars, property, etc.
* I currently have $28k out in loans. I will graduate in 2020 with around $125k in loans, with interest rates between 6&amp;#37; and 7&amp;#37;.
* I will need to buy a car in roughly a year so that I can travel to my clinical sites. Unfortunately, this expense isn't negotiable, as I could be placed at a site nearly anywhere in the state. I want something dependable that I can drive for many years (until the wheels fall off, basically). I was planning on spending about 10k between buying the car, registration/tax/inspection, and having an emergency fund for any unforeseen repairs/incidents.
* I work part-time, but school doesn't leave much time to pick up hours. I make about $3k-4k a year.
* I have virtually no expenses. My parents are nice, so I live at home with no rent, have health insurance under their plans, my mom's company pays my cell phone bill, and my parents pay my car insurance. I was told that I could stay for an extra year or two when I'm out of school so that I can focus on paying off my loans.
* I'm not worried about finding a job after school. I'll be graduating from a fairly prestigious program and live in an area with a lot of job openings. The internet says that average entry-level PTs make about $66k, but I expect to work extra hours/jobs to supplement this (hopefully up to around $80k). After 2 or so years, I plan to work for a travel PT agency; these frequently offer incomes north of $100k. I want to focus on paying off my loans as aggressively as possible.

My question to you guys is this: what should I do with the money I currently have saved? Even subtracting $10k for a car, that leaves me with $10k in my bank account. Should I put it all towards my tuition payments? Should I invest some to start towards long-term goals (retirement, etc.)? Or is there something else I should be doing with it?

I'm a PF noob. I read through the wiki and searched old posts but most of the advice seems to be for working people looking to manage their incomes, not full-time students with a lump of cash that they don't know what to do with. Any advice is appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,Help with 401k Fund selection.,"Hello PF, after months of lurking around finally i have something worth posting here.
I recently graduated and got a full time job. the 401k provided has a 100 percent match by the company upto 4 percent so i have kept the contribution to 4. I am still building up my emergency fund so the Roth IRA and investing in my taxable account is still a month or two away.
Before i joined the company, i was planning to use target retirement funds for my 401k and IRA, but in the list of funds for the 401k the target date funds are from J Hancock Multi Index preserv Fund series. The net expense ratio of the 2060 J Hancock Fund is shown as 0.37% but also it said that its annual operating expenses was 2.1%. Due to that i am a bit confused whether i should use that fund or not.
The other funds in the list are Schwab S&amp;P 500 , VEIRX, VGIAX, VINEX, VIMAX, VMBSX,VSGDX,VTAPX, federal us treasury cash reserves, Goldman Sachs Lg cap growth.

Comparing the expense ratios and then trying for a simple three fund portfolio
it seems i should do a mix of Schwab S&amp;P 500 and VIMAX for US Stocks, VINEX or DFA International Core equity for International
and VMBSX for Bonds.
I am quite inexperienced in all this and ive just put this together from what i have learned lurking in this subreddit. 
So please tell me if i am wrong and what i can take out or what should i keep in. It would be much easier if the vanguard funds in the list were the more well known ones but these ones i had not come across yet. So it would be great to get some suggestions of which funds should i consider keeping in or rather just stick to the target date",finance
personalfinance,Should I start saving for property or pay down my student loans ahead of schedule?,"Hi, 

Happy Fourth of July to all American readers!

I’m trying to plan where I invest my money over the next few years. 

I have $23,000 in student loans currently. $13,000 of these loans have a 6.5% IR, the remaining 10,000 are about 4%.

I also have a car loan with 12,000 remaining, and an IR of 2.1%.

Originally, I wanted to pay down all my student loans then take out a mortgage. But as interest rates on homes continue to rise, waiting to take out a mortgage may be a bad move.

I make about 60,000/yr, although I may make more than this as I work in sales...it’s hard to predict. 60,000 is a good low end figure.

I also live in Arizona, where property taxes are extremely low. This makes purchasing property very practical.

My options, as I see it, are as follows:

Save for a down payment, Take out a mortgage and just pay my student loans over a ten year period.

Pay down by 6.5% IR loans, save for a down payment, take out a mortgage, then just pay the remaining SL over the course of the loan.

Pay all my student loans, save for a down payment, then take out a mortgage.

There’s something very unsettling to me about having a car loan, home loan, and student loans, but this may well be the best actual financial decision.

Thoughts? I would appreciate any advice I could get.",finance
investing,Why does the fed raise interested rates instead of the discount window?,"As I understand it, the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to loans that they make to banks when the economy is growing too quickly to prevent hyperinflation.  They also have the ability to change the discount window as well, which I believe is the ratio of deposits to loanable money.  Wouldn't it be wiser for the Fed to adjust the discount window and always keep interest rates low? That way, when the economy is too ""hot"", the banks wouldn't be able to loan a muchoney out, which would make them be choosier with their loans.  In my mind that would put more of the financial responsibility on the banks.  

Has the discount widndow been used in this way in the past?",finance

personalfinance,What is the monetary value of a 401K plan for me? Is my math correct?,"I work at a startup that offers good benefits / salary, but no 401K plan. I feel like the lack of the 401K makes my total compensation not competitive with the market. I'm trying to understand the value of a 401K plan for my personal situation (or at least come up with a conservative valuation of it). Here are the details:

**Current:**

Salary: 85K

Net Pay (after taxes): 61.5K

Total Annual Net Worth (after taxes, federal and state): 61.5K

**If I invested 18K into a 401K:**

Salary: 85K

Net Pay (after taxes): 48.243K

401K Contribution (max): 18.5K

Total Annual Net Worth (Excluding expenses): 66.7K

Net *Difference: 66.7K - 61.5K = 5.2K*

In order to bring home an extra 5.2K in savings, I'd need to make approximately 7K more. So the value of a 401K plan (without matching) is 7K, any matching is just gravy.

Some other useful details about my scenario. I have no debt, am single / no kids. I'm also maxing out a Roth IRA, but since I live pretty frugally I am saving an additional \~35K on top of that. Obviously that extra 35K isn't tax sheltered in anyway, which is why I feel like the 401K is an important factor for me to consider.

Does this math look solid to you? Are there other factors I should consider in how I'm valuing the 401K?",finance
financialindependence,My dilemma,"Well, I've got a financial puzzle... Been lurking here quite a while and thought maybe y'all might have some good advice, I'd like to know if there's any hope of me ever reaching FI, and buckle up, it's a loooong story.

This starts with me getting my hairdressers license and working on my college degree, both FT and was just getting a great start to life, enter the husband. After I get involved with him, he gets involved in a very strict church, and I get swept up in this, and quit college so I can put him through school and seminary. We are convinced at the time that ""God will take care of you"" and spend our 20s and 30s working and volunteering full time+ in ministry. As you might imagine, this doesn't pay very well, and it doesn't end well, either. He is the Pastor of Worship and I'm a full time programming director/worship leader /choir director/anything else they need director when the pastor we work under resigns. The guy who takes over thinks some of our views are too liberal, and fires us both, and turns around and tells the congregation we left. We discover that THERE IS NO UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION if you work at a church, and no marketable value in the skills you have. I get a job at another church for five more years, and have finally had enough of a miserable marriage, though I have two awesome kids by this point. I'm finally out of the strict belief system enough to file for divorce, but when I tell the pastor, he abruptly fires me. I scramble for work and go back to doing hair. Now I'm a pariah in this stupid small town and decide to get a new start and move with my daughter to a larger area with amazing schools(my son was off to college). My parents pass away and I have about 20k of inheritance, which goes towards me starting my new life, because when I got divorced I lost my church job, and left my husband with pretty much nothing, no furniture or dishes, just my clothes. I plowed through 20k while I was trying to get my kids what they needed and while I was building up a clientele again. So, three years later, I'm self employed and probably about a 30-40k income and my daughter is going off to college, but I'm scared. First off all, I feel really stupid that the money from my parents is gone, though I'm not sure how else I would have gotten furniture and housewares for me and my daughter, and dammit it takes time as a hairdresser to build up a clientele, though that's pretty good now, but that wasn't even the career I wanted, that was just supposed to be to put me through college. So anyway, I'm 48 now with next to no savings, and I work 7 days a week to try my best at fixing this. Any advice would be welcome, I feel like I wasted my life on a bad marriage and the church and just can't catch up, and I'm single and almost 50 with no parents, no SO and no money. I'm pretty and interesting enough to get lots of dates, but I'm not sure I even want to saddle anyone else with this, and I'm not fake enough to be a golddigger,I know I need to do this myself. I would really welcome any advice into this situation. My other skills, I'm a professional jazz singer and perform with some bands and have done piano bar for years, though I put that on hold till my daughter finished HS. I can also teach voice, piano and guitar and did tons of event planning in the church, and have strong leadership skills. I taught cardio for five years, but have had a difficult time getting work without certification in a larger city and, of course, getting certified costs money. How can I turn this around?
I thank you in advance.

TL;DR- I done effed up by marrying a heel and donating my most productive years to the church, now I'm almost fifty with no savings and wondering how I can possibly gain ground now.",finance

This year I’ll be making full salary. I’m planning on sending every extra penny I make to put down back on the loan. The loan I have is in my parents name with CIBC bank, and I only have a TD bank account (because of the cross border banking). That in itself is presenting a problem for me since you can only pay CIBC loans from CIBC accounts? I haven’t even addressed that yet, since thats also such a pain.

My question is for the taxes. If i dont claim my depends here in the states and I do in canada. Will I get get taxed twice? Or is there an agreement that allows me to only get taxed once? Also, I was told if I put the money directly from my paycheck into a loan to pay for it, then it will be exempt from taxation?

personalfinance,"To pay off the mortgage or not pay off the mortgage, that is the question","Without diving into details, it appears that my wife and I could pay off our mortgage right now by using our non-retirement investment money. It would leave us with about $25k afterwards, which still seems like an OK buffer. We also have a line of credit in case of an emergency. We have an interest rate locked at 2.95%. 

The question is-  should we pay of the mortgage?  I’m concerned that the economy is about to tank with all the trade wars taking place. We’ve already started to see losses on the year on our investment accounts. We are both also in roles that may not weather a recession well (in in tech, my wife is in fine dining PR).  Should things go tits up like in 2008, we could potentially see our investment money dive, and our jobs disappear.   We’d have a hard time paying the mortgage in that situation. 

On the other hand, if the economy does continue on OK, we shouldn’t have trouble beating that 2.95% of the interest rate.

personalfinance,"Had debit card declined for online purchase and ""fraud dept"" from my bank called but the phone number is nowhere to be seen on my bank's official website. Help!","Okay, here's the story that happened this morning at approximately 6AM EST. At about 5:20AM EST I tried to buy an Xbox One game that cost $60 from the Microsoft Store, the order didn't go through and I was not charged even though I have more than enough money in my bank account($~400). I didn't think of anything about it since Microsoft Store have effed up in the past. Then at 5:50AM EST or about 30 minutes after my declined purchase, a number that's ""Unknown Caller"" according to my phone caller ID but it was a 1-888 number so I didn't pick it up since most 1-888 are scam/spam/phish/tele-marketers calls. Then, I went to Starbucks as usual to get my caramel frap and bam! It was declined in-store as well but this has never happened before! So I called the number on the back of my bank's card and the first customer service rep asked for my full debit card number and last 4-digits of my SSN and I gave him that and then he said he had to transfer me to the fraud dept as he can see the fraud dept has called me earlier nd put me on-hold. I was on-hold for about 5 minutes and another person was answered and also asked for my full debit card's number and last 4-digits of my SSN but this person also asked for the expiration date and CVV number of my debit card as well. I gave it to the person without any questions(now I have realized that that's so dumb and stupid on my part). She said she will ask me confirm the last few purchases and declined purchases and yes, she gave me the right past purchases and the one that declined this morning. After I confirmed with her, she said she has unlocked/unblocked the fraud block and I can use my card again at anytime. She also said there will be a letter sent to my mailing address(not sure why) and that I should disregard that letter since I have called them to unblock the fraud-block on my debit card. Well, everything does seems to be in order again since after I ended the phone call, I tried purchasing something on Amazon and yes, this time the order went through, no hassle.

Now my question is, was it a stupid and dumb thing to do on my end to give bank customer service the full debit card number, expiration date, CVV number and my last 4-digits of my SSN?

My bank is SunTrust and the first fraud dept number that called me was 1-888-494-0586, is this number even a legit number from SunTrust fraud dept?

personalfinance,A question about student loan debt and current income.,"My fiancée currently has $22k in student loan debt. I don't have the actual breakdown in front of me at the moment of the loans themselves, but I can tell you there are four sub-loans that comprise the entire thing, and the interest rate is the exact same for all four (6.08% I believe). 

We are soon going to be able to start sending them more than the minimum amount that is automatically paid each month, which is $128. Starting in January we may be able to send an extra $200 or $300 per month, and we would like to start doing that.

Now -- the loan payments are based on my fiancée's current income. As far as they know, she is still making $19 an hour (when that is not true, she's working two jobs and they both pay about $28 an hour; one job is full time and the other is per diem, 4 days a month). 

My question is, if we start sending more money to the loan, is it a possibility that the lender will come back and ask where this extra money is coming from, thus increasing the minimum amount due each month? We want to be able to send more than what the minimum is, not just the minimum. Know what I mean?

So I just want to have an idea of how we should proceed with this. And what options do we have with refinancing, if that is a viable option?

Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,I gave my employer the option to pay me more or I would be taking a job offer that pays more. Today's paycheck does not reflect what I was told.,I work for an RV company as a Mechanic/technician and have been with this job for about 8 months. I've recieved multiple offers from other RV places at the same or larger salary but I stuck with my current because I didn't want to commute long distance. A few weeks ago I recieved an offer that dwarfed my pay rate now and brought this to my bosses attention. I said if they could not at least come close to the same rate I would have to take the new position. I was told the next day that they would meet me half way between that rate and my current which was enough for me to stay. Fast forward two weeks and my paycheck today says the same number it always does. Of course my boss is on vacation so I told my GM the situation and he says that he would fix it and I would see it on my next paycheck. Unfortunately now I am hearing through the grape vine that this is a common occurance and I don't know if the larger paying position is even still availablw to me. I wanted to text the man that offered me the other job but I don't want to get his hopes up if my current will actually follow through. What is also troubling is that I have not seen anything in writing for this raise and every time I ask to my boss says we are too busy right now. What should I do? I'm so frustrated I am ready to walk out the front door.,finance

personalfinance,Just graduated college level and starting to tackle personal finance need some help!,Hey guys I just graduated college and I’m starting to take more personal finance responsibility with paying back student loans. I am also looking towards my next car and possible payments on that but I have a question about my credit. I have never owned a credit card because while young I always hear how kids fuck up their credit And etc so I didn’t want to put myself in that position. I am currently looking at capital one credit cards and will most likely get one to start boosting my credit score. My question is do I basically have 0 credit or “ghost “ credit? I have not paid anything on My student loans yet still I have a little period interest free but I do plan on start making payments this month while that interest free period ends around december. My main goal is to Be able to finance a car within the next year or two at a reasonable Interest rate. Is there anything extra I can do to help My credit score to gain these lower interest rates? The car would be around 15-20k and i would want to put down at least 3-8k depending on interest rates,finance

Vechain,[PROPOSAL] Setting up a Community Authority Node,"Guys and gals, please hear me out: 

I'm thinking about purchasing the last tokens to reach my goal of having a stack of 250k VEN and applying as an Authority Node Operator when (or better: if) it is possible.

Since I'm just an Average Joe my only chance to do so is as so-called community contributor (read about it [here](https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/https-medium-com-vechainofficial-authority-masternodes-4c1233c6f18e)).

My plan to fulfill this role as contributor to the community and furthermore VeChain's ecosystem is quite simple and reads as follows:

If I were chosen I would set up a Community Trust Fund which would be fed by a fixed percentage of the Authority Nodes income for the whole duration.

This fund shall than be used for...

\- community events (e.g. Hackathons or other contests)

\- hire professional graphic designers and proofreaders (half joking)

\- offbeat marketing endeavors ( [u/lazergknight](https://www.reddit.com/u/lazergknight) formulated his [idea here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Vechain/comments/8ueo86/daily_vechain_discussion_june_28_2018/e1ggrg4/))

\- pay for VeChain merch for every X-Node holder (half joking again)

\- ...

These are just examples off the top of my head but I think the possibilities are endless and a whole lot of opportunities are opening up.

I would like to involve the community as much as possible into the whole process. Not only now during this concept phase of this proposal but also in the case this plan works out and the Community Fund subsequently collects tons of precious THOR.

**What are your thoughts about all this?** Is this a plan worth pursuing?

Best way to make use of and manage the fund?

Got any exceptional marketing ideas?

How big of a cut for the fund would be fair in your opinion?

Concepts of how find consensus on different topics and work towards set goals collectively?

...

We got a lot of smart minds in here. So please smother me up with as much feedback and ideas as you can possibly think of. Go crazy.

This seemed incredibly low to me, as I see people saying they have rates of over 1% with other banks. I looked at USAA, and they offer [even lower rates](https://www.usaa.com/inet/pages/bank_usaa_savings_rates) for their savings accounts. I then looked at Ally as I've seen them recommended here before, and their [online savings account has a rate of **1.75%**.](https://www.ally.com/bank/view-rates/)

personalfinance,Best way to phrase and request a raise,"So I've been working at my quicklube at a Chrysler dealership for about a year. In that time I've been comission/flag at 16/hr, C-tech at the same rate, and then I was moved back to quicklube at a pay rate of 13/hr hourly. I've been back in this position for about 6 to 8 months (with the company for over a year now) and am very good at it. I work with a partner and we are the best in the department. Usually we do 40% of the cars that come in by ourselves. Some days it's been as high as 60%when the other good team is gone. We're consistent in this preformance too, every day we're pulling this 35-45%. Now it's preformance review season and the boss is finially getting around to us. I've been asking about a raise for about 3 months now. I've got a list of reasons why I'm worth 15-16.5/hr and I would like help selling myself and my partner as worth these rates. 

My reasons are :

1. We have a new responsibility of being the appointment driven bay. There's 4 bays for quicklube and we are the team who can consistently get cars done every 30mins to facilitate having appointments every 30mins and getting contracts with company's that need that sort of turnaround. We were specifically requested to fill this new role by our new quicklube manager. It's a heavier workload than we have been expierencing but nothing we can't handle. We are the only team who can give these results. 

2. We hustle. We were swamped one day horribly, short-staffed too. At EOD we had something like 20 cars done in 7.5 hours, skipped breaks, took lunch. With a car out every 20 mins all day long and then we did trashes. We pulled 50% that day with 4 other techs there, while their times were closer to 30 or 40mins. Our comfortable crusing times are about 30mins, or 15 cars a day.

3. We don't smoke. The smokers in the shop take smoke brakes constantly, during cars even. We take brakes don't get me wrong, but our brakes are between rushes. If there's no cars to do we sit down and take a min, but if there isn't we grab the next one and get it done. Rinse and repeat. 

4. Months of top teir work. We didn't just hit 40% every day recently, that's been the pace for 4 to 6 months now. I remember the first day we hit 50% a few months back, now it's every other Saturday. 

5. Pay rates of other lesser techs. We (my teammate and I earn at the same rate) only earn $1 more than most other techs here. The service writers kid who roasted a 6.7 Cummins (20k shop cost to replace) and continued to work here with MANY other screwups earned at 12/hr. Most of the techs here earn at that rate too. We have been here over a year, are the 2nd and 3rd most seinor in the quicklube and with the ""old man"" leaving here in few weeks were gonna be the old men of the department. Most techs are hired at 11 or 12. 

6. Speaking of screwups we had a vehicle come back with the oil filter missing and a seized engine. We are pretty sure we put the right filter on and torqued it to spec but he wrote down the wrong  filter. (This wrong filter will not thread onto the engine, just slides on and off but I digress) we didn't have evidence so we ate it. My partner was the guy under the car but we share the heat. Now there's been roasted engines before; that Cummins, a boxer 4, and now a Toyota. Never resulted in fireings or other monitary losses for the techs. This is our first major screwup working here and since it's still fresh in the mind of the shop manager I'd like a way to counter it if he brings it up as a negotiating tatic. I'm thinking looking at number of cars done perfectly vs screwups, which would be litterially thousands to one. Ie: 3900 cars through our bay estimated in the past year. (15/day x 5days x 52weeks) One major screwup. Idk, what do you think?

7. Most of those cars have rotates which costs the customer about the same as an oil change for estimation reasons. (List cost is like 40 for an oil and 24 for a rotate but averaged and there's usually cupons). Then theres diesels which cost between 2 and 3 times as much. We estimate we bring in about 169k a year in gross just my partner and I on rotates and conventional oil changes only. Does not include diesels and the rare tire patches ect. We cost the company about 60k gross (estimated from gross pay and what goes into our 401k. Might not include insurance idk). The estimate also does not include what we sell. We recommend additional services by means of our inspections, everything from a 10buck oil additive to $300 drive lines and new tires. We receive 1 dollar spiffs for these sales. Weather it's a oil additive or a driveline it's one buck. 

8. A few months ago I received an unsolicited offer for employment working on fleet semis for a company here at 17 to 19/hr hourly with about 10hrs overtime a week. I turned it down because I really love it here. I got the hours I want, overtime is a request away, the people are good, and at the end of the day working with my partner makes the job easy. We pick up the slack for each other if the days bad and we really have good mojo. I like it here, it's the best job I've had in my 20yrs on this planet. 

Kind of leading off my last point what's the best way to negotiate with my shop manager? He's good at negotiating and I don't really want to threaten to leave. Cuz he might call my bluff. It's unlikely as he needs me but he might. 
 I don't trust the shop manager to actually examine our preformance thoroughly or write a preformance review. So I'm considering analyzing our work from the repair order signout sheet and giving him a report of our work for as long as the sign out sheets go back to. From how fat the stack is it's probably a month and a half to 2. I'll include information such as time we took to finish the RO, number of cars taken, percentage of cars taken, amount of work done by us (oil change count and rotate count) and any other relevant information I come across when looking at the sheets. I don't want to step on my bosses toes but im sick of feeling like I'm being paid less than I'm worth. I work damn hard for this job and I love it but it's going to be difficult to move out comfortably at my current rate. 
And lastly when I am happy with an offer the manager makes id like to take that in writing as he hasn't been the quickest on getting my pay changed. Ie when I went hourly it took about a month and a half. And when it's wrong I gotta ride him to get it back. Reviews were supposed to be last month too.

personalfinance,Thoughts on my college cost circumstances?,"Background?:

I went to community college for 3 years to get all of my gen eds, and I'm transferring to the University of Illinois for Engineering Mechanics (it's very similar to Mechanical Engineering, but it requires harder math and engineering courses at the expense of a couple classes that Mechanical Engineers take).

In total, the cost of attendance is $36k a year, but that includes every cost under the sun. My cost of living will be covered by parents, so I'm thinking I'll only take loans out for the tuition and books, which comes around to $22k.  After I consider the scholarship(s) I received, it comes to around $17k a year. I have been approved for $7.5k (mix of direct subsidized and unsubsidized) loans with a 5% rate. I was offered the Federal ParentPlus Loans with a rate of 7% as well. I tried finding other loan rates, but they all seem to have a minimum of 5.25%. so I'm assuming worse case scenario is that I use ParentPlus.

I intend to graduate after 2.5 years, so the amount of loans I'll accumulate is ~18.8k @ 5% and ~25k @ 7% once I graduate ($43.8k in total, but may come out to $59k after 10 years).

**Is this particularly bad?**

I'm kinda getting scared the more I read about school loans, but everyone in my family is very adamant about me pursuing **a Bachelor's, and if I don't go now, they say I may never want to go afterwards. I'm also a little worried I won't find a job because I try to brace for the worst. Maybe I'm a tad pessimistic, but I'm also the first in my family to go to a University - period. No one in my family has gone through this so it feels like I'm alone.

I don't know if it matters, I had a 4.00 GPA throughout community college, so I'm somewhat confident** in my academics. I know Uni is harder so I'm preparing for that.

**Expected ER expenses:**   
Husband's pension kicks in in 15 years. We would both like to retire at that point (he will be 52, I will be 40) without changing our lifestyle substantially. My student loan should be eliminated via PSLF by that point, we anticipate monthly expenses won't include two car payments or the extra mortgage payment either... Still, we would like to budget for increased travel and of course health care costs at that stage. We anticipate needing approximately $75,000 annually. **His pension should cover $40,000 of this (for his life and mine as survivor).**  


One other note: I also have a pension, which will not kick in until I turn 60 - if I quit working in 15 years, it will add about $24,000 to our income.  


If you consider our extra mortgage payment part of our overall investment plan (which it is - and after PMI is eliminated, will go to our brokerage acct), we're investing $40,500/year ($6750x2 - 401ks, $9000 brokerage, $18k extra mortgage payments). Just a quick investment return calculator shows me that with 6&amp;#37; returns, we should be approaching $1 million in 15 years (we invest bonuses as well - and incomes will likely increase slightly in that time frame as well).  **So, I'm thinking - looking ahead, a 4\% draw from that - along with his pension - should put us at around $80k/year**. Ignoring, of course, things that will kick in further down the road like my pension and social security.  


So a few questions:   
1. Overall, are we on the right track to make this happen? Any recommendations? I know we could be more frugal - but we're not looking to retire asap, just at a specific point 15 years down the road.   


2. Are we doing the right thing paying down the mortgage to eliminate PMI and THEN putting that money towards our investments?  


3. Am I doing the right thing by counting on PSLF for my student loan and making the minimum payment for ten years? I plan to remain in eligible employment throughout that period...",finance

personalfinance,Nelson Nash &amp; Infinite Banking: Scam or no?,"This weekend my uncle came to town for the fourth of July. He gave me a pretty strong lecture on the work of Nelson Nash which he has used to accumulate some of the wealth he has today.

Essentially, my understanding is the concept is based off of Whole Life insurance plans which provide extra high premiums. They allow you to borrow money against your own life insurance policy and set your own interest rates, essentially hedging your risk against the value of your own life policy should you pass away.

That being said, my uncle is a doctor and I studied economics (not finance!) and I am a bit hesitant on whether to take him seriously. Curious if anyone else has heard of this and what thoughts are on the philosophy and how it compares to more traditional approaches to wealth accumulation and management. Pros? Cons?

I am a regular stock trader/investor. in 2016 I had some money in the JNK (Junk-bond or corporate bond) ETF. It gives a regular monthly dividend at about 5.5% yield which is a handy way to get a small but regular monthly income from assets. In 2016 I not only got the dividends, but my principle investment also went up, so I got a ""double.""

But now bond values are currently going down because interest rates are going up (meaning existing bonds that were issued at lower rates are now less valuable). As that happens the trading price of JNK goes down, so while you make the dividend money, you lose on the principle amount.

Any ideas on when or how we will know when getting back into a corporate bond fund will be a good move again? The logical answer is ""when interest rates peak"" but is there a more concise answer or leading indicator on when getting back into these funds is the right move?",finance

personalfinance,"Another IRS scam -- thanks for making me wiser, r/personalfinance!","Well, I haven't had one of these calls yet, and even though I knew it was a scam, everything they told me scared me. If I hadn't known it was a scam, I probably would have given in, so I figured I should share in case someone else gets a similar call.

I received 3 phone calls between 12:40pm and 2:03pm PST from an 803 number out of South Carolina. I did not answer any of them. They left the same 32-second robo voicemail each time. The beginning was cut off, but the recording said they were with the IRS and the federal government had filed a lawsuit against me due to tax delinquency. 

I finally called back. It was hard to understand both people I spoke to and I frequently had to ask them to repeat themselves. They told me it was a federally-recorded line. \*\*Here's your reminder to never use the words ""yes"" or ""yeah"" on any kind of a phone call like this. If they edit the recording to make it sound like you agreed to something and you don't have your own recording, you can't prove you never agreed to it. Say things like ""I understand"" or ""That's correct"" instead.\*\*

I first spoke to a William who told he was an officer with the IRS Criminal Department, badge number 971436 and told me I had not filed my taxes properly from 2011-2016 and I owed the IRS $3,868. He told me my case file number and the ""Doc"" number and said the allegations include: violating federal tax regulations, violating Internal Revenue code, theft by deception, and willful misrepresentation to the government. He told me I could either end the phone call now and he would transfer my case file and warrant to the local authorities who would arrest me within the hour and my car, house, wages, and other assets would be seized, or I could be transferred to the IRS Criminal Department's Resolvment Team. I chose to be transferred. 

David picked up my call and asked if I had enough money to resolve the issue. I told him that didn't matter and asked what the steps for resolvement are. He told me: 1) stay on the phone during the entire resolvement process, which would take approximately 2 hours; 2) the mode of payment would not be a normal IRS-approved payment (check or credit card), but had to be a special form of payment (it had to clear through an electronic government system and be a government-issued bond or voucher); and 3) I was not allowed to speak to any other person (friends, family, law enforcement) while this was being resolved because my case was not yet public record, because they didn't want me to lose my job -- and if I contacted the police, I would definitely lose my job. At this point, I hung up.

personalfinance,Investment Advice for a 16 yr old,"I have around $3000 in a bank account my grandmother set up for me. It is shared between her name and my name. She has done this for each of her grand children. Currently the money is in a 3&amp;#37; CD from Navy Federal (USA). I typically chose not to spend my money on things because I often find that I'd rather wait until Christmas or my birthday for things (and often find myself struggling to come up with ideas for my parents) I have $700-800 cash in my room for emergencies I guess, and if my mom or dad dont want to go to the bank to get money. I make money doing odd jobs around the house, I mow the lawn for my dad often and will do other things for money. I currently dont have a job because my schedule is so busy. My grandmother also set up a ""stock game"" with all of her grandchildren where she makes an imaginary portfolio and gives you $1000 to start. This money is purely fictional and is only used to initially buy the stocks. If you want to sell or buy a stock, you can call/email/text her for her to change it and she will do that (much like a financial adviser) if you choose, you can have her sell all of your stock, and then you can get the difference (value of portfolio - initial $1k). Currently my portfolio has grown 212.9&amp;#37;. I dont believed that she expected me to do so successfully, but the market is currently ding very well and I managed to buy Google before it split. I dont have to worry about college because my parents are in a good financial situation and I believe that they both contribute to a 529 for me and my siblings. My grandmother also contributes to this account. I also dont have any current living expenses as I am 16 and my parents pay for the food and house etc.

I know this is a unique situation and is quite unlike the other posts on this subreddit, but both of my parents have financial backgrounds and have instilled good financial sense in me and my siblings. My grandmother does not have a financial background but got lucky on the stock market a while ago, but she lives an extremely frugal lifestyle.

I'm currently finishing up my BS (have about 1.5 years left) through my university's online program. I also recently started a new full-time job in my field, making $14.50 an hour. I think this comes out to about $1800 monthly take home after throwing 10&amp;#37; pre tax income into 401k.

Sorry if this is the wrong place to post, long-time lurker and first time-asker on this subreddit.

I recently got into Grad school (yay!) to pursue an MBA, and my employer will pay for up to $10k a year, but only after grades are submitted (any classes where a D or lower is earned are not reimbursed).

Recently applied for financial aid, got the option for a 20k federally subsidized loan. It sounded fine to me, but then i saw the breakdown and it said something like 10k for Fall 2018 and 10k for Spring 2019. How does this work? If tuition is only 2100k a class, and I take 2 classes a semester, does the remaining available loan amount roll over to the next semester? Or does it go ""poof"" and I have to reapply again next school year?

In total I'm looking at tuition of about $31,500 for 3 years total. Do I have to take a new loan out every school year? Would it be better to get a loan through a bank? I'm so lost, it's a little sad and frustrating.

personalfinance,Paying off student loan debt vs. saving for retirement,"I know this is a very common questions for young people these days: do I pay off my student loan debt or save for retirement/invest in the stock market?

I am a recent college grad currently making about $60k a year, I have roughly $30k in debit between a $20k auto loan at 3.29&amp;#37; and $10k in student loan debt at 4.13&amp;#37;.  I currently have about $10k saved for retirement between my 401k and Roth IRA in addition to $20k in liquid savings split between my general savings account and my taxable brokerage account.

Up until now, my plan has been to pay off enough of my student loans every month so that I'll be fully paid off in 3 years and I'll still have another 2 years of car payments after that.  I'm currently saving \~18&amp;#37; of my monthly paycheck in my retirement accounts and I really don't have any money left over for other savings accounts after that once I've put money in retirement accounts due to normal and debt expenses.

Lately I've been thinking I should should pay off my entire student loan balance, because I could reasonably do so right now, but it would effectively take all of my liquid cash out of the stock market.  I feel it would lift a huge weight to get my student loans paid off in full right now, but I also feel like I would be shooting myself in the foot because a lot of my investment assets would need to be liquidated to pay for the student loans.  I've always heard that you should invest your money and slowly pay off your debts when you have relatively low interest rates on your debt because you can usually make a better return in the stock market, but I would love to pay off a lot of, if not all of my student loans.",finance

personalfinance,Should I pay off my car?,"First time posting, and I just wanna give a  huge thanks to everyone here. I first started browsing this sub a few years ago when I was flat broke, and through the tips and resources I've gathered from this community, I've managed to scrape together a meager nest egg with working class fingernails.

So I betrayed my minimalist principles and bought a brand used car last October for $9999+tax. If i could go back,  I would have bought a $5000 car instead, but here I am.  I put $3500 down, and financed the remaining $7400 at 5.84&amp;#37;. I currently owe $5900 on it, minimum monthly payment $140 (\~$25 in interest).

Just to get a picture of my finances: My paychecks net $2200 a month at my job and a couple side gigs bring an extra $600+. $1100 goes straight to rent/utilities. I currently have around $14,000 in savings and a couple grand tied up in a buy/sell hustle. No other debt besides the car note.

Sometimes I think about paying off the car asap, selling it, and buying a $5000 car like I should have done, but at this point I'm not sure its even worth the couple thousand dollars I'd save. I've also been thinking about paying off the remaining balance asap regardless just to save on interest, but then again my interest rate isn't \*outrageous\* and having that savings balance is comforting. The ""flow chart"" would have me aggressively paying that mid-level interest balance off, so does that mean i should pay the remaining $5900 RIGHT NOW just because i \*could\*?

Any advice is greatly appreciated - this car has been stressing me out since I bought it. I'm seriously considering going back to riding my bicycle everywhere......",finance

I am looking to put down 30% and have a credit score of 747 (I know this because I just applied for a loan through my credit union). However, I have a few questions.

1. Will the dealership attempt to match my credit unions interest rate? Should I even tell them i'm already approved through my union before we start the conversation?
2. If anyone here is familiar with financing. What do you think the dealerships interest rate would be for a credit score of 747 and an income of $2,669 (Before taxes) a month?
3. Am I able to included settlement money as income? I won a law suit and get paid monthly. Its only a little over $200 a month (For the next 105 Mos.) but it is disposable income.

Also, I recently graduated from college and moved back in with my parents and got a job. So at the moment I have absolutely no expenses. The only thing I currently pay for is my car insurance. Should I tell them any of this during the process?

Edit: $2,669 (Before taxes) Monthly income.

Edit2: I realize I may be sounding extremely spoiled with this post. Yes currently my parents do pay for everything. This is why I want to get a nice car for myself. I figured working one year to be able to pay for it and then going back to school wasnt that bad of an idea? However, I have gotten a lot of great advice here. Also, I got a low rate from my CU at 60 months. Obviously I was planning on paying it off way before then.

personalfinance,New Grad figuring out my new budget and loan payment plan.,"Hey everyone, over the past few months I've been poring over this subreddit for information about all the things I should be thinking about being a new graduate who just accepted his first offer and looking for an apartment around my job location (Providence, RI. Specifically around Downtown Providence towards Wayland for those familiar with the area)

Just to explain my current situations, pre-tax I'll be making $60,000 annually and have the following break-down of student loans:

Interest % / Principal

* 0.00	$8000
* 3.76	$7500
* 3.86	$5500
* 4.29	$7500
* 4.45	$4000
* 4.66	$6500

My VERY rough budget I've thought of (based on an apartment I'm looking at):

* Rent: $1250
* Utilities: $300~
* Phone Plan (Unlimited w/ Metro): $50
* Internet (100/100 Fios): $40
* Food: $260~
* Loan Payment: $1500 (Avalanche Style)

Pre-Tax Deductions:

* 401k Contribution: $300 (6% of salary needed to get 3.5% match)
* HSA Contribution: $100 (75 contribution from Employer)
* Dental + Vision: $22

Remaining (Using calculator for everything including the pre-tax deductions): $115~

I know this savings per month is a bit low and would make it pretty difficult to build up an emergency fund but I'm slightly banking on the fact I have a supportive family in case everything goes horribly wrong and I lose my job. I don't expect nor want to have to rely on that and would rather make necessary adjustments if people see fit.

I'm not very knowledgeable in investments and such in order to make the distinction between the value of avalanche paying off the loans below 4% in order to invest that money at a higher rate of return, however I do plan on opening up an Ally Savings Account for the leftover income to improve over my current run of the mill bad interest rate brick-and-mortar savings account.

personalfinance,"Rent, Buy, or live with Parents?","Hey guys, I have to figure out where to live next year and I really have no idea what to do... I can see the advantages and disadvantages of all the options so I'm kind of stalled at the moment.

Background: I'm 24 y/o, started a new job a few months ago and doubled my salary making 130k/yr while also working completely remote.  Yeah I don't believe it either.  I'm still $35k in student loan debt @6% or less but have paid off everything else I had with a crazy interest rate.

Option 1: I currently live in northern Virginia about 15 minutes from DC as this is where my previous job was.  I'm renting at $850/month plus another $100 in utilities in a 5 bedroom house.  My space is the entire basement which is about 600 sq ft so it's super nice/cheap for the area.  My original plan was to renew the lease, but each of my roommates that were planning to stay there with me to renew have been dropping out one by one.  If I want to renew I now have to find 3 new roommates and I've exhausted most personal/social connections trying to find people.  Had some bad experiences with randos on Craiglist so not sure if there's a better way to go about that.

Option 2: Live with my parents anywhere up to a year.  They live in a huge house with an empty area over the garage that pretty much has everything except it's own kitchen.  Obvious pros are not paying rent and spending more time with my little siblings and dogs.  Cons are that I have to deal with my parents, being drafted into their various house projects, and being judged for the amount I drink or smoke or whatever else they don't approve of.  Also it's an hour out into the boonies, not too much in the vicinity.  Although the amount of friends I even see regularly has been steadily decreasing as time goes on...

Option 3: buy a house or condo closer to the city in an area that might increase in price.  Live with independence, and rent money would go into equity.  But also taking on risk as property value stagnates or decreases, as well as anything that might be wrong with the property and associated expenses.

Option 4: rent somewhere in between where prices are lower, or rent somewhere in a new area entirely as I am completely remote.  Bit hesitant about the latter bc I don't really care where I live but I'm worried about loneliness and not sure if I want to leave the social connections I do have.  

Wildcard Option: my parents own a beach house in the Outer Banks that they're trying to sell but not really getting any bites.  Could say fuck it, go live on the beach, and either buy it from them or pay a portion of their mortgage since they're just paying it and only renting it out occasionally at the moment.  Could work something out there.  

So yeah, any advice on what you guys would do?  Indecision is just going to lead to opportunities going away but I have no clue what's the best way forward.  I keep weighing the options and they're all weighing out equally in multiple directions which I've never really faced before...",finance

I did financing through the dealership and later realized they gave me an interest rate 2% higher than what I qualify for. I knew my payment was due on the 5th but had not received any paperwork in the mail. I called the dealership and no one could find my loan. I found the lien holder info on my signed paperwork and called the bank directly. They told me they never financed the car because they were missing the paperwork. The bank called the dealership and now the dealership is scrambling to get more information from me. I’m not worried because I have the info needed and it wasn’t anything I neglected to give, it was stuff I was never asked for. Also, as far as everything I have, it showed I purchased the car and did get financing.

My question is, instead of giving the dealership that paperwork and then turning around and refinancing the car at the better interest rate, am I able to tell them I want to use my own bank and proceed from there or do I have to submit the info, have the loan taken out through the dealerships bank and then refinance? The info they don’t have that caused the loan to not be financed it pay check stubs which I do have. The finance guy seemed like a slime ball and when I told him he gave me a hirer interest rate then what my 761 credit score qualifies for he said, no, he gave me the best rate I will find anywhere.

personalfinance,$70k Student Loan/PSLF Question,"With my current employment, I qualify for the [Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service/questions).

Essentially, my loan will be forgiven after I make 120 qualifying monthly payments towards my student loan while working for a qualifying employer. 

My loan is around $70k right now with about a 5% interest rate. I chose an Income Based Repayment Plan and make the minimum payment each month. Based on my income, this payment is $55.13, which rarely even reaches the principal. I’m basically just paying interest. I started a new job recently with a significant pay bump, so I expect my minimum monthly payment to increase in January.

My question for you:

Should I continue making minimum payments for the next 10 years, assuming that the PSLF program will continue to exist and that I will continue working in public service? 

My worry is that the PSLF program will go away before my loan is forgiven and I’ll be stuck with a massive amount of debt because I’ve only been making the minimum payment. 

I have no other debt. I have $400 extra dollars a month that I am figuring out what I should do with. I can either add some or all of it to my savings account (I’m saving $400/month), or use it to pay down my student loan faster. 

I will continue contributing $400 a month to a pension plan and Roth account, both through my employer. I’m not interested in contributing more to my investment accounts; I was living paycheck to paycheck until a month ago so my top priority is building up my emergency savings account.

Thank you for any suggestions; please let me know if I can clarify anything.",finance
personalfinance,Is debt a good option here?,"Hey PF,
 I am starting school at A&amp;M as an in-state resident and I have received the Federal Pell Grant of 6k per year (payments are broken down into semesters) and I have divorced parents who will be splitting the cost.

My mother's side has started a fund for me when I was little and it is connected to the stock market. (40k+). My Dad will be taking out a loan of ~10k to help boost his credit score and pay for my college this semester. In the semesters to come, I hope he will be budgeting every month for the payment each semester.

Each semester is estimated to cost ~$13,000 and my parents are splitting it half and half every semester. (That's the plan). Is there anything wrong with this plan? Are we making a mistake? I want to be financially responsible in the future and I have already started budgeting my money for about 3 months with a local 9.5/hr job.

personalfinance,Question about student loan refinancing,"Hi all, I have been looking into student loan refinancing and wanted some advice.  My highest loans are $40000 at 6.8%.  I went through the preapproval (I.e. soft credit pull) yesterday with two companies (ElFi and Earnest) and was disappointed to see that my interest rate was much higher than what is advertised on their website (ElFi’s site starts as low as 3.09 for 5 yr fixed, I was quoted 4.97; Earnest quotes 3.4 for 5 yr fixed, I was quoted 4.02).  I have a high income (~158000), debt:income ~28%, pay off credit card every month (last statement balance was ~6000 which is 15% utilization, and my credit cards report to the bureau the day after the statement generates), and my most recent estimated FICO score through my Citi credit card is 752.  I’m trying to figure out why my rates were so much higher than the best rates quoted on the websites as I thought I was in a good financial position.  When I called the customer service, all they could tell me was that they can’t see my application and that I should go through the full application and hard pull and that my rates might be lower in the end.  I’m not going to do multiple loan applications with the hope of lowering my rates another 1-2%, as I was told before I did the preapproval that the rate based on the soft pull was fairly accurate.  Any thoughts on why my rates might be so much higher and what I can do to improve them?  I can always refinance now as even 4% is better than 6.8%, and then try again next year for a better rate.

The only negatives I can think of are that I had a short sale 6.5 years ago (never late, just had to sell the house due to a job change and the market had dropped below the loan balance) and earlier this year I had much higher credit card debt due to a house remodel but have now paid off that debt and improved my credit score (FICO score through my credit card dropped as low as 680 due to credit utilization ~75% but now is around 740-750).  My student loans were just transferred from Great Lakes to Nelnet, and I haven’t seen the effect on my credit but I’m wondering if they are going to appear as new lines of credit and cause a drop in my score due to lower average credit length.  Could any of these factors be what is affecting my rates?",finance
personalfinance,UPDATE: Using the house to pay off student loans?,"Original post:  [**https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7xqub3/using\_the\_house\_to\_pay\_off\_student\_loans/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7xqub3/using_the_house_to_pay_off_student_loans/)

Since folks were nice enough to offer their thoughts on our situation, I thought I'd offer an update. Real life surprises you, and while it's not the perfect situation, things worked out as well as we could have hoped.

A few things happened: first, I was admitted to a top 10 PhD program for my field starting in the Fall and needed to move cross-country to attend. When this first happened, we had to decide quickly whether to sell or rent the house and whether my husband would relocate with me. We looked at renting through a local property manager, but it didn't make sense. Even with their relatively low fees, we'd only be bringing in \~$150/month, and it wasn't enough of a difference to cut down the monthly student loan payments to a manageable number. Which brings me to the second happening - we discovered another of my husband's student loans that had come due for payment, bringing the balance to \~$85K and the monthly total for payments to \~$1200. The third happening was a housing market bubble in our area. A few houses sold nearby, driving the value of our home way up. 

So, given all this, we made the decision to sell. Our home sold for asking price of $220K the same day we put it on the market. We took away just over $70K after paying off the balance of the mortgage, realtor fees, etc.. We used \~$60K of it to pay off a large chunk of the student loans, focusing on those with the highest interest (between 9-13&amp;#37;). This brought our total monthly payments down to \~$300, and the remaining loans have interest rates in the 3-4&amp;#37; range. 

The remaining \~$10K from the sale went into an emergency fund. It's not huge, but it's a start, and way more than what we had before. 

We moved to a rental with a roommate, which significantly lowered our monthly expenses. Our previous mortgage was \~$1100, but now the monthly rent is \~$700. My husband will stay here in this property for a year while he finishes up a certificate program offered through his work. He won't be going back to school anytime soon, unfortunately. 

In the fall, I'll move across country to attend the PhD program, where I'll live with a roommate and monthly rent of \~$850. I'll also receive a stipend to attend this program which covers my tuition and living expenses, actually increasing my monthly income. Assuming my niche industry continues as is, I'll come out of this program in 3 to 5 years qualified for a job making close to 6 figures. Our current plan is for him to move up with me next summer and look for a similar position with his newly received certificate. We'll recombine households, hopefully further lowering our monthly expenses. 

Like I said, it's not a perfect situation, but we're pretty happy with how things turned out and are hopeful for a much more stable future. 

TL;DR: Sold the house during a market bubble, paid off lots of student loans, and starting PhD program. Lowered monthly expenses and hoping it lowers further next year.",finance
personalfinance,Better to max my TSP contributions for the year or save for a down payment?,"I'm 30 years old, zero debt, credit score 830, no wife, no kids, about to come off deployment next week. I'll have earned roughly $85,000 for that deployment, that's $50,000 after taxes and deductions. I'm carrying an apartment stateside which runs about $1250 per month, where my father and I live. When I'm not deployed (which is the case 18 months out of every 24), I earn $77,000 a year... I'm due for promotion next March, at which point I'll be bumped up to $91,600 a year, assuming no federal wage increase. My liquid assets amount to $47,500 in checking, $3,500 in cryptocurrency, perhaps $6,000 more in a TD Ameritrade account doing F-A as far as return on investment over the last few years.

It's been my plan to continue to save up for the remainder of the year, build my way up to between $70,000 and $90,000 for a down payment, and look to purchase sometime after next March when I've gotten my promotion and my income goes up. That way I figure I'll get the best possible terms on a mortgage. The other option is sinking $17,000 into my TSP plan and maxing my contributions for the year, plus making my maximum Roth IRA contributions. (I didn't work at all during my 20s, so I have nothing saved up towards my retirement, and I'm feeling the imperative to start.) But that would set me back on a down payment on a house. If I did that, it's likely I wouldn't be able to buy the kind of property I want until after I deploy again in 2020, which equates to a lot of lost equity. On the flip side, the stock market's priced at a premium right now, there's the likelihood of a recession in the next couple years in which case it might not hurt to wait on making those TSP contributions.

personalfinance,Recent Grad - 22 Year Old Student Loan Advice,"Hello r/personalfinance.  Just a heads up, I made an account just for this post and I also apologize in advance for formatting issues.  I was hoping I could get some advice to help me pay off my student loans fast and any other tips or tricks you all may have to help myself financially.

**Background Info**
I am 22 years old and a recent college graduate.  I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science.  I have a job in my field currently making $65,000 a year (salaried).  I currently live with my parents rent-free, I plan on moving out in a year or so but I am allowed to stay for as long as I need.  All of my debt is from student loans and a car.  

I recently bought a used (new to me) car.  I needed a reliable car to get me to and from work.  It is a 2017 sedan with 10,000 miles for $18,500 at 3.4% interest.  I currently owe $17,500.00 on the car.  

I have been contributing to a Roth IRA for a little over two years now.  My job matches 100% of my Roth contributions, up to $5,000 a year.  I currently have around $13,000.00 in my Roth IRA.  I have zero credit card debt.  I have and use credit cards but I pay them off when I use them.

**Student Loans**
Overall I currently owe $83,244.59.  This is between 2 Sallie Mae loans, 4 Un-subsidized Staffords, 4 Subsidized Staffords, and 2 Perkins loans.  They Currently break down as follows:

Loan | Initial Loan Amount | Interest Rate | Current Balance
---------|----------|----------|----------
Sallie Mae 1| $26,662.00| 10.13% | $29,944.29
Sallie Mae 2| $20,015.00|   9.63% | $23,994.30
Unsubsidized Staffords (4) | $8,000 | 3.76% - 4.66% | $8,606
Subsidized Staffords (4)| $19,000 | 3.76% - 4.66% | $19,000
Perkins (2) | $1,700 | 5.00% | $1,700

**Paycheck Breakdown &amp; Expenses**
As mentioned above, I make $65,000 a year (before taxes), $2,500 biweekly.  In the table below shows my monthly expenses I currently have.

Expense | Amount  
---------|----------
Roth IRA Contributions| $750.00 (%15 of paycheck or $350)
Car Payment | $284.00
Car Insurance | $248.00
Cell Phone Bill | $53.00
Gas Money | $60.00


This would leave me with the following:

Expense | Amount  
---------|----------
Student Loan Money | $1,600.00
Savings Deposit | $516.00
Spending Money | $230.00

My fear is I am not prioritizing my money correctly or that I may be missing some opportunities that could benefit me in the long run.  Yet again I want to apologize if the formatting is off.  I am open to any suggestions or advice you guys have!",finance
CryptoCurrency,Distributed Credit Chain - loans,"Lending is a habitual phenomenon of private life and an indispensable element of almost any business. The credit line helps to reduce the negative consequences of cash gaps and allows you to get out of unforeseen financial situations with minimal stress. Banking credit systems have a number of significant shortcomings, which the Blochein technology can eliminate. This issue is professionally handled by the Distributed Credit Chain (DCC) team. Today, our review of the ICO of this useful project.

Banking credit systems have drawbacks:

high interest rates. This, first of all, is connected with the phenomenon of the monopoly of the Central Bank. In this case, the price is dictated not by the market, as it should be, but by banking systems. And those who need credit, are forced to go to these conditions for lack of alternatives;

low technical equipment. A third of modern banks do not have a mobile application. And 20&amp;#37; do not have the technical ability to accept payments online. In order to receive and repay loans in such banks, it is necessary to conduct all operations through the cashier, physically being present;

low quality data validation. This problem entails losses associated with non-repayment of loans. For example, a personal income tax certificate is checked by calling the number of the phone that the lender left. At the other end of the wire can be any person at the same time;

lack of transparency of operations. Banks often go to tricks in order to mislead creditors. For example, the important points are added to the contract in small print. After the loan is issued, the creditor is faced with circumstances that are not in favor of the creditor, which he did not know about.

Distributed Credit Chain Solutions

Distributed Credit Chain (DCC) is a credit platform on Block, which allows you to make a loan with minimal time and financial costs anywhere in the world.

The purpose of the DCC is to destroy the banking monopoly for issuing loans. With Blockchain technology at the head, DCC will provide not expensive, convenient, fast and transparent credit services.

Hes got a 715 credit score that just wont budge. The past 5 years are impeccable and the capital one says its against their policy to remove charge offs. The credit bureaus also say there is nothing they can do that he needs to work with the issuing company which is capital one.

personalfinance,Need to refinance student loan &amp; get a car loan around the same time - will there be issues?,"I haven't found any similar tips or situations in the search- apologies if this is not the right sub. 


I graduated from college a few years ago and have federal student loans in my own name (28k). I have a car that I need in order to get to work, but it is declining rapidly and I would rather put money towards a down payment for a newer one rather than repairs at this point. 


My mother also took out parent plus loans for my college, and has been paying them for years. However, even with downsizing her house, she is unable to continue paying these loans as she is also driving a car that is breaking down and will need a car loan as well. She also has loans for my sibling + her mortgage. She is worried she will be denied the car loan, and frankly just needs relief from paying all the loans back.


I am looking into refinancing the parent plus loans into my name so that I can take over the payments and she will hopefully be approved for a car loan. I plan to keep the parent loan refinance separate from my own federal loans, because I work in a federal non-profit and whatever is left from my federal loans could be forgiven in 7 more years with the loan forgiveness program.  


**I am worried that by taking over the loans, I will not be approved for a car loan that I will need in a few months' time. I have excellent credit currently but not sure how that will change after refinancing.**


* Will the newly refinanced student loans (17k) be an issue when getting a car loan (about 12k)? 
* How long should I ideally wait between the two loans? Does it matter?
* Assuming my credit will drop after the first loan, would it be better to apply for the refinance or the car loan first, in terms of interest rate changes? 
* Would it be better for my credit to refinance all of my student loans together, but lose out on the opportunity of government forgiveness on whatever is left on mine in 7 years?

financialindependence,One Year After FIRE,"I retired a year ago after becoming financially independent. The retirement was due mostly to inheritance from my father, but also from my own frugality and saving over 50% of my salary. I'm not quite lean FIRE, but I'm not living large either.

Financially things have been fine. Last year the market was very nice, and my retirement accounts are up 6.2% despite having paid all of my bills for the entire year. I have a 70/30 stock/bond ratio with a variety of index funds (including broad indexes and international indexes) and a variety of bond funds. 5% out of the 70% is invested in a precious metals fund. There's also a generous emergency fund and 2 year CD chain. That's my main retirement account. My IRA and 401K are not alligned with that, but I'm putting off rebalancing those until next year. I rebalance the main account every three months.

I started out with a 3% withdrawl rate last year. But in a year of dealing with my own issues, I have become rather disturbed with the amount of self-hate I have. I began to see that my frugality is partly a way to punish myself, and I wanted to try to be nice to myself. With my 2018 budget I bumped it up to a 3.5% withdrawl rate. I find I have trouble spending the money. My frugality is also partly a realization that things will not make me happy (except maybe my motorcycle). But I am saving the ""fun"" money that I don't spend, and few times I've gone over budget on fun and had to pull from the savings. And maybe I'll travel more than I expected.

When I shifted up from 3% to 3.5% the question came to mind, ""When am I going to shift down?"" Now, the 3% and 3.5% are based on my initial balance at the start of retirement. If you look at my withdrawls compared to my current balance, the rate is 3.29%. The plan I came up with is that if my withdrawl rate based on my current balance ever gets up to 4%, I will adjust my budget based on my evaluation of my situation at that time. Maybe it's something that looks to be short term, and I can just soldier on through. Or maybe it's something that looks like a long term recession, and I will scale back my spending. There was a thought experiment on r/preppers about what you would do if you lost your job for six months. I wasn't worried because I have a six month emergency fund, but it made me think about how I could cut my budget. I think worst case I could get it down to 1.5%. It wouldn't be fun, but I could do it.

I had one big expense that was not planned for. The water heaters in my condo building have reached the end of their expected working life, and several have failed. Not wanting to pay for flooding my downstairs neighbor's unit, I replaced the water heater for $3,600. Previous repairs had only been a couple hundred a year, so I hadn't planned on this. Some of it came out of my emergency fund (which I paid back in a month of diverting other savings), and some of it came from my ""insurance"" savings. I figure that extended warranties are a scam if you can afford the repair or replacement. But I always ask how much they are. Then I put that much into a savings account, along with a small monthly amount equivalent to renter's insurance. It looks like I may have another one coming. I know an estate lawyer, and said he'd help me put together a will. But he's been dragging his feet about it all year, so I think I'm just going to pay someone to do it. I don't know what that will run, but I may just sell some extra stock to pay for it rather than fudging budget categories.

I think I'm still trying to figure out retirement. I have a tendency to push myself to be productive, but I push myself too hard and stress myself out. Nothing that I expect is unique, but there it is. So I'm not one of these people who has no idea what to do with themselves in retirement. I'm one of those people who has too many ideas about what to do with themselves in retirement. I'm trying to find a balance between working on the projects I am interested in and just taking it easy. That balance is elusive.

The projects I am working on include a large programming project that I've been fiddling with on and off for years. I've managed about 11,600 lines of code in the past year on that. When I first posted that I had FIREd, I mention an interest in charity work. Soon after that I went to a Quaker gathering that had a panel discussion on the school to prison pipeline. I did some more reading and became totally dumbfounded at how messed up and racist our criminal justice system is in the U.S. I am now volunteering with a charitable organization lobbying for criminal justice reform at the state level (the federal level is dead due to the insane power a few people have in our so-called democracy). I am also working more on my Zen practice. I finally found a local teacher in my tradition, and I am at the Zendo at least twice a week, some of it working towards a Jukai ceremony at the end of the year. Finally, I am working on exercising more. After having to watch my father's decline in his old age I am trying to be healthier so I can enjoy my retirement long term.

In terms of chilling out, I was sick for a month. I had a massive allergy attack, followed by a screw up with my long term medication, followed by another massive allergy attack. During the second attack there were four days where I got no more than an hour of sleep at a time because I was coughing so bad. It certainly was not fun being sick, but it was really nice to just be able to take a month and deal with it, and not worry about my job or much of anything else. I just did the bare minimum I needed to do, and if I had any energy left over I did want I wanted to do, and spent the rest of the time trying to take it easy so I could heal.

The biggest thing I've noticed in retirement was my [suicidal tendencies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoF_a0-7xVQ). I have had long term depression since I was a little kid and tried to kill myself at age 10. When I was working at my old job, I was having suicidal ideation every week or two, and serious planning every three months or so. At one point I was eating so little I collapsed after walking up a couple flights of stairs. Due to my history with depression (I actually passed out from not eating once in high school, too) I just convinced myself it was normal for me. A month after I quit my job I was like, ""OMG, I haven't thought of killing myself once since I left work!"" My depression is still there, but it's been like crawling out of a sewer pipe into a cool rain on a warm summer's day. And not being distracted by work has given me more time to be with my depression, to understand it better, and to deal with it more effectively.

So here I am and there I go, and I look forward to finding out where I will turn up next.

Edit: I'm don't need therapy. I'm doing fine without it, in fact I'm doing better since I stopped therapy and started doing Zen. Don't worry about it.",finance
personalfinance,"Car crapped out and our wedding is in 4 weeks, need advice","I need to preface by saying that I am currently making $35k/year. I'm currently paying off student loans so my disposable income is limited. My fiancee and I are currently paying off the last of our wedding expenses which is less than 4 weeks away.


I have a 2011 Chevy Cruze (purchased 2 years ago, 80,000 miles) that started having transmission problems. I took it to the shop to have it looked at. Apparently, i'm looking at a full transmission rebuild totaling $4,000. I've gotten second opinions but it's clear the trans is just done. 


I just refinanced my auto loan to a much lower interest rate. I am still paying $180/month for this thing. I still owe $8,300 on the loan with a ~3% interest rate. The current value of the car AFTER the trans is fixed is only $4,500. So i'm completely upside-down here.


My fear is that I'm going to pay to have the trans fixed, and it's gonna happen again down the line (I have come to find out that 2011 Cruzes are notorious for transmission issues). 

**Current Options:**

*Pay to have it fixed. Risk the car dying on me in the future. But at least limit the amount of money spent at the present time.

*Look at trade in options. The car as it stands is only worth about the cost to fix the transmission. Unfortunately this would mean rolling my current loan into a new loan (or lease). 

*Not fix the trans. Drive my fiancees car and she purchases a new car until I can sort this out. This is the least desirable option as we don't want to take on more debt right now.

My fiancee has money saved that we could use, although i'm trying to avoid that option if possible.

My head is foggy and I really am more pissed that this is happening right now, so I could use an outside perspective of what my options are.

**Tl;dr:** Completely upside down in loan for broken down car. Money is tight with upcoming wedding. Looking for the least painful option to get this sorted out.",finance

personalfinance,Should I sell my main source of income for $660k?,"I have a kind of unique financial opportunity and I’d love some outside thoughts.

I’m a single 30 year old male from Texas, and I’ve been offered the opportunity to sell a catalogue of intellectual property that I made in exchange for $660,000. The problem is I’d essentially be selling my main source of income. 

Financial Situation

\-The catalogue generates me about 11k a month in income.

\-I make about $3000 a month that I make from other work (not for sale).

\-I own a $300k condo outright

\-I have a house that I bought for $479k. I owe about 376k. My interest rate is 3.875 on a 30 yr note.

\-I have 7 renters between both properties and after HOA and mortgage on my house I pocket about $1000 a month.

\-I have about $467k in the market/index funds.

\-I have a Sep IRA that has $7500

\-I owe $12,500 on my car. 1.9 Interest rate

\-Checking Accounts have 13k in them 

\-No other debt

It seems like the buyer is basing their offer on what the catalogue should generate over the course of the next 5 years. If I were to sell I’d be allowed to build another catalogue that I think could potentially do well.

I’m just trying to weigh my options. Do I take a lump sum now and invest it? Or do I hold out and see if I can make more money in the long run by holding it? Thats the hardest question because tomorrow my catalogue could blow up and make 2x what its making now or alternatively it could take a nosedive and make less. However, it has earned consistently for the past 2.5 years.

I think my immediate game-plan if I sold would be to buy one more house with cash, rent it out, and start working on a whole new catalogue.

My last note is regarding the taxes if I sold. My tax person is trying to find out what the tax burden would be. I believe if its taxed as personal income it would be roughly 40&amp;#37; but if he can sell it as an asset its 20&amp;#37;? This is the one point that needs clarification and I should know more next week. If it is taxed as personal income I’ll more likely than not pass on the deal.

personalfinance,"18, soon to be college student, what should I do with my savings?","Hello, I'm 18 years old and I will be starting college this fall at University of Wisconsin-Madison. I currently have $5,500 in savings and $1,000 in my checking account and I am looking for advise on what to do with my money. I make ~$800 per month in the summer but only ~$200 during the school year. My parents are paying for my first two years of college then after that, it's up to me. So, I will probably have to take out student loans for my last 2 years, probably around $30,000. I don't have a car and most likely won't until I graduate college since driving is terrible where I go to school and parking costs way too much. I also have thoughts of opening a Roth IRA soon, but I don't know if it would be more beneficial to use my money for a car in the future or to use it to start making payments right away when I have student loans, or do all of the above.

Here are some important facts!!:

-THERE ARE NO SHELTERS OR PROGRAMS HERE IN VENICE, I ALREADY TRIED.
-NOBODY WILL HIRE ME OFF OF THE STREET. DONT TELL ME TO GET A JOB.
-I have no car or cell phone. I can't make calls or drive around the city or sleep in my car.
-They won't give me a credit card or loan, MY BANK ACCOUNT IS -500. There is no place to go for food stamps or EBT.

Nobody really loves or cares for me. Nobody helps me and people are very rude and don't try to understand me. Everyone punishes me for not having a family.

I am getting sick. Tonight I'll have to beg for food and sleep on the freezing beach unless someone helps me. I have walked all over and asked around and keep getting fed bullshit lies like there is a shelter here that will bathe and feed and clothe me.

personalfinance,Just got a sizeable raise at work and I need help creating a budget to strategically pay down debts and create a growing savings account.,"I (23M) recently received a ""promotion"" at work in the form of a commission percentage increase that created a sizable jump in income. I've had trouble the last few years with my CC balances due to living off them (I know, bad me! I was working part-time while in school and used them for food and necessities). I have one roommate who I sublease from and no dependents other than my pets. Last year using an unsecured signature loan, I ""paid off"" a used car note that had a stupidly high interest rate (19%) and consolidated some credit card debt. My main forms of debt are credit card balances, student loans and one signature loan. I have not yet taken steps towards planning for retirement yet.

Income and credit background: $700 check weekly with about $300 cash tips each month for about $3,000 take home each month. Credit score ~550 due to deliquencies that is still recovering.


**Expenses:**

*Rent &amp; Utilities - $450/month (rent, electric, gas, internet)

*Food Budget - $300 (I typically spend ~$50 every week at the grocery store and ~$100/month eating out)

*Pet expenses - $200/month (1 dog, 1 cat, 4 snakes)

*Prescriptions - $200/month

*Car Insurance - $125/month (minimum liability, 2 at-faults on record, &lt;25 male)

*Gas and Vehicle Maitenence - $150/month (2005 honda civic, good condition)

*Health Insurance - $115/month ($20 PC visit copay)

*Phone Bill - $50/month


*Total Monthly Expenses - $1,590*

**Debts:**

*Subsidized Federal Student Loan Balance - ~$10,000 ($100/month current payment)

*Unsecured Signature Loan Balance - ~$7,000 ($215/month payment, ~15% interest)

*CC #1 Balance: ~$7,500/$8,200 limit (22% interest, $245 currently monthly min)

*CC #2 Balance: ~$4,200/$4,500 limit (0% interest until 11/18, 24% interest afterwards, $75 currently monthly min)

*Total Debt: $29,000, $635 current monthly payments*

personalfinance,to lease or to finance!?,"hey guys just running some numbers here as myself and my wife are on the market for a family vehicle.

monthly payments- $453

months- 72

what are your guys thoughts on the options? do those look like good numbers to you guys. insurance is cheaper with the lease.

the monthly payments for both options are doable for us, just wanting to see what you guys think.

deeplearning,[Question] Network structure/type best geared towards classifying non-language sounds?,"So I'm trying to design a deep neural network tasked with classifying or characterizing sounds (16 bit signed wav files @ 44100 KHz sampling rate). The audio clips will be between 0.2 and 20 seconds in length. 

I initially thought about converting the sounds into spectrograms and then feed those into a standard CNN, but I would instead like to be able to recover the sound data back from whatever form it takes as its fed into the network. Unfortunately spectrograms are often subsampled and merely carry absolute amplitude, thus lack any phase information.

To get around this, I'm going to convert the wav files into something more akin to what an actual brain deals with. Using a fast Fourier transform, I will construct a 150 x 150 pixel single channel ""image"" of floating point data for each sample of the wav file, with the data normalized to the maximum signed potential value of the 16 bit samples. This will provide me a 22.5 KHz frequency range (150^2 ). At a 44.1 KHz (Nyquist freq. for human hearing) sampling rate, that's 44100 images per second of audio, and thus a lot of data. Roughly 3.7 gigabytes per second, or half that if I use half precision data. But it's similar to how a cochlea converts sound into something useful.

One option to reduce the data throughout is to reduce the frequency range or granularity (shrink the image) and sampling rate, and then train a second network to upsample the result and interpolate the missing frequencies.

The trouble is finding a network structure that is able to deal with this much data in a temporally cohesive way. A traditional CNN will fail, as will most RNNs. But does anyone have any ideas about how to go about this?

The hope here is to be able to take the trained latent space and reverse the process, whereby I can have the network *generate* a sequence of images representative of an input classification or characterization, and then convert that sequence of ""images"" back into it's wav file representation. 

I've looked into Wavenet, but it doesn't perform exactly what I'm after.

Any insights would be welcome! Thanks!",technology
personalfinance,Input regarding Parent Plus student loans vs Personal student loans,"So just a quick background, I'm a recent graduate and secured a 45k year a job and have student loans totaling about 60k. Up until this week I was under the impression that I only had 30k in student loans, and my father just informed me that I would be taking up payment on his Parent Plus loan he originally took out - which is completely fine by me.

However i was curious if you guys had any input regarding whether or not it would be more beneficial for me to just focus on my own personal loans under my name first (while making minimum payments on the parent plus loan), though they have varying interest rates, even though the Parent plus loan is the largest loan with the highest interest.

1- 11433.52 @ 6.8&amp;#37;

2- 5500 @ 6.8&amp;#37;

3- 3500 @ 3.76&amp;#37;

4- 6361 @ 3.76&amp;#37;

5- 5000 @ 4.45&amp;#37;

6- Parent plus loan 36k @ 7.9

My original strategy if not for the parent plus loan was to use the snowball method and rid myself of the lower balances, but I feel now I have to re arrange my thinking on this. I've lurked this sub for a while and found a lot of great advice and insight but anything into my particular information would be great. My expenses are rather minimal; a car payment, insurance, 401k and i'll be living at home for the time being. I considered consolidating all of them together but found it would probably be best to keep them separate, however i'm definitely open to more educated suggestions on a particular path.

investing,Alaska Airlines Long Thesis,"So I've seen a few post lately mentioning airlines around here and the other stock reddits and thought id share my brief pitch of going long on ALK from my reddit. Hopefully itll give yall something to consider. 

 Alaska Air Group Inc

**Alaska Air Lines**

NYSE:ALK

MktCp: 7.8B

**Core Business:** Alaska Air Group owns and operates Alaska Airlines, Virgin America, Horizon, McGee Air Services and some other smaller units. However I will focus on Alaska Airlines with consideration to the Virgin America acquisition since those are the biggest sources of revenue for the company. Most of their business comes from flights that transport customers to and from West coast destinations. However a significant percentage of their customers are connecting flights from West to Midwest/Atlantic

**Valuation:** Air Lines can be very tricky to put a price on. The business is very competitive and heavy on capital expenditures. Profit margins are consistently being brought down due to price matching other airlines. They naturally trade at low PE ratios. And historically have been value traps for investors. Therefore I proceed even more conservative than usual when constructing a DCF for this company. I assume that its free cash flow will grow 4&amp;#37; on average for 5 years then reach terminal growth at 3 percent. This means some years it may lose fcf and others gain more than 4&amp;#37; but I assume it will average out to 4&amp;#37; yearly for the next five years. Using this I calculated a fair value of **$118 per share.** If my valuation is correct, ALK is very significantly undervalued.

**Competitive Advantage:** The commercial air line industry is all centered around offering the cheapest flights for customers and having small margins. Competitive advantages are usually either A) Niche Location or B) Brand Strength. I believe ALK has a strong case for both of these. The have a very significant presence in the West Coast having main flights going to Seattle to LA to Hawaii, even Costa Rica. The acquisition of Virgin America(although bad in the short term, more about it in risk section) will give them a greater share of the market in the region over the long term. Alaska Airlines has some of the best customer service and attention. They have had the highest customer satisfaction rate among airlines for 11 years straight(JD Power) and notable recent awards include best rewards program(Flyer talk 18), number 1 US Airline(Money 18),number 1 in Airline Quality Rating 2018, and ICCT Most fuel efficient Airline (2010-2017). I know some of these awards can be consider biased and some will say politics are involved but if you look at direct customer reviews of ALK and compare them to other regional airlines, its easy to tell that they have great customer satisfaction and its a priority to their business. To conclude I see ALK being a major player in a major market with an Amazon like focus on customer satisfactions.

**Risks:** Believe it or not, competition is not the biggest risk to Alaska Airlines. Oil prices and a recession are the biggest risks to Alaska Airlines as well as the airline industry. Oil prices make the biggest difference in profits for airlines companies. If oil continues to rise, airlines will have to raise ticket prices across the board. Higher tickets may impact the amount of customers willing to travel. If this happens and prices continue to rise, ALK's revenue,profits and FCF will take a hit. We have been in a bull run for 9 years(I argue less but won't talk about here) and its obvious we will hit a bear market eventually. Airlines are quite cyclical and a small recession will impact consumers spending. Much like oil prices, this will affect the revenue, profits and fcf for the company. They are also quite leveraged and higher interest rates could negatively effect their net income. A smaller risk is that the acquisition of Virgin America does not provide synergy causing investors to back out and lenders to be unwilling to give more money to ALK. The past 2 years have been rough. Alaska airline uses boeings while Virgin used Airbus which cause some operational issues. Management between the two took longer to become productive and internal politics became a bigger problem to solve than expected. This is clearly shown in the stocks lackluster performance over the past 2 years since the acquisition. While there maybe some rough road still ahead I believe management is becoming productive and the synergies will start to translate into earnings very soon.

**Dividend:** ALK currently pays a dividend of roughly 2&amp;#37;. It is expected to hit 2.09&amp;#37; next year. However I do not think it will grow significantly until after the synergies from the acquisition are realized.

**Future Trends**: Customer Service is more and more important as Americans have more money to spend. Considering the extremely low unemployment rates and the growth in spending power, It is reasonable to assume that Americans will choose to spend a little more to feel better. In this case it means paying a little extra for going from California to Seatle on ALK vs a budget ticket. IMO I think most customers will pay more for the satisfaction. As word of mouth continues to spread, more people will choose ALK over other West Coast airlines due to their strong brand and perks(free drinks!) The virgin acquisition strengthens their airport presence and with more hubs and more volume they should be able to lower prices while keeping their margins.

**Expectations:** Alaska Air Group stock is likely to continue its less than stellar growth this year. I personally have a price target of $70 by the end of 2018. Considering the summer months are the biggest for airlines, It has a possibility to get higher than $70 if they report significantly better than expected earnings for q2 q3. However we will have to wait until late this year, likely next year, for the earnings to stabilize and realize the synergies of Virgin acquisition. I have a price target of $100 by the end of 2019. And unless we have a bear market or considerably higher oil , I am confident in those targets. Although at they end of the day keep in mind they are just educated guesses and not accurate.

**Conclusion:** Alaska Air Group is a regional airline that has great brand strength as well as strong presence in their region. The stock has been lackluster due to some unexpected complications that arose when the acquisition of Virgin America took place. However I believe the complications have been solved and the power of the merger will start showing in the earnings soon. Due to the discount of intrinsic value to market price, as well as a decent 2&amp;#37; dividend,ALK is a great 3-6 year hold with potential to double.

*Notes- Feel free to agree disagree , or even tear my analysis apart in the comments. Just keep it constructive and explain why. This is not a buy recommendation , rather its my opinion on the company.*

Bitcoin,How would finance work in a hyperbitcoinized world?,"How could anybody borrow any bitcoin on a long term loan, say for a house or a business? The X number of bitcoins you borrow today, when taken on a long term loan, would become extremely expensive after a while. For a salaried home owner, getting paid in bitcoin, it means he will be paid with less and less bitcoin, since its value keeps appreciating. In the business loan case, your goods or services will be sold for less and less bitcoin as bitcoin value increases. So how could a long term loan in bitcoin ever be successfully paid off?   


Further, as bitcoin is deflationary, hoarding (hodling) it already works well in safeguarding my future needs, so why would I want to risk loaning it? Unless the interest is significant. Which probably means that, in a hyperbitcoinized world, interest rates would be extremely high? Any comments, learned redditors?",cryptocurrency

They           still have not returned my funds. I remind you I sent all the       photos     they needed 9 days ago. They say that they are  conducting  an         investigation. They themselves say that they do  not know how   long   it      will take. In other words, they say:  
""We took your funds, and we will not return it to you until we want.""

But what kind of investigation can be conducted by these anonyms for more than 9 days? **Blockchain           shows that I own funds for 5 years. The presence of many coins    on    my     wallets indicates that private keys were not stolen.**       What   else  can  they investigate? There is no doubt that they  are    just   trying   to  find a  way to leave this funds to  themselves.  I'm   sure   they just   wait  until we  all shut up and  everyone will  forget   about   it.

They           still have not returned my funds. I remind you I sent all the       photos     they needed 12 days ago. They say that they are  conducting   an        investigation... in the time when **blockchain          shows that I own funds  for 5 years. The presence of many coins    on    my    wallets indicates that  private keys were not stolen.**

I told them that I found absolutely all the information about them: names, phones, office address. **And suddenly they decided to take the investigation to an end and arrange a video call with me.** I would have agreed to this 2 weeks ago. But now it's too late. Now we will play by my rules.

# GRAND UPDATE OF THE POST WITH INFO ABOUT SCAMMERS  2018-07-22

More than two weeks ago I opened ChangeNOW.io and tried to exchange 100 BCH for 11 bitcoins.  
Why           did I come to this site with such a huge amount? I confused   them      with    Changelly, which I once worked with. And this was only   part   of    the   total  amount of exchange.  
After I sent BCH, the    exchange  was      suspended and  I was asked for a image of the    passport and an       explanation of the  origin of the funds. I wrote    my indignation to  them.      But when a man with  a Russian name  Sergey   answered me, I  tensed.  If     this is a service from  Russia,  then   why should it  establish the      identity of a person with such  a    large volume of  coins? What  purpose do     they have in the time  when   the  transaction  itself could  not cause   any   suspicion  (other than   volume)?  This is  not for them  to be   formally    protected from   regulators, since in   Russia it is not    regulated by    anyone and   they work illegally. I  decided  that it was    just a  formality.   I   took an image with  someone's passport  from     google-images and sent     them. And also I  explained the origin of the      funds, although  there  is   nothing to  explain, everything is  already     visible:  
.

**1. There is only one incoming transaction(a few months ago) and one outgoing transaction(to ChangeNow.io) on the wallet.**  
**2.           The origin of funds on this wallet is my another wallet. This       wallet     was created 5 years ago(before bitcoin hardfork) and it       replenished   only   once(5 years ago).**  
**3. The presence of many coins on my wallets indicates that private keys were not stolen.**  
.

But           after that they asked to send selfie with a passport. There  was    no     way   out and I had to make a real selfie with a real   passport.  
They         accused me that I deceived them and now they   will conduct an         investigation. That was 2 weeks ago. All the   days during these weeks         they said that they are investigating   this situation and can not   say       about the completion time  
[https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4619534.msg42029915#msg42029915](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4619534.msg42029915#msg42029915)  
[https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4619534.msg42090568#msg42090568](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4619534.msg42090568#msg42090568)  
The same thing was said to me when communicating by mail **within 2 weeks**.           Do you understand cynicism? Absolutely anonymous people,   without  a        company, addresses, telephone, working illegally,   appropriated  my     funds    and in fact declare that they will return   it only when  they     themselves    want it.  
.

They    said  it    until   2018-07-20. This is explained by the  fact that  on    Thursday I    told them   that I found all the information about    them:   their  names,   phone   numbers, office address. I said that  the     information  about them   will be   published and then forwarded  to  the    competent  bodies of St.     Petersburg, as they, having   organized de   facto   anonymous exchange     service of anonymous   currencies (only I   probably  did  not have the  luck    with my   volume) brazenly violates   the laws of  the  Russian  Federation.      After that they immediately   wanted to  communicate  with  me on video      communication. And now they   are  blackmailing: ""that's   when you   call  us,   then we will decide   about  your funds.""  
.

But       I do    not like  this approach. Persons who conduct completely   illegal         entrepreneurial activities in Russia, trying to steal   funds from   those       who feed them, have no right to demand anything   to me. I will    not    please   them. I do not worry about my funds,   I'll return it in  any      case, it's   just that I will not leave   anything from their    ""business""    and from  their  personal   reputation.  
.

Please        understand   me correctly. I do not  gloat simply because they work         illegally  in Russia. It's just a  convenient hook. But I would   never       used  it if they did not try to steal  my funds.  
You,   having  at  least      six months from registering on the  forum, think:   what 2  weeks       investigation can be carried out by a group  of people    doing their       business illegally **in    the time when   the      blockchain shows that I own the funds for 5    years, and the   presence    of   many coins on my wallets says that    private keys were   not stolen**.      What investigation? It's    clear even for a   fool, that this is a lie    and   an attempt to  delay   the time to the   maximum in the hope that the     person  will  fall   behind and the  topic  will be forgotten.  
.

I         repeat, I   have absolutely nothing against services that work  in   the      shadow of  the  state. Not all states have perfect  legislation.    But  if    you work   illegally and yet have no honor,  trying to    brazenly  steal,    then do  not  think that you will get  away with it.

As           it is characteristic of all cowardly scammers, only after    sensing     the    danger, they immediately began to sweep the tracks.    But since  I    have    been on the Internet for a long time and I met a    lot of  such    scammers,  I   knew this and made screenshots before    notifying  them    about the   imminent  publication of these  materials:

**Sergey Sokratilin**:  
And          let's move on to one more person.  Obviously, this is the  second        person  in the organization and it is he  who answers by  email on     behalf    of  Sergey.

Roman Lapin and Sergey Sokratilin are mutual friends in social networks.

**I think no one will doubt that these people, being in Russia, run the illegal for Russia crypto-exchanger ChangeNOW.io.**  
.

You           ask me what I plan to do with all of this. I do not know yet.   Of         course, I'm considering only legitimate ways of fighting.   Also, I     would     not like to participate in some courts in person,   but this     option is    not  excluded. In the end, they may come to   their  senses    and return  what    they do not own.

Bitcoin,US Bond Yield continues to decrease but USD value is increasing?!?!,"Hey guys, I am sorry if this comes off as sort of like a conspiracy, but I have an EXTREMELY DIFFICULT time understanding what on earth is going on in the traditional markets.

If we look at the USD, we all know that its value has seen a slight rally recently - due mainly to the fact that the Fed is saying they are doing quantitative tightening. What I expected was that US Bond Yields will begin to increase, however what I see is the complete opposite. This defies all financial understanding that I have. The only explanation that I can think of is that the Fed is lying - in which case the market buys the USD in anticipation for US Bond Yield to increase, so the USD had the recent rally. However turns out that the Fed is NOT doing quantitative tightening and in fact extending quantitative easing - in which case the USD will reverse and plummet in price again, US Bond Yield stays down and the stock markets go up.

Or US Bond Yield will increase in a few weeks? Anyway if the US Bond Yield does not increase, then they are clearly lying to us.

What this means is that the US Dollar will enter hyper-inflation very fast and there will likely be a reset - where we really see Gold/Silver/Bitcoin/Properties/Commodities play a huge part in the financial system and the US Dollar will become irrelevant.

Soon I will be closing on the sale of my home, after replenishing my emergency fund which I spent on required house repairs I will have right around $20,000 to clear some of my debt. 


Just want to make sure I do the right thing here. I like the idea of paying 3 accounts off as shown in option 2. But then I think about the interest rates and in the long term I will be saving so much money by going with option 1 and just eliminating that personal loan which has a per diem of around $7 right now. 


Option 1 (and I think based on interest this is the best thing to do)

Pay off the Personal Loan

Free up $475.00 per month which I can then use to attack the smaller CC or the smaller vehicle loan.


Option 2

Pay off the vehicle loans $16,475

Pay off the 2nd CC $2500

Pay remaining $1025 to the Personal Loan



This frees up $517 per month that can then let me attack that high interest loan.

A. Keep it in a savings with as much as possible in short term cds?

Additionally, if we needed to make small improvements to our current home while renting it out couldn’t these be used as a tax write off? For example, the grass in the backyard is dying, there are small holes in the carpet in some places, etc. In your opinion, would it be better to sell now, rent an apt for a few months, and move in with 20% down?

Bitcoin,Why bitcoin will act as a safe haven during the next financial crisis.,"This topic has been debated a lot lately. ""If stocks crash what will bitcoin do?"".

The amount of leverage in the banking system is at record highs, with banks seemingly over-exposed to the most over-valued and fragile markets in their own regions.

The next recession/equity crash will not leave banks unaffected. 

Over the last decade QE and historically low interest rates have fuelled bubbles in all assets. Everything in G20 countries looks over-valued.

What is the silent nightmare scenario? Stagflation. A period of rising inflation while simultaneously being in a recession.

This is important because no central bank wants to fight a recession where they have to lower interest rates while simultaneously fighting rising inflation where they need to raise interest rates. Afterall, how can you raise rates and lower rates at the same time.

They know 2008 is going to happen again, and banks are going to fail again, but next time because of the last decade of extreme ""easy money"" inflation will rage unabated. So how can they keep a lid on inflation at the same time a financial crisis hits? Instead of printing money to bail-out banks, fueling inflation, they will allow banks to bail-in customer deposits, this takes money directly out of the hands of average citizens and the less money they have to spend the less inflation will rise. 

Over the last few years the EU, UK, US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand have ALL legislated bail-in law making it completely legal for failing banks to confiscate customer deposits to remain liquid and protect their balance sheets.

Seems perfect, save the banks and put a brake on inflation at the same time. This way rates can be lowered again in the next crisis without worrying about inflation.

The problem with this of course is bitcoin exists. The demand for gold and bitcoin in a period of bail-ins will be astromomical. Would you rather buy bitcoin and deal with its volatility or see a bank take 50% of your money. What if you hold $100,000 in a bank and bail-in law allows banks to take 50% of everything over $50,000, you are going to want to protect that money by holding cash under your matress or buying bitcoin, and bitcoin is just a little bit easier to store than $50,000 in $100 bills under your matress. 

Plus dont forget Cyprus in 2013, during this time cash withdrawls will be basically impossible with a restriction on how much you are allowed to withdraw per week. The only option left is to wire money out to buy bitcoin.

TLDR: the next financial crisis / global recession / stock market crash will probably see bitcoin tumble initially just like gold dipped momentarily in 2008, but as soon as banks start asking for bail-outs or begin using their new found power to bail-in from their customers deposits bitcoin will rise dramatically.

A lot of people heard about bitcoin for the first time in 2013 during the Cyprus bail-in where Cypriots were on the news talking about how they exited the banking system using bitcoin. Now imagine that happening globally.",cryptocurrency

And thats it! Last month I made 1200, month before that 1600, month before that 600. I do work less during the school year so thats why it is 600 but during the holidays I do make some good money even though I work less since Im going to school.

As for my accounts:

Emer Fund: 4k

College: 3k

Checking (for bills, gas, and spend): 300

Travel: 83.00

Holiday: 5.00

Auto repair: 0.00

I have no regular savings fund or anything. As I work during the summer (and to some extent during the school year), i dont budget, i just take whatever money I have, and fill up my ""funds"" while Im making good money. I have planned on saving ~3k a year for college (already met this goal for my sophomore year) and with my 3k/yr scholarship from my uni, I have planned on paying the rest of my school with federal loans only (I want 0 private loans).. 

I am going into my sophomore yr with no loans so after I graduate with BS in comp sci I am thinking I will maybe have something like 20k in federal loans.

I want to travel a bit while in college and am thinking about a 800-1k trip to DC to see all the monuments and such. I should have more than enough to fill this fund with my income from July. Or I could take the vacation money and spend it all my on spring semester tuition. 

So is this a good idea? Should I put all my funds toward college or can I take some trips while in college? If I do take this trip (and others later on in college) do you guys think 1k on DC is a good trip? I really want to go to Europe but I think thats too expensive for me right now. I dont want to feel guilty the entire time, which I feel like I am prone to do, if I am financially secure enough to take this trip and I want to make sure I am financially secure.

personalfinance,Should I open a high-yield savings account?,"I'm looking to get into saving more now that I have a steady income and paid off most of my loans, but I can't decide if I should keep using the savings account I have with my bank (which has 0.01% interest), or open a high-yield savings account?

My dilemma is, is it worth opening a HYS account? I know the interest rate is higher, but will that matter if I'm only depositing like say $1000? or even $5000? Plus it'll take a few days to transfer money back to my checking if I ever need it.

If they published the balance sheet, then every single person will know that they do not intend whatsoever in quantitative tightening.

In fact, the latest version of the balance sheet is March 2018, and right after March the 10 year bond yields stopped rising.

personalfinance,"Sophomore in College, on Frankenstein-Full-Ride, Best Course of Action?","Hey there! 

This upcoming semester I'll be a sophomore in college, and in the case of this year, I have my college paid for in full without loans or out-of-pocket expenses up front. This became possible for me because I got a job as a CA (mostly known as an RA) in the dorm I lived in last year, and landed a couple scholarships that ended up covering the rest of the cost of attendance--and then some. If my math checks out, the university will owe me $1500 in unused financial aid per semester. 

On top of this, my job as a CA will cover room and board, as well as an extra $1000 stipend paid out biweekly. Moreover, I've also landed a job as a TA , which will pay out an additional $500 at the end of the fall semester, and $1000 at the end of the spring semester. And to round that off, my family supports me with around $400 for various expenses, which in the past has gone towards food, class supplies, saving up for fun stuff, etc. 

In order to attend schooling last year, I had to take out a $5500 unsubsidized federal student loan that is currently racking up interest at 4.45&amp;#37;. So at this point, I owe around $5700. Yikes. 

In terms of expenditures, I don't have too many. I don't own a car, as it's not really worth having one in my situation, as I've never needed one. My room and board is paid for through my job, and I get $400/semester to use on campus for food and basic supplies. So I end up spending my money on games, going to the movies, buying supplies and resources for classes, eating out where the meal plan cash doesn't work, going to the grocery store, etc. One of my broad-ended goals this semester is to cut this down, as I realize that a lot of money is probably being burnt up in an unwise manner. 

This semester I want to get serious about my finances and getting myself ready for the future in that sense. I've always done well academically, but I figure it's never too early to start getting ready for the future. While it's a bit jumbled, here are my concerns: 

\- Should I start paying off my student loan now with the extra income I'm set to start receiving? Or is there a better way for me to utilize this money? Last year I did just fine with the money my family sent as day-to-day expense money, so all the stipends and refunds are new funds for this year, if that makes sense. 

\- Is it worth looking into getting set up on some sort of credit card? I don't need it for the credit aspect, and I would definitely make a habit of paying the balance off as soon as it's due (if not beforehand), but is it worth the trouble? What kinds of options do I even have at this point? What are good practices in terms of having and using a credit card? 

\- I've never set up a budget before, only really kept track of how much I have and how much I've spent. I've never had serious money issues, but I'm tired of not having a plan and I would very much like to start saving money if possible. How should I go about setting up a budget? Do you have any recommendations as to how I should approach this, or what I should take into consideration? 

\- In general, what can I do now as a college student that will help me out in the long run? Is there anything in particular that I should do or be aware of? 

I know these questions are pretty opened ended, but I'm genuinely unsure of how I can make the most of my situation. I'm not hurting by any means, but I definitely want to learn to be better with money and set my self up for success in the future. I would greatly appreciate any advice you can give me on how to improve my situation any further!

personalfinance,Should I remove my 3 years of FERS (U.S. fed employee pension) contributions?,"Hi Personal Finance!

I haven't found much about FERS pensions and removing contributions online or on reddit. I'd like to learn peoples thoughts on FERS as well as thoughts on my particular situation:

**Question**: Should I remove my FERS (pension) contributions and invest it instead? Should I roll it over into a new employer sponsored 401k or cash out entirely?

**Background**:

* Worked for The Man making $68k average for 2 years and 10 months (left for a job making \~110k).
* FERS retirement calculation is: (highest\_3\_years\_avg) \* (years of service) \* (1&amp;#37;) = yearly payout
* My pension would be: ($68k) \* (2.9) \* (0.01) = \~ $1.9k a year payout
* Current FERS contributions are $8.1k
* I am 27 years old and healthy
* *EDIT:* I started paying into FERS in 2015
* No plans to return to government but...
   * I like the idea of going back for the health insurance benefits before retirement
   * A few years even as a capped out GS-Whatever wouldn't affect my pension much
   * Removing my contributions nulls out any time in service should I return to gov
   * Gov is a good employer overall and bases are all over the states - you never know!

**Other Notes**:

* I don't think my FERS gets inflation increases when I am not working there
* A FERS payout comes with an interest rate matching Gov Securities (2&amp;#37;?)
* I'll pay taxes on those pre-tax pension contributions... but don't know if that's at my 68k salary or my new one!
* My 68k salary calculated into FERS might not be so cool 30 years from now (inflation)
* 115k investments (TSP, Roth IRA, other vanguard investments),  15k savings/checking
* HCOL area (So Cal), no debt
* Rolling my FERS contributions into my new employer 401k would allow me to roll *that* new 401k over into my TSP should I ever leave my current employer.

**My Conclusion**: Since the pension benefits wouldn't be huge, even if I went back in a few years, pulling out the 8.1k and investing what's left over 35 years would be better than a tiny pension 35 years from now.

**References**: [https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/fers-information/former-employees/](https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/fers-information/former-employees/)

***TL;DR***: I have 8.1k in FERS. I think I should roll it into my new employer's 401k and invest it for 35 years instead. Am I crazy?

Thanks for your thoughts!",finance

Bitcoin,Bitcoin to benefit from Trade War?,"I believe that a US dollar hyper-inflation is on the horizon (maybe 2-4 years depending on whether or not the Fed will hike interest rates to pop the asset bubble, only to introduce mega QE later to save the economy but at the cost of killing the US dollar).

And I believe the demise of the US dollar is something the ""elites"" did not plan for. If you read through the article in the link below which is a translated article in 1982 outlining (and foreshadowing) exactly what is happening in the Middle East and the economic structure of the fiat currency system, then you will know that it aligns with the current US foreign policy in the Middle East to make sure that there is sufficient resources for the luxurious lifestyle in the United States - and it is done through attaching the petro to the dollar (which is why so many people nowadays call the US Dollar the petro-dollar). But they did not anticipate for Bitcoin and cryptocurrrencies to come in - and it's taking them by surprise it seems. Adding on to the fact that China/Russia/India/Iran are trying to isolate NATO/Japan through One Belt One Road and circumventing the US Dollar, it really seems like the ""elites"" may actually abandon the US Dollar entirely and actually bag hold Bitcoin or Gold or Silver.

gaming,Always Cherish Your Wingman,"This past Friday I had to say good bye to my gaming wingman, Roxas.  He enjoyed a healthy and happy life and loved all the typical dog activities of running, fetch and tearing up countless stuffed toys.  But in addition to being my best friend and brother, he was my gaming wingman and perhaps it was my imagination but for the entirety of our time together, no game excited him like the gears of war series. 

Maybe it was the constant noise from the television or my frequent outbursts of joy at a victory or shouts of profanity from a particularly questionable death (a constant in multiplayer) but whenever we took our spot on the chaise to play gears I  was greeted with a type of enthusiasm and joy in his face you’d never see in any other situation. 

His head rested on my lap, fixated on the television.  I’m his older years he’d sleep a little more often than not, but no other game brought this focus out in Roxas.  It was as though he was my team mate, a silent partner to celebrate in victory and comfort in defeat. 

One final game was played on Friday, and we did great. A King of the Hill match on War Machine, and like always.  I couldn’t have done it without him.  I’m sharing all this because as a gamer, he was more than a pet.  He genuinely shared in this experience with me.  Of all the countless walks and great experiences burned in my memory...

Productivity creates more supply, more supply lowers prices, lower prices lead to higher levels of savings, and higher levels of savings will lead to lower interest rates. In a world with a non-inflationary monetary medium like bitcoin there is no upper limit on productivity, no over heating of the economy. Inflationary money like fiat requires high interest rates and high unemployment to prevent CPI inflation, but with sound money increased productivity and zero unemployment just leads to increased supply and declining prices of goods and services for all. 

Bitcoin will do everything traditional finance does but better and available for everyone everywhere, all while allowing us to live in our natural state of low/no unemployment, low interest rates, constantly increasing productivity and a constantly decreasing cost of living leaving everyone better off over time even if you never get a pay rise.

The countries that adopt bitcoins sound/strong monetary policy will become the switzerlands of the world while those that dont will become the venezuelas of the world. Until all countries eventually adopt btc because that will be the only way to be recognized as a legitimate nation. At that point the whole world will be on the same level playing field, making weak-currency-policy induced poverty nothing but a chapter in the history books.

Bitcoin really does take us in the right direction as a human society towards global equality by putting every human on the same level playing field.",cryptocurrency
gaming,The Golden Age of Video Games,"In my mind, it is almost undeniable that I grew up in a golden age. I only leave room for the doubt that is inherent in my limitations, being unable to grow up in another generation or capture some age of nostalgia that developed before or after my childhood. I will make my case, and I would like to know whether or not you agree.

My first memories of playing video games are in the early 90’s, and that means NES and Sega Genesis. These games were challenging, creative, colorful, innocent fun. My brother and I had a decent collection of cartridges, but just as fun was going to Blockbuster and renting whatever game had the strongest magnetic draw from the box-art. My personal favorites were the Mega Man games on NES and Sonic 2 on Genesis. I still sometimes hook up these old consoles, blow on the cartridges, and play to my heart’s content. Not long after this, we acquired a PlayStation, after which my life was periodically engulfed in Crash Bandicoot games. 

Looking back, it seems that gaming matured alongside me at exactly the right moments. The first serious game I played on the computer was Heroes of Might &amp; Magic II, one of the greatest games and soundtracks of all time. On PlayStation I journeyed through my first Final Fantasy game, FFVIII. I have played through it a number of times, and I am convinced that its story, music, and creativity place it among greatest classics of literature and art in history.

Then in middle school a few friends introduced me to a new world: StarCraft, Diablo II, and Counter-Strike. Only God and Xfire know what percentage of my waking hours were invested among these three games. They were and are absolutely awesome. 

Arcade games of my generation also deserve special praise, namely Area 51, Street Fighter, Tekken, NBA Jam, and DDR.

Whether any other period of childhood spanned such greatness, I can’t say for sure, but it seems unlikely to me. In a certain way, gaming came of age with my generation, and I doubt that the kind of excitement and discovery that this encompassed can ever be recreated, until some whole new medium of art and storytelling again rises from infancy to maturity. 

The similarity I draw is with the publishing of the Harry Potter series. Every generation from now to the end of civilization will enjoy those books, but there is some magic that cannot really be recaptured, that existed among my generation who turned eleven when the Sorcerer’s Stone was published, and grew up with Harry like he was one of our own. 

Let me know what you think.",technology
personalfinance,Advice needed for family of 4 going on 5 in debt.,"Needing advice for paying down debt. Here's the scoop.
I've been paying extra on one of three loans I have with Navient (formerly Sallie Mae) in hopes that we will have one loan paid off by the end of the year, which will then reduce our monthly payments. Instead, Navient continues to increase the interest rate and I'm not able to pay off as much. I'm getting very frustrated. We just found out we are going to have another child. We feel like we are never going to get out of our hole. Our current debt list:
$9,000 credit card 15% interest
$32,000 student loans (both private and federal)
$15,000 car loan (need to get bigger car before January 2019)
$9,000 home improvement credit card no interest
We make between $40,000-50,000 annually. And, we pay our medical bills through our HSA. 

An option we thought about taking was to refinance our mortgage to pay off our Navient loans ($16,000), and credit card with interest ($9,000). 

Thoughts and suggestions are greatly appreciated!",finance
gaming,CyberPower WARNING,"Update:

After trying to ship my computer back, I was given two options: use their shipping label and package it myself to return it (told by customer service that they highly recommend getting shipping insurance instead of using label Bc if I package it wrong they won’t cover it) or that I would have to pay for the insurance to cover the shipping of the device. The cost would exceed $200. 

I decided to wash my hands of ever dealing with this POS company and went to Geek Squad. 

They’ve now figured out that the power supply and motherboard were faulty. They’re still trying to test the GPU. But I will have an update soon. They’re claiming the warranty for me. S/O bestbuy and geek squad!!

ORIGINAL POST.


I wanted to make a post about my experience with buying a gaming computer from CyberPower (CP) in case people are looking for a new computer and are searching for reviews like I did...

Here’s a list of everything that went wrong:

1. My computer didn’t arrive on the schedule day, so, I called CP to see what was up. They said “we’re a bit backed up, it’s not even cleared the line yet.” That’s ok, it happens right? Some heads up would of been nice though.  It came in two weeks later. 

2. When it first arrive, it was perfect... until I tried to turn it on. It took multiple attempts to power up. I thought maybe I was just crazy, but i continued to have issue with powering it on. So, I called the customer support... he thought it was the power supply, so he sent me a YouTube video to test it with a paper clip. I asked, “what if I damage the power supply or something in the process, who will be liable for that? He said me...  

3. I started to have GPU issues with low FPS drops during games. I called again, I was fed up (keep in mind I’m still having issues with turning on the computer). I asked for a refund... they told me I’m passed the 30 days mark from buying the computer. This is true, but technically, if you factor in the order delay, when I received the computer... I mean I only had it for a week... LIVID at this point. 

4. I asked about the warranty and if I could send my computer back to get diagnosed. He said absolutely! I thought ok, Now we are back on track... I asked him how to go about sending it, he said to go to ups/fedex tell him you have an electronic package and make sure you wrap it up carefully... because if anything were to go wrong during the shipping of the Computer back to CP, the CUSTOMER is liable!!!! He said, if I were you I’d get the insurance through Fedex or UPS, Bc you theres a high chance the fiberglass on your tower will crack or break.

5. FML

6. $3,400 computers, priceless customer Fucking support.. 

7. I really want to be in all caps right now and I really want to slap a mother ducker. 

So, yeah.. save your hard earned money. Go somewhere else.

Oh, I’ve never in my life taken the effort to write a shitty review about a company. I know that it one bad experience make a company bad... but bad policy do... 

I hope this helps... if anyone knows anyone at CyperPower, please share this with them. Hopefully, they will learn from this and progress.


Also, I’m sorry for cursing and please ignore grammar mistakes. I’m big mad.",technology
financialindependence,"This will be my last week of full-time work, hopefully forever","**Quick info:**

* 33 years old, married with kids, living in the San Francisco Bay Area
* Job: Overpaid engineer at a Silicon Valley tech company
* Annual household income: $250k-300k, which is $150k salary plus $100-150k stock and bonus
* Annual expenses: About $65k, with half of that going towards rent for a run-down 2-bedroom duplex that's 18 miles from work (sigh, Bay Area housing...)
* Assets: $1.4M invested in 50&amp;#37; VTSAX, 30&amp;#37; VTIAX, and 20&amp;#37; VBTLX, plus $70k cash. Investments are held in roughly 50&amp;#37; taxable and 50&amp;#37; tax-advantaged (401k, IRAs, HSA) accounts.

Tomorrow is a special Monday for me, because it's the beginning of what will hopefully be the last full-time work week in my life. Ever since my first kid was born a few years ago I've really struggled with managing my time and have found it nearly impossible to balance work, parenting, spending time with my spouse, my own personal interests/hobbies, and various other responsibilities. I'm incredibly fortunate to have a massive income and a fairly average lifestyle, which has led to me saving a lot of money in relatively little time.

At work I'll be dropping to 80&amp;#37; time and will no longer work on Fridays, so every weekend will be a three day weekend. This comes with a pay cut, but I have enough money saved up at this point that I feel like it's a pretty good deal. Additionally the money I'm giving up would have been taxed at the highest rate, so while my gross pay will decrease by 20&amp;#37; my net pay will decrease by less than that.

While 80&amp;#37; time sounds nice I know that I want more, and I'll be attempting to drop to 60&amp;#37; time soon. One thing I've realized is that my savings gives me a lot of negotiating power - if management is not willing to go to 60&amp;#37; time then I have the freedom to quit and find another job that will allow me to work at 60&amp;#37;. Additionally my department recently lost a bunch of people for various reasons (transfers to other parts of the company, people quitting, medical issues, etc.) so we're now very understaffed, which I think will give me even more negotiating power.

While I would like to completely stop working for at least a year or two (possibly forever!), I'm hesitant to do that right now for a few reasons. First, I'm not quite FI yet - I would be if I moved to a LCOL area, but I'd prefer to live in a MCOL area. Another year or two of saving money should be all I need, and while I could get there a bit faster by continuing to work full-time I've just reached a point where I feel like I need to scale back on work for my own sanity.

Second, the health insurance situation in the US continues to be wildly unstable and unpredictable. I can currently afford to buy insurance out of pocket with ACA subsidies, but I don't want to put my family in a position where we'd be in trouble if those subsidies were no longer available to us. We're very lucky to have Canadian citizenship in case healthcare becomes a massive problem, but moving to Canada is something we'd really like to avoid if possible.

Finally, I know that the current bull market must come to an end eventually, and if possible I'd prefer to work through the next market crash. I'm not completely set on this and may stop working before the crash if it takes more than a few years to happen, but if possible that's what I'd prefer to do.

My view of FI has changed a lot over the years. When I first learned about the concept all I could think about was early retirement - I wanted to quit working as soon as possible and never work again. I still feel that way to some extent, but I'm realizing that there's more than that to FI and that having the freedom to try something different (work part-time, take a less stressful job, etc.) is also an incredible benefit. It's really about having the financial freedom to do what you want and try different things instead of being locked into a career for several decades. And who knows, maybe once my kids are in school I'll feel less busy and decide that I want to spend my time working again :)",finance
Bitcoin,Is Satoshi Nakamoto ... an A.I. ?,"Hello everyone,

Yes. This will be a bit of a long-shot and conspiracy theory.

To be a bit Musk-esque I have thought about the possibility of an A.I. coming up with the concept of crypto currency.

Thinking back many many years, it has been a constant struggle of the human being to own their own money.

Money has been a constant slave to centralization, which, contrary to popular belief, did not mean government money.

If you look deep down the rabbit hole of money, it turns out there are very few holders of vast wealth in the world and very few people controlling who gets what money - aka debt.

If you take out that dollar, euro, etc. that you hold in your hand. What makes it desirable ? The promise of that piece of money being worth something. Who gives that promise to you ? ECB, the FED ? Who are the people behind these institutions. I will let you answer those questions yourself. With some searching on the interwebs, you will find out.

Anyways. Why would an AI create Bitcoin and to what purpose? 

Since ancient times, but more recently during the rise of the Rothschilds money has been used and aquired to, well, make more money. Armys have been funded, huge companies producing tanks, planes and weaponry paid. But they were not paid by people like you and me. We have no interest in all of this. We would only like to exchange goods.

This is how Bitcoin is different. You can exchange Bitcoin for a Lambo. But the government cant (well it could in theory, but they would undermine themselves) buy Tanks, Planes, Weaponry for Bitcoin. Now imagine a world where we stop supporting the dollar, the euro, etc. We buy everything - with Bitcoin. We would crush ""their"" money and would get along quite well. Look at the South-American countries or some countries in Africa where Bitcoin is already a parallel currency. Much more stable and much more reliable compared to their own currency.

And here I return to the above question. If money is the cause of so much suffering and misery, due to the fact that

the few own the money, a logical step would be to seperate the ones that own said money and us, the people. Let us have our money, decentralized and without being able to control how much and where we hold it. It would be the logical step for creation of a more egalitarian society. Where people control their money and it is truly global also cutting off all the middlemen (yes, im looking at you bitcoin/fiat exchanges). What is the one thing that everyone is concerned about ? Money. 

Enter A.I. - by creating Bitcoin many things are achieved.

Financial Independance. A sense of community. Financial freedom.

... and many more.

What a great idea. Perhaps too great to come from a mere human mind.

Sorry if it all sounds a bit ... conspiracious. But I wanted to archive this, just in case I am right,

in which case I will celebrate and become a bitcoin legend :3 all for the sweet sweet karma ;)

I would be curious about your opinions !",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"Student Loan Servicer didn't apply years worth of payments, no bank records, what to do?","Hi Everybody!

Back in 2005 I took advantage of the super-low interest rates to consolidate several different student loans right when I graduated with a 10 year repayment period (I'm based in NJ, USA).  At the time my parents did most of the heavy lifting with the consolidation, but I immediately began repayment.  My mom casually mentioned how it must be nice to be done with my student loans, but according to my servicer (Navient) I have 3 years left of payments.  When I look into the account history they only started counting my payments in 2011, erasing 6 years of repayment!

Unfortunately, the bank account I used for those repayments was closed in 2014, and the bank (Wells Fargo) can't dig up the historical records).  I'm trying to find the origination documentation, but no luck so far.  I'm trying to get my detailed credit report, but as far as I know that only goes back 7 years.

Any advice for how I can get either: a copy of the origination documentation, which should show that I was scheduled to begin payment in 2005 or historical transaction records showing that I actually make those payments?  At this point the monthly payment isn't painful, but I'd really prefer not to pay nearly 50% more for the loan (both interest AND principal!)

Med Bills $40

Discount Rate PrePay for Vet Care for Good Old Kitty Boy $106

Software Subscription $10

Food $200

Rx Cat Food $160

Gas $70

(\~$1,711-ish/month total)

With these base-ass needs covered, I end up with about $250-280 give or take a month that ends up going into the weird stuff like car maintenance, larger grocery purchases, or house supplies. Impulse things are an issue for me still, but greatly reduced since canceling my Prime account.

I live with a roommate, but don't pay rent or power myself (hush hush, but necessary). I own my car, and the insurance is paid for me as well.

I was in a car accident that resulted in a lot of expense, still in active treatment for physical injury and major depression, postponing legal settlement. (not my fault or vehicle)

I don’t buy new clothes often, maybe something every 2 months-ish.

I have a weird tummy, so my food is difficult cost-wise. I eat out maybe once a month. Since I started spreadsheeting, my food expense is down to \~$200 vs. the $350+ it was before!

I've targeted one of the smaller loans ($2,995/VI9.24&amp;#37;) in the $43,000 batch to dump what I can into the principal outside the total minimum.

Regarding work, I currently love my job. They're the ""like family"" in a good way, always understanding and supportive in good times and bad, and transparent. I've been with them for about 10 years and now get 3 weeks PTO. Everyone works well together and we’re steadily growing.  I tried to leave two different times for better prospects in corporate jobs that completely bombed, the most recent attempt in 2015 to an office setting with a paycut that left me in massive CC debt after less than a year (living off the cards). My company took me back at my old pay rate like nothing happened after 11 months and I’ve been decently content since.

Ship has sailed on my student loans, I think I’m stuck with what I have for now. I can’t consolidate/refinance because I didn’t get a degree. I feel trapped cause I only need 7 credits, but I can’t afford the time off or tuition currently. I was so overwhelmed during an Individualized Degree program meeting, that school seems like such a far-off concept for me. Maybe this is the depression talking? The degree was between Art Major and German Minor, amongst like 5 other probes into other areas. (wet fart sound)

I was recently inspired to apply for a concept art job at a growing company that pays $10-12K more than I make now. The position in question has since been filled on the website, but something similar should open soon since they’re opening a new location soon. I need to get a portfolio together, but I’m nervous about the environment. If it’s a crunch culture kind of place, it will not work out for me. It worries me to try this since I feel like my current company might not take me back after a third flight attempt if it goes sour? Especially since without a degree my prospects of making my current salary are scary if it doesn't work!

My other thought is doing wedding suite graphic design via Etsy as a side hustle with my current job. I'm garbage at navigating digital art programs and feel dumber at every attempt. I subscribed to an inexpensive online art school for access to instructional courses on this kind of stuff this past week. I still have too much pain to be pulling all nighters, or working another manual labor position elsewhere.

In preparing for these options, I keep hemming n hawwing on what's a waste of time or what’s valuable and sustainable for me, and worth parsing out from my meager “extra”. I hate feeling useless despite working as hard as I am. I hope this makes sense, my browser keeps crashing as I write this lmao;;; I need new tires, I need to save up for surgery, I want to visit friends again, but I just feel dog-piled on.

tl;dr what’s the best use of my monthly sort-of-loose $250 until I figure out a stable, manageable additional income stream? I'd appreciate any unbiased outsiders' opinions!

personalfinance,"Mortgage is more than what I need, what can I do?","Hello all, have been lurking in this reddit for awhile and learnt a lot about financial options and investment. Now I have a unique problem where I don't know what to do with the money. Situation is:

Bank lent me - $550,000

About $300,000 is used to pay for a house.

I have about $250,000 left.

I also have savings of about $90,000.

I live in Australia where the central bank has not moved rates up for close to a decade, but banks have started tightening lending rules and has heavier scrutiny. My current interest rate is pretty low, 3.95&amp;#37;. My savings rate is only 2.8&amp;#37; which barely keeps up with inflation. My household is a DINK and currently childfree (trying to keep it as CF as long as I can). What should I invest in, if I should invest in anything? And how much? Hopefully enough to beat the bank's interest rates while earning a bit for retirement.",finance

personalfinance,A question about buying a house and then buying a car immediately after.,"In the middle of underwriting on my soon to be house (in a couple days), my car's head gaskets decided to take a turn. I can still drive it, but have to constantly be vigilante over coolant and oil. Needless to say, it is incredibly frustrating, and came out of left field.

I have been told time and time again that if you are going to buy a car after closing on a house, that the best bet is to wait 2 weeks after closing, but before you hit 30 days, thus giving enough time after funding of the house, and just before the point where the mortgage could likely hit your credit score. 

I haven't quite seen much online over this through google, and was curious if anyone here would have any insight. My credit score is around 690, and with the predicted drop of my credit score being around 80-100, a large hit to my credit score could mean a higher interest rate, if my car were to explode before my credit score shoots back up. Also, with increasing interest rates, I worry that if I tough it out until my credit score goes back up, I will be stuck with a higher interest rate anyways.

Is buying a car before the mortgage hits my credit report shady, and or, a legit thing? Is this even a good strategy?",finance
personalfinance,"Bank ""lost"" CDs","My mom bought some CDs for my kids several years ago at National City.  She held on to the paperwork for several years, then gave me the paperwork a couple years ago.  I saw that the CDs were marked to reinvest at maturity.  I wasn't a member of National City and didn't realize that they had been bought out or merged with PNC at some point.  Since the CDs were marked to reinvest, I just held on to them.  Flash forward to last week.  I was getting some finances in order and decided to see about cashing the CDs in and moving them to a better investment for our girls such as a 529.  I see that National City is now PNC.  I take the CDs in, but they have no record of the account numbers.  The CDs are in my mom's name, so she has to take it from there.  She is currently getting bounced between our local PNC branch and their online call center.  Her last communication was with a manger that said the money is probably ""just gone"" and that they purge records from time to time.  Their advice was to work though a state webpage (Michigan) for lost or unclaimed money.  Any advice?  I have the original signed documents with the deposit amounts, terms, and account numbers.

TL;DR
Have documentation for 7-year old CDs.  Original bank merged with PNC, who now says the money is ""just gone"".

Update:
Thanks for all the suggestions!  The money is not listed in state or federal unclaimed property sites.  After a long meeting with the bank manager there are no records of anything - even that my mom ever had an account.

CryptoCurrency,brain-gain vs. brain-drain,"Hey hey heeeeey community :)

First of all you might think i am crazy after my first statement, then you should better stop reading at this point.

""The more money I loose the more confident I become!""

I am in the nice position that I followed the number one rule ""Never afford more then you can loose"" when i first started trading in the end of last year. I am still pissed that I lost money the last six months but it doesn't hit me too hard.

In the last few weeks the bear-market changed my feeling completely. It feels like we almost reach the point where content is becoming valuable. Everyone that is still in the market or still interested in the market is already a winner I personally think. We reached the point where we can actually educate ourselves as preparation for the next bull market and i am 100&amp;#37; confident it will come and be a lot bigger then the last one. Still it will end in overvalue (in regards to actual achievements by that time) again, but we will be educated and everyone that fomo's in will most likely not have the time, experience and knowledge that we will have by that point.

Still markets, greed, 3rd party influence everything else negative will try to reenter our brains again during bull market and partially we won't be able to sustain. But we can sustain a lot better then 80&amp;#37; of the others what gives us a big edge.

If you look back, think about what you learned during the bull market and the start of the bear market compared to the last 2 months what did you learn? I actually learned about tech, hype and projects but completely forgot about psychology of the market. That's not even surprising because there was almost no content on reddit, telegram ... was all spammed with moon boys and LAMBOnians.

There are many good sources to find information but the real cognitive achievements you will get by using your own brain in learning actively.

The best and easiest way for me to start into market psychology was:

Search for famous financial quotes and you will come across many smart words that you should try to understand. Filter five of those you think will help you the most in the next bull market. Write them down!!!! Take a deep dive into history. (DotCom bubble, real estate ""bubble"", market cycles, effects of pay interest rates...) Then set your goals for the next bull market (write them down as well) and rethink you portfolio.

(Mental quotes of successful athletes are very interesting as well for traders/investors)

In financial markets we've got to know that we have a disadvantage against institutional money and against wealthy people most likely. They are often not personally responsible for their decisions and won't use/loose the money they worked hard for. If they fail, that's calculated risk and will be balanced out because they usually trade better. Why?This is like a cycle: non emotional trader -&gt; better decisions -&gt; more reward -&gt; more power -&gt; less risk -&gt; better decisions....

But we can withstand that if we learn to control our emotions in trading.

My advice (for myself included):

Don't be arrogant. We all made and will make mistakes. Those are necessary to learn for the future.

Use the bear market to train your brain that you are able to sustain the drain during the next bull market.

One of my favorite quotes in the end (by Yogi Berra)

\-Baseball is 90 percent mental and the other half is physical-

Think about how you can use this one for your trading.

Good luck guys :)

btc,Looking for help making sure I am understanding this chart correctly.,"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BASE


After the crash in 2008 the Fed started ""Quantitative Easing"" which as far as I can tell is just a fancy word for counterfeiting. Basically they're just creating MASSIVE amounts of money out of thin air. They used to supposedly only do enough to inflate the supply at 2-3% per year but now apparently they're just firing up the printing presses and doing factory style production of this paper stuff we use as currency?

According to the chart above, the monetary base has QUADRUPLED since 2008. 

Am I understanding this correctly? Does this mean the FED has literally just QUADRUPLED the amount of base currency in just TEN YEARS? 

And to be clear, this means then, that this QUADRUPLED money supply, is all money that can be taken by the member banks and fractionally reserved out at ten to one?

So basically the physical money supply has just QUADRUPLED, and of that NEW, quadrupled amount, banks are going to take it and then 10x it under fractional reserving? 

So this a 4X, followed by a 10x...right? So the money supply is going to increase 40 fold. 

Unless I'm reading this wrong? 


If this is true then it would seem to me like the prices of goods in the US are going to absolutely skyrocket here pretty soon...

Can anyone explain how prices haven't gone up that much yet even even though the money supply appears to be multiplying by orders of magnitude? Are the rich just hoarding it all!?

What the heck is going on here?

Thanks in advance. 

BTW sorry if this is slightly off topic, I figure it is still somewhat relevant because inflation is a driving force behind the increasing prices of cryptocurrencies.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,403b loan to pay off debt while increasing contributions?,"I have about 12k in credit card debt and a few hundred thousand in a 403b. I have about $1200 a month to pay down the credit card debt but I started thinking about how best to use that $1200. I already contribute a significant amount to my 403b and I was thinking if I got a 403b loan to pay off the 12k I could then use the $1200 to max out my 403b contributions by contributing an additional $870 a month, tax-free, and then use the remainder of the $1200 ($330) to pay off the 403b loan monthly. 

By my thinking, this would reduce my tax burden (and my AGI), add to my retirement savings, and reduce the interest rate on that debt. I'm thinking the tax savings, and the gains on the investment would be greater than the benefit of paying the CC debt down sooner at the higher interest rate. Does this sound like a reasonable plan or am I completely off base?

personalfinance,Need some advice on student loans,"Hi r/personalfinance.

I'm looking for advice on how to deal with student loans while I'm still in school. To give a little background information about me, I am a 25 year old male living in the Midwest. I have recently just completed my masters degree and will begin my doctorate here in August. I am attending a large public university where I will be working as a graduate assistant throughout the entirety of my degree. This could be anywhere from 3-5 years to complete my classes and dissertation. I am very fortunate with this position as they will pay for my tuition for my degree while also earning around 1100 a month in stipend money from working.

Currently my student loan situation looks like this:

* 44k in federal loans
* 14k in one private loan through Wells Fargo

My monthly budget situation looks like this:

* Rent - $375
* Utilities - $50
* Food - $120
* Car Insurance - $75

This adds up to around $620 leaving around $480 after I pay all my bills. Recently, I have been putting $200 a month into my private loan through Wells Fargo and putting the rest into my savings account (roughly $4000 in there). In the coming year I am able to receive around $16000 in federal loans. I know I will not need this money to pay for my schooling as my graduate assistantship will cover all of it but I was wondering if it would be a smart idea to take that and pay off my private loan with it.

crypto_currency,Distributed Credit Chain project overview,"We all live in the modern world, where the financial component plays a huge role in the well-being of people. As if we did not want to, and without credits it's very difficult to manage. Oh, these loans. You pay one sum, but you must give it with interest and on time. In life there can be many unforeseen circumstances that do not change the financial plans for the better. Not payments on loans are currently increasing, which not only leads to the decline of the banking system, but the entire financial system. To remedy the situation, banks are forced to raise interest rates of loans and hope for solvent borrowers. Therefore, this situation makes it easier for bank employees to select clients for issuing loans more rigidly, more requirements for submitted documents, careful checking, which takes a lot of time, the desire to borrow decreases.

The project Distributed Credit Chain promises to help out of this situation.

About the project:

Distributed Credit Chain is a block-based platform for solving banking problems, and all financial services in the world. DCC will provide an opportunity through a decentralized network to safely and quickly distribute loans, consider debts, assets, etc.

  Benefits:

The project is based on blocking technology, which allows you to conduct profitable and secure transactions around the world. Given the fact that the world economy is now actively approaching new markets, the development of such a project is very urgent. Its value increases due to the distributed credit chain, it will be possible to destroy the classic financial monopolies. Increasing the effectiveness of financial institutions is another goal of project developers who seek to unite people from different parts of the world. The financial structure will become flat, without the participation of ""third parties"". Thanks to the decentralized system, you can change the model of user interaction and make it more democratic and transparent. Will change the management structure and make the system more efficient. Since all records are registered in a block chain and can not be changed, state regulation can be performed in the present tense, it is possible to identify industry risks in a timely manner and take measures.

personalfinance,401k Loan to pay off student loan and state tax levies?,"Not sure if it's the best course of action, but it's the best I can come up with considering my income.

I currently gross \~$1900.00/mo. 

Student loan levy($3700 balance) = $445/mo., State tax levy(approx $5000 balance) = $223/mo both being garnished from my check after taxes and all.

With the student loan levy out of the $445 taken each month, $336 goes towards principal, \~$20-40 goes to interest based on how much as accrued for the month so far. And $87 goes towards ""fees and charges""

I'm not sure how much of the tax levy is going to principal/interest/fees.

So after all the deductions from my gross pay each month; I'm left with $1691 net. After all my bills (Rent, cell, internet, electric and car insurance) I'm left with approx $650/month for other the rest of my living expenses (food, toiletries, gas, etc.)

Currently a 401k loan through my company has an interest rate of 6&amp;#37;. A 24 month loan would have a monthly pmt of $354. Which would be a net difference of $427 in my pocket each month. Which would give me a little more breathing room financially. And I would most likely be able to dump that extra $427 into paying extra on the loan principal each month. 

Anyone got any advice? Best way to go? I just feel like it would be more beneficial to take a loan where I can ""pay myself back"" instead of paying outrageous fees each month just to have my money taken away from me. I understand that I won't end up earning any interest on the money I take out for the loan, however I'm still young (33) and have a time to add more money to my retirement fund.",finance
personalfinance,Currently 20% of income to Roth 401k and 40% to student loans; should I change things?,"I have read in other discussions that people should pay off their student loans before starting any contribution to retirement funds, so I wanted to ask for advice before I elect to reduce my retirement contribution to zero (for now).

Background:

* Started working my first job 6 weeks ago, after graduation
* Have: **$0 in savings** (no savings account)
* Have: **$2k in checking** account
* Owe: **$18.3k in student loans**

Their auto-pay system changed to take money out of my account regardless of whether or not the bill was paid early so now I've over drafted by over 200$ for a car payment and they can't refund me right away because their systems are down. Currently I have a checking account, savings account, credit card, and car loan from them. Unfortunately I'll probably have to keep my credit card open with WF because it is my first credit card and I don't want to lose that much of my credit history if I close it.

I would prefer to use Charles Schwab because of their atm fee reimbursements, free checks, decent interest rates on savings accounts and all that jazz but unfortunately they don't do car loans. At the moment I've had a collection impairing my credit report for a medical procedure that my insurance didn't correctly payout (they are correcting it soon and hopefully that will be removed shortly without me having to pay it, its a long story) but this has been preventing me from attempting to refinance my car loan (also through Wells Fargo, about 4&amp;#37;, 12k left of principal) as well as opening a new credit card. In all honesty its been preventing me from doing pretty much anything with my finances because all the things I'd want to do would require a credit pull.

Chase has been another bank I was looking at because they have decent interest rates on credit cards and have good rewards and welcome bonuses as well. I'm curious if I walked in to Chase and told them I wanted to move every single account over to them whether or not they would give me a better car loan rate or higher credit limit based on all the accounts I'd be opening. Is that something that typically happens? I'm still fairly new to finance as I am a recent college graduate

What do you think would be the best way to remove myself from Wells Fargo's grasp in this case? I know Charles Schwab does brokerages accounts too so  I was considering moving my Vanguard account over to them as well but Vanguard has been pretty good so far and I don't know if it would be worth it to move everything from them over to Schwab as well if I go that route.

I am now moving out of my parents house and will be renting for 1 year.  My plan was always to rent for 1 year and save up for a house during this time but now I'm questioning whether I should pay off my public student loan debt instead.

Public Loans: $16k, fixed interest rates 3.7&amp;#37;-4.4&amp;#37;, minimum payment $200

I've always only paid the minimum on my public loans as my private student loan interest rates were much higher (6.75&amp;#37;).  During these first 2 years working I've put aside 15&amp;#37; of my income into my 401k.  My thought process is over a 10-15 year period my 401k should return greater than the interest on my public student loans.  Sorry, that was a bit of a tangent.  If needed I can add my budget.

EDIT: Fixed interest rates",finance

personalfinance,Account put wrong address on return,"Topic says it all.  Got my taxes done professionally this year and she used the wrong zip code.

personalfinance,How much should I set aside for taxes for 1099 income that is on top of my w2 income? How much can I put into tax advantaged accounts?,"I'm considering taking a consulting contract for a previous employer, and I need to know how much to set aside for taxes. 

Income setup:

* Married Filing Joint
* No dependents
* W-2 base salary: 170,000
* W-2 bonuses ytd: 14,500
* W-2 bonuses expected before end of year: 20,000
* Wife does not currently make income substantial enough to change any figures (building a business currently not turning a profit, can't pay herself yet). 
* Current pre-tax contributions: 18500/yr 401k + 2550/yr by employer, 2450 HSA + 1k/yr by employer
* 1099 rate: $150/hr
* 1099 expected hours/wk: 20
* 1099 expected contract length: 16wk
* Total expected contract value: $48000

Based on using the withholding calculator on the IRS website, my w-2 is spot on (I'm going to get like 200~ back when I file). I'm expecting to have to pay 2.9% on medicare, but I already capped on social security. My expected marginal rate for my 1099 federal income tax should be 24%. I also am in CO, so there's a flat 4.63%. 

I'm trying to reduce my tax liability by as much as possible. How much of my 1099 income could I put into a SEP IRA? It looks like there's a limit of 25% of net income or $53,000, whichever is smaller. But I'm not sure if contributions to my 401k are going to count against that limit as well. I really would like to put $12000 into a SEP IRA, but I don't want to get dinged at tax time for over-contributing. Additionally, are there any other things I can do to mitigate tax liability? I'm considering starting a 529 for my niece, so I can give a bit more efficiently (she's 2, so it would have a fair bit of time to mature). Otherwise, it looks like I'm going to need to hold 31.5% of my 1099 income for taxes. 

I don't believe we'll be able to deduct more than the standard deduction. I'm anticipating very few costs for this contract, and we rent. Any expenses for wife's business are being written off against the business. 

Does this look right?",finance
personalfinance,"Possible to apply for a lower-rate FHA loan, then pay off 20% of principal instantly to retain lower interest rate without PMI?","Hey all, I’m planning on buying a property with my S/O in the near future. 

I currently own a rental condo, but it’s fully paid off since I bought it in cash and never got a mortgage on it.

 We’re looking at condos in the NJ/NYC area for about 450k-600k since we’re looking to keep our monthly payments at around ~2800/month max. Some areas have 15 year+ tax abatements which allow us to afford a more expensive property. We have no problem getting to 20% down payment, since we have about $150k-$200k in fairly liquid assets. 

I’ve been looking at 30-year mortgage rates and they’re about 4.5% which is pretty high. A friend of mine mentioned that I could possibly opt-in for a FHA loan which usually gives lower rates, however, the monthly payment is higher due to PMI. I’ve read that PMI automatically goes away after you’ve built about 20-22% in equity.

Given my situation is it possible to apply for a FHA loan, and then immediately pay a lot of principal so I have 20-22%+ in equity in the property so I get a lower monthly payment / lower interest rate than a conventional 30 year mortgage?",finance

Considering how much of a difference a tiny change in interest rates can make, I totally understand shopping around for a mortgage, but how many different lenders should I go through preapproval with?

personalfinance,"Help budgeting and switching financial institutions at 26. No debt, but still living ""month to month"".","I [26 y/o] am about to begin the process of moving most of my accounts from a small credit union to USAA. My dad supplements my income while I am in school to help pay for rent until I finish my doctorate (I probably have about 1.5 years left). He has deposit authority, as well as authority to see account balances. I didn't realize he could see account balances until he saw the balance change for a ticket I purchased to visit family on my mom's side. The money I spent was money I had saved from working summers in college, but he told me I shouldn't be making large purchases while I am in school, trying to survive. I am grateful for his financial assistance, but I've decided that I want to move all of my personal accounts to another institution (the credit union we use is located in another state, with few branches), so he has less say in how I spend my money. I am strongly considering USAA, as I use them for insurance, and they have similar interest rates. 

I'm also struggling to save money, even though on paper I make enough to save. I'm always running right up against the edge of my checking account, and sometimes dip a little into my ""Fun Fund"". I think switching to a new bank is as good a time as ever to get my financial life under control by starting a budget and saving for retirement. Most of my peers who have jobs are contributing to a 401k, and many of my fellow students are putting money into IRAs for retirement. I don't have retirement options at work, but I know I could easily make an automatic payment every month.

I currently have no debt, and earn about $36,000 a year after taxes, including my father's contribution to my school stipend. I treat my credit card like a debit card where I always pay back the balance before APR is charged. I own my car, so no car payment. 

Here are my expenses/incomes:

* Stipend: +$2000 /mo
* Assistance from father: +$1000 /mo
* Rent: -$1050 /mo
* Utilities: -$120 /mo (the weather varies wildly, and it is currently &gt; 100F every day)
* Internet, phone, and streaming services: -$100 /mo
* Groceries: -$160 /mo
* Car, renters insurance: -$130 /mo
* Health insurance: covered by school
* Gas: -$100 /mo (I try to take the bus when I can)

I go out with friends a lot, and I burn a lot of money this way. We all work long hours at school, so to blow off steam we frequently eat out, go to bars, or do things with equipment rental fees like kayaking. I try and treat my checking account as a reservoir which gets filled at the beginning of the month, and then any excess goes towards my car emergency fund, vacation fund, or long term/emergency savings. But, I never have more than $300 at the end of the month, and I often dip into my fun fund. That's between $1200 and $1800 a month of fun money spent. I don't think it's wasted, but I can do better, and have fun in less expensive ways. I definitely want to be more responsible, and start building better financial habits now, before I start my career outside school (and hopefully start making a little more money).

I currently have 4 accounts, and a credit card with the credit union, all of which my father can see the balance of and make deposits into.

* Checking: Starts at ~$3,000 every month. Excess at the end of the month is distributed to various savings accounts.
* Car emergency savings: $1000, only to be used for car maintenance, or in case of minor financial emergency. Anything left over at the end of the month in checking goes here, until the account is at $1000.
* ""Fun Fund"" savings: $850, used to save up for personal vacation, or supplement excessive spending from checking. Anything left over from checking and car fund goes here, until the account is at $1000.
* Money Market Emergency Fund: $8000, in case of employment emergency. Anything left over from fun fund goes here. Only to be used for financial emergency. 

* $1000 limit Visa card, no rewards, 0% APR, used as debit card for large purchases (car repair, travel).

My goals and plan:

* Keep my checking and debit card with the credit union. This way my dad can keep contributing if he wants to, and I keep an account with the credit union in case I want to use them for something later down the line.
* Move all other accounts to USAA. Reduce my Fun Fund to $500, so I can still enjoy myself, but save more in emergency fund.
* Apply for new credit card with travel rewards, and pay everything on it. Rewards will help replace my ""Fun Fund"".
* Auto transfer some amount of money to emergency fund at the beginning of every month, to get balance up to $12,000. 
* Start a retirement fund of some sort

**Here are my specific questions:**

* Is it worth it to start an IRA or other retirement account with only ~18 months left in my program? Or should I just save it all in my Money Market, and worry about retirement once I find a salaried job? How much should I be putting aside to max out IRA/retirement in the time I have left?
* Are there risks or charges associated with moving this much money between institutions all at once?
* Is there a better way to set up my emergency funds?
* If I pay for everything on a credit card, what is a good limit to have? I was thinking 2-3x monthly expenses, so $3-5k limit. 
* Does APR on credit card matter if I always pay it back on time? The cards I am considering have 20-30% APR, which seems very high.
* Are credit card miles a safe way to save for vacations?",finance

personalfinance,Personal Loans for Credit Card Debt,"I used to have a job that did not pay very much, and during that time I used my credit card for emergencies. But a lot of those emergencies were buying food for my cats and getting groceries. I was unfortunately using the card because I didn't have the money for those things, which means I did not have the money to pay it back. I know it was irresponsible, but at the time I was sort of stuck. Once I started making a more reasonable salary, I tried to move my debt to a new card with 0&amp;#37; APR for a year to make payments a little easier for a while, but only half the debt moved over. This meant I had to make two payments instead of one, which was significantly harder. I'm trying to find a better solution, and I found a personal loan through Upstart that can help me pay the debt on both cards, so I can make one lower monthly payment with a pretty decent interest rate. 

Is there any reason I should not do this? The idea of taking out another loan gives me pause, but I'm not really sure why. Does it make sense to handle it this way? Or am I going to get myself into more debt?",finance
personalfinance,New Father Looking to Improve Financial State,"Hey PF,  


I've been reading this sub on and off for years now, and  I've been looking for situations like mine for a while. I find posts  that are similar to mine, but I don't always know if all the information  applies to me. I may be in for a job change, so I feel like this is the  perfect time to get some advice, so here it goes.   


I'm 25, I  have an 8 month old son, and an SO. I work in tech, and make a little  less than 80k a year. I have a 401k that I contribute to, that gets a  50&amp;#37; match (up to $4000 a year I think). If I remember correctly, I  contribute about 11&amp;#37; of my check to my 401k. I also contribute $200 a  month to a Roth IRA (Betterment...). I have a high deductible health  plan, and contribute about the equivalent of my deductible each year (I  can look it up if people really need the number). Those are my current  investments, and the decisions were all made before I read the PF side  bar. I also have a $1,200 emergency fund that I'm trying to build  higher, but it's slow.    


As far as debt goes, I pay off my credit  cards in full each month, and I have a car payment. The loan has a  rather high interest rate, that I can't remember off the top of my head  (Once again, I forget exact numbers, but I can look them up). It has  been almost a year since I started that loan, and I'm planning on  refinancing to get a better interest rate.   


We rent an apartment  really far from my work because it's more affordable than living in the  city. I currently pay 1600ish for a 3 bedroom. That same price might get  me a studio near the city. It's a 2 hour commute each way though.   


My SO is a stay at home mom, and I'm not looking to change that. It has been a decision we discussed, and found works the best for us.

Now  that you know my life story, here's my question. How can I make this  work better for me? After reading the side bar a few times, I get the  feeling that I've been putting money in the right places, but not at  ideal times. A major concern of mine, is not understanding how taxes  work. If I start making major changes to my investment accounts, what is  going to happen during tax season? Does not understanding how all this  works set me up for failure? My goal is to retire early, and set my  family up for success. I have no idea if I'm on the right track. Anyway  thanks for taking the time to read. Let me know what you think. If more  details are needed, I'll update the post. (This is a throw away for privacy reasons...)

Bitcoin,How come that states' financial regulators can safely ignore the will of majority of population on Bitcoin?,"The short answer is that financial watch-dogs of all countries are not elected by voters - they are mostly political appointees. Hence, an absence of the real accountability. Here's an example of Kenyan central bank's position on Bitcoin.

Kenya, together with Ghana, Nigeria and South Africa, has became one of the few African nations to embrace Bitcoin. In 2013 this country served as a launched-pod for the first African internationally recognized money transmitter startup, which used Bitcoin to conduct its business. Kenya also hosts one of the largest blockchain-incubators in Africa.

Nevertheless, the Central Bank of Kenya has more than once expressed its hawkish, anti-Bitcoin position in several public memorandums. The most widely cited one is the CBK circular number 14 of December 2015, which, among other preventive measures, introduces the following: Financial Institutions are advised not to open accounts for any person dealing in virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. Failure to comply with this directive will lead to appropriate remedial action from the Central Bank.

In 2017 such aggressive stance of Kenyan financial watch-dogs towards Bitcoin resulted in several persecution cases mounted against local entrepreneurs, which used it to run their companies. At the same time, this domain remains officially unregulated in Kenya. CBK public stance on the legality of Bitcoin is the following: ... virtual currencies such as Bitcoin are not legal tender in Kenya and therefore no protection exists in the event that the platform that exchanges or holds the virtual currency fails or goes out of business. Still, there's a little doubt that in the foreseeable future Kenyan legislators will do their best to make lives of local Bitcoin-enthusiasts much more exiting than it's really necessary.

I currently have $143,000 in federal student loans and making the minimum payments of about $1,800/month.

personalfinance,Lost All My College Grants - What Should I Do?,"Created a new throwaway account, hoping to gain some insight. 

I recently got my new financial aid package from UCLA going into my senior year. In the past three years, I have received 21-22k in grants, which covered all of tuition and most of housing. Now, I no longer have any grants, and was only offered two loans: direct unsubsidized loan for $7,500 and direct parent plus loan for \~$25,800. The reason I suddenly lost all my grants is because they asked me to submit a real estate verification form, where I included my guardian's apartment that he is subleasing which was worth about $875k according to Zillow. This asset made me ineligible for the Cal Grant that had been renewed for me, along with everything else. For the first few years, I was never asked for that form, so I've been getting away with it. Apparently I should've never received any grants the first three years because of that asset, but I did not report it in the FAFSA applications (ignorance), and thus had been unintentionally lying to them. The representative I spoke to suggested I try not to appeal or press further otherwise they might bill me $17k for this oversight. So basically I am ""lucky"" in the sense that I got through three years with a lot of grant, only taking out about $6k in subsidized loans every year. But my family is not well off financially, and I have no choice but to take out a new loan to afford this last year (I can't graduate early due to lack of units).

Tuition and housing is paid in 3 installments: Fall Quarter, Winter Quarter, and Spring Quarter. Last year's quarterly tuition installments was around $5250, so rounding to $5300 (and assuming it doesnt increase to more than that), that's $15,900 in tuition for the year. I will be paying $850/month in rent for an apartment, and there are about 9 months in the academic school year, so that will be $7,650 (not including utilities and the last 3 months of the lease in which I will have to find someone to sublease). That totals to $23,550 for the bare minimum for my final year. I plan on taking the full $7,500 direct unsubsidized loan (5.05&amp;#37; interest rate, repayment period beginning 6months after graduation). I do not want to take the direct parent plus loan which has a 7.6&amp;#37; interest rate and repayment period beginning 60 days after graduation. So with the direct unsubsidized loan, that's 23,550-7,500=$16,050 in loans I need. My friend suggested I take a $20k loan with Wells Fargo or Discover (I have a Wells Fargo bank account) since they offer lower interest rates and 6 month repayment period after graduation. 

This sounds like the best option for me, but I just wanted to ask if this is the way to go about it, and for additional advice.",finance

personalfinance,Is it possible to save money while in college?,"In about a month I will begin classes at a large public institution whose tuition is about $27000/yr as a transfer student. While attending community college, I was ignorant to the fact that I could have easily paid my fees with grants and money I would have made. Resulting from my lack of information at the time (mostly self inflicted, though I was never taught these things in school) I now have $16000 in federal student loan debt that has just began collecting interest (high number because I graduated in 3 instead of 2 years). The good news is that now that I’m enrolled full time and I’ve found one job already and I’m looking for another. I think payment will be deferred until I graduate again or fall below part-time. Anyhow, I’ve tried to reduce my fees by opting out of the insurance program thinking my plan would reach the new school but that’s not the case. I’ll be paying about $550/month in rent plus utilities, maybe $210/month on food, and I’m sure I’ll incur general college student expenses from time-to-time. Also, it’s likely that I’ll have to take out $13000 in additional loans depending on how my expenses pan out over the coming weeks. So with these hurdles considered, is it possible to save money (to pay back lenders most likely) while in school. 

Sorry that this was more of a stream of consciousness rather than a concise grouping of information like you all are used to but any and all help would be appreciated!

We bought our first house in March 2017. We are trying our hardest to get out of debt with snowball and such but are having a hard time doing so due to also trying to update a house (not extravagantly, just making it comfortably liveable. i.e. new room doors, paint, actual thresholds at room doorways). We have 2 credit cards and student loan debt (which we aren't that worried about right now). Our one credit card is about 11k (discover, high interest rate) our other is about 6k through a credit union (low interest rate, low limit to keep us from repeating the discover card balance). Anyways, we feel pretty equipped to pay down the 6k amount pretty easily, but the 11k card has been hovering around there for like 3 years and feels impossible to pay down. We are in a much better place as far as making better choices, spending less, than we were before when it got that bad so we are ready to pay it off and cut up the card, and keep the credit union card after paying it down until we build up our emergency fund to where we want it and use ONLY ONLY ONLY ONLY for actual emergency if needed. so my question is, could we refinance yet, should we for this purpose? I really just want a debt reset (other than our student loans) so we can finally be where we want to be. We have been trying to have a baby so we want to save up for that  (and possibly for fertility treatments) and not be worrying about all that when a baby comes. What is the best course of action?

personalfinance,Looking for advice: Have built up some healthy equity in my home and looking to consolidate some debt.,"Hi! 26M here. I've owned my home for about 5 years, got it through FHA (stellar interest rate @ 3.75%). Roughly $90k in equity. Have $12k in credit card debt across 3 cards and a $20k car loan @ 6.5%. Credit score is an average 700.

I've been running some numbers and it seems obvious that I can save several thousand by getting a HELOC, while also significantly reducing my monthly expenses. The monthly extra would simply go right back into the HELOC balance to reduce interest. 

Largely I am wanting to do this to end the cycle of credit card debt, peace of mind, and a chance to reduce interest over the next 5-10 years. My questions are, what is considered a decent rate for a HELOC? What are the most trustworthy companies in that business? Companies I should avoid? What are some common and perhaps not-so-common pitfalls of getting a HELOC? Should I be considering other options (thought about refinancing to a 15 year loan, but decided against it as it locks up more take-home pay - reducing security and peace of mind - and also loses my current low rate)?

personalfinance,Need ideas and guidance on what to do with 10k in an trading account.,"I'm 34 from Australia, no debts, no loans, but only a modest amount of savings which have been split between a large term deposit, and a small amount of poorly performing Australian shares which I have just finished selling. The interest rates here in Australia are currently very low and I'm only earning 2.5&amp;#37; on my term deposit which is tied up for another 2 years, and given the astronomical increase in property prices in Australia, it seems like I have made a poor investment choice. So I have finally decided to stop procrastinating and find a more effective way to invest the available money I have. I'm late to the game I know, but better late than never. 

I have opened a US trading account though my Australian bank and moved a small amount of my savings (about 10,500USD) across. It's enough that I feel it is significant, but not enough that I would be in any trouble if it were to be lost forever. 

I read the wiki, and despite the advice that LSI is a preferable strategy to DCA I would still like to trickle the money in over the next several months. With that in mind I'm trying to figure out where to start with an investment strategy. Where's a good place to research. What to look at. What a good spread of risk to returns would be. Should I prefer ETFs or spend time researching individual stocks. Etc etc. Basically I need to get started since I'm new to investing in the stock market, previously I had bought up a spread of mining, banking, and hospitality shares on the ASX without really knowing what I was doing and all of which I lost money on when the mineral boom ended here. So I feel like I would prefer lower risk ETF's as opposed to individual stocks but I'm open to anything.

crypto_currency,Distributed Credit Chain,"The modern financial system is characterized by a high degree of decentralization. For example, the provision of financial services in banks, such as the issuance of a loan, depends more on the approval of the application by the bank. In addition, the payment of monthly payments adds a significant interest rate and various fees, depending on the financial institution. Because of this situation, the financial market is largely monopolized, which means raising the interest rate of loans to borrowers, as well as reducing the income for creditors.

The project Distributed Credit Chain is designed to solve the problem. The development team plans to change the financial system through its decentralization. In addition, the platform provides for the placement of various financial services based on block-technology. The implementation of the project will overcome existing problems and provide potential borrowers with access to financial services. Thus, all aspects of the process, from ordinary people and to representatives of small and medium-sized businesses, will benefit.

The Distributed Credit Chain project will allow the introduction of digital banking services in everyday life, thereby increasing the flow of funds through the conduct of payment transactions with e-currency. This is due to the fact that during the implementation of transactions there are no territorial barriers, therefore each user of the system has the opportunity to transfer money regardless of social status, age and other socio-political parameters and standards.

The problem of monopolizing the financial market has been around for a long time, so the issue of increasing confidence in this difficult sphere, as well as the introduction of a digital currency for its widespread use, was only a matter of time. All payment transactions, as well as current questionnaires of potential borrowers and users of the system, are registered in the public register. This technology is completely safe and guarantees the preservation of confidential information, without the possibility of changing it. This decision will allow us to obtain timely reliable information about a potential borrower and quickly make a decision when considering an application for loans or other types of services.

How to solve the problem

Potential borrowers.

People seeking to get a money loan create their own account with the aim of authorizing the provider of the transfer of services and applying for a loan.

Providers of information transfer services.

The implementation of certain data and their storage in the block system.

Service providers of algorithms and calculations.

Obtaining characteristics from information, forming judgments based on politics.

Feedback in relation to credit history.

The generated reliable data on credit history generated on blockages prevent such problems as long-term borrowing and re-borrowing.

Providers of financing.

The supplier does not directly participate in the provision of loans, but provides financing.

Development team

The project team consists of young, ambitious, and most importantly, experienced experts in various fields of knowledge, behind which are a dozen successful projects. The team includes professionals of IT-technologies, marketing and advertising, the crypto-currency market and block and technology and many others.

Features of the project

Demonopolization of the financial market

Due to the globally distributed banking ecosystem, DCC seeks to eliminate monopoly management and return revenue from the provision of financial services to all parties to the process - both to suppliers and users.

Decentralized thinking

Due to the decentralization of thinking, Digital Banking will be able to fundamentally change the model of cooperation related to traditional financial services by building an innovative model of cooperation.

Global Business Framework Improvement

As for the field of entrepreneurship, the introduction of a digital banking system can dramatically change the structure of debt, assets and intermediation. In other words, the tree structure of administration of the traditional financial sphere will become a flat structure of a decentralized bank, thereby increasing business efficiency.

State regulation

As to state control, all payment transactions are registered in the block, respectively, they can not be forged, which will reduce the likelihood of fraudulent actions to almost zero.

CryptoMarkets,Top trends for blockchain technology in 2018,"**Here are a few predictions for 2018 and beyond**

1. **Higher Priced Bitcoin and Other Top Alts: Towards the end of 2018, the entire cryptocurrency space may pass $1 Trillion in total market capitalization. A larger bearish scenario would require the market a couple of years to amalgamate, recover and regain its previous momentum.**

**2. Higher Quality Entrepreneurs and Developers turn to Blockchain:** Still many are not entirely convinced about the real uses of the blockchain, but the scenario is changing. Higher token prices will lead to more blockchain startups making highly competitive offers to developers jostling for talent, in synchronization with likes of Amazon, Google, Apple, and Facebook. Working on tokens and protocols will ultimately reshape the startup landscape in Silicon Valley and the rest of the world.

**3.**

* **Delisting of Many “Useless” Tokens on Exchanges:** The exchanges have three options: a)Delisting “ useless” non-utility tokens not carrying out the functions they claim.b)Registering them with SEC, or C) Close their doors. It goes hand-in-hand with the SEC’s impending regulations. Exchanges are incredibly critical for providing liquidity in markets. In an attempt to comply with the new regulations, exchanged will delist an increasing number of tokens- which lack a clear product or use.  
Companies that sold tokens which are deemed to be securities will likely be fined. US exchanges carrying tokens that are considered to be unregistered securities will find themselves in trouble.
* **Shift from Ethereum to Other Platforms:** More and more companies will continue to realize the impractical and expensive fees of Ethereum based protocols and subsequently will consider alternatives. Undoubtedly, smart contracts on Ethereum’s Turing Complete platform allow much room to express, it comes at very high costs. Moreover, network congestion can make transferring data and execute smart contracts a costly process. Developers will be pushed to consider building on other platforms like Stellar, NEO and other DApp platforms due to scalability problems on Ethereum.
* **The rise of Decentralized Exchanges:** In the longer term, these efforts will energize the emergence of distributed technologies and decentralized exchanges like the Stellar Distributed Exchange and 0x Protocol.
* **Central Banks Embrace Blockchain Technology:** Even in the presence of regulatory scrutiny, more government experimentation with blockchain will continue. Keen on reducing friction and lowering costs. Central banks will experiment with blockchain-based settlements. Consequently, foreign exchange markets and cross-border remittances will become more efficient and cheaper for people to use. They will be the first steps towards a global cashless society.
* **Intensification of China’s Crypto-Prohibition:** China is currently implementing further restrictions on VPN providers to prevent capital outflows into ICOs, exchanges were also shut down in the fall of last year. These efforts will only strengthen decentralization by encouraging P2P networks, diminishing centralized platforms like significant exchanges.
* **Intensified Promoter Scrutiny:** Emerging self-proclaimed “Youtube experts” in the crypto space evangelizing high expectations of ROI for projects have undisclosed special private deals. It creates an environment where influencers can potentially harm Main Street investors with unqualified investment advice or manipulate markets with bogus schemes. It is expected that the Federal Trade Commission and other consumer protection agencies will take action against such promoters.
* **Declining ICO Success Rates:** Even though ICOs may hit their hard caps this will be done with higher prices for Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2018, so the total token raise will be much less when compared to past ICOs. There will be many ICOs that will fail to hit hard caps or critical product milestones. It is expected that SEC will introduce concrete guidelines and regulations in 2018. To protect the market from fraud and market manipulation, ICO’c will be subjected to the SEC’s guidelines as they have no product The few major ICOs that do occur will likely take the shape of long-awaited reverse-ICOs (like Telegram, [Overstock](https://overstock.com/), Kodak, etc.) and attract the majority of capital in the pre-sale. With this trend, we will also see mainstream investor enthusiasm die down significantly.
* **Taxes and Anti-Money Laundering Laws Will Be a Bigger Issue than Security Laws**: Accumulated tax liabilities will apply to ICOs past, present, and future and all US entities in the space. The obstacle is not the SEC; it’s the IRS and FinCEN. A few years ago the IRS deemed some cryptocurrencies to be property, which means every time crypto is used for sale or exchange it’s potentially a taxable event.

The IRS has launched a John-Doe summons of Coinbase so now every transaction of $20,000 or more has to be reported.

FinCEN recently said that companies selling tokens are money transmitters and must comply with relevant KYC/AML laws. FinCEN had fined Ripple years ago for operating an unlicensed money services business.  
Several recent token projects have failed to hit their sales or fundraising goals. This year paves the for great diligence in the space – from both community self-governance and regulators. The market will continue to shift to altcoins. The trends will continue to grow when the SEC, IRS, FinCEN, and FTC come with a strict handle. The market will continue to shift to altcoins",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,My car dealer didn’t add my old car’s trade in value to my finance pricinple,"I bought/financed a used car about a month ago. I made a 4K downpayment the day when I purchased the vehicle, but because I wasn’t planning on buying the car that day I didn’t bring in my old car for trade-in. My dealer gave me 6k for my old car without taking a look at it because I provided my old car’s insurance with VIN info. However when they pulled my credit and got me a finance, the agreement loan amount didn’t include the 6k trade-in value (which was understandable because I didn’t bring my car in yet). I brought my car in two days later and signed a bunch of paperwork, and on the spot I made sure to ask the finance guy that this 6k is going into my principle that day. He said yes. However I didn’t get any form or copy of confirmation, because the dealer guy said I would receive a packet in the mail. I received my finance packet from the bank yesterday and the 6k was not applied to the principle, and it’s been a month since I brought my car in when they were supposed to do so. I will be contacting the dealership today to see how they’ve made this mistake on their side, but was wondering how should I investigate the process and the extra interest that has already been added to my principle for the past month because of the extra 6k. Right now I do not have any form of proof that I traded in my car for 6k, but the dealer has my signed title for transfer for my old car. 

Any help/suggestion is appreciated. Thank you!


UPDATE: So the finance department investigated and apparently, they simply FORGOT ABOUT MY TRADE IN VEHICLE... The manager offed me a $6k check and will arrive in mail in 7-10 days (past my first payment due date). I would definitely like to get compensated since this is a complete mistake on their side. Besides mentioning that I paid extra for Sales Tax and interest, is there anything else I can use as a leverage to negotiate? Appreciate all of your help and thank you!",finance

1. The question is do I consolidate and try to get an interest rate of 3&amp;#37; with a company like Sofi (seems to be the most popular)? 
2. If I do that and lock into a payment of say $1700/month will I still be able to make additional payments to the principle balance like I am currently? 
3. Lastly, is there any benefit to trying to target a few more high interest loans before consolidating to potentially get a lower rate?

gaming,Looking for PC or Console games that aren't FPS/isometric/over the shoulder/whatever,"Here's the thing. I get motion sick. I can make myself motion sick just turning around in my kitchen. I bought a Wii years ago and made it around the Mario Kart track twice before I almost barfed on my living room floor. I've tried to play Warcraft, Call of Duty, Fallout 4, Overwatch, Witcher and GuildWars and can't do it because of the way the toons move. What I can play is Starcraft or Path of Exile or Diablo. And while that's fun, I'd love it if I could find a new game. 

When I ask these questions of my gamer pals and I say ""I can't play a first person shooter"", they say ""It's not FPS, it's 3/4 isometric view"" or some stupid thing. I can't make people understand I don't care if I'm looking out of his eyes or sitting on his shoulder, I'm still viewing the game as if I'm in a VR environment and that doesn't work for me.

The only way I can explain this is, if I make the character spin around in circles, I need the background to NOT MOVE. In Diablo 3 I can sit there all day with my toon running in a circle and the buildings don't move. In Path of Exile I can do the same thing. But in the rest of those games, when I make the character turn, the whole background swings around.

So I'm hoping someone here might know of some games where the background doesn't move. Either PC or XBOX is fine. 

Thanks!

personalfinance,Mortgage vs Income percentage - Tell me we're crazy!,"Hi everyone!

My wife and I are looking to make a move and found a house in our ideal location... but it's on the very top end of our budget.  Making this move would raise our monthly expenses, however, in selling our current house we'd have enough equity to pay off our student loans in one fell swoop.  We live in the Dallas/Ft Worth area and the housing prices keep skyrocketing.  We also currently live in an area of town where there are no kids playing on the street, no community involvement, just all around dead when it comes to culture and neighborhood feel.  We feel isolated and want to give our kids the same community and neighborly friendship we grew up with. This is THE BIG reason why we're looking to move, even though the house we're in now is amazing.

Some quick background - We're married with two kids.  Combined income of $113k.  Student Loan debt of $30k.  Current house payment is $2100/mth.  Only other debt, other than mortgage, is car (but interest is so low I'm not worried about it)

Pros to moving - This home is within walking distance of elementary, jr high and high school.  We'd be surrounded by all of our friends that we trust.  Kids would be in close proximity to friends.  The house we're considering was basically gutted and completely redone - pier &amp; beam foundation, new floors, new kitchen, new bathrooms, new HVAC, new insulation, new drywall, new patio, new sprinkler system (this is very rare in this area as most houses we look at are crap or are $35k cheaper than this one but still need new bathrooms and kitchens).  For the mortgage itself, I can get no PMI with 10&amp;#37; down (which is what we'd do).

Cons to moving - The house we're considering is $370k, which would put our payment at around $2450/mth, or 34&amp;#37; of our take-home income.  It's price is above what we ever considered in the past.

One of my biggest fears as a husband and father is putting my family in a situation where we're stuck in a mortgage we can't afford.  I know the tried &amp; true approach is 28&amp;#37; of income, but with the way property values are rising in our city, and interest rates rising, we're considering rolling the dice and going after this place.  We are rationalizing it b/c it's basically a new house in a 65yr old shell (and pier &amp; beam, no less).

So am I crazy for considering this or should I chill out and go for it?  I mean, we can pay off our student loan debt from selling our house!  That alone is what is making me think it's worth it.  If there's more info needed to form an opinion let me know in the comments and I'll provide.  Thank you.",finance
personalfinance,I'm hedging my PSLF bets by paying the interest on my loans. Should I be investing that instead?,"Apologies for another in the long line of PSLF posts that crop up here, but I didn't see one that fit my situation exactly. I'm wondering if it makes sense to take some money I have been voluntarily over-paying towards my PDLF-qualified loans and

I have quite of lot of debt from law school, about $250,000, with an average interest rate of 6.64&amp;#37;. I participate in PSLF and expect to work for qualifying employers for the full 10-year period (probably most of my career, TBH). I work at a nonprofit and make $90,000 a year (and my salary is likely to go up 5-8&amp;#37; each year for at least a few years).

I'm married, but I file taxes separately from my wife to keep my payments reasonable. My payment under IBR is  ~~$260~~ $650 per month, but my wife makes good money and can cover much of out living expenses so I decided to hedge my bets by paying an extra $1,000 per month to cover the interest on the loans. However, now I'm wondering if it would make sense to take that $1,000 and invest it in something (relatively) safe like a Vanguard index fund.

I know there is risk to investing, and paying loans off can be considered a guaranteed return, but since I'm comparing paying the interest versus investing that money while I'm participating in PSLF, I'm really comparing to options for hedging my bets. And if I invest, I could benefit from both PSLF and investing. Am I missing something?

Edit: Yes, as people have pointed out, $260 is awfully low for someone making $90,000, although that is my current monthly payment. I checked my latest re-certification paperwork and it will go up to $650 — which is probably still low because I wasn't making $90,000 last year. Apologies for not double checking that before posting.

Also, some people are worried about over-paying meaning I'm making fewer payments; I did call to specifically make sure they didn't apply the over payment to future months, so I'm still getting credit for a payment each month (although the woman on the phone was a little surprised at my request).",finance
XRP,Adopting XRP,"Hey guys. Just wanted to hear your thoughts and have a discussion on the following. Now I'm not an economist or any professional of the sort. But I think that there needs to be regulation on coins and reduction of volatility. For example lets say XRP is more accepted and I'm paying for a Coca Cola drink. I won't want to pay 10 xrp today and then 20 xrp tomorrow. There has to be some control of how the value of the currency behaves. 

Now everyone seems to think that a private company controls XRP. Even though it does not, people have a problem with it. However for years, the Federal Reserve has been controlling the USD and other Central Banks have been doing the same with their currency. There are reasons why countries inflate or deflate their currency. Now since XRP is not being made the way the dollar is printed, based on the demand and supply, there has to be proper valuation of XRP.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,26 Yr Old NYC-er Trying to See If I'm Making Smart Decisions,"Hey all, hopefully someone who knows way more than me can let me know if anything looks glaringly wrong. I've read the 18-25 and 25-35 guides here but a lot of the language is still kinda lost on me. I believe I'm at the step to simply ""increase my emergency fund to 3-6 months""

So here's what I'm working with per month:

* Making ~$3.5k after tax
* $1,430 Rent
* $80 Therapy
* $155 Utilities + Internet
* $300 to School Loan (will talk more about below)
* $20 Gym
* $10 Moviepass
* $10 Patreon

(no car payments and rarely spend any money for metro, I bike everywhere)

* Putting 3% into a 401(k) with my job matching that
* $4.1k in savings
* $1k in checking, at the moment
* I have a Chase Sapphire card which I purchase most things on and pay off the same week to build credit. Current balance is $0. 

I use a monthly budget sheet to keep track of purchases, which, after all those expenses, leaves me with $1510 for groceries and everything else. I work to pretty much never spend more than that per month.

Still have $19k left to pay on school loan. It's paid into a few uni loans consisting of $1.5k-$3.7k with different fixed interest rates 3.1-6.5%.

Sometimes my take home can be from ~$200 - ~$1000 more a month depending on if I work freelance gigs on the side. I make sure to throw a third of what I earn on them into savings for taxes at the end of the year.

Last thing I have is an investment account on the Acorns app. One of those round up purchase things. I often forget about it, but it puts about $50-$70 away a month. I've had it for two years and it has about $2.2k in it now.

In my thinking, my smartest next steps are to pay down my college debt more aggressively and put more away for emergency funds. Possibly moving to a cheaper city so I'm not throwing away so much money on rent and other NYC expenses. Tossing the idea around of going full-time freelance instead of just weekends here and there, thinking I may be able to make more money even after the crazy self-employment taxes.

So as a fresh 26-yr-old entering more serious adulthood... does this look alright? Am I doing anything stupidly wrong? Thank you so much to anyone who actually gets through this.

**TL;DR** I'm 26, relatively financially stable in my mind but want to know what are some more informed next steps I should be taking. Only debt I have is $19k in school loans.",finance

I do work a lot of overtime and yearly make roughly around 50k. I have not received a raise in around 3 years. 

Recently my work has been short staffed and they are offering me a bonus on top of my hourly rate to come in my off days. Typically these bonuses are: $50-$75 if I pull a 12 hour shift on my off days, or $100-$125 if I pick up an extra 24 hour shift. 

The thing is; these bonuses are taxed, and are separate from my base rate. I hope I’m explaining this well enough, but to put it simply, I make “$3,240 a month and can have hundreds of dollars of extra money, but that is taxed just as much as my hourly rate is”.

* Assuming that this goes on a card with a 12% interest rate (so 1%/month), is the interest compounded monthly, or daily? Or is this something which differs depending on what card I use? Obviously it's a small difference, but hey, figure it's better to know and be able to plan around it.

btc,"The ""POLONIEX"" exchange steals the money of its customers. ""POLONIEX"" answer before the law !","My name is Fed\*tov Petr Ale\*\*ndrovich. I am writing this message because there was a

theft of my funds from my ""Polonix"" exchange account in the amount equivalent to 6000 USD.

16.06.18 when I tried to log in with my ""Polonix"" account, I found that two factor

authentication (2FA) was enabled. I did not make this inclusion, because of this I lost access

to my account. I created a ticket for this problem, ""Polonix"" answered technical support

only on the third day. The essence of their answer was that I need to provide a photo to

confirm my identity.

 After uploading the photo, the two-factor authentication was disabled, I got access to my

account and found out that all my funds were transferred to unknown wallets.

 It all happened, an unknown person on 16.06.18 logged in to my account from the IP address

64.64.121.70 and transferred funds with three transfers, while messages about logging into

my account on my email DID NOT COME. Also, there were no messages on my e-mail to confirm

the transfer of funds.

 Very important is the fact that for 18 days (I have been a client of the Polonix exchange

for more than a year) before this event, the Polonix exchange blocked my account and the

requirement for unlocking was to complete full authentication of the person,

after which it became possible to transfer more than the equivalent of 2000 USD per day.

About what I have a saved correspondence.

 During these events, I met several people. They also stole money on the Polonix exchange.

These four people, one of them has dual citizenship, one of

which is US citizenship. Curiously, three of them had 2FA enabled, but this did not help

save their money, they also lost access to their account, and their 2FA code did not fit.

 We came to an unambiguous conclusion during the discussion. Theft of funds occurs with the

help of employees of the Polonix Exchange, or them. This is happy with direct and censual

evidence.

1. With 2FA disabled, you can not log into your account from a new IP address without

 getting one-time authentication code.

2)My email ([pfedotovtns@gmal.com](mailto:pfedotovtns@gmal.com)) is protected by 2FA. Physical access to devices registered

 in google has only me. In the list of devices that have access to my google account in the

 last 28 days, there are no other except those that I used.

3)You must confirm by e-mail to transfer funds.

4)At the time of the theft, Polonix blocks the account. For those who have 2FA disabled,

 it turned on, and those who have 2FA enabled the code does not fit.

5)In my case, to access your account, I used a complicated eight-digit password that digested

 the numbers and Latin characters of the large and small register. It was not recorded anywhere,

 only I knew it and was used only for the Polonix account.

We believe the Polonix exchange is guilty of stealing its customer's funds or reporting critical

vulnerability to a group of hackers. We consider it advisable to declare collectively in

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission and FBI on behalf of a US citizen.",cryptocurrency

From cosmetics alone his front bumper is dislodged and has a dent in the side but my driver door no longer closes flush with the rest of the door (still locks and stuff) and outside of the obvious dents the left driver mirror popped out. Definitely probably more underlying damage to both cars in terms of alignment and what not that will be uncovered through a legit inspection.

Anyway, we got on the shoulder, the guy said follow me to the exit and I did and we discussed it there. No police were called. tbh there's more damage to my car than his. I guess I got really flustered and panicky and was willing to give him literally whatever info he needed....he was in a rush supposedly and I gave him my insurance and license info and phone but I only got his license info and phone. He said he'd rather not go through insurance because it would probably hurt me more and he'd take it to a mechanic and we agreed to meet tomorrow morning to discuss it because this isn't my car it's my dad's and im under his insurance yadda yadda. So I'm typing this all out and realize all my fuck ups of not getting his insurance (even though he said he'd let me take a pic but idk why I didn't) and all this important obvious stuff which is just unbelievable considering I've followed this sub for like 4 years and failed to follow every textbook rule about what to do in an accident and now I'm just panicking because I can finally sit and think now.

I said I'd have to discuss it with my dad and we'd meet about it. We've already started filing a claim and such.

I figured that 1) he'd show up because we both agreed it's my fault and he wants the car repaired. 2) if he did show up and for whatever reason DIDN'T want to go through insurance that would be because he had none, right? I mean this would all work out in HIS favor if we went through insurance right? Is there any reason why he wouldn't show up or why he wouldn't want to go through insurance? Like I know I effed this up in like every way possible and I literally want to die right now so now I'm running through scenarios by default.

If he doesn't show up...does that affect our insurance and stuff at all? Idk how any of this shit works and I'm learning it the hard way.

In Ohio. He's driving through the state but lives in OK.

Edit: after some database searching I found out he has a suspended license and was an excluded driver on his wife's insurance. Wanted me to claim through our insurance and lie by saying that his wife was driving. we told him if he wants to get his car fixed for the $600 in damages he can through our insurance and we'd file our own police report as well with his info on it. meh. bs from both sides",finance
personalfinance,"Got a scholarship to go to grad school in Lisbon, but apparently can't defer my US undergrad loans because the university doesn't participate in the Federal Student Loan Program. What should I do?","I have just about $18k in loans from my undergraduate degree (about $4k unsubsidized at 6.5%, the rest subsidized between 3.15-5.35%).  When I wrote to my loan servicer about getting a ""going back to school"" deferment, I was surprised to learn that most schools outside the US aren't eligible. (If I understand correctly, they have to apply to participate in the Federal Student Loan Program and be approved by the Department of Education. The University of Lisbon do not seem to have done this.)

I'll be going to school full-time on a scholarship with a small living stipend, and even if I can find part-time work, I don't expect to have income that will allow me to continue to make my current $340 monthly payments (if at all). My wife is an EU citizen who will be moving to Lisbon to look for entry-level work, but we can't count on her income just yet beyond supporting herself. We've both been living off my ~$35k income since getting married a year ago.

Originally, I was hoping to save up and pay off the higher-interest unsubsidized loans before school starts in the fall, figuring that the deferment would freeze the interest on my subsidized loans and I'd graduate no worse off than when I started. 

Since that seems to be a no-go, I figure my options are:

* Send in a discretionary forbearance request and let interest continue to accrue while I study.
* Try to switch to an extended or income-based repayment plan to lower my payments as much as possible, pay what I can, and backslide a tiny bit less.

I should also note that I don't expect much of a pay bump after graduating. I've been doing pretty dull work as a technical writer in a position without much room for growth, and applied to this program in hopes of transitioning into a more fulfilling career path that's more in line with my interests and background (forestry). So I was thrilled to get the scholarship, but now in a bit of a pickle as to the best way to approach the not-eligible-for-deferment situation.

personalfinance,Debt help - what to tackle first? Is this the right approach?,"Hey guys,  
I've gotten a bit over my head.  I'm single and make about $2200 bi-weekly after taxes.  However, i'm struggling to save and to pay down my debts.  My car note is approximately $1100/month and rent costs me about $1300.  Car insurance, phone, student loans, credit cards, food, gas etc use up the vast majority of the rest of that money each month.  


I have 3 credit cards.  
CC-A has a balance of $12,400 with a 24.65&amp;#37; variable APR  
CC-B has a balance of $1500 with a 25.40&amp;#37; variable APR  
CC-C has a balance of $6000 with an 11.5&amp;#37; variable APR  


I also have a loan that I took in June of 2016 with a 60 month term at a 17.61&amp;#37; rate that has a remaining balance of $10,500.  


Within the next 30 days, I plan on taking a loan out of my 401k of approximately $18,000.  The interest rate for that will only be 4&amp;#37;.  It will cost me about $350/month to pay back over a term of 54+ months.  I currently pay $350/month towards just CC-A.  


I just wanted to get some suggestions/feedback on how I should divvy up that loan towards repayment of the aforementioned debts.  


Currently, my credit is decent, but the ONLY thing that is keeping my credit from being great is my percentage of usage which is about 90&amp;#37;.  I am hoping that I can get the score up based on using this 401k loan to drop my debts, and then look into refinancing my car and putting the extra money each month that I have that is no longer going towards interest payments on those debts towards paying down those debts.  


I also think that I can approach my credit union that i've been with for about 15 years to see about further assistance with debt consolidation once i've gotten my credit score higher based on what I plan on doing above.

personalfinance,Student Loan Advice NEEDED,"Hello, I'm not quite sure where to even begin or how to ask what I need to ask. But basically: I am a college dropout with 1 semester of college under my belt that involved having terrible grades in all but 2 of my classes. I won't go into personal detail but the gist is that I was away from home for the first time and did not handle that freedom responsibly.

Fast forward 2 1/2 years: I am living back at home and am finally ready to man up and make the sacrifices necessary to go back to school and make my future one worth living. I received federal loans in the amount of about $8,000 my first year. Last summer, I paid into a forgiveness program for about 12&amp;#37; of that debt in order to become eligible for federal aid once again.

But frankly, I have no idea where to start with student loans. I have terrible credit and almost nothing to show for my one semester in school. Where do I even look for loans? Regardless of interest at this point I have no choice but to take what i can get. I applied and received my first loans thru my high school's college aid counseling program so I had pretty much nothing to do with the process and don't remember any of what I had to do back then.

ANY advice even if it's to tell me I'm screwed would be appreciated I really don't want to feel like a POS anymore living at home with no real future in sight. Thank you in advance.",finance
personalfinance,"Is it wise to take a loan, pay revolving debt, raise the score, then take another, lower interest loan to pay the high-interest one off?","I just took out a personal loan of about $9k at 33% APR to pay a few pressing medical items I have. This is really dumb since I just found I can probably get a much lower interest rate through my credit union. While I was applying, I thought maybe I could grab some extra, pay off a lot of my revolving CC) debt, then take a new loan from the credit union to consolidate my high-interest debt and reduce APR once my score reflects the new utilization rate here in a month or two.

I have $5,400 in CC debt (about 14% APR)  that takes me pretty high for utilization. My score right now is about 690, which would be closer to 730 if I reduce my revolving debt to &lt;10%. I know I'll get two hard checks that way, but I really don't have many on my credit. About 3 months ago I asked my Credit Union to increase the limit on my card, which they did to the max for that card ($5k). I used that to move other, higher interest debt over.

If it helps, I am 31, have a variable income of between $140k and $200k/anum, depending on the month/season/year, and have a total debt portfolio of about $98k, $63k of which is student and $20ish is my two vehicles (both used; one for Summer and one for Winter). The rest is on one other CC and a personal line of credit. All of these are double digit interest.

personalfinance,Roth vs pretax retirement planning,"Hello,  
I recently posted this thread at Bogleheads but wanted to get some input from this site as well.

I am new to the Boglehead's concept and recently finished reading The Bogleheads' Guide to Retirement Planning. I have read all the threads I could find on Roth 401 vs Traditional, as well as the Wiki topic at that site. I am in my mid-30s and currently have \~40,000 in a 457, \~13,000 in a Roth 401k, and a 21,000/yr pension starting at age 55. I no longer contribute to the 457 as it is from my previous gov job, and my 401k is my new investment vehicle. I make about 105,000 base, and will likely make around 130-140 with overtime this year. Before June 2017, I made about 60/year, so I have basically doubled my salary, which is why I am unsure about which way to go with my investment vehicle. I have researched and am happy with my choice of investment funds, but when I first had the significant salary increase I read Dave Ramsey who is very high on the Roth 401. (No I am not using his mutual fund advice). Now after reading more, I am much less sure of the Roth 401, and while there is a lot of information on Roth vs Traditional 401, including the Wiki and threads on Bogleheads, none of it has made my situation very clear to me. The only debt I have at this time is a mortgage, which we pay 500 extra in principle monthly. I am putting 15&amp;#37; of my base salary (\~105,000) in the Roth 401. I am also using a 529. I have a previous HSA but my current employer does not offer one. Regarding taxes, I will likely have more than the standard deduction for 2018, probably 25-28k. I have been trying for weeks to figure out if the traditional or Roth 401 would be a better choice for my situation, but am still very unsure. I would prefer not to do both as some recommend, but am open to it if that is the consensus.   


Emergency funds: 3 months  
Debt: Mortgage 3.99&amp;#37;, $500 in extra principal monthly. Hope for a 15-20yr payoff.  
Tax Filing Status: Married Filing Jointly  
Tax Rate: I believe 22&amp;#37; Federal, 0&amp;#37; State.  
State of Residence: TN  
Age: 36 in August  
Desired Asset allocation: Happy with my investment funds  


Current retirement assets  
Roth 401k \~13k  
15&amp;#37; of base salary (RFKTX) (.42)   
Company match? 1.5&amp;#37;

Pension - 21,800/yr at age 55.

This time, circumstances are different.

Up front:

Supercapital-class ships in Eve Online are the largest and most powerful ships in Eve, taking years of skill training and tens or hundreds of billions of isk (the in game currency of Eve Online) - equivalent to hundreds or thousands of dollars.

Titans - the largest of these ships - are combat behemoths, designed to siege structures and other capital ships.  The loss of just one remains noteworthy, with the single largest battle in Eve History -[ B-R](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-25944837) \- seeing over 150 on the field, and 75 destroyed.

These ships take months to build and the loss of a fleet would, in addition to the ship loss, leave ones home region vulnerable to invasion.

Roughly 4 years later and after a galactic arms race, superpower coalitions in Eve have each amassed hundreds of Titans and thousand of Supercarriers.

The deployment of Supercapitals around Eve constitutes the galactic balance of power.

The action will commence at 9:30pm EST / 1:30am GMT on 11 July.

**YOUR GALACTIC PRIMER**

*The Southern Front*

Since January, the landscape of Eve has shifted dramatically with the total defeat and eviction of a Russian coalition known as the Drone Region Federation - once the largest territory holder in the game - from its historic home in the East.  DRF suffered very heavy losses during its eviction.

Remnants of the DRF were offered a temporary home by Southern based regional power Legacy Coalition, lead by Test Alliance Please Ignore, affectionately known as TAPI.

With momentum and morale on their side, the coalition responsible for the defeat of DRF - comprising such alliances as Triumvirate, Skill Urself, Hard Knocks and rising power Fraternity (China based), announced a full scale invasion of the south and set their aim on Test Alliance Please Ignore.

Dramatically, last week Pandemic Legion - one of Eve's most storied and powerful Alliances - joined the invasion  against Test Alliance and, critically, moved its Supercapital Fleet - one of the largest in the game - across the Galaxy into range of Test.

*The Northern Front*

For the last year, guerrilla forces belonging to the Imperium - lead by Goonswarm Federation - have waged a disruption campaign against Northern based alliance Guardians of the Galaxy (GOTG) , who are aligned with the larger supercoalition of Pandemic Legion(PL) and Northern Coalition (NC.)

In the last month, as this disruption campaign threatened to cripple GOTG, NC. moved its own Supercapital fleet closer to GOTG to prop up their control of the region.

**World War Eve**

Pandemic Legions deployment of its Supercapitals  upset the tenuous balance of power in the North  and the Imperium saw an opportunity to take the fight to its ancestral enemies in the Northern Coalition.

Two days ago, the Imperium began deploying its own Supercapital fleets North and is now poised to begin its own full scale invasion of GOTG/NC. space.

**D-Day**

Tonight, The Imperium anchored a Keepstar Citadel - the largest player deployable structure in Eve - on the very edge of GOTG space.  This Keepstar would allow the safe staging of its Supercapital fleet and allow The Imperium to project power into the North.

Tomorrow, after a 24 hour anchoring period, the Keepstar will become vulnerable to attack for a short period before coming fully online.  This is its most vulnerable time.

An incredible array of forces have already signaled their intent to attack - or defend - this Anchoring Keepstar.

personalfinance,Consolidation Loan,"I am going to be graduating from college this coming spring which means the student loan payments will be soon to follow. My parents’ income was too high for me to receive federal loans large enough to cover my tuition costs so I had to take private loans out through Discover as well.

personalfinance,10k to put toward student loans,"Hi there!

(Using a throwaway, because personal info)

I recently received $13k and decided to put $3k into my EF. So I have $10,000 to allocate toward my graduate student loans (currently on an IBR plan), which have been on deferment for the past 4 years while in school &amp; completing a fellowship. I’d like some advice on how best to approach it:

Loan A, Federal Direct Unsub, 5.59%: 
Original Loan Amount - $33,000
Capitalized Interest - $5,199.82
Principal Balance - $38,199.82

Loan B, Federal Direct Unsub, 6.59%:
Original Loan Amount - $14,000
Capitalized Interest - $2,451.55
Principal Balance - $16,451.55

Total student loan interest: $7,652.37
Total principal balance: $54,699.85

I’m not behind on any payments, so the website says they’ll allocate to interest first, then principal. I can choose which loan to pay on and the amount. 

My first thought was to pay off all of the interest, then put the remaining to Loan B (smaller one + higher interest rate). Paying off the interest would have some tax benefits. 

But my second thought was how nice it would be to take Loan B from $16k to 6k. I could absolutely have that one and it’s higher interest rate gone in the next year.

Any advice on how to allocate my 10k to my loans?",finance

I made a post recently about the number of allowances I should claim both federally and for the state of michigan.

The tl;dr is, I am a 17 year old dependent, working as a summer intern, and currently claim 1 allowance for both.

I make $10.50 / hour, and work between 30-40 hours / week; I will not make more than the standard deduction, so I believe I should receive most or all of the federal taxes I'm paying back. That being said, putting 1 allowance on my W4 should be fine, right?

I was told in my last post that for putting 1 allowance, I may owe taxes to the state of michigan. Is there some way I could know whether I would or not? My estimated net pay is \~$3000.

personalfinance,Buying a House in a High Tax Area,"Good people of Reddit, we are looking at moving on from our Condo and into a house.  We live in Chicago, and the most optimum area to live for our employment is in Northern Cook / Lake County.  The big problem is that all the houses we look at have high property tax.  We're looking at 400 - 500k properties, and the taxes are ending up at 7000  - 15000 per year.  

The big question is how do people afford to live in these areas?  What about deducting these taxes on your income tax and state income tax return?  Our combined income is 180 - 200k.    After refunds how much property tax are you really paying?  We have no kids but might be in a few years.  

The other question is when selling your old property, are you required to put in all of your profit into your new home?  I've heard there is a tax benefit in doing that?  Currently owe about 180k on my condo, and is valued at 375k, so this would easily cover a 20&amp;#37; downpayment.  If we do put in a large downpayment is there a likely-hood of better interest rates from the bank?

personalfinance,"ADVICE: Trying to open a credit card to build credit. Matriculating graduate student, with stipend ""income.""","Hello all, 
I am reaching out to seek advice on my latest endeavor: opening a credit card! Up until this point, I have used a debit card and a credit card in my parent's name. I would like to have my own separate credit card (preferably a controlled one) so I can start building my credit score.

Info about me:
I am 21. I just finished my undergraduate career, and am embarking on a 6-year PhD program in the fall.
I am NOT working this summer, and have never worked full time (a lot of part time gigs). 
In graduate school, I will be receiving a stipend to work as a research / teaching assistant.

Here is my issue...
I went to a local credit union yesterday and was denied from opening a controlled credit card because I am a student and have no source of income. My stipend will be paid to me starting September 30, 2018, but until then, I have no real income.
My parents refuse to be a part of opening the card in case it affects their score.
The card I nearly opened had a 14+% interest rate, which surprised me but I suppose all have high rates.

So, in summation, I'm a student and would appreciate any advice / recommended companies or programs for my desire to build credit. Please also let me know if I'm going to likely get denied each time because I have no income.

personalfinance,[US-KY]Looking for housing loan options with minimal credit requirements and minimal needed in savings.,"Long detailed post below, basically looking for a house:

Hello, I am 32 year old male, married, father of two children, who also shares a rented home with my mother-in-law. Currently I am the only person employed, I make decent wages for my area (about 45K annual) but have been unable to really do much in the way of savings due to the costs of supporting my family. My mother-in-law was employed up until recently and is looking for another job, I don't really have to pay her way and she is likely a permanent fixture in our home for awhile. My wife is a stay-at-home mom because my son is special needs and it just works better all-around to have her at home than have to go through the expenses and problems of child-care.

I do not have any credit, I opened a small credit card in my name to build credit at the start of last year but have used it sparingly. I have no debt beyond what is on the credit card which I pay off monthly. I haven't ran my credit in awhile (I try not to do this very often) but if I had to guess my score would be upper 500 low 600 range. I have never previously owned a home or had any sort of personal or vehicle loans (neither has my wife).

My Mother-in-law has filed for short term disability for two years she was unable to work due to spinal injuries, we don't know yet if she will be approved (should find out by the end of the month) but if she is that will be about 30K paid retroactively, and she's willing to help us.

I am currently renting and my current lease will expire at the start of May next year, at which point we do not wish to renew. My hope is that I can complete the process for applying for a home loan in time that I can find and close on a house before my lease expires next year.

I attended a home-buyer's seminar held at my credit union (I've been a member for about 5-6 years) and they gave a lot of info on the costs involved in home buying and hidden costs but it all felt heavily slanted towards not using government sponsored loans and going for bank loans instead. I have been able to improve my income a lot over the past few years but getting a savings account up to 5 figures is not something I can see happening within the foreseeable future (difficulty keeping it at 4 figures). While I do understand the smart and advisable path is to have significant savings before looking for home buying, what I have noted here is that a lot of people don't even really get started being able to make considerable head-way on their savings until after they already own a home. Doing quick math in my head the type of house I am looking for would save me hundreds of dollars per month on mortgage + escrow vs. what I currently pay in rent. I've decided that interest rates be damned, I don't want to wait ten years to get into a house, by then I could have already paid off whatever difference in interest there might be!

I'm aware of things like first-time homeowners loans and I heard about something called a Rural Loan (I plan on buying in a rural area). I know the loan covers *most* of the costs involved that the seller doesn't but I think I still need to pay for lawyer fees home inspection fees.

I will be able to contribute all of my tax return next year (about 3K if similar to this year) towards finding a new place to live, as well as my yearly bonus in May (about 3K as well) but both those fall too late to really be useful for the loan application process if I want to find something before May, I really need to begin this year but I have no way of putting away anything significant in savings (I *might* be able to put back like 1K by the end of the year). My Mother-in-Law may be able to provide something significant but that's all up in the air and not certain.

I've been *told* I can get home loans without much in the way of credit as long as I have stable work history and no debt without any down payment or savings but I don't know how valid this info is, so I am trying to find out what types of loans are available to me, and the method I go about getting more info and starting the whole process. I am very green to all of this and while I feel there's likely to be an option available to me I don't have the slightest clue where to start.

Feel free to ask questions. Just to clarify, even though my MIL will be living with us and may be providing significant resource if she has it available, I will be the only person applying for the loan and she won't be involved in the process.",finance
personalfinance,Should I go back to school?,"I don’t know if this is the right place for me to ask this question, but here’s my situation:

I work in Environmental Health and Safety and love my chosen field, but I didn’t study for it. I graduated with my undergrad in 2012 in Business and finished my MBA in 2017. I’ve been doing this in progressive roles for 6 years now. The one thing I do have in my field is that I’m a CSP, which is a pretty big deal in the industry. My parents never contributed to my education so I’ve got federal student loans that are now at $65k. My only other major debt is my house (currently owe $83k, the home is currently worth $130k according to Zillow and Redfin). I’m married with a stay at home wife and two young children, have $12k in a 401k I contribute 6% of my income to. 

Job info: I’m hourly, make about $22 an hour and work about 45 hours a week. I like my job just fine, good benefits and they match 55% of my 401k up to 6%. Been here a little over a year.  They also have tuition reimbursement for up to $4500 a year with a commitment to stay for one year after you finish your degree. 

I found a masters program for occupational health and safety that is well respected in the industry and is fairly cheap, $900 a class and 12 classes for the program. I’ve already been accepted. 

So here’s my question: with my resume right now I wouldn’t have a problem finding a job that would pay me $80k a year in my area. Is it worth it for me to go back to school and stay at this salary (with small raises of likely 2%) for another 3 years or should I ditch my current employer and go after the higher salary? I live conservatively, and my goal is to be debt free by 45, so I’d like the salary to start paying off my debts sooner, but the MS program could help be demand a salary of over 6 figures a few years down the line. Total expenses for me and my family are about $400 a week, with the rest going to food, gas, and savings.",finance

personalfinance,Consolidating credit card debt with a personal loan,"Hi PF, I have two high interest credit cards that I’m looking to lower my interest rate on and have been considering using a personal loan.


Card 1 - $10,000 @ 24.74% APR

Card 2 - $9,200 @ 17.99% APR


I’ve been speaking with my local credit union that I have history with, they are able to offer personal loans starting at 10.5% APR with no additional fees. I am considering applying, but want to ensure this is the smartest thing to do.


Primarily I am looking to lower my monthly payments on these cards, as well as save money long term in interest. I’ve had some unexpected circumstances lately that really uprooted me financially, by my calculations I would save $284 per month if approved at 10.5%. That would help immensely in the short-term, long-term that $284 would be thrown back at the loan for faster payoff.


I’ve looked in to balance transfers, but I’m unsure I’ll be able to pay off the balance completely in the promotional period. I’m currently looking for a higher paying job, and if that pans out I would pay off the personal loan early. If not, I’d hate to be stuck with a remaining balance after an intro promo rate ends.


I’ve also read that consolidating under a personal loan can help increase credit score, as it is considered installment debt rather than revolving debt? My credit score is good, but certainly has room for improvement.


Obviously I plan to lock the cards in a drawer at home and not touch them. I would cancel them, but I’m worried about the effects of closing two of my longest standing accounts.


Is this a sound plan? Any pitfalls to be aware of or concerns about personal loans in general?

Loan 2: 16k at 4.64% for 10 yrs (187/mo pmt)

Refinancing options:

Option 1 (consolidation option):
70k loan for 4.7% with 543/mo pmt for 15 yrs
total cost of loan w/ interest is 97,682

Option 2 (Refinancing Loan 1 only):
54k loan at 4.7% with 419/mo pmt for 15 yrs
total cost of loan w/ interest is 75,355

Both options would lower my pmt. I was just unsure of doing the first option since I would essentially be adding on 5 years with the 2nd loan and also losing out on a slightly smaller interest rate, even though its pretty much a wash between them. 

Would it be better to consolidate or keep the loans separated and just refinance Loan 1? And which option is best for paying the lowest amount of interest possible?

personalfinance,(US) Review my logic - Refinance Private AND Federal Student Loans?,"Current Loan Situation:

Private- $275K @8.25% (crazy I know)

Federal- $31K (20k @ ~6.2%, 11k @~3.8%)

At a bit of a crossroads here and need some insight/advice.  My wife was forced to take private loans during grad school and we’ve just been able to get approved to refinance them as the new lender required us to have a 20% of loan amount as liquid assets. We have been for $295K @ 3.10%.  I want to refinance both the private loans ($275k) and the high interest federal loans ($20k).  Most people try to hold on to their federal loans due to the benefits they bring, but that refinance rate is too low to ignore, and my wife is not eligible for loan forgiveness.  As I understand it, the only other time having federal loans is beneficial is, God forbid, one or both of us are unable to work, in which case we could apply for an income based loan repayment plan.  But at the end of the day, that $20k really only results in a $200 monthly payment which is less than 10% of the private loan payment, and that private loan can’t be renegotiated in an emergency.  Honestly, if things every got that bad, bankruptcy would be a reasonable alternative.

personalfinance,Taxable account fund selection,"Hi PF,

Making enough $ to have left over savings after maxing out both my 401k and IRA. I want a relatively easy solution to maximizing my returns in a taxable investment account. My 401k and IRA are going straight into the Vanguard target retirement fund which makes my life easy by managing things like re balancing, picking a good allocation between stocks, bonds, international stocks, real estate etc.

I’d like something similar for my taxable account as well. I understand the basic principle that some forms of investment are tax efficient and some aren’t (bond interest rates aren’t and are taxed every year eg).  But I’m pretty sure I’m going to screw something up along the way if I try to optimize the ratios myself - stuff like holding bonds in my tax advantaged accounts etc.

What is a set and forget strategy for these accounts? Are things like wealthfront and betterment an option? Or are they too expensive?",finance

personalfinance,Should I take out a personal loan to resolve credit card debt?,"Throwaway for some reasons.

Good evening, /r/personalfinance. I'm not going to beat around the bush. I have about $4200 in credit card debt. My current interest rate is 12.15&amp;#37;.

I work full time and get paid bi-weekly, about $2100/month.

I just now switched to a new district that offers matching (as far as I know up to 5,500 annually -but no other details). I know AXA isn't all that great, but I'm not paying any fees and the money that has built up hasn't gone down at all, but it really hasn't grown at all.

My new district offers accounts with a lot of good companies, VanGuard included, so I'm considering moving over the accounts to a more decent company that will allow for more growth.

retirement,"Differences between nonqualifed and qualified money, decluttering your portfolio.","What are three types of money? Qualified vs non qualified money:

What is nonqualified money?

Non qualified money or non qualified investments is money you pay taxes every year. If you take out the money, you don’t owe any in taxes. You have already paid the income taxes. To put it simply, this money is not qualified for any tax free growth like in a retirement account. Individual, joint, or trust trust accounts are examples of a type of account you may have at an investment firm or bank that you would need to pay tax on growth. It is also important to understand the tax consequences of a Non qualified deferred annuity and Non qualified annuity rollovers before any action is made on these investments and accounts.

What is qualified money? 

This could be your ira, 401k, or any type of tax deferred saving plan you have on your own or through a company. That money your required to take out at 70 1/2 . If you take it out at 59 ½ and dont have special circumstances, plan, or strategy. you are gonna take a penalty.

What is roth Ira money?

The third type of money is the most sought after. It is roth ira money. That money you're not forced to take out at 70 ½ and you can’t take it out at 50 ½ and it is all tax free forever. The money you put into it grows tax free. 

Simplify your life! You can boil down your investment accounts, in most cases, down to 3 accounts or less. When you understand what 3 types of money each account you have would fall under, you can consolidate your 11 accounts you current manage down to a simpler and more organized three. Knowing the different types of money, the difference between qualified and non qualified money allows you to declutter your plan.

personalfinance,$20K from inheritance with $7.5K pending from car sale; seeking advice for proper allocation,"My father recently passed away, leaving me to $20K and a pending $7.5K after we intend to sell his 06 Range Rover SE. I graduated from college last year and make a yearly salary of $69K. I am in the following positions financially and I am seeking advice on where to allocate my money appropriately:

Income
Salary: $69,000

Investments
Roth IRA current balance: $1,800
401K contribution percentage: 10% (intending to raise) 

Debt
Student Loan (to pay): $22,000 (w/ 4.5% interest rate)
Credit Card bill: $1,400

Inheritance received: $20,000 ($7.5K pending) 


My current opinion is to throw $5K at my student loan and pay off my credit card bill immediately. This would leave me with $13.5K (I'm not including the car sale yet) remaining that I believe I want to invest into various ETFs and mutual funds. I am already vested in $QQQ within my Roth IRA and I would most likely consider that as an allocation. I do not know much about mutuals, other than the contributions within my 401K that have landed me about a 4% return this year and 10% return since July 2017. 

If someone could give advice for other mutuals/ETFs to look at and start considering, it would be much appreciated. If anyone has any advice on allocations, I am keeping open ears. I know it is not a significant amount of money, but my goal is to double it within the next 5 years.

The first time I used this, there was a drastic difference in my pay check. I presume because the information i was putting it was wrong. Hence the reason I come here. Before I began, I do what to state that I did try calling the number the had, but could due to some pass code I didn't even know I had. And I also did try going to my paycheck/stub and it didn't have the information i needed, or at least I didn't see it.

* I live in NC

* I get paid $13.75/hr bi-weekly 

* I work 40/week


**Money be taken out of my check currently**:

* Employee Medicare
		 
* Federal Income Tax	
	 
* NC State Income Tax	

* Social Security Employee Tax



**Questions based off of the calculator**

* My contribution was going to be 4%. I got that based of off the percentage raise from $13. Please tell me if Im wrong

* My gross income: Is this before or after taxes are take out?

* My gross income (ytd): Basically the same question as well as the last as well as why would this be relevant in determining what is to be taken out in future paychecks? 

* My total exemptions: I don't think I have any. I always had so kind of sheet to determine this for me so, i really don't know. I presume this I would see on my paycheck.

* State income taxes (either in the form of % of gross pay, % of federal taxes, or no states taxes): I don't know either one of those. All I know is I do have state taxes. What percentage I don't know. And my math is not so good to determine that. Nor can I find that on my own. 

* Deductions: Slightly as confusing as Exemptions. I don't think I have any.

personalfinance,Any way to remove multiple student loan late payments aside from waiting 7 years?,"I'm sure this is not an uncommon case, but I have federal student loans that I pay off through the FedLoan website.  Even though it's a single payment, it gets applied towards 8 different smaller loans.  I was going through a rough patch financially at the end of 2016 and stupidly, instead of using some available deferral time, I just didn't pay for about 3 months.  Sure enough, I have 24 late payments on my account due to those loans.  Needless to say, it feels a little unfair as it all goes to the same place, but I realize that in reality, it is 8 separate loans (and I'm sure, presumably, if I made partial payments even, I'd likely have less missed payments as some of the loans would have been covered).  

Other than those, I only have 1 other late payment.  my other credit factors are pretty solid according to Credit Karma (under 30% utilization, 0 derogatory marks, etc).  I currently have 25 open accounts on my report, all in good standing that have been in good standing for a while, including an auto loan, a mortgage, my student loans, etc.  However, my score keeps lingering in and around 600 - 650 range.  My Equifax is seriously confusing me as it was over 650 around the end of last year, but is now at 609.  Nothing major has changed on my report since it was 650 (I actually managed to get a different late payment that I thought was inaccurate removed during that time as well) so I have no idea why it dropped nearly 50 points when I've been paying everything on time?

I can't help but feel that obviously, those enormous amount of late payments are holding me back.  Since I have no major purchases I will need to be financing anywhere in the near future, maybe I just need to have some patience, suck it up, and let my score correct itself, but personally, I wish I did have better credit already as I feel like I'm losing out on bonuses from cash back cards and the like as I don't currently have any credit cards with good rewards programs and I feel like I'm throwing money away every time I get gas or buy groceries on my debit card.

I obviously can't imagine them removing the late payments from my credit report all together, but I don't suppose there's a way I can get them to reflect it as 3 late payments instead of 24, is there?",finance
personalfinance,"Best ways to use/invest a windfall, and ideas for good capital gains shelters?","Greetings PF! I have a windfall situation, and will be hit with pretty huge capital gains. I am wondering what will be the best vehicle to avoid some, and also general advice on best future planning. Warning, wall of text!


 I live in AR and had land given to me by my family, jointly with another relative, who lives in SD. Now that we have settled on a price, I am getting roughly $230K for my share of the buy-out. 
My SO and I file jointly, and I earn roughly $46K, and he earns roughly $100K. So, capital gains ae going to be huge. I figured Federal tax will be $35,025, and our accountant says state tax for AR will be another $8,700. Crazy!!


So, here is my current plan (and I am hoping for more suggestions:))…
We are in the process of getting our house ready to sell, due to needing to be in the right school district for our kid, and we have about $30K in equity in our current house, plus we should make around $15K more than what we paid if we sell. We will need about $60K for a down payment on a similar house in the right school district, so I am going to use my land money for that, so we don't have to buy contingent on our house selling.

 
Next, my DH has about $30K in student loans and about $10K in CC debt. I have about $5K in debt. I am going to use the land money to wipe out the CC debt, but not the student loans. 


Third, I have a rent house that I still owe $87,000 on that is generating $1200/month guaranteed income. I want to pay that off. This will allow us to not have the second mortgage to worry about, and now with the extra income, DH can have more to pay down his student loan debt.


This will leave roughly $28K left. So, here are some ideas...


We have nothing left in our joint savings. We had to take some big hits for major home repairs on both my rent house and our primary residence. So, we have nothing. In fact, part of my debt is from having to pay for a new hot water heater on my rent house (although its a tax write off, so there's that). I want to put $20K in joint savings so we have that cushion. 


Secondly, I have a traditional IRA (the target 2035 VTTHX, if you are interested), with $56K in it, and my DH has about $80K in an IRA with Merrill Lynch. Neither of us has been able to contribute anything this year, because we are broke! So, I could put some land money into that, and because it’s traditional and not a Roth, I could avoid some gains tax, right? 


Another idea: My grade-school age child has a 529 account already set up by her generous aunt, and has about $20,000 in it. It is in another state (CO). We have not been able to contribute, due to our debts, but it’s my understanding we could open a 529 account in our state and contribute up to $10,000 that would be sheltered (my accountant informs me this would only save about $800 on the state tax side, but still…).


So, how does this plan sound? I think the only part that might sound a little weird is paying off the rent house, but I have my reasons. The interest rate on the mortgage is pretty high, and it was also my property before marriage. I guess I want to protect myself. My spouse brought nothing into the marriage (except for $100K in debt, which we have been paying down on for the last 10 years). He has also said during arguments if we ever divorce he will take everything, blah blah. We are in a better place in our marriage, but a girl has to protect herself. Therefore, I’d rather have a good asset that is mine, free and clear, should something ever happen.",finance

btc,questions on op_group discussion,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwhsKdXRIXI&amp;feature=youtu.be

I am trying to understand the development of tokens. This video seemed pretty insightful but it was long. I wanted to try and highlight some issues that didn't seem to be addressed or there was still contention over. 

These seem to be the main concerns brought against op_group.

1) That the tokens created are not guaranteed to be redeemable. This the users must rely on centralized companies to redeem their value. 

So they would like to see a trustless use case where the redeemable requirement removed. 

2) In general, they want the issuer to be able to specify transfer controls. An example given for this was a small island nation wanting to have full control over their own monetary policy. 

3) That there is some other project that i couldn't quite make out called Cicada or Tokada? That is a second layer solution, or somehow solves all of these use cases with tokens but without a hard fork. Maybe someone can help explain this one to me. 

4) Steve mentions that he has teamed up with nChain and will be working on an alternative solution to Andrew's op_group proposal. He thinks it will solve all the issues without a hard fork. 

Overall I feel a lot of the issues raised were issues that we have with all crypto. If an exchange or government wants to blacklist addresses they can. I also agree with the argument that that adding tokens will fill up the entire blockchain. 

I thought there were no issues with scaling because of moore's law. Apparently, the concern from Amaury is the weakness is on the capacity of the average internet connection.  

I feel that the issues raised against op_group tokens, such as black listing and being redeemable are for the users to decide on. If you want to trust in some large company to be around to accept your gift card, then that is your choice. However, what is 'guaranteed' is that the transfer of that token or asset and it's overall security. 

Also, in a simple sense. Op_group would allow for ICOs to be launched on bch. This could lead to a lot of development on the chain to help lead to further innovation. At least in my opinion. 

I also don't known what this other implementation or solution they are taking able called tokada I think. I also look forward to nChains counter proposal that if found viable will be given resources to have it out ""soon."" 

So what do ya'll think about this discussion?

crypto_currency,DCC —Realizing the Dream of Inclusive Finance,"## From centralized to distributed banking— DCC’s vision

*“Distributed banking is a new kind of cooperative service relationship where financial service organizations collaborate with each other on a decentralized blockchain basis.”*

*– Stewie Zhu, Project Leader, DCC*

The traditional financial markets are heavily dependent on centralized banking institutions, with key user credit data and transaction data controlled by a handful of mega-sized financial firms. By contrast, DCC’s goal is to serve as a public chain for distributed banking, establishing a decentralized financial trading platform. In DCC’s framework, each individual has full control over their credit information. Financial institutions are then able to provide multiple competitive services to customers according to their digital credit data and there are no fixed relationships among institutions.

DCC’s user account system is based on decentralized DCCID which ensures that transactions and credit data cannot be tampered with. Personal credit data reports are stored in the cloud, while all data transmissions are encrypted for the highest level of security. Blockchain’s intelligent contract interaction architecture successfully shifts personal data from the grasp of centralized credit institutions to decentralized individuals.

The DCC platform is open architecture too, meaning any party can create intelligent contracts based on open standard protocols or develop DApps (decentralized apps) to expand the DCC environment.

DCC will ultimately transform the financial market structure, leveraging innovation to drive change from centralized to distributed and decentralized.

## Why do we need DCC?

The traditional financial industry is highly centralized.Financial transactions rely heavily on the endorsement and support of large financial institutions, with substantial transaction fees paid out to these institutions. Monopolistic financial institutions have in fact raised lending rates for borrowers and reduced the interest income for lenders. In some cases, intermediaries have even distorted the credit rating of borrowers for their own benefit, making it impossible for lenders to accurately identify risk, which can have a destabilizing effect on the market. The outbreak of the 2008 financial crisis, to a large extent, was the upshot of excessive greed and a complete disregard of market risk by several major investment banks.

Public chains for distributed banking based on blockchain technology have now broken this monopoly. As the first ever distributed blockchain financial service platform, DCC can virtually abolish transaction costs and commissions while providing a secure and convenient service that’s affordable for traditional financial institutions. On DCC’s public chain, all financial services firms have equal status, and they bid for customers based on the same criteria. There are no longer a monopolistic few who “control the whole”.

In the new era, the traditional major banks will have equal status with smaller institutions, which is in the interest of fair market competition. This way, competitive smaller financial firms have the opportunity to set the trend, making the overall market more active and free. There are even benefits for the traditional major banks, as their own risks will be greatly reduced, benefitting their long-term development.

## How does DCC achieve inclusive finance?

*“A family in South Africa could easily get a loan from a North America-based financial institution that changes their lives through DCC.”*

*-Stewie Zhu*

Under the current financial system, there is almost zero possibility for the above to happen, but such cases will be commonplace in the future with DCC.

Let’s take this South African family as an example.They would not have to pay expensive fees, or spend time and money building credit records with a bank. By registering their credit footprint on the DCC platform and entering the needs of the family, financial institutions around the world would be able to learn of their circumstances and offer appropriate services. The cost of financial services on DCC can be greatly reduced by cutting out credit data control from traditional central financial institutions. The family can quickly and easily find out what they can afford to borrow and sign digital contracts online.

As the family works hard and begins to repay their loans, they leave a positive footprint on their DCC records. Other financial institutions cannot take control of these records, and the family are the owner of their own credit data.

Similarly, the general public all over the world can, through DCC, prove that they are trustworthy and have the ability to repay loans before quickly obtaining financial support. By rewarding the service party and trustworthy borrowers in the form of digital currency, DCC has a positive impact on financial activities. Compared with traditional financial markets, the DCC platform not only achieves lower interest rates and easier borrowing but also will greatly reduce default and risk.

As greater numbers of people get the support they desire through DCC and transform their lives, the global economic polarization of the rich and poor can be curbed, and productivity from individuals from all social backgrounds enhanced. One of the greatest features of the distributed financial services system is that it enables financial services to reach an extensive number of people and spread benefits to all sections of the society.

## How will DCC change the blockchain industry?

DCC addresses the biggest shortcoming of the traditional blockchain currencies — the lack of true value. DCC’s value comes from the financial activities and transactions of all its members. As increasing numbers of financial transactions are completed via DCC, the DCC digital currency will have a more concrete foundation. Today’s socio-economic operations go hand in hand with the flow of large sums of financial capital, which bringsDCC a broad range of potential commercial applications and invaluable potential.

This is the beginning of the commercialization of blockchain technology. Based on the huge market demand and by eliminating the key weakness of traditional digital currencies, DCC can become a high-quality digital asset which is worth holding on to in the long term.

## Passion and inspiration —the essentials of a successful team

DCC’s core team of experts is an all-star line-up. Stewie Zhu, a graduate of Oxford University and the London School of Economics, is a specialist in behavioural economics and game theory, and has been an active player in the blockchain industry for many years; Professor Lu obtained a PhD in mathematics from Yale University, and brings extensive experience as a former director in several major investment banks along with an unwavering enthusiasm for all blockchain related topics; Shi Fei, Vice President of JP Morgan, is an authority on quantification, derivative pricing and quantitative risk analysis, with valuable insights into blockchain; Chen Yu is an angel investor with countless successes and achieved fame online as “Jiangnan Young Cynic” by advocating decentralization;YuhangGuo is founder of DIANRONG and Chairman of Galaxy Capital, and is one of the earliest blockchain investors.These top-class academic experts and investment gurus make concerted efforts to develop the distributed banking system and allow millions to benefit from blockchain finance. Professionalism, strength of character, inspiration and enthusiasm are the key to DCC’s success.

Will DCC cause an explosion in the blockchain industry? It may be too soon to draw a definitive conclusion. What’s certain is that the financial industry needs a blockchain revolution, aided by the support of real economic activities. DCC is the bridge connecting the two. Responsive investors have already started to explore DCC’s investment channels. Whether you sit and wait to see how things unfold, or act now to seize a potentially valuable opportunity, the decision is yours.

personalfinance,Investment advice for wife.,"I've just started my medical residency and have been getting all my financial ducks in a row (life/disability insurance, retirement, emergency savings, etc.).  I've extensively researched the best options for me as a resident, and have followed suit, including recently maxing out a Roth IRA for 2018 and now I'm contributing to a Roth 403b (no 401k match for residents). 

Having said that, I'm at a loss as to what are the best retirement options for my wife. She currently has a salary of about $78K. She will creep upwards over the years, however is unlikely to ever go over 90K. Her employer pays for 100% of the premium for excellent medical coverage for our entire family, however does not offer any retirement plans at all. Apparently the owners are in talks about starting a 401k with a match, in which case we will take advantage of, however that remains to be seen. I understand the merits of Roth contributions for a resident, in that I will be in a much higher tax bracket when I retire, so best to take advantage of paying the lower taxes now. However, I am unclear on what choices are best for my wife?

If her company 401k comes to fruition, would it be best for her to contribute as much as possible to this and/or a traditional IRA, or would a Roth also be advantageous for her/us, since our combined income in retirement will be our new tax bracket?

We currently have zero student loans and zero debt due to several scholarships and some cash tuition payments (writing that check was painful), so we can focus all our efforts on retirement contributions. Also, since my wife single-handedly supported our family throughout medical school (god bless that woman), she has not yet started saving for retirement, so this is square 1 for us. I’d appreciate your input. Thanks.",finance
btc,"Why is BCH better suited to cash, than XMR or other inflationary coins?","Genuine question - not shilling any coin. Just curious to understand the economic model BCH is employing.

&amp;nbsp;


As it stands, fiat currency in western nations has an inflation rate of *around* 3%, this is in almost all instances higher than the interest rate which seems to sit at around 1%. This devaluation in my currency is the primary reason I invest as aggressively as I do - knowing that the 50k in my bank account is going to lose value if I just leave it sitting there.

&amp;nbsp;


Now with Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash - there is only deflation caused from accidental destruction of funds, and no emission to increase this. So what is my incentive to not just save indefinitely knowing that my purchasing power increases over time rather than decreases over time?

&amp;nbsp;


I entirely prefer BCH to BTC in every other way, but I think I agree with the Blockstream guys in saying that Bitcoin is better suited a store of value rather than electronic cash as described in the Satoshi whitepaper.

&amp;nbsp;


I feel that coins like XMR are better suited to acting as an electronic cash due to the fact that they do have a small emission rate (incentivising some form of spend and hence keeping the circular flow of income working), and of course they're just as anonymous as fiat cash is (not true for BTC or BCH).

He has been receiving subsidized and unsubsidized loans through the government (standard federal student loans). The problem is that he is $1000 short of this coming semesters tuition without any assistance available for the following semester - and he is being told that he has used up all the government will offer him.

personalfinance,"Received good chunk of money from stocks, how can I optimize my earning potential?","So I live in America and I recently earned a good chunk of money ($115k) from some stock that I owned for 4 years. From all the research I've done, I see that this money falls under ""long term capital gains"" and thus is tied to the long term capital gains tax.

Now, I have a salary of $66.69k. I saw that my long term capital gains are only taxed if I have a federally taxable income &gt;$38.6k, then my stock money is taxed at 15&amp;#37;.

15&amp;#37; of $115k is $17,250. If I work full time and get 40hrs/week, my actual income (after taxes and all that jazz) is \~$50k for the year.

So essentially, if I go for my full salary, it would be $50k - $17k = $33k which is less than if I just work up to $38k. So right now I'm just billing my company for 12hrs of work a week so that at the end of the year, my federally taxable income is \~$38k.

Does this make sense to everyone else out there? Or is there something I'm missing, like how I can reduce my federally taxable income?

The way this works is that the SEC issues a notice, which is then published in the Federal Register.

financialindependence,"Superannuation, the retirement account system in Australia","I thought I would write up a little intro to the Australian retirement account system just in case this is useful to anyone. Inspired by u/notkiwihaqi's post about the [New Zealand system](http://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8lovxg/new_zealander_here_was_thinking_you_might_find_it/
).  

# Superannuation in Australia  

Superannuation (super) is the retirement savings account for Australians. Contributions to a person’s super are *required by law* and have tax advantages going into super and when withdrawn in retirement.  

##### Getting money into Super  

The primary contributions to your super account come from your employer. If you work more than 30 hours per week an employer is required to contribute at least 9.5% of your wage to a super account. An employer may contribute more, such as some government work or academic institutions will contribute 17% or more, but not less than 9.5%. You do not have to make any sacrifice to get a 'match' like a 401K this is in addition to, not subtracted from your salary/wages.  

&gt; A salary of $100,000 would have an additional $9,500 contributed to your nominated super account. Both figures before tax.  

You can also make additional ‘voluntary’ contributions up to various limits. Currently $25,000 per year can contributed to your super before tax, so called ‘concessional’ contributions. The employer contribution of ~9.5-17% count to this limit. These amounts will not count to your income tax for the year and are often made though ‘salary sacrificing’ but can also be paid directly to your super fund and declared on your tax return later. You can also carry forward unused concessional contributions for 5 years if you have less than $500,000 in your super.  

Concessional contributions are not however completely tax free, they are taxed at a flat 15%, or 30% if you earn more than $250,000/year. This is however much better than the income tax rates and where much of the benefit of super comes in. For low income earners (&lt;$37,000) the government will refund the first $500 of this tax, so that you’re not losing money. 

You can also make after tax contributions up to $100,000 per year. As you would have already paid income tax on these there is no further tax. After $100,000 in after tax contributions if you still contribute you will be liable for a 47% tax on the *earnings* from that amount over that $100,000 cap, which is equal to the highest income tax bracket. There are some exemptions to this such as personal injury settlements, or bringing forward 2 future years worth of cap. For low income earners, the government will also match post tax contributions at a rate of ~50% up to $500 each year.  

&gt; I can contribute $300,000 post tax this year and not pay tax on the earnings but I can’t make any more post tax contributions in the next two years.  

So consider my $100,000 salary from before, I decide to contribute an extra $10,000 before tax.  
 
&gt; I now have a taxable income of $90,000 and $19,500 is contributed to my super account. After tax values would therefore be around $68,000 in take home pay and $16,575 to my super. About $3,000 less paid in tax overall than if I made no extra contributions.  

The tax benefits on super also continue for the investment returns. As we hope that compounding is doing its work your investments will also be growing. Investment returns inside a super fund are also taxed at a flat 15% for short term gains, and 10% for long term capital gains.  

#####Where the money is invested  

While your super is growing, it will be held in a super funds. These can be:  
Industry funds, focused on a specific sector e.g. retail workers,  
Retail funds, standard investment/financial institutions,  
Public sector funds, for government employees,  
Corporate funds, run by your employer,  
Self-managed super funds (SMSF), managed by yourself, probably best to get a good accountant. A general rule of thumb is that SMSF will only become worth the investment once you have a balance &gt;$200,000-300,000.  

A super fund is usually like any mutual fund, the money is invested, fees subtracted and distributions/growth received. Depending on the type of fund you will have less control (public sector funds) or total control (SMSF) over how your money is invested. Many super funds also have bundled life/death/disability insurance which can syphon off a lot of money without people noticing.  

#####Getting money out of Super   

So we have built up a nice retirement account what now? In general, to access your super you have to be old, or retiring, or both. Once you reach the age of 60 and retire, or 65, you can receive your money as an income stream or a lump sum, usually completely tax free.  There is a limit of $1.6 million (indexed for inflation) that can be transferred from the accumulation phase to the tax free retirement phase. Amounts above this will be subject to a 15-30% tax on their earnings  from the date of transferring and can be converted to a taxable account that pays income/capital gains tax as normal. Being over this $1.6 million can also affects the caps of how much you can contribute before and after tax e.g. carrying forward pre tax contributions.  

There are very few ways to receive money earlier. You can apply under compassionate grounds or due to financial hardship such as paying for medical treatment to receive funds early. These are usually taxed between 17-22%. Although a new scheme is the ability to withdraw voluntary pre or post tax contributions (up to ~$30,000) for the purchase of/deposit on your first house. This will be taxed at your marginal income tax rate less 30%.  

### Summary  

So overall superannuation is a pretty good system for those looking to FIRE. It allows most Australians to cruise along knowing that they are saving ~10% of their income automatically in tax advantaged accounts. Additional contributions can help get your tax rate a bit lower and tax free gains up to a $1.6 million portfolio. These tax benefits come at the cost of locking the money away until a normal retirement age of 60+.  

There is also an aged pension in Australia for those over 67, with a maximum rate of $900/fortnight. This value decreases as your income increases, per individual in a couple, etc. but can help supplement your super if you do not have enough or live long enough to exhaust your retirement savings.

personalfinance,"23yo First Job, 13k signing bonus - Advice","Hey everybody. I'm a lurker on pf and want to get the right jump on my financial future and am asking for any advice you may have for me and my current financial situation.

I'm 23 years old and just graduated with a Masters in Business (not an MBA but similar) from a top 25 school in the US. I landed a job at a great company in ecommerce and retail buying. Starting salary is $47,500 with a $12,500 signing bonus payable on the second check (have to stay for a year, otherwise have to pay it back). 401k is 6&amp;#37; matching after first year.

Grad school was great, but not cheap. I currently have about $100k in student loans ($96k federal) at roughly a 5.5&amp;#37; interest rate on average. Repayment starts in November. I also recently bought a Certified Pre-Owned 2015 Honda Civic for a total of $18k with nothing down at 4.25&amp;#37; for 72 months (please don't crucify me). Credit is around 750.

I have been budgeting expenses and expect it to come out to around $2,200/month before 401k/savings/entertainment. So that includes rent, all loans (student loans on graduated rate), food, utilities, gas, insurance, etc. This would leave me roughly $800/month for savings/spending outside of my signing bonus.

I currently have around $1,300 sitting in a robinhood account and another $1,000 in my bank account. My plan is to get out of robinhood and take another $2,000 from my signing bonus and throw it in some sort of Vanguard account with the robinhood funds, not touch it and count it as my down payment for my car/car fund. The remaining money from the bonus would go into an Ally Savings account (accruing interest at 1.75&amp;#37;). Bad? Good? Should I be doing something else?

Tell me if I'm stupid or on the right track please! Thanks for your help in advance.",finance

Credit Rating \~780

Zero Credit card debt

I figure refinancing is my best option, and I've gone through and ""found my rate"" for a bunch of companies. I'm primarily looking at 10 year fixed rate options, as I can handle the monthly (\~$1,300/mo), but I guess **this is where my question starts**: 

Some of the companies provide me with exact interest rates (ranging from 5.14&amp;#37; to 5.90&amp;#37;, while others provide me a range. For example, one company gave me a range from 4.31&amp;#37; to 5.51&amp;#37; for a fixed rate loan. 

A) Is it safer to go with one of the options that is an exact value or a range?

B) If set number, just go with the lowest interest rate or are there other considerations?

C) If range, is the loan ""fixed"" within that range? Or will it pick a value in that range and that will be my rate for the lifetime of the loan?

D) If it's fixed once picked, would my rate likely be toward the bottom of that range?

E) How do I go about getting the exact rate? Do I need to go forward with the application? What if I don't like the rate? Am I screwed?

F) Any other questions / shit you wanna sling at me or advise on anything?

personalfinance,Just graduated. How to budget for loan repayment?,"Hello all, I just graduated from a bachelor's degree this May. Over the course of my undergrad, I had to apply for loans to help pay for classes as well as some other living expenses. The total loan amount I have borrowed is around $15,000, most of which are subsidized federal loans. I do however have one loan that is unsubsidized, and has been accruing interest for about 3 years. 

I plan on going to PA school the following year, and I have been working a full time job as a medical assistant. My hourly wage is $13, and I work at a somewhat consistent 30-40 hrs a week. 

Since my loan repayment period is coming this November, I was wondering how much of my earnings should I put away to pay for my loans? The website recommends a monthly payment of around $150 for the next 10 years, but would it be smart to put more money in each month so I could repay it earlier so interest won't accumulate? I live at home so I don't have to pay for rent or food, but certainly there are some expenses that I have each month. Any advice? Thanks a lot!",finance
personalfinance,Friend (27) has serious unpaid student loan debt that have gone to collections. How does he negotiate most effectively?,"*Mark* is an idiot. 


Mark is a nice guy. We like him. However, he was kind of given everything and had a sizeable inheritance. Mark used it to travel in college and pay for his school. Mark is bad with money but whatever, it's Mark. He doesn't have student loans. 


*Mark* is an idiot. Mark burned all the money traveling. He then took out student loans and is now some years out of school and he has NEVER paid them. He didn't think he had to???Yes Mark is an idiot. He knows that. I have stressed it. Anyway, he was so ashamed he never said anything and we were all under the impression he was loan free so we never really worried about the money issues.


Well he came to me and fessed up, I went through his credit report and...


211$ car payment (up to date and 400ish left total)


~700$ nonpayment utilities gone to collections and one 0$ marked CLOSED (he never got a bill and assumed he didn't need to pay, I know I know)


31xxx$ Student Loans gone to collections as of June 2018


Income

50k annually

After insurance, retirement, taxes, ect approx
3200 per month. He should have had no problem paying anything off but seems to not be proactive in keeping track of debts.

Required expenses only 1200$ including grocery's, gas, phone (for work), rent


We're working on fixing the rest of his budget that's just disappearing . We're trying to find out who they sold to for repayment but he basically let his federal student loan info laspe  and everything is out of date. His credit is done for at this point. (400s)


My question is since his credit is already shot I know we can negotiate this. How can we most effectively cut the overall ammount due? He has yet to be contacted by any agency. Should he attack it head on and get ahold of them? Draw it out? Build a savings first? Pay off the utilities first? (Not in use currently). Also what's the typical ammount it can get cut by or does that not apply to student loans at all? Does he still need to do anything for the 'closed' utility account?


I'm sorry this is a mess. I'm trying to help but my loans are minor and well cared for so this is completely new for me but I'm trying to help him get less overwhelmed. Once he has his one monthly payment he should be okay. 


TLDR; friend let 31000 in student loans go to collections. How to best reduce the loans or at least get then under control?

Edit: I appreciate the thought behind the relationship advice but that's not the question here. I'm hoping for some advice on how to deal with collections.",finance
personalfinance,My father bought a life insurance policy in 2002 with the impression that he would only have to pay for 10 years but now MetLife has extended the time to 20 years.,"Hello. I don't usually post on here so I apologize in advance if I leave out anything important. 


In 2002, my father bought a 250k life insurance policy from MetLife. The agent there told him he would only have to pay a premium of about 3k per year for around 10 years and he would be all paid up. 


Fast forward 15 years, the agent is now telling him that due to a drop in interest rates (??), the pay period has been extended to 20 years. However, the payout is also better (??). When asked if this is subject to change, they said that is dependent on the interest rate which they have no control over. After reading the policy myself, I have the impression that my father is supposed to pay until 98...so I'm completely lost on where they're getting these numbers from




I have zero experience in this field and plan to speak with the agent myself to get a clearer understanding of the situation. I was hoping to obtain some basic information here before I call so that I'm not going in completely blind. Images of the policy information below.

I expected I would be on the upper end of that range as I have 3.5 years experience with the programs requested as well as a 4 year degree using the programs.  I exceeded every requirement and preference on the job listing.  I smashed my interviews and was excited.  I got the offer today, and it's for $16.34/hr and it's non-negotiable.  The company I applied to is a private company, and there was never any mention of government contracting, but when the staffing office I applied for the position through went to bat for me on the salary point they brought up that they were going off of government contracting prices.  They kept saying all throughout the interview process that they were competitive in the area (they're not, they're 8k below average).

I know I have no choice but to take the job, I haven't gotten near as close with any other application I've put out, but I did some back of the envelope math and 45% of my net pay will go to private loans, and will leave me with less than $650/mo to pay for gas, car insurance, maintenance, and my federal student loans.

personalfinance,Are student loans typically amortized and should I take out a loan to pay them off?,"Just curious if student loans are amortized like a mortgage is, where the interest is heavily front loaded onto the loan. My thought is I could take out a personal loan for 10% and pay off all my student loans and I would end up paying less in interest in the long run. 

This method works with mortgages (even if the loan has a higher interest rate than the mortgage) because of the way mortgages are amortized. I'm wondering if student loans are the same, or if they calculate interest every month like a credit card does.

2. How do I calculate the earnings? (both my 403b and roth 403b were invested in the same target date fund in my fidelity account)

CryptoCurrency,Announcing Dark Matter!,"# 

https://i.redd.it/n1626tlcnp911.jpg

# Announcing Dark Matter!

Dark Matter (XDM) is the genesis token on the ION blockchain. The mother  of all ION tokens. Just like the real Dark Matter, XDM features unique  properties that make it an essential element in the ION ecosystem.

## Revolutionary Store of Value

Dark Matter is a revolutionary way to store value. The XDM token supply  diminishes with every transaction, making it a deflationary asset.  
 

Its monetary policy alone is a valuable utility. Every portfolio should  be balanced with Dark Matter as a hedge against inflation. Its supply is  more predictable than gold. Its deflationary policy is steeper and more  absolute than bitcoin.

https://i.redd.it/vtd5hsrhnp911.jpg

## Deflation Mechanism

Deflationary by protocol, every time you send XDM, 80&amp;#37; of the  transaction fee gets burned. This incredible disappearing of token  supply means that, with every XDM transaction on the ION blockchain, you  own a greater share of the total Dark Matter.

# Transactional Velocity

Just imagine what would happen if Dark Matter had additional uses that  drove adoption, thereby multiplying transactional velocity. Then XDM  would have two utility functions! The more Dark Matter gets used, the  more gets burned. It would become a hyperdeflationary asset. More on  that later!

https://i.redd.it/xyx24ojknp911.jpg

## Get Dark Matter

There’s just not gonna be much Dark Matter. Ever. The supply starts at  only 71,000 tokens and it’s all downhill from there. Dark Matter’s  scarcity gives it value.  
 

Half of all Dark Matter will be given away in airdrops. There will also be a token sale. [**Register now**](https://www.darkmatter.info/) to receive information about the upcoming airdrops and token sale at [DarkMatter.info](https://www.darkmatter.info/).

We got lucky and share a small condo that her mother owns (and was previously renting out). We only need to pay association dues which is $350/mo along with utilities. My wonderful girlfriend covers those living expenses to help me with my finances. I'm currently studying for an industrial engineering degree. So with some backstory, heres my current standing:

Student loans (with current interest):

Private:
$22,500 at 10.24%

$23,000 at 10.49%

$19,000 at 6.49%

Federal:

$3,500 at 4.66% (subsidized) 

$2,400 at 4.66% (unsubsidized)

$4,500 at 4.29% (subsidized)

$2,200 at 4.29% (unsubsidized)

$5,500 at 3.76% (subsidized)

$2,100 at 3.76% (unsubsidized)

$5,500 at 4.45% (subsidized)

$2,000 at 4.45% (unsubsidized)


This amounts to approximately $92,000 in student debt.

I'm currently working full time making $19.50/hr doing an internship. This next year I will have to take one class in the fall and one class in the spring. Some scheduling issues forced me to take a 5th year to take these final two classes. I will get my degree May 2019. Over the school year, I plan to work 32 hr/week along with my classes. These classes will cost approximately $5000 and can be split among 6 payments from Sept to May. It is possible that I will get a raise before graduation, but don't want to rely on that. Once I graduate, I hope to be making at least $60,000/yr (maybe closer to 65).

In addition to all of this, I have been setting money aside for the past year to buy an engagement ring for my girlfriend. I've saved up $4,500 (though I realize ""saving"" money when I'm in such debt is ridiculous)  for the ring, and would like to make the purchase as soon as possible.

I’ve only had my Capital One credit card for a couple of months and made all of my payments on time. Once it was activated it appeared that my student loans were “connected” to it, meaning that I had 3 accounts under my credit card as opposed to just the one. 

I figured this was no biggie and I’ll start paying them off too. Everything was fine for a few months, credit score kept going up. I paid off maybe $300 worth of student loans. 

Keep in mind, this was a direct subsidized loan, and two separate accounts, with each loan being $1750.00 (So total loan was $3500.00). One loan has a 3.760% interest rate and the other has a 4.450%.

Today I woke up to check CreditKarma and my score went down by 46 points. 

My current balance for the student loans is $3,309.00 and it is due on 10/4/2018, which is a little less than 3 months from now. I believe that both accounts were “deferred” but now both of their statuses are listed as “repayment” which I figured stands for standard repayment. 

My question is this: what can I do about it? I thought the fact that I was paying it off would help but it seemed to barely make a dent. This just makes me want to pay it all off now but, will that make the credit score go back up afterwards? I’m just a bit confused and honestly quite nervous since I’ve always been told not to mess my credit up. 

I’m a waiter in a restaurant, no longer in school, and I can probably make that back within one month if I work hard enough. Is this my only option? I’m also about to move out in August so I have to be strict with my money. I have ~$2k saved. 

I apologize if I didn’t provide enough information, but if anyone has any advice, I would appreciate it. Thanks.",finance

personalfinance,Roth IRA conversion tax paying process and best way to do it,"Hi pf! Long-time lurker, first time posting here. I’ve been learning a lot about investing these past few months and I’m in the process of reorganizing my portfolio, which will include a traditional to Roth IRA conversion. 

I’m curious about people’s experiences with the Roth IRA conversion process. I understand the concept (“pay the taxes according to your tax bracket”), but I can’t find any posts detailing all the steps involved. 

So I was wondering if anyone could share how they went about paying taxes on conversions and how they avoided any penalties, on the federal and state levels. 

From what I understand, the IRS website says that a conversion would trigger an estimated payments requirement. Is this actually the case, or do people usually wait until tax day? 

Also, assuming the process is initiated through Vanguard, do they send you a statement of the taxes owed or anything else?


**TL;DR: When is best to pay Roth IRA conversion taxes?**

personalfinance,"Married business owners, sell our house or double down? Looking for opinions on our situation.","Hi PF, 

Looking for some thoughts on my spouse's and my financial situation and some decisions we're going to be making coming up here soon. Here are some stats:

Married, no children, and both self-employed. Adjusted gross income for us is $60,000. 
Current finances: mortgage with $64,000 remaining at 6% interest, combined $320,000 in Federal student loan debt at 6.8%, one car loan $10,000 at 3%. No credit card debt. About $30,000 in savings.
Currently we are making almost double the payment on our mortgage and almost triple the payment on the car loan monthly in order to pay them down. The Federal loans are in repayment under ""income based repayment"" terms, meaning the payments are scaled for our income, and we are paying the minimum on those right now.

We bought our house five years ago. We were first time home buyers with a ton of student loan debt. Despite our excellent credit (both in the 700s), having such high student loan debt and both being self employed (high debt-to-income ratio), we were given a shit mortgage--house was $90,000 and we put 11% down and financed the rest under a ""balloon"" mortgage with a variable interest rate. We will need to either pay off the remainder of our mortgage balance, or refinance in two years when the mortgage term is up.

The original plan was to pay off the house ASAP so we can save for an upgrade and possibly rent out this house for additional income--time frame was about ten years. However, this house may need some work done to it to make it livable long term for us as we are hoping to start a family soon. We're talking about $10,000 of upgrades and repairs needed that we likely wouldn't see increasing the value of the house. Therefore, we are thinking about selling the house.

My questions for r/personalfinance are this:

- What would you do differently in this situation? Would you sell or try to stick to the original plan of paying off the house even with the possible $10,000 expense and refinancing costs coming up?

- If we plan to sell this house, should we really be making a double mortgage payment each month, or could we better utilize that money elsewhere?

- Considering debt-to-income now (which is actually somewhat better than five years ago when we bought this house), do you think a $200,000 home is within reach for us? What should a down payment look like for that? What kind of interest rate should we be aiming for on that?

Any thoughts or comments are appreciated. I plan to set up a meeting with our credit union (who doesn't currently hold our mortgage) in the next few weeks to see what they could offer us in terms of a mortgage.",finance

My main issue is that my parents don't know that I took out this loan, my dad doesn't believe in them and I know that if he found out about the loan he would pay for it himself in full, but I know he cant afford that.

personalfinance,"Paying off mortgage, affect on credit score","Background: Husband and I moved into our home 4 years ago. We have been aggressively paying our mortgage since we live well below our means and up until last year were living as DINKS (Double Income No Kids). While I was pregnant we made all of my income go either to my 401K, savings, or the mortgage. When our first child arrived last year, I decided to stay home, but we have continued to pay aggressively on our mortgage while continuing to put money in our savings. Fortunately we have no other debt other than our mortgage. I rolled my 401K into an IRA, and we have a vanguard account with an additional 30-40K ish dollars for retirement. My husband’s work has excellent stock options that he will be fully vested in within the next 6 months, but no 401K matching so the vanguard account is our substitute while at this employer. We have a 6 month emergency fund plus 100K in a money market account.

Problem/Question: We have about 21K left on our mortgage. The interest rate on our money market account just went up, but it is still pretty low vs the interest rate we are paying on our mortgage. **Would it be best to just pay off our mortgage with the money market account?** It wouldn’t take long to build that amount back up when not paying aggressively to the mortgage. And if we did pay off our mortgage **would our credit score suffer?** We only have one no fee credit card that we use for everything to get the cash back, but pay off every month and a line of credit that we have never used. It seems so dumb that we would get penalized for paying our shit off, but I don’t fully understand how the score system works. We will probably be moving in the next 3-5 years so I want to make sure we get the best rate for our next mortgage as most likely we would be living in a higher cost of living area and need to take out another mortgage.",finance
personalfinance,24 Year Old Money Decisions,"I'm 24 years old. I personally have $10k in CDs, $15k in liquidated income, and $12.7k in my retirement fund 401k/Roth IRA.  After my distribution to my retirement fun and taxes, I bring home roughly $3200-$3500 a month.

My fiance and I just purchased a home together for $131k. We qualified for a grant that is a $10k loan that is completely forgiven after 5 years of owning the home. Accepting this grant meant that we had to go with a loan that had a higher interest rate (5&amp;#37; instead of the initial loan of 4.25&amp;#37;).  Once the house has been owned for 5 years, we will receive $10,000 and we will be able to refinance the house under a lower interest rate, depending on the interest rates at that time.

I'm at a point in my finances where I'm trying to make a smart decision on managing my money and growing my own equity.  I am contemplating a plan for the short term financially.  I keep thinking that my fiance and I should aggressively make payments on the house for at least the first 5 years, because any amount that we pay off will not be hit with the 5&amp;#37; interest rate that would build up.  I am also considering simply making moderate payments (slightly over the minimum payment) and investing some of my liquid funds into the stock market.

Which of these two paths would be more financially sound.  Are there stocks with low risk that pay out solid dividends that would be a better option for me to spend my money on? Or should I take advantage of the fact that I know that if I pay off part of the house I won't have to pay nearly as much in the long run of paying off the property?

My bank says that the interest rate for my ""high interest e-savings"" account is 1.05&amp;#37;.

My question is this. Why on earth would I ever use their ""premium"" savings account if it offers SIGNIFICANTLY less interest than my current... normal savings account?

CryptoCurrency,Distributed Credit Chain,"Distributed Credit Chain is a decentralized banking system that unites service providers and people who need loans. DCC was created using blocking technology and operates throughout the world. The creators of DCC have set themselves the task of changing the usual financial scenarios, making them more convenient. This was made possible by a transparent block system for all involved participants, which allows you to save data and share it with all users. The crisis of the banking system due to problems with lending

Credits are one of the pillars on which the banking system is based. And the share of consumer lending is increasing every year. At the same time, banks around the world often face non-return of borrowed funds. To solve the problem will help to create a global public network based on the blockbuster. This will facilitate the identification and screening of unscrupulous borrowers immediately after applying for a loan.

Factors that speak in favor of the creation of a common banking network, a combined block:

constant preservation and distribution of information resources;

acceleration of digitization of data;

increase the speed of information transfer on the Internet;

mass implementation of cryptographic methods of data transformation.

DCC Concept

The main principle of the platform is distributed banking services, which implies the weakening of the monopoly of traditional large financial players. According to the DCC concept, all participants who have made a financial contribution to the development of the system are entitled to returnable income.

Decentralization will help create a new model of linear interaction between all players across all regions, regardless of whether the participant is an individual or a large company.

To convert assets, proceeds from intermediary services and the structure of the debt, the following methods will be applied:

implementation of joint financial management;

accessible to all credit reporting;

liberalization of interest rates.

DCC is an effective tool for financial institutions

The complex structure of capital management, to which conservative financial institutions are used, will be transformed in the process of work into a transparent linear chain. This availability of information in the DCC system guarantees the security of operations higher than that of traditional banking systems. Because all data on transactions and loans will be available to analysts. Due to this, a bad credit history can not be hidden or changed. And you can immediately abandon questionable transactions and work with problem customers.

One of the leading advisers of the project is Matthew Chang Joins, a specialist with twenty years of experience advising international corporations in the field of investing in Europe, Asia and North America.

Chang believes that the future of the banking sector for innovative technology. In his view, the successful operation of DCC is irrefutable evidence that the use of blockchain significantly reduces the time of verification and improves the efficiency of financial organizations.

My soft credit score is sitting right around 680, I know a hard inquiry might be a little different. After grants/trade in etc, I’m looking at financing about $25k. One thing that is hurting my credit is I did miss a couple credit card payments in late 2016 and early 2107 when I was going through a divorce and had no income. Can’t do anything about that!

1. I have approx $1300 of credit card debt. This is my only debt. Interest rate 12.99% and my  overall credit usage is at 12%. I could either use those funds and pay this off this month or it will be paid off in 3 months.

personalfinance,Federal income tax allowance question,"Hi there,

I'm in a position where about 75% of my compensation comes in the form of bonuses (annual and quarterly) and 25% salary. Everytime those bonuses hit payroll, the system automatically withholds at a 37% tax rate (because it extrapolates the amount to assume that's my standard salary) which is higher than my effective tax rate. So, essentially the result is that I end up withholding wayyyyy too much because of the lumpy nature and overwitholding of the 4-5 large payments. I've dialed my allowances up to 8 but thinking I need to push to the full 10 after some back of the envelope calcs.

I've already maxed out the OASDI annual limit and I continue to be withholding for Med and Addl Med.

personalfinance,Should I take out a private student loan instead of federal if I'm expecting reimbursement for my tuition?,"I'm starting my first year of university next month at a public state school. Even as an in-state student with a good amount of merit and need-based aid awarded to me, I'll still need about $10,000/year to cover the rest of my bill. I qualify for about that much in a combination of $2000 direct subsidized, $3500 direct unsubsidized, and $5500 parent plus (which my father would take out but I would be expected to repay as I become able to). 

My step-father's company provides about $10,000 towards tuition until I'm 21, but that can only be paid as a reimbursement (meaning one pays for the tuition out of pocket initially, sends the receipt to the employer, and is then paid back) and only if the bill specifically notes that it is for tuition (not room/board/books/etc.). My family's original game plan was to apply my $18,000 in financial aid to my living expenses/books, take out the 10k in federal loans to pay tuition, then be reimbursed by the company (which takes about the month) and use that money to quickly pay off the loans. This would mean all I have to pay for is extra living expenses (I'll have a part-time job once school begins).

However, I've just come to learn that any federal loan I take out will be given directly to the school first, with only the extra funds being deposited to me, thus removing the reimbursement as an option.

I'm not a big spender and I recognize that I need to make my money work for me while I'm young and have time on my side. I believe purchasing a home is a good investment that I can strive towards and is a necessary stepping stone in making my money go further. I essentially left University with no savings and around £20,000 in student debt. This student debt will be repaid over my working life and the interest rate is extremely low. It is essentially insignificant in any monetary decision I will make.

I plan on opening a ""Help to Buy"" ISA as that is a tax efficient way to save money while also benefiting from the bonus payout once a home is purchased. With the rest of my ISA allowance (As much as I can afford) I intend to invest my money in a ""stocks and shares"" ISA (I believe I am correct in saying that a help to buy is considered a cash ISA and as such I can pay into both in the same tax year - can someone confirm?). Nothing too risky when it comes to the stocks and shares ISA and given my line of work I am well aware of the risk involved. I'm just looking to make steady annual returns on my disposable income. Will likely mainly be Market tracking ETFs. £200/month is the cap on a help to buy so after living costs and expenses most of my cash will be in the market - with a small amount left over for liquidity purposes.

So far these are the only two ""investment"" methods I can think of to make my money work. I was wondering if this sounds like a solid plan to you guys and also if there are any pieces of advice you'd like to give me? Given the maximum purchase available from a help to buy is £250,000 (I.e. the bonus payout does not apply on purchases larger than this) I and the area in which I will be living, I am projecting to need to use that full £250,000 limit. When it comes to making the purchase that is a different discussion. For now I'm looking for ways to speed up the process as much as possible and make as big a dent into the deposit for any purchase I do decide to do.

I've followed this sub for a while now and I've seen it help a lot of people - figured I could give it a shot. I'm looking for some advise/encouragement from the universe. 

I worry due to my current circumstances, I am stuck in a revolving door of debt that will take me way longer to pay off then I can accept. 

There are several good bits about my debt. I dont have high interests in most expect the credit card, and my credit score I think may be pretty good for my age. 

Here's a breakdown of that debt:

~$9k in CC debt @ 19% 
~$7k in FedLoan debt
   This breaks up into 4 loans:
   - $2k @ 3.4%
   - $1.9k @ 3.4%
   - $2k @ 4.5%
   - $1.2k @ 6.8%
~$5,700k car loan @ 2%

I make a little under 3k a month (sucks!) and generally I will pay a little more then minimum due amount on all loans, then rent, and car insurance goes on my credit card. The remaining amount I have, usually around $800-$1,000, I throw onto my CC. The issue there is that monthly expenses (food, gas, etc.) goes on that CC so I go down little by little. When emergencies come up, they go on CC since I have zero savings. 

There are some really good bits:
My credit score fluctuates between 725 and 730. My credit cart offers me 0% interest for a year every other year. And all my debt does decrease every month though not by much. 

What would be the smartest way to divide my monthly income into payments on these debts?

Would it be smart to focus more on all the smaller debt and pay more on those while letting CC increase? Am I adulting right??

personalfinance,Have been living out of the US for 10 yrs... and am now moving back. Questions about getting re-established.,"So 10 years ago I moved to Sweden from the US. Now, my husband, 1 yr old and I are moving to the US. We are at the final stages of the visa process for him and I have some concerns about our finances during this time. 

Background: We will have about $50k in savings to start off as we finalize selling our house, car, and personal items in Sweden as well as savings. I work part time fully remotely for an American company and get my pay into my American bank account. I won't have to look for a job when we move as I will be bumped to full-time when we settle. My husband will be looking for a job as a software engineer, he is quitting his Swedish job pretty much right before we move (his employer already knows we are moving.)

Credit: I'm concerned about my credit for when we get established (applying for apartments, getting a car, mortgage later on etc). I tried getting my credit report at all 3 big credit companies but they had no info on me (spoke over the phone as I couldn't do it online). Does something happen to your credit if you leave the country after some years? Can credit transfer over country to country?  Is having no credit as bad as having bad credit? Will it be an issue for apartments, mortgage, or getting a loan for a car? 
I also have a bank account maintained in the US for my job, and I have had it for a bit over a year now. I only have a debit card attached to it though. Before I left to Sweden I was 20 and had no loans, debts, and credit cards. 

Any recommendations on things I can do to get my credit score up quickly? (We are hoping to buy a house about a year after we arrive in the US so I don't want a bad interest rate on the mortgage...) 

Any advice would be appreciated. I can also provide more info if this is a bit too vague, I just don't want to post something too long.",finance

personalfinance,Father in nursing home owns a building with a mortgage. Please help with a difficult situation.,"Hey PF,

I was hoping to get some help analyzing a difficult situation. My father has fallen very ill and is now permanently in a nursing home. Unfortunately, he’s got dementia and can’t really comprehend the situation himself to lend a hand. He was unprepared for this in every way and has left a financial mess that I’m now dealing with and bleeding money. He has no money of his own, less than $2,000 total in a bank account that I have established access to as Power of Attorney. He would easily qualify for Medicaid, except he owns a building. The building has about a $200k mortgage on it, and is worth maybe $400k tops. It’s a mixed use commercial storefront on the ground floor where he used to work, with an upstairs apartment that is currently rented out. I do have an Elder Care Attorney on retainer, and have spoken with him about the best course of action, but I’m constantly second-guessing myself because I don’t truly understand all the details of the situation. Basically, he can't qualify for Medicaid unless the building is listed for sale. Ideally, I’d love to keep the building for myself (as was his wish), but I don’t have the money to buy it from him outright without emptying my own bank account, nor do I necessarily want a mortgage with the upkeep required on a building in this state. It’s very decent, but does need work. I should also mention his mortgage interest rate is miraculously low.
  
At the moment, his social security check goes directly to the nursing home, and his rent goes to pay part of the mortgage. I supplement that rent to pay the rest of the mortgage, his insurance, and any other expenses out of my own pocket. Our lawyer has laid out the following plan as the best course of action, and I wanted to see if there are any options we’re missing. What do you think?

1.	Sell the building in his name.
2.	Use the proceeds to reimburse me first for any out-of-pocket expenses I've incurred on his behalf (mortgage, insurance, medical bills, etc.).
3.	I inherit a certain percentage of the profit of the property sale as a gift (52%?)
4.	The remainder goes into an annuity which pays directly to the nursing home until it’s gone.
5.	Once the annuity from the building is dried up, he qualifies for Medicaid and is no longer financially dependent on me.",finance

My past recruiter said that I would be leaving for training in August so I used a deferment for three months. August rolls around and she said it got pushed back to December. December rolls around and she said it got pushed back again. Its now July and my new one is saying I'll be leaving in the Fall. I signed the dotted line and I'm just waiting for a ship date and I got a job recently that pays roughly $13.50 an hour full time. 

I don't know what to do, whether I should consolidate them, or keep them the way they are and live just super cheap. My parents are incredibly supportive and let me live at their place until I ship out so no rent or anything really. If it helps, all the student loans are through one company. If anyone has any advice for what to do when I do get in and am considered active, that would be awesome! Thanks!

personalfinance,"My tax rate jumped 10% on my second paycheck, why did that happen?","Hi all, I just started a full-time job (first job out of college) in California that pays out bi-weekly, every 80 hrs. With how my start date lined up, my first paycheck only covered 40 hrs with 21.98% taxes being pulled out of my gross pay. So I figured, when I received my first 80 hr paycheck, I would receive twice as much pay at the same tax rate. But on my pay stub, I'm now paying taxes at 30.63% out of my gross pay. 

Looking at the tax distribution, it appears that my Federal Income Tax increased by 6% and my CA State Income Tax increased by 3%. Gross pay for each paycheck was about $1.5k and $3k so I'm confused as to how an extra $1.5k resulted in such a spike in my tax payments. Does this have to do with tax brackets? 

I worked hourly through college in Texas (of course things are different in California) but I never saw something like this...maybe because my hours differed every week unlike a consistent 80hr pay now.. so I'm curious as to what caused the spike. Very amateur question I'm sure, so thanks for any help :)",finance
personalfinance,Advice for working my way through college?,"Hi everyone, I got into a university and am committed to attending starting in August.

I plan on either becoming an RA or living off campus the last two years (as is commonly done by many students there). Board is 20k, and my academic scholarship was 45k.  So there is a relatively large gap in what my parents can pay, and what I can pay. I will be taking on some loans for this. So I plan on working to make sure I end up with the lowest amount of loans possible.

Bitcoincash,Our History and Motivation to Help,"Hello dear community of reddit, today we come to talk a little about ourselves, about how important BCH is for us, for the world and especially for Venezuela.

**Who I am?**

I am a young Venezuelan who every day struggles to help the people of my country and especially those who need it most, my inspiration comes from projects such as eatBCH and Bitcoin Cash Fund with which I kept in touch to work together and share ideas, I remain anonymous for my safety because I could have problems with the Government of my country.

**What was the motive and history that led me to help people?**

It all started when the mother of a cousin who had diabetes was hospitalized and because of the situation in the country that we all know we decided to collect money among all the members of the family to pay for medicines and dialysis sessions, we did many activities in order to raise money, we sold soups on Sunday, we performed plays in nearby communities etc ... We even asked for help at the mayor's office and said there was no way to help us, sadly despite our efforts the mother of our cousin died was when I decided to investigate on the internet if there was any way to receive help from other people abroad, at first I had thought about using PayPal in case of getting help after a while looking for I found great projects like eatBCH and Bitcoin Cash Fund investigate a little more and I found the community yours.org and saw that they reward the content with BCH investigate more about BCH and I noticed that it is much easier to use than PayPal and that its commissions were much lower and I decided to create my own project to help the most needy people, starting with my community, inspiring me and based on eatBCH and Bitcoin Cash Fund.

**How can I assure donors that I am delivering food and will continue to deliver and help?**

I can assure you that I will continue to provide help to people, in our twitter account and yours.org we will be constantly updating, sharing images of the beneficiaries, in our last recent project we visited a nursing home and we gave food and medicines to the grandparents of the institution all this was achieved thanks to people from all over the world who are part of yours.org with their donations from BCH.

**What impact will the project have on future donations and tips?**

Many people will be fed and in some cases their lives will be saved for those who require a drug for some serious diseases such as cancer, our project will grow and we will be able to help many more people all over the country.

**What do I want to say to all the people who give donations and tips?**

I want to tell all the people who are part of BCH and make their donations that thanks to you many people will be fed, many people will be saved thanks to you who are reading this, they can be happy with you because today they saved a life and fed someone I did not have the resources to eat.

**What is our next goal?**

Our next goal is a Local Hospital in the state of Aragua in the coming days we will be posting photos on twitter and yours.org of said hospital.

**Critics**

We have suffered many positive and negative criticisms, mostly negative about what we do with the money raised, we try our best to help and in our networks we publish our achievements thanks to donations, but without donations we can not help that's why we ask for support and help, a project without support can not grow, big projects have needed help and thanks to that today they are great, example of which are eatBCH and Bitcoin Cash Fund.

**Thanks**

We want to thank all the people who are part of BCH especially the people who are part of yours.org since it is our main means to obtain donations and tips.

Thanks from the bchvenezuela team

CryptoCurrency,Distributed Credit Chain [DCC] is a blockchain project designed to change the financial environment,"Distributed Credit Chain \[DCC\] is a blockchain project designed to change the financial environment through a platform for converting distributed credit reporting, debt registration, capital management and asset management. Distributed Credit Chain wants to return the power of financial services to users bypassing the traditional banking system. With plans for the first entry into the credit business before the expansion of distributed banking services, business contracts will be used to settle services and allocate funds, respectively in a safe manner.

Problems

Currently, there are many problems in the credit services market that need to be addressed, which are mainly caused by the centralization of organizations. Online credit agencies are known for using privileged information and circling around making profits, not innovations. The credit industry has several players who make it monopolistic and because of the different payment structures in its model, this industry is extremely harmful to people. The main problems with these credit services are: cost, efficiency and borrowers.

Credit organizations earn their money by charging extra people. They do it to pay for a bad debt, which is very irrational, Distributed Credit Chain developers are sure. The effectiveness of these services is also in question, as most borrowers are not aware of the requirements. Credit reporting services reduce the effectiveness of service provision by recommending products to consumers based on their credit rating. While credit systems in some countries are often underdeveloped, which leads to higher interest rates and duties, the likelihood of coming to an increase in bad debts, which can not eventually be repaid, increases. People who fall into this chain also often do not know how the credit system works, interest rates of the borrower can confuse him. Just as important, that the user may not be aware of their rights. This system forces people to borrow money in an endless cycle, eventually tie it to this system forever.

Solution

Distributed Credit Chain offers solutions for creating multiple plans to address the above problems. To preserve information about the real attributes of operations, applications for loans, loans, redemption and bank cards, a system for identifying user accounts will be created. This information will be stored through private keys and will use the signature technology through the block system to ensure that the information will not be used.

On the credit side of the Distributed Credit Chain platform, a data transfer verification (SDV) implementation will be created, which will be easily introduced into the user's risk management system. The data chain that is collected with the SDV will automatically update the order confirmation. The entire life cycle of user transactions is stored and analyzed with each request, so it is accurately assessed, effectively creating a secure decentralized credit system for lenders and borrowers.

Investors

Distributed Credit Chain has an impressive list of serious blockbuster investors. Among them: Nirvana Capital; AlphaCoin Found; Transferense Fund; LD Capital; Ceyuan Digital Assets; Starp; Crypto Vision; Whales Capital; DFO; Evolotion; Fusion Capital; StarWin Capital; [Gvc.pe](https://Gvc.pe); BA Capital; Consensus Lab; TFUND and other large investors.

Conclusion

Problems in the financial sphere today are very acute. I believe that the Distributed Credit Chain project will bring really good changes to our world. The team has excellent solutions and opportunities for their implementation. Distributed Credit Chain is one of the most attractive projects for investment.

With all the subtleties of the project Distributed Credit Chain, you can read through the links at the end of my article.

Thank you for attention!

* 1,965.05 at 3.76% (federal)
* 5,743.42 at 4.29% (federal)

* 5,000 at 7.68% (private)

Obviously dumb me went to a private school, but I love where I am. Before I knew I would have a job, I signed for graduate plus loans for about 42,000 for this coming school year and planned to pay/give back what I did not use. So total I will have about 100k in loans, most federal.

I am now making about 3,500 a month and live on about 1,500-1,700 a month. I just started tracking my expenses more seriously. I already have okay spending habits and do not eat out very much. I have two credit cards I pay off in full every month, and a car at home that is fully paid off but never used because I'm in a city where I don't need it (I don't know what to do with it). My problem is I have a heart condition and most of my money is going to medical bills right now. I have about 4k of medical expenses I expect within the next month. I have pretty good insurance but I've had to have surgeries (and will have another soon) and I'm going to meet my out of pocket max after the 4k. If I don't pay the bills in a timely manner, will my credit score be affected? 

I've just gotten a job offer to continue where I am for my internship but with better pay but less hours. Starting in August until the end of 2018 I will make about 3,700 a month and then I will make about 2,500-3,000 a month.

personalfinance,Is the 401k as good as the pension?,"I see a lot of posts on how people are happy to have their 401k because it’s their money and they make more money in the market than a pension.  Either I’m thinking about 401k wrong or the 401k pales in comparison.

So even if I saved up 18500 every single year for 35 years, had it all in equities so I get that 7% I would have just shy of 3 million.  What middle class working class person does this?  At a 3% withdrawal rate so the money actually.... well lasts you forever like a pension you only see 90k which will be just about OK in 35 years.  Do most people spend 401k like this?  Even with that or if you draw a little more it can and will go broke if you live to 90.

Take the pensioner.  You hear of cops and teachers and random fed employees  making 70,80,90k for the rest of their lives and when they die it goes to their spouse.  I guarantee they didn’t put 647k (35x18.5) of their own money into that fund.  They also don’t likely put in 35 years to get that.

personalfinance,About to receive a sizable lump sum and want to put it towards debt. Strategy advice,"TLDR; would you focus on getting rid of biggest payments, biggest balances, or biggest interest rates?

My partner and I are about to come into a mid-to-upper 5 figure amount of money from a business acquisition. We have a decent amount of debt from running other businesses. I've put all of our balances, minimum monthly payments, rates, etc. in a spreadsheet. I know the avalanche method is mathematically more sound than the snowball method. The question I have is, given that it's a large, one-time sum, should we pay off optimizing for interest rate (paying highest first) or maximizing monthly cashflow? Our debt is a mixture of cards, lines, loans, and student loans, and of course our house and a car. There's almost no incentive to pay off our car because the loan is nearly 0&amp;#37; interest and the house is a recent purchase so we couldn't make enough of a dent in it to get rid of the mortgage any time soon.",finance
personalfinance,UK graduate. Student loan payoff vs house?,"I've just graduated. Take home pay is about 2.25k per month. Rent will be 600 or so, then allowing 50/week for food, 30 for entertainment, 40 for holiday budget etc etc I end up with about 800/month left.

I have 55k student loans, at interest rate 6%. The minimum I must pay is 10% of everything I earn over 25k. In 30 years any remaining debt gets wiped.

I could feasibly pay off all these loans in 7 years (and total paid will be about 80k) if I pour all my spare income into them. I have 13k saved in cash right now, so emergency fund isn't an issue.

My thinking however is that it would be better to save for 5 years for a down-payment for a house so that after that my rent payment is instead a mortgage payment and not going straight into somebody else's pocket.

My starting salary is 35k in a tech company(small - not Facebook etc), with potential to do a PhD. I am hopeful that I will be earning over 100k by the time I'm 35 (or even before; if I get a PhD then 80k+ jobs are not that hard to come by)

Anybody have any thoughts on this? Any ideas what my route should be with the student loan? It's more complicated than just a 6% loan since it gets wiped when I'm 50ish. Is saving for down-payment first and then moving on the student loan aggressively sensible?

Edit; further info:

I have read  links about paying down debt and am aware that generally a 6% debt should be hit pretty quickly. However, taking that 70k it would cost to pay them off by 30 and investing it would be about 200k by the time I'm 50 (assuming 5% return iirc), and I'd have paid about 130k to loans assuming 3% pay rises year on year(again a simplification but easier to approximate it as linear). Thus I'd be better off simply investing that money and paying the minimum on the loans, giving me 70k in my pocket at the age of 50 rather than 0 having paid them off by the age of 30. I should also say that I hope to be earning more than the 3% pay rises suggest by the time I reach that age.",finance

personalfinance,Pay off personal loan or keep savings,"Situation: I have a personal loan I have been paying off for several years. In March, I restructured the payment so it would be paid off within one year (by March 2019). I currently have enough money in savings to pay off the balance. There are several reasons why I am reluctant to just pay it off, so I would like some objective advice. This loan is owed to former in-laws, so there is a personal angle to this. I don’t have to interact with them, my bank automatically sends the check every month. But it would be nice to be able to finally and completely sever ties to that part of my life. I can afford the monthly payment and it is very comforting to have a nice cushion of savings, which is why I’m reluctant to just pay it off. My current plan is to make the monthly payment until October, when the balance will be around $3500 and pay it off completely then, when it will be less impact to savings. 


Current balance: $6300

Monthly payment: $920

personalfinance,"Received 11k, how do I go about this with repaying my student loans?","Hello /r/personalfinance I'm a 21 year old student with 3 semesters left to graduate. 

Recently, I received 11k and I was planning to use this money to handle some of my student loan debt right now, but I'm not sure how to go about this. Here's some information about my loans: 

Loan Type | Current Balance| Interest Rate | Interest Rate Type | Status
---|---|----|----|----|----|----
 Direct Unsub Stafford| 5844.76 | 3.760%|Fixed| In School
Direct Unsub Stafford| 1,062.65 | 3.760% | Fixed | In Schhool
Direct Sub Stafford | 5,500.00| 4.450% | Fixed | In School 
Direct Unsub Stafford| 2,061 | 4.450%| Fixed | In School 
Sallie Mae| 4,971.71 | 9.125% | Fixed | In School 
Sallie Mae | 3,166.95 | 8.125% | Fixed | In School
Sallie Mae | 2,948.41 | 10.125% | Fixed | In School

Right now every semester seems to be cost ~$11,300. For 3 more semesters that totals to $33,900 left to pay with more private loans and direct sub/unsub loans and some personal payments with the help of my parents. 

My Dad is a cosigner for the private loans and is paying $75 a month to help me out. In total, my private loans amount to 11,087.07. So it seems best to pay off all my Sallie Mae loans if I cough up $87 from elsewhere, but I'd like to know what everyone else thinks. 

How should I go about this? Should I spend all 11k on my loans? (I don't necessarily need the 11k for other things considering I live with my parents, I don't have to pay bills etc.).

personalfinance,Newbie needing advice on whether go for a Heloc or Refi for some home remodeling,"Long story short Fiancee and I bought a new construction home 5 years ago under FHA. Paid 534K on a 30year loan @3.75%. Currently owe 460K and since then smaller homes in our area have been appraised at 750K-800K. I was thinking about pulling 40K from a HELOC (not planning to use remotely all of it) to renovate our backyard since it's literally just dirt (new construction) and also pay some high interest rate credit cards (5K total). 

I have also heard that a Refi would be better but I'm still confused on the whole process , my rate I keep hearing is pretty good and the new prime rate is like 4.2%.

ethereum,Manipulated ETH network gas prices look connected to EOS funded bot accounts in possible indication of corporate network attack.,"X-Post from Team JUST discord (they make popular decentralized applications)

EDUCATIONAL: Hey @everyone, we know gas prices are astoundingly high today. Let's have a bit of an adventure and find out why shall we?

Today, 40&amp;#37; of the ethereum's network is being used by this contract [https://etherscan.io/address/0x98b4ca8bd52e4ed1f28d3f30d9f567d1166c9483](https://etherscan.io/address/0x98b4ca8bd52e4ed1f28d3f30d9f567d1166c9483) A beautiful and innovative copy-paste of a default ERC20 standard token called ""IFishYunYu"" with no features. (So it does nothing.)

Yet miraculously, it seems tons of ""unique"" accounts are transferring massive volumes of this token constantly, almost 50 ETH of gas an hour have been steadily used for nearly 24 hours now. Just to transfer individual tokens to the Fcoin exchange. But of course. The exchange is just a red herring to distract you from what's really happening.

Bitcoin,Quantum Computers confirmed? A new development in the 21e8 mystery...,"[~~#~~**00000000000000000021e800c1e8df51b22c1588e5a624bea17e9faa34b2dc4a**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/00000000000000000021e800c1e8df51b22c1588e5a624bea17e9faa34b2dc4a?src=hash)

This is the hash that has gotten everyone so worked up, I'm sure you've seen it by now...

The theory is that ""21e800"" is Bitcoin ""referencing itself"", in a feedback type of loop, or some might even go far as to say that it's alive or quantum computers are at play. The reason being is because the amount of energy necessary to ""create"" that block hash and specify ""21e800"" is astronomical, literally, you need stars (plural)....

What if I said that the vanity hash was 10 characters instead of 6, would that pique your interest?

What if I said it was 14 characters?

What if I said the ENTIRE HASH held significant meaning?

Call me crazy, you won't be the first, but hear me out...

""21"" = Total Supply of BTC in millions

""21e8"" = Total Satoshis (scientific notation)

""e8"" = Theory of Everything

""00"" = 2 zeros extra, calling back to the Genesis Block (Bitcoin's Birthday)

This is where most people stop...

The massive calculations they've done are already astronomical assuming that just these first 6 characters were mined for ""vanity hashing""... It would literally require entire STARS and years of time to ""create"" this vanity hash with only 6 chosen digits...

I will now try to find logical reasoning through this ENTIRE HASH, so bare with me... Skeptics, you will have a field day belittling me, but I frankly do not care...

21e800 is followed by ""c1"", a quick google search reveals that C1 is internet slang for ""Affirmative, Roger That""

So directly following a 6 digit string that ""appears"" to be self-referential, we have 2 extra digits that are basically saying ""Yes, I just referenced myself, affirmative""

This may just be a passing thought, but this self-reference is confirmed a THIRD time with ANOTHER ""e8"" following the trailing ""c1"" affirmation...

This hash of Bitcoin has now referenced itself with 10 digits extra... That is a magnitude more difficult than just solving the hash for the preliminary 6 digit ""21e800""...

I will now reference that hash as ""21e800c1e8""...

If you understand Bitcoin enough, you understand that it is a complex file storage system designed for the ""Bitcoin"" token that we use as ""money"", but simply put; Bitcoin is a file system for data being stored on disks around the world (decentralized)

The two digits following ""21e800c1e8"" AGAIN reference themselves as Bitcoin in the characters ""df""...

""df"" is an acronym for ""disk-free"", a reference to total available free space on a file system, this again could very well be Bitcoin referencing itself and it's ability to store ever-increasing amounts of information...

If you're with me this far, the self-referencing black hole of a hash is now ""21e800c1e8df""... That's now TWELVE digits of self-reference... Not 6, 12! Do the math on THAT difficulty...

The next two digits are a 5 &amp; 1, do I really have to explain what that could be referencing? Area 51! This is also the digits where I believe the ""self-referencing"" may stop, and a message may begin? I'm not sure if 51 is part of the self-reference, or part of the message, but I'm quite sure that's where it diverges...

The following 3 digits are ""b22"", upon Google searching; ""b22"" seems to be the model number for THE most widely used ""light-bulb"" sockets, is this referencing a source of light? Illumination? Enlightenment?

""b22"" is followed by another ""c1"", as if to say ""Yes, Affirmative, What you are seeing is correct"", this is another 7 digits of potentially intentional ""meaning"" added to the 12 that consists of ""21e800c1e8df""

The hash will now be referenced as ""21e800c1e8df51b22c1""...

I have found meaning amongst the remaining digits, but it seems to be referencing ""us humans"" and our ""establishments"" rather than itself...

588 is the Electronic Funds Transfer form for [CMS.gov](https://CMS.gov) (medicare)

E5 could be referencing the US Military pay-grade of E-5, or it could be referencing E5 (5&amp;#37; ethanol, 95&amp;#37; gasoline)

A624 is a road, named 'Glossop', roughly translates to: Utopia, Heaven, or Paradise

BE - Exist, to occur or take place

A17 - Area 17, closely linked to Artificial Intelligence

E9 is the collection of 9 countries holding 70&amp;#37; of illiterate adults, dedicated to education

FAA = Federal Aviation Administration

34 is supposedly an ""Angel-Number"" linked to intelligence, and growth

b2d = Business to Developer

c4a =  Anaphylatoxin that seems to be linked to ""immune"" disorders, immune disorders by the way are ones where the cell can't recognize friendly cells, or itself for that matter, immune deficiency can be classified as ""loss of consciousness"" among the cells in your body...

CALL ME CRAZY, I DON'T CARE, I WELCOME IT

You tell me the odds of this hash generating such massive interest for no reason, comparable to a black hole, it sucked people in for a reason... Now tell me the odds &amp; difficulty of either creating this entire hash as a vanity, or it randomly coming together and each portion having meaning, arguably RELATED meaning...

Truth.... Truth will always be stranger than Fiction...

Ripple,The Measure of Success by Andreas Antonopoulos,"Here is a talk I was at in Dublin by Andreas which presents a good sentiment for this thread on how to define the success of a coin.

He mentions Ripple once at this point (note the booing (not laughter)): [https://youtu.be/mPMsbgWl9p4?t=1910](https://youtu.be/mPMsbgWl9p4?t=1910) but you would want to listen from at least 31.49 to get the context which is,

The Dominance Index is a percentage of the total market capitalisation of cryptocurrencies owned by bitcoin.

32:02Here's why this is not a good metric (of success).

32:04Here's why we shouldn't look at that metric for any of the cryptocurrencies.

32:09Market capitalisation tells you which is the ""richest"" cryptocurrency.

32:15I can guarantee you that there will be cryptocurrencies ""richer,"" ""bigger,"" more broadly accepted than bitcoin.

32:26It is very easy to do that, all you have to do is sacrifice the principles.

32:32You can make something that is cheap, fast, centralised, controlled, and censored.

32:40Then you can pump money into it and make it ""mainsteam.""

32:44FaceCoin will be ""bigger"" than bitcoin. FedCoin will be ""bigger"" than bitcoin.

personalfinance,"(US) Preventing Financial suicide of a family member. Questions about Housing, foreclosure, account histories and where did the money go, how do I find the records and disseminate?","So folks, Hypothetically speaking, I have a family member around the age 60 who has given up on many things. This person is receptive and asked for help.  I have come to the rescue and am now creating an action plan. We will be in front of a lawyer very soon. I have contacted a debt manager accredited and refereed (lol,S^P^?^) from the state we are in. That only gave me a small understanding of what I can do. Throw away and Generic round about numbers to keep things kosher. 

I am not an acting power of attorney yet, The person will give me that, asap, I just have to figure out how to do that, and would like the lawyer that we have hired to do that paper work to protect me and the person, both. I don't want to make this situation any worse than it already is.

Here is the situation. This person let every bill sit for 6 months. Just didn't pay. Told everyone everything was fine. This person is also a hoarder and I am here to remedy that and the mortgage issue. This person spent their life savings on medical bills. Everything. I don't even know if they were legitimate bills. 

The person owns three homes. One paid off @300K.
Another sitting at a worth of 150K and the person owes 100K. This can be made whole with 9K. Loan is defaulted and pre-forclosure.

and another that is worth about 150K. The person owes only 50K. Defaulted and possibly being foreclosed on. need around 10K + legal fees of Foreclosure Lawyers to get it out of foreclosure. Now, they sent a notice at the beginning of the month stating that it was defaulted, not foreclosed. Called them, and they say that its been in foreclosure for 2 months and they couldn't find the person to serve the person, yet the person hasn't moved in 3 years. So they may be trying some funny stuff and that's one reason we are getting a lawyer. I'm not asking a legal question about this. I'm just stating what I know.

There is also a vehicle involved, that will be repo'd, but that's not even a thing I give a shit about at this point.

Now, the income. None. None until the person gets about 1K monthly, SSI will come later, and a spouses SS will kick in too far down the road. We have one check coming for $900. I'm working with just enough to keep us fed and move the person to the rest of the family. I have more where that came from, I'm just trying to keep costs low. We have a huge move coming, from one coast to the other. I may fly this family member, but in all honesty, I don't know if either driving or flying is safer.

Now here is the thing. This person has possibly had health issues that make it hard to find the accounts and where money has gone. In all, this person has made a large sum, upwards of 1 mil in the last 5 years. The person just doesn't understand where they went wrong, who was paid, which accounts are where... I need help finding/organizing all this persons accounts, what went where, and how this happened. Would you hire a CPA? Can the lawyer? I am also going to track down all the medical bills. Any kind of help understanding how to do this will be of great help. The credit report helps somewhat, I have it. I am tracking down everything to give to the lawyer.

The bank accounts that have been used over the years are closed because of overdraws, The first thing I did was close the checking after paying the balance to stop the accounts from continuing to overdraw it and cause issues. I will try and get records Monday. As many records from as many banks as possible.

So far, i've found certain insurance policies that are able to be sold. I have found many different policies that can give us somewhere in the range of 50K, others much more, others less.

I don't want to go into all the details of the insurance simply because I don't understand the policies and have to get them organized better. I found them yesterday with no real input from this person.

Right now it looks like I can liquidate an IRA (maybe?), and maybe a smaller or larger life insurance policy and get the person completely in the clear on both the persons outstanding mortgages. The goal here is to get the person free and clear (sell both mortgaged houses) and get the person back into the paid off home close to our family so we can get the person well again. The person is very receptive to help, so we can pretty much get anything done. I will sell these two homes. Not short, but traditional. This will save the equity in both and I shall make sure the person has the correct accounts for retirement. This person will probably never re-enter the workforce.

So, question time:

personalfinance,Paying off Student Loans?,"Please forgive me if the following is foolishly naive. I have never posted here before.

My wife and I have a combined ~$50,000 in student loans.

We have just finished our first year in a new area with new jobs and have saved a decent amount of money. In the past year, we saved about $12,000 bringing our savings account from ~$16,000 to closer to $30,000.

We are planning to stay in this area with a slightly increased income (cost of living) and virtually identical expenses.

I've been thinking lately that it would be a good idea to completely knock out some of those loans now instead of waiting and continuing to take the hits from their exorbitant interest rates (most are 6.8% but some are higher).

I'm considering proposing to her that we knock out ~$20,000 in loans in one go, by fully paying off three of our loans (2 for me, 1 for her) that have higher interest rates. That would obviously leave us with a much smaller savings cushion, but not *nothing*.

We are planning to move across the country a year from now, and if we were to save at roughly the same rate we have been we would therefore be looking at ~$20,000 in the bank at the time of the move.

Is this a reasonable proposal on my part? Is it a good idea, but too big of a payment to do at once? Considering our rate of savings and current finances, should we consider knocking out some of them but not dropping that much money?

Thank you in advance for any advice that is offered.

which split it up across  10 or so accounts, that each do this [https://etherscan.io/token/0x98b4ca8bd52e4ed1f28d3f30d9f567d1166c9483?a=0xcd4777b5f4d8779e99ea996bb32988daf0bbbf3b](https://etherscan.io/token/0x98b4ca8bd52e4ed1f28d3f30d9f567d1166c9483?a=0xcd4777b5f4d8779e99ea996bb32988daf0bbbf3b) splitting it up across 500-600 accounts each.  Which are, the mystery ""unique"" accounts that are spamming the eth network. So yeah, it's one guy, it's the creator of the token. He was doing it during the previous Fcoin exchange competition too. He's running a multi-sided scheme, he even has bots running ""wash"" accounts. Like 

    https://etherscan.io/address/0xa67ef2aca4c6459e60821c1b1afe45812c4c1bcd#tokentxns

which is pretty cool, it just shoves the token into other accounts, and then those accounts shove it into other accounts, and then back to the big main account to simulate volume on the token itself. Try following a transaction, you'll come right back to the big-daddy account.

**most importantly** on why is this being done?  Let's see what one of the accounts funding all this eth might be doing [https://etherscan.io/token/0x86fa049857e0209aa7d9e616f7eb3b3b78ecfdb0?a=0x7a717e226a8b37b912d0effbb0aab24ab690dbdb](https://etherscan.io/token/0x86fa049857e0209aa7d9e616f7eb3b3b78ecfdb0?a=0x7a717e226a8b37b912d0effbb0aab24ab690dbdb) gee, that sure is a lot of crowdfunded EOS, hundreds of thousands to be exact. From an account that seems to receive large sums of eos and immediately market sell them for thousands of ETH, which is then distributed out to contracts like this.

personalfinance,Finish masters or start High rise window cleaning company.,"*first time poster ( might be kind of long winded)*

 I live in Canada where I a masters student and a high rise window cleaner. I've worked during the summer as a high rise window cleaner for the better part of my time in undergrad, for a year after, and during the summer break from my masters program. I have finished the first year of a Masters in Environmental studies at a Canadian university, however my province has recently cut the budget for renewable energy and are not friendly to environmental spending in general. 

I'm wondering if I should take a brake from the masters and start my own building services company or if I should finish the program (which I'm getting bored of).

My masters program is fully funded, so I'm not forgoing any sunk cost besides time if I leave. 

I used to see myself working for the government for a time and then doing a PhD to become a professor, however I'm getting tiered of accademia, and looking to make some real money. 

I am currently at a small building services company where I make an average of $450/day due to 7 years of experience with sub contracting piece work (basically I'm experienced/productive and at quickly finishing the better contracts in company). The lifestyle is really chill, I can take off and travel whenever, or take a day or two for school as long as I give notice.

I was recently offered even more money by a company who works contracts in both Canada and the southern US (overcoming seasonality of outdoor work in Canada). This offer opened my eyes to how big a company like this could really get, because this other company is HUGE. 

As I see it, space is limited and the future of cities is vertical, which leads me to believe that this could be a lucrative industry for the next 20-30 years (barring a revolutionary window cleaning drone, but I doubt it's on the horizon for a number of reasons). 

Another factor is that my father recently passed and I have an aging mother (68) who will be in need of financial assistance in the next 5-10 years. She is all the family I have and making sure she has a good life is my top priority. 

Although there are some interesting prospects in working for federal government,  'green' investment/divestment funds, consulting, I still think that getting into this line of work will be less financially lucrative in the short and long term, and give me less control over my life (making it harder to help my mother and live a good life). Furthermore my biggest qualm with window washing is lack of intellectual stimulation and social prestige. However being a business owner may, to some degree or another, resolve both issues. 

I do believe that finishing the masters may he a smart longterm investment, however the business could just as well be the same.

Needless to say I'm torn! Any suggestions/advice are greatly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Should I refinance my auto loan?,"So my financial situation currently is not great, but it is improving. To make a long story short, I went through a series of health issues and a loss of a job that hurt my ability to pay back my car loan at the time. They had a program that allowed me to put off paying and it would just go on the back of the loan every month I skipped. I didn't have a choice in the matter as I was out of work and had no income. That was in 2015/2016. A year later the car unexpectedly dies. I still owed on it, and i got a newer vehicle and put the remainder of my previous car loan into the new loan and I had poor credit, so I have a high payment of 398 and a 17% interest rate, and I owe a remainder of 15,000 on the loan. The car is a 2014 model and it has 53K in mileage. Since I've owned it I've made all my payments on time and my financial situation has gotten better. My credit score has gone up 150 points within the last year and I've recently consolidated my debt and my credit cards are paid off. Would it be appropriate to try and refinance my auto loan now, in order to lower the interest and monthly payment? Or should I wait until my situation gets better and I've paid off more of the loan?

personalfinance,Upside down on my car... what next?,"I did like most young and ignorant people do, went and bought a car from a dealership in a pinch and screwed myself over.

Backstory:
I was living with my partner and we were sharing a car they bought. I’d lived with them since I was 16, due to not be accepted in my family home for “life style choices.” 
Being kicked out of my home forced me to quit school and join the work force to avoid being homeless. However being young and uneducated didn’t land me very solid jobs- so I was working 2-3 part time jobs at a time just to keep up with the bills. This partner and i shared finances at the time of living together and we could never really save up enough for another car, nor afford the cost of insuring, gassing, maintenance on another car. 
Long story short, they left me. However, before they left, they let me know and gave me some notice before finishing our lease.  When the lease was over we would split and I would be on my own. 
I had $400 saved for a car.

I went into a dealership. Found a $5,000 car [2007 Hyundai]. But I was approved through the dealership for a loan with ACA (American Credit Acceptance) @29% interest rate with $400 down. $245 a month.

Again, I was young, desperate and in need of a car to transport me from home to work and to school since I started college after getting my GED. 

I began leasing in Dec 2016. So it has almost been two years of on time payments and since my interest is so high I currently owe $7,885. Car value in excellent condition is around $3,000 now. 184,xxx miles. I deferred my car note twice due to unemployment. Payoff is scheduled for Feb 2023. 

What do I do next? I tried refinancing but the car is over mileage and age for any place I tried to refinance. I know now that I made a huge mistake... I’m just wondering if there’s anyway to help my situation.

personalfinance,Tips or Improvements to aggressively tackle my student loans and other debt?,"Hi all, I'm a fairly recent graduate with over $120k in debt, and I wanted to get some tips/advice on how to tackle this and if what I'm doing so far looks good or any ways to potentially cut back. 

I work full time as a SWE, making *$77000/year* (salary), and doing 8 OT hours each week at my salary to hourly rate *($37.019/hr)*. RN, I'm making *~$2293* (with the OT added) after taxes every two weeks. I'm not sure how long I'll be able to work OT so I'm trying to keep working the hours until we're unable to do OT. There is a raise every year, so I'm hoping next year, my income will increase again (at minimum 10%, but I won't know till the time comes). I also work a PT job now making minimum wage, and just received a promotion so I'm going to start making *$10.60/hr* with more consistent hours, probably 20-24 hrs/week. I was making on average *$250-$275* every two weeks (prior to mininmum wage increase).

Let me know if you need any additional info, I'm on the fence about selling the motorcycle, I'd like to sell it for about $1500-$2000 but it does need some work to get running again (new tires, battery, chain/sprocket) so idk if I want to invest in fixing it up then trying to sell or sell as is. I should also mention, I'm using undebt.it to plan out how and where to put extra money towards bills, so my next pay offs will be my two credit cards, then tackling my student loans (highest interest rate ones first), but I was also thinking about paying off the car after the CCs just because that payment is really high, and I could use that towards other debt when it's payed off. I'm able to put ~$1200 extra/month towards something, but with that I wouldn't be saving a ton.

personalfinance,Paying back amortized (AES) student loan early after 6 years of payments.,"I am debating whether to take money out of the market (SPY) in order to payoff my spouses student loan serviced through AES at a 8.5% rate. I believe it is amortized (because they break out principal and interest in the payment, most of which goes it interest), which I believe means the effective rate today is somewhat lower than 8.5% (because amortized loans front end the interest). 

Does this sound correct?

* 27 y/o male:
* Bachelors of Arts
* FICO Score: 650

2 Months ago I started a new job, Inside Sales prospecting leads for an IT company.  It's a $50k salary plus OTE $5-10k (roughly).  *Job security in these jobs are uncertain - you're only as good as the last quota you meet.

I currently moved back in with my mom and helping her through a divorce/get back on her feet.  We rent a 1BR apt.

After taxes, my take home (without commission) is ~$3000.

After paying towards rent, essential bills, income earning expenses, non-essential bills - I'm left with $2000.

Not including Gas/Food.

We then go into my debt portion of bills:

* $150/m friend downpayment debt ($1500 left)
* $150/m Bank of America debt ($5000 ~25% APR)

($100 going towards interest monthly.....).  I called collections and they offered to close my card and lower my APR to %3.71.  I said I will think about it because - after doing the research, your credit score drops 15 points.  I am worried this will affect my future interest on any apartment/house I decide to buy to re-model and re-sell or even leasing/financing a car as my car is nearing 250k miles and the wheels are about to fall off.

* $25/m Wells Fargo ($2500 debt at 22% APR)
* $60/m Chase ($2000 debt at 24% APR)
* $35/m AMEX ($900 debt at 24% APR)

* $35/m AMEX2 ($970 debt - 0% APR through 9/18)
* $25/m Capital One ($720 debt - 0% APR through 1/19)
* $25/m SynchronyBank ($500 debt - 0% APR through 3/19)

I have tried and tried to do a 0% APR balance transfer and no card is taking me.  I have too many inquiries over the past year.  My mom credit is shut too.  I was just able to set her up with a non profit 503c debt management program.

I also have student loans that are on pay based on my previous income until Feb 2019.

* $25/m for Parent+ loans ~$80k debt at %7-8 interest.
* $25/m for Fed loans ~$21k debt at %3-7 interest (non consolidated).

After I pay all minimum payments (ASSUMING without doing snowball effect) and I buy groceries and pay for gas, as well as put 10% away each paycheck for savings, I have ~$800 to use towards credit card debt.

I want to close bank of america and chase but I read that your credit gets hit 15 points per card you close and the banks might not give you a loan in the future.  I'm really worried about I want to save money and flip apartments or houses and I'm worried that my credit score will be screwed up.

I had been maximizing my TSP contribution ($18,500/year), but dropped it to 5&amp;#37; so I can save for a house faster. I know this goes against the Prime Directive and it sucks paying more in taxes, but if I ever want to own a home in this area, I need to save for a down payment faster. The average house price in this area has been increasing about $30k per year since 2011 and I don't think that will change for many years, but who knows. I'm thinking buying into a house sooner rather than later even with a sub-optimal down payment and PMI is a good idea because I would then own the increased equity in the house instead of having to pay for it later. I think I would be able to eliminate PMI after a few years. 

The houses I'm looking at are currently $400k - $500k which does break the 3x your salary rule of thumb. There are a few houses for sale around $300k, but I do not like their location and they were all built around 1890 and recently cosmetically updated. I imagine they'll all be a pain to maintain.

personalfinance,Need Student Loan Advice. Afraid I may not be able to follow my dream career path with current state of affairs.,"Hello all,

I bother you guys once again for much needed financial advice. Thank you very much for the help in the past, but I've hit a new problem...

For any new help I'm getting, to give some context: I've gotten accepted to graduate school ( PA/Physician Assistant School). Orientation starts the 23rd, and school starts the 30th. I applied for FAFSA, but apparently I may not qualify... I appealed with the school and I await their reply. With the lack of time ahead of me, and unsure about my financial fate to pay for my education+living expenses (it's out of state) I'm trying to determine my options and what I should do.

1) **Private student loans -** I've been advised these are HORRIBLE, and have screwed people in the past. I've read that interest rates are higher, no support if something goes wrong/deferment, some require payment while in school which isn't feasible with a PA program, I don't have anyone to be a cosigner and I don't want to put someone in that position. Also they have repayment options different from fafsa that don't take personal things into account. I also heard that they can sell private student loans? (not quite sure how that could be a bad thing. can they change the rules on it?)

2) **Military scholarships that pay for school in return for service -** I know about these, but I'm a dual citizen and if I'm not mistaken, you must give up your dual citizenship for it. Also I was told they could change the terms, or add some contingencies keep you in for much longer. I'd prefer not giving up my dual citizenship so I can go back to my parents country to visit family. I was born and raised in the US though.

Do I have any other options? What should I do if my appeal fails for FAFSA? Any help at all? Cause I'm dying of fear of not being able to go into this program, or being shafted down the line if I take an alternative method. My mind is running a million miles an hour, and I've started breaking out in hives due to this.

Thank you. And I'm sorry if I've left out any important piece of information. Please let me know if any clarifications on details would help find a solution",finance
personalfinance,Student loan advice for someone who has made some stupid CC mistakes,"Here is my situation. I have 3(ish) semesters left at a public university.

My question is this. Would it be a ""good"" decision for me to take part of those student loans and pay off the CC debt, in order to get the lower interest rate?

The other option is to put in a high-interest savings account - most banks are offering upwards of 1.8&amp;#37; on these. However, the downside is that earnings are state/local and federally taxed, however, they too are very low risk, FDIC insured, etc.

&gt;Back in the 1980s, the original stated purpose of the mortgage-backed bond had been to re-distribute the risk associated with home mortgage lending. Home mortgage loans could find their way to the bond market investors willing to pay the most for them. The interest rate paid by the homeowner would thus fall.

Can anyone explain what this means?

By selling mortgage backed bonds, wall street essentially made interest rates lower for the American homeowner? I'm not sure how this works. Securitization = lower risk = lower interest rates? Can someone explain this one to me?

This sort of reminds of a scene from Margin Call where one of the Sr. traders (played by Paul  Bettany who is just absolutely fucking brilliant) is driving around this junior analyst guy in an Aston Martin and he says something like:  ""If                people want to live with their fancy cars and houses that they haven't even paid for. Then you \[Wall St.\] are necessary. The only reason people can live like kings of because we are tipping the scales in their favor.""",finance
personalfinance,"Next steps credit wise? 720s, with perfect payments but very thin history. How to set myself up to accomplish later goals?","Good evening all, 

 I'm in my mid 30s and up until about a year ago completely avoided using credit like the plague; I've lived my whole life on cash or within my limits. 9 months ago, I set up a CapitolOne card and was given a small limit which I set up to auto pay netflix, audible and spotify. I've thrown the occasional gas fill up or rental car on it, but always without fail 100% pay it off before the due date. They increased my limit a few months ago and my utilization is less than 10% monthly, according to CreditKarma (which i understand is not the most accurate) i'm at a 726. 

I know this is a long term game and I will continue to keep up my strategy, but, i'm curious what my next steps are? What would help me out and prove my credit worthiness in the future? Do I diversify and add on another card? Do I purchase the motorcycle ($2500) i'm buying next month in cash, on credit instead? I know it's usually argued against paying interest to build credit, but, is it worth eating $200 if it makes my future financing goals easier? I could just toss that cash in a savings account and autopay the loan with it..

I apologize if these are easily answered questions but I feel quite overwhelmed with the situation, my parents ruined their life with their lack of responsible credit usage and have both since passed. Kinda solo-dolo on this life journey thing!

Short/long term wise, I would like to finance a small van (ford transit) within the next year to replace my 250k mile honda, but my credit file is very 'thin' and has no revolving payment history, just the on-time small credit card payments. I want to be in the best position to receive a low interest rate and have financing lined up before I get to the point of pulling the trigger. As well as position myself to buy a home or workshop in the next 5-7 years. 

To boil it down, besides continuing the working strategy on my Cap One card, what should I do now credit wise to help me accomplish my short/long term finance goals later in life? I should also mention I am self-employed if that changes anything.

Thank you for your time.",finance

personalfinance,"selling home, question about dealing with cash after sale, have options within.","Throwaway account.

28 years old, new job at $100k+variable bonus, no debt other than mortgage, car loan.

We'll be moving soon to another state as I've got a new job, moving from an income tax state to a no income tax state. We own a home currently that was purchased around 2012, which has appreciated greatly during that time as well as having been mostly remodeled. We will be putting the house up on the market soon and had a few questions.

We have OK equity, which is drawn out like this:

* \-$98,000 mortgage
* \-$96,000 HELOC 
* \+$40,000 in cash (savings and checking combined)
* \-$27,000 in 401k
* \-$26,000 car loan at 2.85&amp;#37;

**Comps on our home are in the $260k-280k range**

Our real estate agent is a flat fee broker ($6k) and we will negotiate a split closing cost because we are in a sellers market in our area and believe we can get that done. So we are looking at a conservative net sale of around $44,000 taking into account concessions, closing costs, overlap with renting new place and paying original mortgage and other costs. 

So that leaves us with a total of $84k cash including savings, with no other debt other than the car loan. Would it be wise to continue paying on the car loan and put $30k cash into Vanguard? We plan on buying a house in the new state when we get settled, for the time being we will be renting. We also plan on doing a small down payment (not 20&amp;#37;) because we will be able to secure a good interest rate due to excellent credit and believe our money is better invested in the market than as equity in our house.

What's the consensus on keeping the car loan and doing a sub 20&amp;#37; down payment on a new place?

I've unfortunately managed to accrue $24,000 in debt during my time in service. I am receiving $1,600 per pay check twice a month. My current expenses are rent, internet, car, insurance, phone, credit card, a personal loan, xbox live, family support (give my family about $300 to help with bills at home), and groceries. My interest rates aren't terrible (worst being my credit card @ 10.49% APY &amp; my auto loan @ 7.04%). I have taken to using a half-decent budget on google spreadsheets, however, I feel like it isn't accurate. I'd like to use a more accurate and detailed budget as I'm not capable of creating one that is as efficient as I'd like.

While I want to tackle all my debt and knock it down as much as possible before I completely transition back into civilian life in the next year, I honestly have trouble sometimes operating solely by my budget. I definitely feel like I need advice. I'm scared of being in a bad spot financially-speaking by the time I get out as I will have to find a job immediately. My one goal is to be as financially independent as possible and yet, I feel like I've never been further from that feeling.

personalfinance,"Okay PF, I'm not in debt yet, but I want to be smart about it now that I know I will be, ft. Student loans.","Hi PF. 

I glanced through the PFWiki on student loans and it was all plans of attack and advice for recent graduates. This is great if you already have student loans, but I do not yet. 

To make a long story short, I am already in college and have not needed to take out loans until now. Until this coming semester, my scholarship and some money I make over the summer has been enough to avoid loans. That, plus a bit from the family every now and then. However, circumstances changed. I interned this summer to get work experience in a new environment and in the field I want, but for no pay. There goes the usual $2k or so I generally save over summer. Now because of family issues my EFC (expected family contribution) is zero, zip, nada. Not because of a falling out, but because the money is no longer there to give. 

As of now, I need likely between $2-3k to help pay for housing and food, maybe textbooks too. Let's err on the side of $3k. 

What's the best thing to do? Best place to go for loans? 

Yes, I have signed up for the FAFSA, yes I have some money coming. This is $3k I need on top of the FAFSA money. Being eligible for the Pell Grant makes me eligible for some federal loans, right?

I know that I want federal loans, not private. I know that there are federally subsidized and unsubsidized loans and I'm pretty sure I want to go with subsidized, right?

Okay, that's about all I know for now. 
What should I do, PF? What will be cheapest for me to pay back in the long run? Am I overlooking anything? 

Thanks for any help or advice!",finance
personalfinance,Pay off loans aggressively vs. save for retirement. Need advice!,"I graduated from school last year with about 100 k in loans.

personalfinance,Help understanding used car financing / interest options.,"So I bought a used car the other night, and it came out to around 15k. Afterwards the financing guy kept trying to sell me on these bullshit warranty packages that I know are ran through fidelity and worth basically nothing. 

The problem is that he goes ""well I can lower your interest rate to 4.75 instead of 6&amp;#37; if you do the warranty, but also mentioned that we could cancel the warranty at any time.

I know I'd have to pay like $200 in sales tax on this $2900 warranty, but he also offered to write me a check for the taxes to cover that. 

Is it even worth my time to entertain this warranty, knowing full well that I'm going to cancel it almost instantly? Or should I just take the higher interest rate for now and then refinance it elsewhere almost immediately? For reference, I have a steady income of around 55k / year as a nurse. My credit score is around 750, but unfortunately I don't have a very huge credit history, and my credit cards that I have don't have huge limits due to me having them since like high school.

personalfinance,Housing re-finance and buying new car together?,"Hi everyone, I think I have enough equity built up in my home, to at least eliminate my PMI payments. Then, I don't know, but maybe the interest I am paying which in the higher 4's could come down (as my credit score is a lot better than when I bought my home, but I hear interest rates are rising so who knows), and also another maybe is that I could potentially find someone to do the re-finance without closing costs. If all of those maybe's turn into definitely, I will pull the trigger. But now by end of year, I am planning to buy Tesla Model 3 (already have the invite, but holding on to it), I will most likely get a loan for it for maybe 20K and pay the rest as down payment.

Now my question is:

1. Should I go ahead and re-finance first, or get the car first? There will be hard inquiries on both of those things, right?
2. Is there any other thing that I'm missing, like when I go to re-financing the house, can they also give me some sort of a discounted rate if I get the car loan from them? Or are the auto loan and housing loans completely different things and they don't touch each other?

Together, we make $45,400 a year before taxes. We have $20,000 set aside for a down payment. Neither of us have any debt. House is in a small town in Iowa.

I've gone through some online calculators, and it seems like the monthly principal and interest payment will be in the ballpark of $450. Does that seem right? I've been talking to my parents and they think that seems low. The bank we would be going through would give us a 30 year loan with a  4.375&amp;#37; interest rate. The calculators are also estimating homeowners insurance at roughly $30, and property tax at $110. My parents think that seems low as well. I have no frame of reference for these sorts of things since I've never owned a house before.

I currently have housing costs estimated at $600 a month, which includes property tax and homeowners insurance. I have utilities estimated at $200 a month, which is an estimate based off of utilities paid by previous tenants. (Fiance's dad used to rent this house to college kids.)

personalfinance,Empty nester recent divorcee' w/no retirement,"I'm 55, an empty nester.  I recently went through a divorce leaving me with little to no retirement (20k).   I am a remote employee for a healthcare company living in the extremely expensive Seattle area.  Kids all unmarried (no grandkids) not thrilled w/the NW anymore and considering relocating back to the south.  
Currently, I owe 275 on my home, which has been valued at 549.  I've got a significant amt of credit card debt as a result of the financial impact of the divorce, followed a few month later by a natural disaster (home owner insurance has a lot of limits), then getting a kid through a rehab program and lastly, a brief lay off. As soon as I'd sort of come up for air, another financial tragedy would occur and, for the first time in my life, I found myself with a crap credit score and really close to losing everything.  Easily the toughest time in my life.  I made bad financial decisions I'd  never have otherwise made had I not been in a total ""give up"" frame of mind.  I lost 95% of my belongings in the disaster, paid out the arse to cover areas the insurance didn't pay, and if the rebuild takes longer than your homeowner's ALE will pay - you're paying for your house AND you temporary housing...  (that's what happened to me) 

I've got two cars, one I'm upside down (big time) on a high interest rate loan (thank you crap credit), and am trying desperately to pay down the principle so I can sell it outright and call it a wash.  The other car (4yrs old) has a high interest loan, but is a solid vehicle w/good gas mileage - nothing fancy.  

Now, I am obsessed with NOT spending money, and put everything possible towards debt.  I don't eat out, I don't shop, don't go to movies... My guilty pleasures are netflix and working on my house.  My house payment w/tax and insurance is 1985/month (and will go up due to recent increase by the county assessor).  Homes in my neighborhood sell in days - very desirable location.

I want to relocate and be closer to family in an area with a MUUUUCH lower cost of living.  It will likely be another year or two before I would actually move out of state.  
I don't want to sell and rent here in the NW (1bdrm apt is abt 1300/mo), nor do I want to rent while I'm home shopping in AR.  So... I am considering the following plan:

1. sell, pay off all debt, budget 20k for a used 5th wheel trailer.
2. invest the remaining 170k for retirement
3. Rent an RV lot here (600/mo w/all utilities &amp; internet)
4. When I leave WA, I'll haul the trailer to AR and rent an RV lot there until I find a home to purchase.(6mo tops)
  
Paying off all debt and going the RV route would allow me a grand total of abt 3500/mo to sink into savings/investments for retirement.  If I were to rent an apartment, this number would go to about 2k.

I'm perfectly OK living in a small footprint.  I'm used to being ""alone"" as working remotely doesn't offer a lot of social interaction - plus I travel a LOT for my job.   I basically have a big empty house, and live in my bedroom and office - so I think I'm fine for an RV.  I'll miss my garage and tools... 
I have a cousin w/a 3/4 ton diesel pickup who would travel with me to move the trailer to AR - so no need to purchase a pickup.  Upon initial purchase of the RV, the local dealers will deliver and setup trailers.

I figure I'll be in the RV ~18-20 months.  While the RV thing isn't my dream life, I'm willing to sacrifice the comfort of a nice big home if that's what is necessary to be debt free with a comfortable home in the future.

crypto_currency,Distributed Credit Chain,"Good afternoon! Today I will talk about a cool project that will bring something new to the world of financial services. Why did I call this project cool? Because he has already collected a hardcard on the ICO, which is extremely rare, and besides he was already engulfed on the stock exchange. However, I will not hurry and tell everything in order.

There are situations when we need to borrow money. Usually loans are taken from relatives or friends, who of course do not require interest on repayment. However, if we do not have anyone to turn to, then we have to borrow from the bank, that is, take a loan at a percentage.

If you look at the history of money, you can see how bankers (who, honestly, are, in fact, ordinary usurers) showed considerable ingenuity in drawing up mechanisms to increase their monetary capitals. Their main invention originates in ancient Babylon and is called loan interest. It is worth noting that for legalization of loan interest in society, usurers had to go through a number of stages. All stages of Overton Window were realized: from complete rejection of this phenomenon to the legislatively fixed norm, which we see at the moment. Personally, I do not like such a phenomenon as credit and I myself try not to use it. My opinion is that the credit should be treated as an operation - if this is a vital necessity, and you can not do without it, then of course you need to use it. But if there is an opportunity not to take out a loan, then why should it be taken and subsequently repaid interest? However, now in many countries, for example in the US, the practice of taking out loans for every sneeze is very common. Most Americans regularly use credit cards, even if they have enough money to buy these goods without credit. These are certainly extremes, but there are situations when a loan is needed. For example, when one of your relatives falls ill with a dangerous disease and large amounts of money are required for treatment, or your gas stove is so leaky from the time that neighbors begin to complain about the smell of gas, and you do not have money for a new plate at the moment. In general, such situations can be listed for a long time, but the point is that the need for such a phenomenon as a loan exists.

If you find it necessary to take a loan, then you can take it in a bank. But in the traditional financial banking system there are many shortcomings:

high refinancing rates of central banks, in connection with which credit is extremely unprofitable

the human factor plays a significant role in deciding whether to grant you a loan or not

the causal relationship of the monopoly of the Central Bank is the slow development of technology, since when there is a monopoly - there is no competition, and there is no competition - there is no desire for development

The project, which I will discuss in detail below, offers solutions for these problems.

The project Distributed Credit Chain- (in literal translation from English means ""distributed credit chain"") is a platform developed on the technology of blockages for the provision of financial services, and if more specifically for credit products.

The Distributed Credit Chain project offers the following solutions to the pressing problems of the traditional credit system:

Reduced loan rates: you do not have to overpay for a loan

Instant credit processing: you do not have to wait for a long time to approve your application

International coverage: it does not matter in which country the client lives.

Elimination of monopoly: thanks to the distributed banking ecosystem, the project seeks to break the monopoly of traditional financial institutions and return the revenues from financial services to all participants in these services

The main objective of this project is to change the system of issuing loans and loans.

One of the main advantages of this project over the traditional system is that the entire credit history of each client will be stored in the technology of the block, and it will not take a lot of time to check it, and accordingly the loan can be executed instantly without spending a lot of time on this procedure .

personalfinance,Lower income guy looking for some advice regarding taxes.,"Starting to feel the crunch quite a bit regarding my paychecks, hoping someone out there will have some advice. I'm unmarried, no children. Currently earning $14.50/hour with about 75 hours on each paycheck. My most recent paycheck, I earned $1,093. I pay $57 per paycheck for insurance, which is no problem, glad to pay that for insurance. Also paid $253 in taxes though, so my take-home was only $783. Is something off, or is a person earning my income really paying $500+ a month in taxes? I get a little back at tax time, but only around $1,100 federal, little bit from state. 

With my budget, I need to up my income or I'll just be maintaining my debts instead of paying them off, which is my first goal. Do I just need to work more to earn more? Get a second job? It's kind of depressing, but being taxed like this makes me think I'd be smarter to work less and try to maximize frugal living. But, then I would probably never beat my debts and end up paying on them indefinitely. 

Thank you for any advice.",finance
btc,"Hello /r/BTC, I'm trying out a new decentralized fundraising system and I'm a fully supportive of the Bitcoin Cash movement.","Hello /r/BTC. My name is Jkid, (Long-term unemployed) Linux Systems Adminsitrator and IT professional, Twitch Streamer, political an socio-economic researcher and analyst, and more recently moderator of /r/lostgeneration. I've been struggling to support my unemployed parents for four years as a sole income provider, and ended up sacrificing my remaining 20s and social, economic, and life milestones and it finally came to a head a few days ago when I saw a article about elderly couple who tried seeking help for month ended up deciding to end it. It brought up so much emotions because despite all my best efforts to help my own parents this may happen to them eventually, forced to live in the street or worse.

However, someone named /u/oshisat who was a long-time /r/lostgeneration user invited me to try out a decentralized fundraiser system called bitfund.cash, a decentralized Bitcoin Cash Fundraising project created by /u/akari_bit Basically it allows anyone to raise funds via Bitcoin Cash, without the need to log into an account. The process for me took an hour, but 
I already have a account with github. With trial and error and prior knowledge of basic html coming back to me from my Linux SysAdmin years I was able to set up the page. 

Already I can see the advantages of Bitcoin, particularly Bitcoin Cash. Primarily it brings the potential of bringing cash to a portions of society that can't use banks particularly lower working class people. 

And anyone with a cell phone, computer, and with a few basic safety precautions can use Bitcoin cash. A person can send money via Bitcoin cash address and the person holding the actual wallet can receive the money almost instantly, and with ATMs available in a growing amount of major cites, anyone can withdraw money without ATM fees.

As a left libertarian I want to support this however I can. That's why I want to post this fundraiser  to help me and my family from being in the streets and for me getting a fresh start in life.

My fundraiser is located at https://ndokeh.github.io/helpJkid/

Already I've set up these initial goals to this end. These are in US Dollar equvilents as Bitcoin Cash amounts change by the minute or by the day. The '+' means the amount raised reaches another dollar amount above the initial $20 goal. I will add these goals within 24 hours onto my github page as they are fulfilled or not.

~~$20: ID renewal, as you need a ID to get anything done and mine's has expired last month.~~ **GOAL MET!**

~~$120+: Passport Renewal. My US Passport was expired two years ago, and I did not realize it until I found it in their basement of stuff at my relatives.~~**GOAL MET!**

~~$150+: I will start work on a personal webpage hosted by github. Initially basic but will include my writings, my resume, my photography and videography portfolio from my time at the University of Maryland to Anime conventions and street photography and political events and vigils, technology manuals and tutorials. Basically everything I know.~~

**NEXT GOAL**:$200+ (Up to $1200+ for a year): Allows me to rent a storage room from Uhaul to move all of my stuff that has been in my relatives basement for 8 years. Many of my stuff are of sentimental value to me because it represents the life that I wanted to have before my parents lost their jobs in 2014. Books, manga, video games, costumes, posters, video game consoles, electronics, clothes, comics. They're telling me that they want to fix the basement ASAP.  In the event I can only rent a small room in a house or an apartment, I would not worry about my stuff being thrown away.

Certifications:
A+ $250+
Linux+: $450+
Cloud+: $350+

With everyone having a Bachelors degree, the only way to stand out from the crowd is to have a IT certification. I had plans to get certifications after I moved out from my parents until it got derailed. The price include the cost of taking the exam and the book that allows the person to study for it. The Linux exam costs over 400 dollars because there are two exams that you have to take to get the Linux+ certification.

$300+: Pay off Best buy credit card, that I have been paying the minimum off for YEARS and it never went down.

$1000+ (up to $12000 for a year): Allows me to rent a room and pay ultities in the DC, MD, and VA area. If I can get a small room of my own, it will allow me to study, work on small jobs, play video games to stream publicly.

$1500+: I will be able to pay off my Perkins loan completely. I had plans to pay off my Perkins loan within 6 months of moving out of my parents. Now it had gotten close to becoming defaulted.

$2000+ (up to $12000 for 6 months): Allows my parents to stay in the house while they find people to rent out rooms without fear of being homeless or have power, gas, or water cut off.

$2100+: Allows me to use professional movers to move my stuff from my parents and relatives to my new home.

$2500+ (up to $30,000 for a whole year): Allows me to rent a one bedroom apartment and pay ultilites and cable/internet.

$3,000+ (up to 15,000): Will allow me to pay off one credit card that I'm totally behind in since I was laid off on October 2017.

$4,000+: Will allow me to pay the past due rent on the apartment we were forced to move out of because we could not afford it, despite paying the rent on time and giving proper notice.

$5,000+: Will allow me to set up a Gaming/Tech Studio with all the works: Including three Ultrawidescreen PC monitors, a Streaming PC, a Gaming/General Use PC, and a Linux Server for Podcast Production/Video Gaming Streaming/Movie production, plus a stream deck. Along with a comfortable chair due to my scorliosis.

$20,000+ I will start doing a weekly political and socio-economic commentary/research/analysis writing series: At least one commentary per week, with at least one of them related to bitcoin bitcoin cash and real economy (read, on the street) developments.

$25,000+ This will allow me to pay off my entire Federal Direct Student Loan that has been lingering for years since graduation.

$15,000+ I will start doing photography  and videotography projects and allows me to travel the united states to this end and also allows me to attend and document anime/fan conventions.
$15,000+ I will begin streaming sessions on twitch.tv, and fan commentary and analysis of anime, manga, video games, and otaku culture under the brand name ""The Ministry of Otaku""

$15,000+ I will be able to write a non-fiction book in politics or in any other subject. Probably one about the media, internet culture, or socio-economics.

$15,000+ Allows me to travel to any one country in the world for a much needed vacation away from the slow decent of craziness and politically polarization of America: Canada, Taiwan, Britian, Japan, South Korea, Germany, Hong Kong.

One more thing: 3% of the proceeds in Bitcoin Cash in this fundraiser, will be used in some kind of way to support the movement.

If you have any doubts of my need, I will send you a folder or evidence of my proof of need ,including a letter of reference, via PM.

Thanks for your appreciation in advance.

personalfinance,Debating on whether to pay off car earlier or invest...,"Here’s my situation.

I financed a car back in 2016 @ 2.49% for 60 months, and I have around 13k left on it today. I’ve been debating on whether to pay this car off earlier or invest it instead to beat the interest rate. As you all know, a car purchase is usually a losing game but the longer you drive your car the more bang you get for your buck. I actually wouldn’t hesitate to pay it off if it was a reliable car that I know I could drive for a super long time with low maintenance costs (toyota, honda, etc.), but I was short-sighted at the time and went for a CPO 2014 MB C300. It’s all good right now since it has relatively low miles, but I started to think about the risks of potential future repair costs once it’s out of warranty. Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely love driving this thing, but this made me think that this car is not worth the risks of driving it long-term.. and I decided my next car should be something reliable that would impact my finances the least. I feel stuck right now though, a part of me tells me to just pay off the damn car and take the hit, but another part says don’t be stupid, just pay the minimum monthly rate and get rid of it at the end of the term and invest in the market now for higher returns.

I don’t have any other liabilities besides my mortgage. I have a healthy income, but I started out late because of professional school and paid off my massive school loans a year out so don’t have as much in assets at the moment. Also maxing 401k, hsa, roth this year.

personalfinance,Pay it off or not?,"I have the opportunity to pay off my mortgage, but I don't know if it's the right choice. I'm hoping you guys and gals can provide some guidance to help me with this decision. Here is the info I think you would need, but if you need more let me know. 

I'm a 32 y/o guy, married with no kids and we don't plan on having any. My job is steady and pays well, especially for the area. My wife (31) doesn't work or collect disability or anything like that. It works best for us that she doesn't work because my work schedule is erratic and we like spending time with each other instead of having conflicting work schedules. I've amassed enough money where I could pay off my mortgage, but I don't know if it's the right choice. Here is what I believe to be the pertinent information.

Total savings: $101,208.99
Total amount owed on the mortgage: $91,173.98
Interest rate: 3.5%
Maturity date: September 1, 2046
Monthly payment: $699.28 ($424.58 principal &amp; interest; $274.70 escrow)
Credit score is great (780+ depending on the agency).

Between my job and VA disability, I bring home about $6,200 a month. I also have a second job that I do on a case by case basis that brings home a couple hundred dollars here and there, but I don't count it towards income because it's infrequent, often not making any money for a few months at a time. I'm currently in college and collecting additional monthly income from veterans benefits (about $1,000 a month), but I will be done with school in about a year and a half and will lose that money, so I don't count that towards my monthly income either. I will have $0 college debt because of the veterans benefits. I don't have any other recurring debt besides utilities and internet. Company pays for health, dental, vision. The wife and I both have life insurance, with me having substantially more. Both cars are new (2014 &amp; 2015). We pay our credit card off every month. As far as retirement savings, my company deposits an additional 20% of my salary into a SEP IRA that we control. I'm not adding anything else into retirement accounts yet.

The house we live in is not going to be our final house. We are hoping to move in about 3-5 years and we aren't sure if we want to sell or rent (leaning towards selling). As it currently stands, if we sold today we would have about $52,000 in equity. 

So the big question is, would it be worth it to pay the house off to avoid the interest, or is it better to keep paying the minimum and getting the tax credit? Also, what are your thoughts on the rental/sell debate?

Any advice is appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,"Maxed Out Credit Cards, No Savings","Long story short, my boyfriend of a few years just recently revealed to me that his credit cards are almost maxed out. There’s about a $10000 balance over a few cards with interest rates around 20%. He has no savings right now, but every paycheck is going towards paying them off. His parents aren’t able to help as they’re going through a tough financial situation too, and I’ve already lent him all my emergency savings to lower the balance/interest.

I’ve read up on the debt info on this subreddit and we tried to apply for a 0% APR balance transfer credit card, but he was denied. He also applied for a personal loan, hoping that the APR would be less, but it’s the same.

Right now, he makes about $3000 a month, and half of that is going towards the debt, while half are going towards new expenses.

Is there anything else he can do to minimize the interest he pays/pay off the debt quickly? I have good credit (800+), and no balance on my cards, but also only $5000 in savings and a bunch of student loans. I was considering taking out a personal loan to help since he can’t get one under his own credit, but like one of my friends pointed out, he doesn’t have a good track record with financial responsibility, and I wouldn’t be able to make the payments if I get stuck with it.",finance

I currently drive a 2002 Honda Accord with 250k miles on it. It has been at the mechanic and I was quoted $5,000 to fix the transmission and some other issues, and the car is valued at around $2,500. 

I was approved for a $25,000 loan for a new car and I have been looking into certified pre-owned. Because of the short length of credit I have the interest rate is 7.5% for a 60 month loan.

Would you recommend taking out a 5k personal loan to fix the car, or go ahead and get a new car with the auto loan?

My summer job from my teens had a mandatory percentage of each paycheck go into a retirement account. Now that I am no longer at this job, I am choosing to withdraw the balance of that account, rather than transfer it to a new retirement account. The account is through PARS (public agency retirement services). They state that early withdrawal has a federal tax penalty of 20% (in addition to state income tax), so that amount will be withheld before it is dispersed to me. However, everywhere I have looked online says that the federal tax penalty is only 10%. I don't know nea

crypto_currency,All you need to know about Distributed Credit Chain,"Governments around the world today are being run with finances and this helps the government carry out its activities efficiently. Given the important role financing plays in the world today, there are financial institutions on ground to ease the financial burden of interested individuals.

However, haven identified its crucial role in the world economy; the financial industry had over the years become monotonous and highly centralized. All transactions especially financial transactions must pass through them and this added more “power” to their already existing leverage.

Certainly, you might have certainly been a victim of financial brunt posed by these financial institutions. Let’s narrow this down a bit: Mr. Festus who is an importer needed some fund to clear his goods at the wharf. He approached his bank for loan only to get stringent terms before his loan request could be processed. Part of the terms included a high interest rate on the loan and literally unimaginable collateral in addition to sureties in like terms. Mr. Fests was devastated and didn’t know what else to do. More disheartening is that he has chances of losing his goods if not cleared within few days.

The above is just a tip of the iceberg on the monopoly financial institutions have and which they don’t hesitate to exhibit at the least opportunity. Most financial institutions issue low interest for its lenders and investors but demand excessive interest rate from its borrowers. This action is not encouraging and haven been in existence for many years, it is important and very urgent that something must be done about this.

Introducing DCC: The Decentralized Credit Chain
The major reason why traditional financial platforms and institutions have outright monopoly is because of their centralized nature. They thus manipulate the borrowers and users to bend towards their interest.

But now, we have a new platform that will threaten the continued existence of the traditional financial institutions and platforms. I’m talking about the Decentralized Credit Chain (DCC).

DCC is here to change the monopoly of traditional institutions such as banks. It hopes to achieve this by offering a decentralized platform – the Blockchain. Basically, DCC is a new approach and an opposite of what was obtainable in traditional banks and other financial institutions and platforms.

The Decentralized Credit Chain (DCC) offers incentives to its users and all participants in its ecosystem. This, DCC reasoned, will help facilitate the growth of its ecosystem because the presence of an enabling environment and offer of incentives will ignite the interest of users to its project.

PROSPECTS
The Decentralized Credit Chain (DCC) has amazing features such as the Digital Banking Model that will replace the Corporation Model found on traditional financial platforms and institutions.

In line with the provisions of the Blockchain technology, DCC will feature a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) business model. With the P2P feature, you can be an active participant in the DCC blockchain no matter your location in the world.

What will I benefit from DCC?
You might now be contemplating the reality of the Decentralized Credit Chain (DCC) network. You might have even wondered if DCC is not a scam in disguise! I know the traditional/current financial platforms and institutions have succeeded to gather our “trust” and made-up make-believe thought in our minds that no other platform will be better than them.

I know all that but I make bold to say that the Decentralized Credit Chain (DCC) network is actually real and will; distort all that traditional financial institutions have been perpetuating.

According to its team, DCC’s goal is to “establish a decentralized ecosystem for financial service providers around the world”. DCC also takes away the transaction costs and commissions/interest that are obtainable in traditional financial institutions.

On the DCC network, all financial firms have the same status so there will no issue of monopoly anymore. We know that most banks have popularity and much customer base and these negatively upcoming banks. But with DCC, major banks and financial service firms are reduced to the same level with the smaller ones. This offers a level-planning ground for all and as DCC hopes, smaller financial institutions will now have a stronghold and are expected to boom just as the major ones.

A change in the Financial Sector
Another advantage that the Decentralized Credit Chain (DCC) features is the ability to change the current blockchain model. The traditional blockchain model has decentralization as its basic feature but now that DCC is here, the Blockchain technology is set to be commercialized. DCC will soon weaken traditional digital currencies with its prospect of becoming a high-quality digital asset in the shortest time possible.

OTHER FEATURES
The Distributed Credit Chain (DCC) network has other amazing features you should go through:
• User Account Identification: DCC features a decentralized account system called Distributed Credit Chain ID (DCCID). DCCID is responsible for storing credit history in DCC’s smart contract. DCCID is generated through a Public-Private- Key Pair and anybody on the DCC ecosystem can create their DCCID even when they are offline. DCCID is fully protected as it uses the digital signature technology on every data exchange.

Other features on the DCC network are:
• Non-Cooperative Game between participants
• Virtual Asset Lending

I was recently offered a job in Wyoming making roughly $75,000 a year.  I know this may sound silly, but my question is, is $75K a livable/comfrtable family wage now days?  I have been so sheltered by the military, I have no Idea what it is like.  I have looked into healthcare, housing, etc.

My thought process looks like this:

Take home: $4400

Healthcare: -$420

Housing: -$1700

Utilities: -$300

Car: -$400

SL: -$200

Insurance: -$130

Random: -$250

Leaving me with $1,000 for groceries, fun, investing, etc.   Is this livable/comfortable in the U.S. nowadays?  I also have my GI Bill if things got hairy.

Note. I do understand the good benefits of military as I have briefed, and been briefed many times.  It is just a good time for myself and my family to utilize my skills elsewhere.  I will also still have access to military facilities to shop should I need to.  And I also understand that many make it with less.

personalfinance,Fleeing abusive situation...unstable housing and student loans in default,"I signed up for federal loans my first semester college. One of my parents co-signed. Then I did a some more semesters and took out loans each time.

I took a year off to try and earn money to pay down these debts.

At the end of that year, I called the federal loan people to ask about my options for an affordable repayment. I also went back to school on short notice, ironically in part because one of my abusers threatened that I had to. All in all, It was a matter of life and death for me to move out into my car and take classes again. This all happened pretty quickly.

But unfortunately I didn’t have much planning and the decision was made relatively quickly.

So I’ve been living out of my ~5k car (on which I pay $100/month) for a year now, and I don’t receive any mail. I work the best job that I’ve been able to find around here, and it pays $11/hour. I’ve gotten my budget down to about ~$600-~$700/month (liberal estimate) by living in my car and eating as cheaply as possible.

There are clauses in my contract that don’t allow me to pick up a second job, but thankfully it seems I’m getting promoted to a $30k full-time role.

Since I work inconvenient hours, it’s difficult and seemingly impossible for me to make it to places where I can get on a computer while also using a phone and printer to sort my messy financial situation out.

Yesterday, I finally got a chance. I got to the library and sat down to print out my tax documents to file for my tax refunds, which I’ve been looking forward to for a while now. The refund will give me about $1500, which is like a lifeline in itself. As I opened my email, the first message in my inbox said my student loans had gone into default. I was so disappointed and didn’t know what to do.

It seems the loan people have thought that I’ve been out of school for the past two years, when I actually enrolled again recently. According to them, they don’t penalize students for not paying if they’re enrolled. But because of an issue with my school processing my financial aid, the loan people thought I’d been out of school for two years and just not paying, I guess?

Anyway, I’m not sure what to do. I’m assuming I won’t get my tax refund anymore. I’m homeless, and I need my car to get to work. Public transportation is a bad option for where I live. I’ve worked relentlessly on trimming my budget to where it is now. I thought I was finally going to get things moving forward efficiently when I read that email. Now I’m trying to figure out the best way forward.

personalfinance,"Just learned the scale of my girlfriend's student loans, I have none. What should we do, and what should I do?","Note: I am solely looking for financial advice for my girlfriend and self, not relationship advice.   

  **Meet Colenotphil**  

I'm a 24 y/o dude who works in marketing, meh salary (~$50k) in Connecticut, USA where there is a high cost of living (not Seattle-high, but I would wager in the top 5 most-expensive states). I have slowly been working to get my personal finances in order:  
  
1. I have no student loans,   
2. a growing savings account ($1000+/mo),   
3. IRA (small contributions here and there) and   
4. 401k (10% + 2% match)     
5. Credit Score ~780, have never had installment loans  
6. Rent $700/mo plus utilities, $120/mo car insurance, no car loan, 
  
I am not the best with money, but I think I have pretty decently-sound financial practices and am working to save even more. I do like to ""party"" a bit and probably spend too much on food (I do cook in a lot though), booze, and activities.   
    
  
**Enter girlfriend**    

Recently I met an awesome girl who I really enjoy the company of. Without going into specifics, I have never had a relationship quite as close as this. We have a ton in common and are very sexually compatible. We've only been dating a few months, but I feel really good about us.   
  
Last night she let me on to just how much she owes in student loans. I always knew it was high, but I imagined like $60k. It's more like $150k, partially her own loans, partially her mom's loans. Her mom wants my girlfriend to pay off her (mom's) loans first and put her own on hold, I know nothing of interest rates. I do not believe my girlfriend even uses credit cards, I have only seen her use debit. 
  
Here comes the hard to swallow pills: she is a photographer by study, but namely has older equipment she needs to upgrade ($5000+ easy). She is working nannying jobs that bring in $1000-1200/wk max, no benefits of course. Frankly the situation seems rough no matter how you look at it. I don't think anyone has ever helped her much with finances and while I am still evaulating if I want to be with this girl long-term, I want to help her because I care. 
  
I've done research on this sub and it seems the advice is generally:  
  
* I should not sign for or help financially, we are not married and these were not my decisions
* she should try to tackle the highest interest rate loan first    
* she should take a job outside photography, whatever pays the bills
* call the loan issuer and explain her income, negotiate for the lowest monthly payment possible, apparently there is a law if she somehow pays off every payment for 20 years the rest will be forgiven?
* Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) could be an avenue, but (I'm speculating here) I have heard Trump is talking about getting rid of this, and since student debt is so big in the US, there is likely a lot of competition for limited funds, a big gamble that 10 years down the road she'll have these paid off right?  
* Some redditors have said ""parent loans aren't your loans, you do not have to pay those"", personally I feel it's wrong to fuck over a parent like that and not pay it off. Plus my gf lives with her mom and sister so that would probs get her evicted.

personalfinance,PAYE monthly payment to low?,"Hey PF;

i subscribed to this forum and am making great headway on my student loans. taking a lot of advice in going into a PAYE plan i got everythign in order and applied. i just have a couple questions as i think my **MONTHLY PAYMENT IS TO LOW FOR ME**. i used several calculators i found online and estimate my monthly payment should be round $400, however after i applied i just recieved a notice that my monthly payment is $19?! all my paperwork is square; i am just worried that they made a mistake and will come back in 6 months and ask for money for a correction. i think that they calculated my payment based on my 2017 w-2 in which i was un employeed.

i am happy/worried; my basic question is can fedloan come back and say they made a mistake and demand the unpaid interest? what have other people done in this situation. i always contribute more than my monthly payment so i am not worried about paying them off, just want to make sure that im not putting myself in a bad situation.

personalfinance,$200K in Student Loans and 26 years old,"As the title says I have Roughly $200K in student loans that just seem impossibly daunting and I feel like this debt is paralizing me from making decisions. Here are some details on my current situation:

* Salary: $68,000 and hope to bump that $75,000 at yearly review. I am an engineer with 3 years experience.
* Rent: \~$500 a month for my half, could possibly go up depending on whether a house is purchased in the near future.
* Utilities: \~$200 a month
* Car: $175 a month for insurance, car is paid off but 11 years old and at 230,000 miles. So sporadic repairs may add $60 a month.
* Credit Card Debt: $7000 at 24% should be completely paid off by april of next year
* Fed Loans(My name): $39000 at 6.125% apr
* Fed Loans (Parents): $165,000 at 7.375% apr
* For both loans paying at minimum, I am spending $1,513 monthly
* For all loans and credit cards I make equal payments every paycheck (twice a month) to help reduce interest charges
* I have a $20 daily budget that includes gas, food, and fun.

I've been planning on paying off my credit card debts first to raise my credit score, and to focus on the larger debts.

As my car is getting up there in age, my gut feeling is that I should start saving about $400 a month towards a new one, but then on the other hand I start to get anxiety because i feel that extra $400 should go straight towards my student loans, which would help me pay that off faster, but then if I do need a car I would have to take out another loan.

In addition to paying off debts, I am saving as much as possible in hopes of putting a down payment down on a house with my partner.

I'm just completely stressed and don't know if I am moving in the general right direction, and how to deal and prepare for a possible new house and the inevitable need for a new car, while still aggressively trying to dig my self out of my private school education.

personalfinance,Question(s) from soon-to-be first time homebuyer,"Hello - I am getting close to buying my first home. I have a question about the loan... more specifically, getting money back from it. I'm hoping someone familiar with California real estate lending laws, or even federal ones, might be able to help.

Let's say I have a handshake deal with a family member on a residential property for $160,000 which they own outright, free and clear. We agreed on that amount based on an informal appraisal from a trusted friend in the real estate business. This handshake deal was made a little over a year ago.

Since making that handshake deal, property values for similar, neighboring properties have gone up considerably, by as much as $40k.

I am also eligible for a VA home loan and have my certification letter already.

Now my question: 

I know the lender will want their own appraisal/inspection. Let's assume their appraisal comes in at $190,000. A difference of $30,000 between the agreed upon price a year ago and an appraisal a year later. 

This place is a bit of a dump and will need about $20,000 in work to bring it up to date and doing some much needed renovation, but I don't want to drag down neighboring property values by buying well under market. 

So... let's assume I get approved for a $190,000 loan. My family member gets a check for $190,000. Our agreed upon price was $160,000. Can they then turn around and write me a check for the $30,000 difference?

personalfinance,$35k that needs to be put to use,"Hey guys, I'm looking for some advice on what to do with about $35k I have sitting in checking/savings accounts. Quick backstory: when my now-wife and I combined finances last May, I suggested we keep whatever money we had both accumulated up to that point in our own accounts and then all new money made from that point would go into our new joint bank accounts. So I had about $35k in my own checking and savings accounts and that money has basically been untouched since then since everything is paid from our joint account. The plan was so we each had a ""just in case"" fund if we ever split up, but we're married now so I don't think the money in our personal accounts is even ours now anyways, it's probably all considered owned 50/50. 


The point is, I just realized how dumb it is to have $35k sitting in bank accounts when I could be doing so much more with that money. Here are the things I'm considering:

1. Pay down mortgage. When I bought my house two years ago I financed $193k, I probably have somewhere in the ballpark of $186k as an outstanding balance. It's a fixed 30 year mortgage with an APR of 4%. In the next 2-4 years we plan on moving out and into a bigger space and either selling the house or renting it, depending on which makes more financial sense at the time. I don't want to play landlord, but I'm willing to pay a management company if financially feasible. If rented, I wouldn't need to make money from it so long as the mortgage is being covered by the rental income. I love the idea of someone else paying my mortgage on the home for me, but I also like the idea of rolling equity from this home into a nicer home in a few years time.

2. Pay down car. I have a car loan with probably $25k remaining balance to be paid over the next 4.5 years. APR is 3%. I don't really want to do this since the interest rate is so low and because cars depreciate in value, but it's my only other source of debt besides my mortgage so it's on the table as an option.

3. Invest the money. One thing the wife and I have not done in the past couple years is make IRA contributions. I have always maintained a 401k with contributions of about 10% (7% me, 3% employer match) and my wife contributes to a pension fund through her school system (7% I think) so we are making other retirement contributions already, but I know it's in our best interest to make the maximum IRA contributions annually. We could also throw money into other investment accounts once maxing our IRA contributions and probably see some decent growth from that.


I know one general rule of thumb is to look at ROI/avoidance of interest. Mortgage is 4%, car is 3%, the market if moderately aggressive might return what, 5%, 7%? So under this rule, the answer would be to invest the money, but I think there's something to be said for reducing debt. There's no guarantee the market will return 5-7%, but paying down my mortgage is a guaranteed avoidance of 4% interest on that amount paid down. So my question is, what's the smart move with this money? Leaving it in a bank account earning .4% interest seems dumb considering the other options available to me.

financialindependence,Early retiring abroad--would we be hosed on taxes compared to if we stayed in the U.S.?,"**TL;DR: Our situation seems like it allows us to pay no federal taxes once we early retire--*if* we stay in the U.S. If we early retire abroad to Spain, it seems like we'll pay a lot more in taxes. Am I understanding this correctly? Are there any alternate options to consider?**

----

Based on some answers here, it's starting to look like there's a good chance once my wife and I retire, we can pay little to nothing in U.S. taxes based on our situation. We will have (I hope) eventually close to $700-800k  in a brokerage account, and perhaps $200k+ in tax deferred retirement accounts. The suggestion one Redditor here gave was:

- Once early retired, each year convert $24k from tIRA or 401k/457b to Roth. Pay no taxes due to $24k married filing jointly exemption. Don't touch that Roth money for the 5 years necessary. 
- Withdraw $40k/yr (or less, maybe 5k less) from brokerage account to live on.
- Do tax gain harvesting of the remaining $37k in the 77k LTCG 0% tax bracket.

Sounds good. That means within about 15 years, so by age 65 or so I guess, we may have converted all our retirement money to Roth without paying any taxes on it and ""re-basis'ed"" our brokerage money significantly. I'm also not paying any taxes on the LTCG money. So we'd be not paying any federal taxes at all, correct?

(This is not as much working the system as it may sound when you realize that we failed to take advantage of tons of tax savings earlier in life when we had no idea what we were doing. We've paid in a lot of taxes that we didn't have to, so I guess that's part of our civic contribution.)

OK, now here comes the catch: My wife is from Spain, and would sure like to live there at some point. I'd be up for that, too. Now this is where the plan takes a concerning turn... There are really four issues:

**1. Long Term Capital Gains.** I'm under the impression that if we live in Spain, our Long Term Capital Gains (from the U.S. stock market) actually *will* be taxed, and not favorably ([source](https://www.blevinsfranks.com/news/blevinsfranks/article/capital-gains-tax-spain)):

&gt; In 2017, residents pay tax on savings income progressively at 19% (€0-€6,000), **21% (€6,000-€50,000) and 23% (over €50,000).**

So that seems to me, if living in the U.S., we could realize $77,000 in LTCG and pay $0 in taxes on it, ever. If we do that while residents in Spain, we'd pay about $16,590 in taxes on it. I get that from assuming Euros are the same value as dollars, and applying those brackets like so:

&gt; ($6,000 * 19%) + ($44,000 * 21%) + ($27,000 * 23%) = $16,590.

**2. Roth.** Plus, worse, the $24,000 in Roth conversion would, I think, be obviated because once we take that Roth money out as a distribution, *that too* would be taxed (as ordinary income?), whereas in the U.S. it would never be taxed again. This part I am unsure about because there is a U.S./Spain tax treaty that does at least mention 401ks and so forth, but I haven't read it carefully yet.

**3. Inheritance.** I'm due about 100-150k inheritance. Spain has an inheritance tax; I don't yet know whether there are exemption amounts. I'm hoping I just get this before we even move there, so this isn't much of an issue for us, but it's dependent on the sale of a property, so if that drags out for years, it could be a problem.

**4. Wealth tax.** Last, Spain currently has a ""wealth tax"", where you are taxed on your total wealth--not income, the money you have. For a married couple, there is currently a $700k each exclusion, so that would allow us $1.4 million in wealth before any taxes kick in. THey also allow $300k each for your primary home, if we owned one there. All of which might be more than enough to not have to worry about that. 

I know there is a Foreign Tax Credit from the U.S. that we could take for the taxes paid to Spain and apply that credit to future taxes owed...but would it be any use to us if we would not be paying U.S. taxes anyway? 

In order not to be considered tax residents in Spain, we would have to not live there for ~183 days a year. I'm thinking of being 65+ and being forced to fly back and forth the Atlantic twice a year, both of us, in order to not worry about this tax issue (and have a domicile to go to each time!) and it seems like a real drag. I know these trips and the disruption of finding a flight, settling in on the other country, etc., can sometimes be a pain. Also, I was thinking that maybe we should retire in Spain fully when we're older (70+), since I prefer their healthcare system to the U.S. system in terms of financial effects and just pure hassle. 

So, I'd like to make sure I'm understanding the situation correctly before making any long term plans.",finance

personalfinance,27 year old with a good-paying job and a substantial amount of debt at a low interest rate,"Hi, all!

I am 27 years old with a well-paying job (\~180k/yr). I also have \~200K in student loans that I got refinanced at \~3.3%. In the near future, I will be receiving \~50K (I will claim that money as a tax-free gift) and \~35K in severance (which I believe is taxable income). I now have saved up a comfortable amount in my savings (\~30k) while making the scheduled monthly payments to my loan (I am on a 10-yr plan). I have also been maxing out my 401(k) (I think, because of my income, that I do not qualify for a Roth/Traditional IRA). My last major financial disclosure for y'all is that I mayyy have to buy/lease a car soon (unless this affects any advice you would otherwise give me, you can probably ignore this last sentence; just felt like being thorough).

In my head, I have a few options regarding my liquidity:

(1) Throw everything I have (besides some savings, as a cushion) into my student loans. Without an intimate understanding of personal finance, I am leaning toward this option because it allows me to be more financially independent and free ASAP, which is appealing. I dislike being pigeonholed to my job because of the money, and I dislike the cloud over my head that is the student loan debt.

(2) Throw everything I have (besides some savings) into the market, while still satisfying my monthly payments. Assuming that my job is stable, I would be making more in the long-run by investing my $$ into an index/ETF since I have such a low rate on my loan.

(3) Some sort of balance of the first two options.

personalfinance,Strategy specific to rental property debt vs student loan repayment,"**Life Situation:** My wife and I are both working full time and we currently live on my salary . My wife uses her job to pay for her student loans, which are considerable since she is a recent graduate. We have no children and I am a M/42 and while she's 36. 2 dogs, 1 cat. We are moving into a lower mortgage home that we've been fixing up for 10 months and going to rent out our current home in a high rent area in a couple of months when the home renovations are completed.

**FIRE Progress:** We currently operate several rental units that are single family dwellings. We have considerable equity in all, but non of them are paid off. We max out 401k contributions and HSA contributions. We do not make contributions to traditional IRA or backdoor Roth, nor do we contribute a substantial amount to taxable equity accounts. The goal has been to have rental units and potential part time employment carry us until 401k accounts kick in.

**Gross Salary/Wages:** My salary $7,800/mo and my wife's is $5,500 after taxes, max 401k, and max HSA contributions. She also works a side job that we use to travel on that amounts to about $8,000/yr.

**Savings Amounts:** Roth IRA:$56K, Traditional IRA(mine) $7k, 401k $550K (mine), 401k $110k (hers), Traditional IRA (hers) $15k, Savings account: $29K

**Rental Income, Actual Expenses, and Depreciation:**

* Rental House #1(211) - Mortgage is $102K and monthly payment with escrow = $1000/mo - 10% rental management = $200 income/mo. HOA: $100/mo. Equity $100k
* Rental House #2(1912) - Mortgage is $198k and monthly payment with escrow = $1400/mo - 10% rental management = $400 income/mo. Equity is $102K
* Rental House #3 (1910)- Mortgage is $167k and monthly payment with escrow = $1200/mo - 10% rental management = $500 income/mo. Equity is $133K
* Rental House #4 (1116)- Mortgage is $89K and monthly payment with escrow = $1000/mo - 10% rental management = $300 income/mo
* Rental House #5 - Mortgage is $120K and monthly payment with escrow = $750/mo - 10% rental management = $500 income/mo. This is the future rental and will be our primary home until all debt is paid off.
* Purchased Property #6 - No mortgage but potential for rental house or sale when adjoining road intersects major thoroughfare (2-3 years). Potential Rent: $1100/mo.  

   * Combined lawn care for all units = $200/mo
   * 10% of mortgage yearly maintenance costs.

**Current expenses:**

* 1 car loan still being paid for @ $538/mo. ($13k)
* Fuel expenses: $230/mo
* 2 mobile phones with unlimited data: $160/mo
* Monthly groceries: $750/mo
* Dining out: $900/mo
* Gym Membership: $70/mo
* New mortgage with escrow (in two months): $700/mo - ($105k). This home will eventually be a rental and we will move into our new home (potentially RV or smaller home) after FI date.
* Entertainment budget: $400/mo
* Student Loans: $130k @6.5% interest. Wife's payoff is in 2023 under normal payment schedule.
* Credit Card Debt (due to house renovations over budget) $10k. I won't pay this off in full until house completed.
* Utilities: $225/mo

**Specific Question(s):** I know a couple of steps that we need to take immediately when we move into the new house. The credit card debt needs to be paid down immediately after we move into the newly remodeled home. Also the cell phone bill is partial bill for my wife's newish phone. We've looked at combining into a family mobile plan with my parents to saved an additional $60 per month. My question is really about what potential we have for my wife's student loans. Would it be better to refinance these to a lower interest rate or potentially cash out equity from the homes and use the money towards the loans themselves since you can't deduct student loan interest? One option that I hadn't seriously considered is the cash out from a portion of one of the 401ks and take the penalty to accelerate loan pay off. This would enable us to pay off rental homes quicker and achieve FI after homes are paid.",finance

personalfinance,Trying to find a way to resolve my $80k student loan debt,"Hey guys,  
I've graduated 2 years ago with a 12k Private Student Loan and a 68k Federal Student Loan. I've just recently landed a job with Google but not exactly in the field I've wanted -I graduated with a BS in Computer Science-. I live in Silicon Valley and needless to say I do not get paid enough to live with ease day by day. Right now I make about $2500 monthly after taxes, again though I live in Silicon Valley so in turn rent is a nightmare.  


* Splitting rent with roommates I'm still paying $1700 monthly.
* Car Insurance is $90
* Gas is $80 - 100 (Because of long commutes still)
* Food $100
* Student Private Loan $140
* Personal Loan Debt $240
* Phone $50  


Now all this I'm left with $180. Yes still very doable, but I haven't been able to pay my IDR for student loans for quite some time because I was either unemployed for a good portion or based on my new income they want $230 monthly which I don't have.  


I'm trying to find a new place with even farther commute for hopefully cheaper but in the end longer commutes is going to run down my already run down car which in turn makes me spend more for maintenance. Public transportation is doable but for monthly transportation like Caltrain to work it'll run me about $150 to $200 a month still.

personalfinance,2 Collections Agencies for the same debt?,"Hey Reddit,

Some backstory: I was a member at a certain large gym. I hear it's pretty common, but I too fell victim to the whole changed my credit card information and forgot to switch over my membership, was never denied entrance, suddenly get a debt collection thing months and months later. This was in August of 2016. I was contacted by Debt Collection Agency A and told I had a balance of \~$150. I paid said balance and went on with my life.

Later, I noticed I had a collections on my Credit Karma credit report. It was showing the high balance of \~150 and the balance of \~250. I was confused but since I'd paid it off, I didn't pay it much mind. I figured it was just there because it had gone to collections and was going to be a blemish on my report for a while. I don't check my credit score often and when I do, I mostly just look at the number and call it a day. This is now probably in 2017 when I first noticed this. 

It's now 2018 and I'm trying to buy a house. They ran my credit and the collections came back active. It negatively affected my credit score much more than Credit Karma told me(which is to be expected, I'm not sure how accurate that site is) and because there is an open balance it counts toward my debt to income ratio which is already really close to being too much to get the loan. I've been going through and zapping everything to make it as clean as possible. So I call the collection agency to figure out what the crap is going on and they say they've never gotten any payment from me. Since I'm positive I paid it I told them I needed to go back through my bank statements to double check before I  paid it. They said there was a $50 fee to take it off my credit report plus a 10% interest rate so at this point I'm paying over $400 for a $150 debt I paid 2 years ago. Since I'm obviously not okay with that, I spend forever physically going through my bank statements to figure out when I paid.

It's only just now that I realize the Debt Collection Agency that has no record of payment is completely different than the one I paid. But the debt is the same. I called Debt Collection Agency A and made sure; they confirmed the debt was from the large gym and that I'd paid it off in 2016. They even resent me an email with proof of payment.

I'm not quite sure where to go from here. Apparently the large gym had sent my debt off to two different collection agencies and now this one wants almost double the original money. I shouldn't owe them anything. Do I need to call Debt Collection Agency B and yell at them or call the large gym that sent my debt to two different places?

I appreciate all your help. This is my first experience with this kind of thing so I'm basically hopelessly confused. 

Tl:dr dumb gym sent my debt to two places. I paid off Agency A. Agency B has an open collections negatively affecting my credit score.",finance
personalfinance,Contemplating buying a car with my student loan,"For a little backstory, I'm going into my last semester of grad school, and I have been toying with the numbers of various loan amounts I can take out. I'm sitting at 22.5k total loans from undergrad and grad school so far, and I can take out a federal loan up to around 10.2k for my final semester. I've been driving an 07 Mazdaspeed6, but I wrecked it back in December, and I'm surprised it still gets me around as a daily driver. I have a job lined up for after graduation, so I'm going to start paying back on my loans as soon as I can. I've basically cooked up 4 scenarios as far as the amount of loan I take out is concerned:

A) I take out no loan and owe the school \~2700 (I'd be down to my last dollar if I went this route)

B) I take out the same loan as I did in the spring. I'm taking fewer credit hours, so I'd get more of a refund. I'd set aside the same amount I received as a refund last semester. If I go this route, after setting aside a portion, I'd have \~1200 leftover. I likely would not look into getting a car at this level. 

C) If I bump up my loan to give me a round total of 30k in debt, set aside the same amount as before, I'd have around 3200 to play with.

D) If I take out the max loan, and put aside the same amount as previously mentioned, I'd have about 6000 I could use to purchase a car.

I'd like to buy a car outright if I use my student loans to fund it, as I do not want to finance and likely increase my insurance coverage and pay more there. I currently make payments on my other unsub. fed. loan's interest to keep that in check while I'm in school, so I'd do the same with the new loan, which would essentially be the same as having a car note, as far as I can tell.

Since we work for the same company and have the same hours, we decided to go for it, with the plan that we would refinance and take one person off in a year, then buy another car.

We had our welcome call from the bank but were called back to bring more pay stubs and bank statements several times over the next few weeks. In early June we were told that we needed to come in and sign a new contract with a higher interest rate and bring even more stubs and recent utility bills.

personalfinance,Can someone ELI5 why using a home equity for student loans is a bad idea?,"A few months ago, my family decided that it would be best to pay for my college bills by taking out more money on their home equity loan. I don’t know much about this type of stuff, all I know is that home equity loan rates are much lower than student loan rates. My parents and I agreed that I would pay them back, month by month. However, when I looked online for using a home equity for student loans, every website said it’s a bad idea and you’re putting your house at risk. Can someone explain how it’s a bad idea, if I’m going to have to pay it all back anyways? Shouldn’t I just take the one with the lower interest rate?",finance

personalfinance,How do I get student loans,"Hi there!

I was able to get through my Freshman year without taking out loans. Now that I need to, I'm lost on where to start.

I'm in an agreement with my parent where they will pay for half my education, and I will pay for the other half. Problem is, I'm short on my half.

I qualified for 3,250 in Unsub Federal Direct loans (per semester) the school I'm going to comes out at about 9,000 per semester (Including room and board, and textbooks). That leaves me with needing another 1,250 per semester to cover my half, which I don't have. 

I am working during the summer, but minimum wage jobs pay next to nothing when it comes to actually being able to afford school. I could maybe afford to take one semester's $1,250 on my own, but that would leave me with less than $1000, something I'm not necessarily comfortable with. 

Working while in school isn't an option, I've tried before and had to quit due to slipping grades. I'm in school to get an education, that comes before all else.

Food and rent are covered in tuition since I'm living in the Dorms again. I'm a mechanical engineering major, so when I graduate I will hopefully be able to land a well paying job (relative to other entry level jobs). It will probably take a while though, hopefully less than six months, but you never know.",finance

ethereum,"Ethereum on ARM. PoC ARMbian image for Nanopc-T4 (a high performance ARM board with RK3399 CPU, 4GB RAM and NVMe SSD). Full node up and running from scratch in 2:30 hours with Parity (warp mode). 3 days for Geth (fast mode).","Hi there :-). It’s been a while.

In late 2016 [1] I released a Raspberry Pi 2/3 image that turned this device into a full Ethereum node and, few months later [2], a set of scripts for customizing an Armbian [3] image and turning a bunch of  ARM devices into Ethereum nodes as well. However, the rapid Ethereum development and the continue growth of the blockchain (as well as the increase in hardware requirements) made pretty much impossible to run an full Ethereum node with these kind of boards. 

By that time, no ARM board had the necessary resources to synchronize the whole chain. But high performance SoCs are starting to show up and these ones are more than capable of doing such demanding tasks.

Today, I’m releasing a Proof of Concept Eth Armbian image [4] for the brand new and powerful NanoPc-T4 [5] that, again, turns this device into a full Ethereum node and shows the potential of these tiny boards.

If you own this board you can give it a try it by flashing a MicroSD.
SEE INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS [6].

In case you own a similar device you can build your own Armbian image using the customization scripts (see above link)

**DISCLAIMER**: So far, the image is running smoothly and the performance is really outstanding, but it is based on an Armbian devel fork [7] with the Rockchip kernel [8] (NVMe doesn’t work on mainline kernel yet) so it may have stability issues. I expect to release a more solid image in the coming weeks(TM). Currently, there is no official Armbian support for this device (it will, for sure [9])

#ETH Armbian image

This is what the Eth Armbian image does once flashed and plugged in:

- Automatically resize the SD card
- Partition and format the NVMe SSD drive (in case is detected), and mount it as /home for storing the Ethereum blockchain under ethereum user
- Change the hostname to something like “ethnode-2fed2ha5” (HEX chunk based on the MAC hash).
 Automatically reboots for this change to take effect.
- Runs Geth (v1.8.12) by default as a Systemd service in Light Server mode and starts syncing the Blockchain
- Watch  the client binary and respawn it in case it gets killed
- Includes Parity client as well so you can switch both clients
- Includes Swarm (POC3) binary for testing purposes

You can optionally:

- Install the OS in the eMMc card through the armbian-config script (not tested)
- Change to Parity client or modify the clients settings

**DISCLAIMER: Keep in mind that without a NVMe SSD drive there’s absolutely no chance to sync the blockchain.**

#Syncing the Blockchain

##Some numbers

Parity client (--warp --memory-cache 3072) is up in 2:30 hours (25GB) and keeps synchronizing the whole blockchain in the background.

Geth client (--fast --cache 3072) takes 3 days to sync the whole blockchain (106 GB),  which is pretty impressive for this kind of device taking into account that it takes 2-3 days for some decent laptops [10] (see this great Karalabe explanation to get familiar with the Geth sync process [11]).

##Sync modes

There are several Ethereum clients and sync modes but I’m just focusing on Geth and Parity clients running as Full Ethereum nodes. For further info, I recommend reading this post by Afri Schoedon [12]

By default, Geth client runs on light server mode so we can support light clients. This behaviour can be easily changed but I encourage users who run a full node to leave this option enabled.

You can tweak the clients configuration by editing the files in /etc/ethereum/ and restarting the service.

#Stake and sharding

According to Vitalik on “Marginal Revolution” [13]:

*“Casper doesn't try to impose very low latency or high performance requirements on individual nodes; we are trying to design for consumer laptops, even though we are aware that in reality some degree of pooling will be inevitable.”*

So I think there is solid possibility we can stake with this (or a similar) ARM board, but of course, that remains to be seen. Hopefully, sharding should also lower the hardware requirements for staking.

#Build your own image

There are other interesting SoCs out there that can be suitable for running as Eth nodes. If you own one, feel free to build your own image and give it a try. Building scripts updated here [6].

Instructions for building an Armbian image can be found here [14]  (I strongly recommend the Vagrant environment).

Keep in mind that I’m building the image with David Huang Armbian fork (Devel branch) [7], not the official Armbian repo.

#ARM SoCs

IMO, ARM boards have plenty of advantages over x86 desktops and servers for running as Ethereum nodes, such as follows:

- Low consumption (max 24W for this board)
- Small form factor
- Hardware and software resources are pretty much dedicated to this specific task.  No graphic environment, browsers or other apps running. 
- High efficiency and great price/performance ratio. For 200 $ you have a board with great hardware resources, and particularly a insane storage throughput
- Hardware vulnerabilities: The Ethereum network shouldn’t rely on 1 CPU Architecture (see SPECTRE issues, for instance). Vulnerabilities are no longer a software problem but a hardware one as well.

The ultimate goal of this PoC is validate such ARM devices for supporting the Ethereum network and testing if stake and sharding will be possible on these devices.

#Board features [15]

- Rockchip 3399RK (64 bits 6 core CPU)
- 4 GB RAM LPDDR4
- SSD M.2 NVMe x4 slot (PCIe) and 16 GB eMMC onboard
- USB 3
- 1Gbp Ethernet

I’ve been looking forward to a device with features like the Nanopc-T4, particularly, 4GB RAM and a fast SSD. The PCIe SSD slot (with 4 lanes) is insanely fast and far superior to SATA SSDs [see 16]. I ordered a 256 GB NVMe x4 SSD for this PoC [17].

This is not a cheap board (at least compared to a Raspberry or equivalent) but the NVMe M.2 SSD throughput is mind blowing and worth the price gap. Overall, the SoC performance is impressive.

#Thanks

Last but not least. Thanks to the Armbian team for their impressive work supporting these kind of devices and to David Huang for supporting this specific board and fixing some u-boot compiling problems.

#EDIT 24th July
Updated Image to Parity 2.0 beta and applied some kernel patches (download link is the same).

personalfinance,What Investors can learn from World Cup Goalies,"""Inactivity isn't a spectator sport, but we believe it remains the optimal strategy"" 

[https://www.oakmark.com/News/The-World-Cup-and-Investing.htm](https://www.oakmark.com/News/The-World-Cup-and-Investing.htm)

Thought this article was exceedingly interesting and topical! A summary and my thoughts below: 

For anyone who has been watching the World Cup (I'll be the first to admit that I only watch when it also comes with free alcohol and time off work), you may have noticed that during penalty kicks the goalies typically dive either left or right. However, studies show that this isn't the best strategy:

\- Goalies who dive to the right stop the ball 12.6% of the time

\- Goalies who dive to the left stop the ball 14.2% of the time 

\- Goalies who don't move stop the ball 33% of the time 

Despite this, goalies typically don't choose to stay in the center (only 6% of the time do they not dive to either side) even though it is statistically the best decision (the study was done by the Journal of Economic Psychology- you can see the references in the actual article). 

Article author Win Murray suggests that this might be because of behavioral biases. **It feels better for a goalie to have missed a ball as a result of action versus inaction.** 

Psychologically, I can understand that. If you dive, even if it is less likely you'll stop the ball, at least you did *something*. How awkward would it be if they kick the ball right and you're just standing there, still in the middle? 

The same can be said for investor psychology (except at least the whole world isn't watching your investment decisions). 

Inactivity (""buy and hold"" investing) versus Activity (market timing, panicking, or short-term investing) typically wins out over the long-run, however, it can be exceedingly difficult to avoid. Information is now more readily available than ever before, and the hold period for people (whether it be individual stocks, mutual funds, or ETFs) has fallen drastically to 8 months! Y'all, that's some serious tax burden even if they manage to make money. It was an average of 2 years in the 1980s. 

Anecdotally, I feel like I see this psychological effect of activity vs inactivity all the time in my job. Currently, people are freaking out over the ""impending market crash"" or (earlier this year) investing in cryptocurrencies. People feel like it is worse to lose out because of inactivity than it is to lose out because of activity. It is hard to sit on the sidelines while being bombarded with floods of information about how interest rates are rising and your financial world is about to be ruined or how these teenagers got rich off bitcoin. You think ""I have to do something!"" even though, logically, you know your best opportunity to perform well is just to do *nothing.* 

I think this effect can also be reflected in some of the r/personalfinance budgets and holdings that are posted. Many people have small, random, holdings (either in a brokerage, like Robinhood, or in cryptoassets) that seem out-of-place with their priorities or what they can afford. This is not to say that having a Robinhood account or Bitcoin holdings is inherently bad (on the contrary, I am one of the few people on this subreddit that thinks there are places for individual holdings in some peoples portfolios) but understanding the psychology of *why* you have these assets is important. For a lot of people I suspect- although I obviously cannot know for sure- that it is because they felt pressure from their friends or the media to get into some new and exciting thing, even though they possibly knew it was not the best financial decision. For them, they preferred action over inaction. They preferred to dive over stand still.",finance

personalfinance,Declined every loan for 15 years due to clerical error.,"I tried to type this all out but it was too long. So short version     
    
Got a car loan easy at 18... The place I worked for closed and I had to move so it got repossessed.     
    

7 years later declined a car loan for *not enough credit history*(CS 540)    
    
    
Over the next 4 years declined every single line of credit even 500 personal loan. (CS 540)    
    
I got told when I applied for my veteran house loan I needed a credit score of 610ish before Quicken Loans would work with me. (CS 540)    
    

Got a secured credit card for $1000 3 months later (CS 711)    
    
6 months this later applied for Amazon credit card. Declined.     

6 months later I applied for what Credit Karma said I had excellent approval odds for... Instantly declined. (CS 720)    
    
I tried to get a small 500 dollar loan through my bank.. NAVY FCU. Instantly Declined. (CS 720)    
    

At this point I'm like so upset and bewildered that I figure something has to be wrong. Why am I getting declined super small loans with a 720 now. It doesn't make sense. So I call my bank.     
    
I ask then what credit score would I need in general to get approved for a 500 dollar loan. She gives me the thing about each case is different and depends on collections and things like that.. And I said what about a 720 with no collections. And she said ""oh yeah that shouldn't be an issue"" and so I told her I was declined and she said that's strange.. So she puts in a formal request to to the loan department manager to see why I am getting declined.. And thank God for Navy Federal Credit Union they found the real reason for the decline.     
    
It says here that the reason for the decline is ""unable to verify identity""    
    
So I was like.. WTF? So I called Transunion.. And I got this lady on the phone and I have her dive into my account. She tells me my address is listed as the same address when I got the car loan at 18.     
   
So I called the next one.. Same thing.. And the next one.. Same thing.. And I updated all of them. 
    
I figured that this was always my problem. Obviously the time I spent with a repossession on my credit was on me.. But after that fell off I never understood. I figured I was in the worst catch 22 of my life. A year later I applied for another small loan. Still instantly declined for  *not enough credit history*     
    
2 years of 711 to 720 is not enough credit history? What is the deal. I have no open collections.. No reports of bad payment. My credit is essentially spotless right now with a 1000 dlar limit card with a 40 dollar balance as of last reporting.     
     
What the heck is going on.",finance
personalfinance,Saving vs paying off debt.,"Hoping to get some advice on my options with the current debt I have. 

I have roughly 7500 left in my student loan, and around 13k for my car. I don't know the exact interest rates, but I know my student loan is lower than the car. They're both expected to be paid off by 2013. I don't have any credit card debt, so I'm trying to decide what to do. I have an emergency fund (1000$), but I don't have a savings other than that. 

My questions are, do I snowball the student loan first? Pay off my car since it has higher interest? Should I put more into savings? Right now I'm basically putting every dollar I can into my student loan since it's the lowest debt I have. Hoping for any kind of advice I can get.",finance
personalfinance,What to do with bonus money?,"So I recently signed up for a retention bonus.  $25K/year for 9 years, with half up-front ($112,500).  My employer (the Air Force) will withhold 22% of the bonus money for taxes, leaving me with a deposit of about $88,000 this year, then \~$9K a year after that for the next 9 years ($12,500 bonus, taxed at 22%).

Here's the rest of what I have going on:

Pay: $5200 every two weeks, about $4300 after taxes, insurance, and TSP contributions.  My TSP does not get any kind of matching from my employer.

Total income available to me: \~$8600/month

Debts:

Mortgage at about $150K, 3 years into a 30 year mortgage.  House was purchased for $180K with a VA loan, nothing down.  Interest rate is currently 3.25%

Car loan at about $7K, zero percent interest (2014 Toyota Prius V, purchased new)

Credit card at about $12K, 6% interest (yes, I know it's dumb to have $12K on the credit card.  This one seems like a clean kill when that bonus check comes in)Store credit card with about $1500 on it, zero percent interest.

Total debt: \~$175K

Bills:

$1500 Mortgage (with tax, insurance, etc), which is about $200/month more than the minimum

$1200 every 8 weeks (so, roughly $600/month) tuition for my wife going back to college.

$500 car payment (actual minimum is like $470)

$500 credit card (attempting to pay down the $12K one, actual minimum is like $200)

$200 store credit card (to make sure the balance is paid off before the promotional period is over)

\~$80 a month for various subscriptions (Netflix, Hulu, Pandora, Adobe Creative Cloud)

$200 church offering

$213 cell phone (3 lines plus we recently got new phones)

$85 Life insurance

\~$145 electric

\~$100 internet/cable

Total bills, \~$5000, with an additional \~$1000 for food.

Assets:

\~$30K in TSP (employer program), invested in a lifecycle fund targeting 2050 (contributing approximately $400 month, not included in income above because I don't consider it ""available""...it's invested before I get the money).  This is a Roth account.

\~$17K in an IRA through the bank (currently $50/paycheck or $100/month contribution).  Also a lifecycle fund, targeting 2050.

\~$12K 529 plan for my daughter

\~$9K in stocks through Sharebuilder.  Some individual stocks, but the bulk is in the S&amp;P 500 index fund

\~$13K in savings account.

Other things to keep in mind:

As a member of the military, I was able to transfer my Post 9-11 GI Bill to my daughter.  So she's funded for 36 months at the in-state tuition rate of any college she attends.  There's also the prospect of attending a Yellow Ribbon Program school, which would pay the difference between the GI Bill and tuition costs.

After the 9-years (which was the commitment made in exchange for the money), I can retire from the military with a pension that will pay approximately $4600 a month, or $56K a year.

I have no medical insurance costs since all medical care is through the military.

So, after laying all that out there...what's my best course of action to use this money wisely?  Options I'm considering:

1. Pay off the $12K credit card.  Instant $500/month boost to the cash flow, instant 6% payoff on the investment.  Seems like a no-brainer.
2. Pay off the car.  Yeah, it's zero percent...but it's also another $500 bill every month.  This one can probably be argued either way.
3. Make some home improvements.  Not tens of thousands of dollars...but we are going to live here for a while, and we will have to sell the house eventually.  I'm considering some new floors at (napkin math, no quotes yet) approximately $5K and replacing a fence at (again, just estimating from the length of the fence and average cost found on the internet) approximately $6K
4. I'd like to increase the regular contributions to my investment accounts as the cash flow is freed from those other bills.
5. Finally, even if I do everything I'm considering...I will still have almost $60K just sitting in my checking account.  What would a good use for this money be?  I'm thinking - use this as a cushion to ensure I have enough money to max out the IRA account; put it into the investment account (but that isn't tax advantaged...?); find other improvements to the home (we will be here for the next several years, and it would increase the resale value); dump some into the savings account (we recently drained $20K from the savings to pay for plumbing repairs...$13K is not 6 months worth of income, as you can see from the numbers above).
6. Things that are not on the table: new cars, new house, investing in real estate to become a landlord, weird or exotic investments (like, say, BitCoin).  I have enough tolerance for risk to invest heavily in the stock market...but not enough to risk it all on a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" investment opportunity.  I also want things I can ""set and forget""...I know that I, personally, am not motivated or educated enough to try to pick individual stocks, day trade, time the market, etc.

If you spent the time to read all that...thank you.  I appreciate the help.",finance
personalfinance,"Our family home: sell high, buy high? Or wait it out?","My husband and I live in southern California, and make a combined $245k gross. We bought our home in 2014 for $420k. It's a 3b2ba, 1800 sq ft.

personalfinance,Something better than throwing extra savings at mortgage?,"Hi guys, I'm looking for some suggestions on how to improve my money management, since I get the feeling that what I'm doing is suboptimal, but I don't know what to do differently.

We're making more than we spend to where we're currently maxing out Roth IRAs and 401K and still bringing in some excess cash. No other debts. I've got $15K in a high yield checking account as an emergency fund ($15K cap), and my question is: **What do I do after that?**

At this point, all I've been doing is shoveling extra money at paying down principal on my mortgage, which is at a roughly 4% interest rate, just because I get next to no interest on anything beyond the $15K mentioned above. I know this isn't necessarily a bad idea, because it's a guaranteed return, but are there better alternatives?

I feel pretty solid on the saving/debt-minimization side, but clueless on the wealth growth side. I don't have enough experience to believe that I can confidently get a return at 4%+ through a brokerage account or something else.

Other details, if relevant:

\- Feeling somewhat behind on retirement after recently coming out of a lengthy grad school program.

\- Have kids, and we started a 529 plan for one of them, but I don't know if this is worthwhile.

\- May end up moving in a couple of years, but if not, some major home projects (basement/bathroom) are \~4 years out.",finance
personalfinance,Student loan and credit,"So I took out student loans between 2008-2009. Finished school 2010. Paid monthly payments until 2012 but then I lost my job. Haven’t been able to pay since. They went to collections and have been burning interest. It’s really stressful. About 20k in private and 15 k in federal are now in collections(original balance).  There are like 4 loans per private/federal so they are small and can maybe pay off one by one in order of smallest to largest.  

I have a good paying job now (60k).  What’s the best option for repayment?  Should I save and bulk pay them off?  Will collection companies write off interest if I can pay the original balance?  

Do I just start making monthly payments ?

I work for the government which has like a 10 year repayment forgiveness program. Should I focus on repaying the private loans and minimum pay the government loans in hope of forgiveness? 

Also, about building credit. Since I have bad credit is there a credit card company that I can like pay a deposit on to start it up? I don’t think I’d qualify for most standard credit cards. 

Who can I get good financial advice from? Like a Credit Union maybe?

personalfinance,Student about to graduate college with high amount of debt - Help,"Full-time college student here. Got an internship last summer that keeps extending my contract until graduation in December. After I get out of school, I plan to work full-time as an hourly IT employee with this company until I can find a salary job. I make about $2400 a month currently when I work 40 hours a week.

I have about $75K in private loans from Sallie Mae and about $25K in Federal loans. What's the best way to go about paying this off?

I already have plans to pay AT LEAST $1K a month (hopefully $2K if I can swing it) since I still live with my parents.

personalfinance,In a pretty rough financial situation,"Hello all,

I was told by the amazing people at r/povertyfinance that I could find some help here. Anyway here is the copied text from my original post:



So a little background first. I’m a college graduate with two Bachelor’s Degrees. Both are pretty low paying majors (humanities anyone?). When I left college I got a job that looked promising. Up to $2k a week they said. So I opened a credit card and loaded it up to buy suits and professional attire for the job thinking it would be a week or two’s salary that would pay it off. It never came to fruition and I quit the job. For the next 6 months I struggled to find a job and opened a new credit account and then another to pay for my everyday living expenses. 

**IF YOU DON’T CARE FOR BACKGROUND INFO START HERE:**

I got my current job which I’ve had for nearly 18 months. The pay is terrible and on top of that they’ve informed me I’m being laid off (probably permanently) and Friday will be my last day on the job.

For about 3 months now I’ve had to pay rent at my current place ($600 just for my room really). My student loans have kicked in for the past 15 months so that’s $250 minimum payment for my private loan and $180 minimum for my federal loan. 

I work in education so during the summer my hours were slashed terribly and I’ve been unable to pay my credit cards for about 3 months now. This is what’s killing me. 

My minimum payments have ballooned to $320 for one of my cards and $120 and $109 for the other two respectively. I think I can get my loans paid off this coming month but that will be my entire last paycheck. 

**My problem is what can I do for my credit cards?** The one with the $320 minimum payment has already asked me to contact them otherwise they’re going to send me to a collection agency. Should I call them will it help? What can I do about my other cards?

The other have not but I need to pay them off too.

Bitcoin,Predicting the price of bitcoin,"The price of bitcoin is not like the price of a company's stock, or the value of a currency, or even the price of gold. A company's true value changes in relation to its surrounding industry sector, the performance of the sales of a product, or the changing of management. There is no technical difference between the Euro and the Dollar. More gold can even be produced by investing in mining the Earth's crust for more gold.

Bitcoin is technically unique. It is the first, most battle-tested, most secure, and largest, decentralised currency. And unlike gold, or any other commodity, there is an absolute hard limit of 21m bitcoin that can ever be produced. Any other object in the world can be produced more of, by investing time and human labour to produce it. There are techniques to producing arable land from desert; sea water can be desalinated to make it drinkable; asteroids can be mined for gold - it's not easy, but it's all technically possible. But no matter what we do, we will never produce more than 21m bitcoin. This leads to the conclusion that bitcoin is the first truly scarce store of value (Saifedean Ammous, The Bitcoin Standard).

Coupled with the utility that bitcoin can also be used as a near-instant digital payment system, this has led to valuations of bitcoin, based purely on its utility, of over $1 million. For example, [one research paper](https://www.scribd.com/document/354688866/Bitcoin-A-5-8-Million-Valuation-Crypto-Currency-and-A-New-Era-of-Human-Cooperation) valued each bitcoin as $5.8 million. [This other valuation (page 1 of 7)](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4133818-bitcoin-valuation-4-million) puts it at $4 million. Many others have valued one bitcoin as over a million dollars, taking into account the current size of the gold market, current size of the broad money supply, etc. Bitcoin is technically superior to them all, due to the elimination of trust, and the absolute scarcity. Bitcoin and even the crypto market in general is still [extremely small](https://steemitimages.com/DQmcHBAQaGjez1R26AG6Mrshz74cU1sxTtvCpajABoNeLcE/all-the-worlds-money-and-markets-dv.png).

I believe the price movements seen thus far are bitcoin breaking through dollar price barriers, on the way to its eventual multi-million dollar valuation. There are four major notions to bear in mind:

1. The only factors that influence the price of an object are the true value of it (i.e. how useful it is to humans), and how valuable humans think it is. In other words, the object itself, and the humans that buy/sell it.

2. The technical usefulness of bitcoin hasn't changed (it has, in fact, improved).

3. Since the invention of bitcoin, the human mind has not changed.

4. Due to psychology, immediate price movements of a product influence a human's perception of the value of the product, i.e. regardless of the usefulness of the product itself, if the price is going down, an average human is more likely to sell, if the price is going up, a human is more likely to buy.

For example, if I told you about a company who's shares have gone from under $2000 dollars, to $7000 in a year, that's over 250% yield in a year, which you'd no doubt agree is a stellar investment. But I've just described bitcoin's yield in the last year. People forget that fact, because when they see the chart, they see [this](https://i.imgur.com/VBD3cry.png).

If you were trying to assess the investment opportunity of bitcoin in July 2013, you would be looking at [this graph](https://imgur.com/R3aKpiI).

Trying to assess the investment opportunity of bitcoin today, you're looking at [this graph](https://imgur.com/eAW89zP).

The similarity is striking. Based on the notions I've just stated, I believe that the pattern of what has already happened will essentially happen again. The conventional mantra of ""past trends do not guarantee future performance"" is a statement that investment companies need to tell people when they try and guess stock price movements. Bitcoin is not the same as any other conventional investment at the moment, and the phrase does not apply. Bitcoin is a newly-discovered commodity. Everything is the same as it was in July 2013 - the product is the same and the humans are the same. Except for one crucial factor. Bitcoin's price is now of the order of $1000 instead of $100. The price movements are becoming ""slower"", i.e. the graph is becoming more ""stretched"", because bitcoin is closer to its true valuation in July 2018 than it was in July 2013. It's a curve approaching a true value - see [this log graph](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DXOUJwiVQAAg0R-.jpg:large) of the entire price history and you'll see it's actually becoming less volatile overall.

In terms of the many ""crashes"" that the price has gone through, I believe that this is down to human psychology. Again, nothing changed about the technical utility of bitcoin to force people to sell. There was no CEO fired, no technical fault that was discovered about the blockchain, there was no product released that was a big flop. Bitcoin remained the same. Indeed, the biggest external shock to bitcoin has been the bankruptcy of Mt Gox, which was handling a staggering 70% of bitcoin trades before it went bankrupt in February 2014. What did this do to the price? [It was hit, but not as much as it was hit a few months earlier, at the end of 2013](https://i.imgur.com/BdPSwQz.png).

So what happened at the end of 2013? It was the first time bitcoin was priced at over $1000.

Powers of ten, especially powers of ten of the dollar, which is the most common currency of bitcoin trades, matter hugely. Imagine living in a world where bitcoin had only been worth tens of dollars, then suddenly it's over a hundred dollars. It looks expensive, so you sell. Why do shops sell things at $9.99? Because $10.00 looks expensive. Why do people say ""you look like a million dollars""? Why not ""you look nine hundred grand""? If you told someone ""you look like nine million dollars"", they'd ask, ""why not ten million dollars""? People think in terms of top tens, centuries, millennia. There's a TV show called Who Wants To Be A MiIIionaire, where the top prize is exactly $1,000,000. If the top prize was $999,999 it would be frustrating. If it was $1,245,379 it would be arbitrary and weird.

Human psychology of the power of ten is the only reason for bitcoin's major crashes. If you look at the [all-time log graph, overlaid with dollar powers of ten](https://i.imgur.com/CC25CON.png), you'll notice that every single time bitcoin breached a dollar power of ten, it looked expensive, so people generally stopped buying and started selling. It's that simple. Obviously the pattern won't be perfect - sometimes a whale will come in and temporarily force the price to well over a power of ten before it crashes back down. But the fact is that every time it breaches a power of ten, it looks expensive, so it will be sold until it drops below that power of ten.

What about non-dollar power of tens? In April, a strange price movement happened which looked like a mini-crash, yet it wasn't associated with a dollar price mark. You'll probably be able to identify the price movement [here](https://i.imgur.com/KUcRToF.png). It just so happens that [this mini-crash happened at the 1 million Yen mark](https://i.imgur.com/DgPS7Zn.png). It was the first time it had crossed that value in over a month - Japanese buyers must have seen this, then piled in. It looked expensive to the holders, so they sold. The effect is reduced in scale because the Yen isn't used as much as the dollar - but the effect is the same.

Looking at 2013's crash - the time from breaking through the dollar power of ten barrier and the low point was 3 months. 5 months after that, it had breached the next power of ten, before enduring a longer selling period (the longer selling period is because of people's reluctance to sell something that has just broken through 2 powers of ten. People look at linear graphs, not log graphs). Comparing to the crash we've just gone through, and assuming that we're recovering from the low point now (as it looks like we are), it was around 6-7 months from the power of ten mark and the low point (around twice as long as in 2013). [See comparison](https://i.imgur.com/AZ2qowl.png). Assuming the pattern roughly repeats, I estimate that around July-August 2019, bitcoin will be valued at $100,000. It will peak just above that (maybe $110,000), then endure another very long selling period of several years (someone who famously made a bet about eating part of himself will (un)fortunately lose), where it will reach a low of around $20,000 to $30,000. The cycle will then repeat again, but even slower - it will climb and eventually break through the million dollar barrier, slowly crash below it, then slowly climb possibly to the ten million dollar mark, where it will gradually fall below and settle at its true value of 4-5 million dollars, per the valuations above.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,(US) Is it a bad idea to go about my banking with multiple institutions?,"##**Hey guys!  Im trying to get the best idea I possibly can for whom I want to bank with, with-in the near future!**  Here is what I have to say:
 
**Current Banking info:**

* One Chase Savings account
* One Chase Checking Account
* One Chase Credit Card (Amazon Prime 5% CB Rewards card)

---|---

* One Paypal account (linked to chase, used for ebay and minor online spending)
* One Paypal ""business"" Credit card, used as a debit to earn 1% Rewards.  I dont ever use this card.

---|---

* ROTH IRA (TDAmeritrade)
* Individual Investors Account (TDAmeritrade)
* Client Rewards Credit Card (TDAmeritrade) (used for all transactions just about)

---|---

* One Khols Credit Card - *(First credit card ever, co-signed 4 credit score booster at a young age)*

***
At the moment. My chase checking is routed through everything.  I dont use my debit card anymore from the checking account.  Instead, I use my credit cards, dont buy what I cant afford, and pay them off immediately.  I've also stopped using the amazon credit card unless for an amazon purchase.  But i've limited my spending for the most part anyways.  Basically, all my spending at this point is done on my TDA Client Rewards card, bills, etc.  That's Because I receive 1.5% cash back on everything, which is matched 10% when deposited into my Roth IRA.

*Effectively, I see this as allowing me to spend my money now on required expenses to live, but benefit on them in the future w/I my roth, or the other TDA account if my IRA was max'd in the year* 

***
#**I am wanting to start budgeting more intensely, and this is what I want to do: (I think)**

With every paycheck (lets say its 1000$) I will to split it up as follows: *this is a rough example*
***

* 15% into savings:
    *  Partial of it goes into the ""E-fund"", an emergency fund - savings account.  Preferably an account with High yield APY.  I want to start this account off with a $1,000 deposit, &amp; a portion of each paycheck being deposited automatically.
    * The other portion is placed into a short'er term, ""big Purchases"" savings account, separate from the above account. with high yield, meant to be used for down payments of cars, homes, and big/ little life changes.  Apart from tapping into any emergency fund.

***
*  The 85% remainder of a paycheck would be deposited into an interest bearing Checking account.  This I would use as more of a place for my money to sit until I pull from it and place it where I need it to sit.
    * So now 85% of my income is sitting in my interest bearing checking account.  Manually, I expect to want to transfer my expenses for the month to another savings account, we can call this one ""bill pay"".  I can calculate these by adding what I need to pay for in the month.  I.e Insurances, I pay 1000$ a year for.  So I would transfer 84$ a month to the ""bill pay"" account, in addition to the funds needed for rent, subscriptions. aesthetics, and the rest of what I budget for.
* The ""Bill Pay"" account contains the total account for my monthly expenses, whether or not they get paid that month*  This way I can ""finance"" with myself some of what im required to pay.  I.e insurance, rent, vehicle registration*  etc.  This account could potentially earn some amount of an APY, although the account will ideally never have a huge/ lasting balance so I dont think a huge APY is super important.  or even one at all.*
    * To actually pay for bills I would like to do so using the TDA Client rewards card I have.  Again for the future investing benefits I see in its reward program!  So basically I would just transfer the current credit owed from the bill pay account each month, or twice a month.  Allowing me to stay up to date on when I pay my bills. but also have the money on hand to pay it off. and visually be able to see it sitting in its own separate account.

#**So the account types I think I should open:**

* For the above mentioned savings accounts; ""E-Fund"" &amp; ""Big-Purchases"", I want a fairly large APY.  These are places Im storing money for an extended period of time for the most part.  The two options I've found that sound like they will work the best is **""American Express""** &amp; **""Ally""** which **(as of 7/18/2018)** offer an APY of 1.75% on any account balance.

* For the Interest earning checking account, this is where Im finding a little bit of problems.  My two options here are **""Ally"" @ .1% APY until I reach 15K balance**  or **""Capital One"" @ .2% APY until I reach 50K balance**  Leading me to wonder a bit, is it worth going from capital one, then transferring to Ally, then back to capital one so that Im always on top of the APY maximum I can earn?
    *  On the other hand do i say screw the APY its there, but i dont care.. Cause im earning more than double on the savings accounts, and this isnt meant as a savings account.  Plus if i stick with ally for the savings accounts &amp; the Checking then I benefit with the ease of use!

* lastly there is ""bill pay"".  I cant decide if I would want to open this account as a savings, or potentially a money market account.  The idea of this account is to earn accrued money over time as I push the money to the side for when it comes time to pay an expense.  However I do believe that a transfer can take between 1 &amp; 3 days within ally's money market, but the same goes for their savings account.  So i will have to ensure im always accurate on when I pay off a charge via a transfer from this account.  The only other difference is I get a Debit card to use my Money Market account funds* but I wouldn't do so. I would instead use internal transfers to cover my credit purchases.  Being careful because money can only be withdrawn 6 times in a cycle.

***
***
***

#**My Conclusion based on my research:**

I broke it down as a ""tree diagram"" for myself.  Basically by using Ally I can open Two savings accounts, a Checking account, and a money market (or maybe a 3rd savings account) and the benefit of using ally is that it would allow me to keep all my banking w/i one area/ website/ bank at the same time achieving the higher interest rates I want'd within a savings account.  

A paycheck would first cut off 15% as savings and deposit it within Savings #1= Emergency fund, &amp; Savings #2= Big purchases savings fund.  

A paychecks 85% remainder would then be placed into a Checking account.  From here I would access the balance and using a budget I can set aside money I need to pay for expenses each month.  This expense account I am calling ""bill Pay"", and will be either a 3rd savings account, or a Money Market Account.  Both earn interest, but @ different rates. The Money market account also provides me with a debit card, and checks.  With the limit being the same as a savings account, of 6 outgoing transfers within a cycle.  To actually pay expenses, I will use a credit card via TDA earning me cash back for my Roth ira.  And paying the credit card off via monthly transfers from the ""Bill Pay"" account.  At the  end of the year the rewards earned from the TDA card will be deposited into my ROTH IRA, or another investment account if the Roth is maxed out.

One negative thing i've realized is by removing myself from chase banking, whom my family has at least 3 generations of banking history with, I temporarily would lose any Mortgage loan rates based on history (if this is even a thing) of banking i've had with them.  Perhaps I lose a better approval chance, but I would think me leaving them throws a bit of the ""relationship status"" out the window.  ON the other hand, ally offers home loans. but I do think you have to have a home already to get one.  And it would probably not be super smart to have to do so, in most situations.  Especially if im already being smart with my money and achieving a savings account and investing!

***
***

Sorry that this post got super long!  I wrote it this long for me &amp; to make sure It was clear how I expect to work these accounts. 
 So that if im viewing something incorrectly ideally someone in this great sub can point it out for me!

The questions I could really need help with are as follows:

* Is dividing my income up after a savings plan a bad idea?  I.e into an expense account?
* Is it dumb to use a credit card with rewards to pay for bills and everything else.  So long as I have the money to pay off the expenses, and the other charges w/o going into debt &amp; its fitting into my budget?.
* If holding my expenses in a separate account is a fair thing to do, would I not want it in one of the two accounts suggested?  The 1.75% APY Savings account or the .9% Money Market account?  i.e is there other options I should investigate?
* If I were to close both the chase checking and savings account and transfer their balances to ally accounts, could I &amp; should I leave active my Amazon Prime Visa?  I do suppose I could stop using it.  But at the same time the credit limit on my TDA card is not too high.  If I were to use it I have to also be careful to pay it off before bills potentially exceed the limit*  Assuming they get significantly higher when i stop living at home.

personalfinance,Paycheck through Federal Work Study Job or Cash out as Loan?,"Hello,

I am a law student in New York and have a job through Work Study.  I am allotted $2,000 per semester which I can either work for at $12/hour or can cash out as part of my loan package.  I'm wondering if it would be smarter to work for that money or to take it out as a loan?  Here are some details:

The loans have an interest rate of 7%, which is not deferred.  I will graduate in May of 2020, and will be responsible for making payments six months thereafter.  

I am currently taking out about $30,000 per year for school (some has 6% interest, some has 7%).

I am self employed and make about $8,000 per year.  If I max out my work study hours I will earn an additional $4,000 plus any money I bring in from summer employment, which will likely change my tax bracket.  Importantly, loans do not count as income and will keep my earnings lower.

Right now, after taxes, I take home about $11/hour.  However, I'm not paying taxes on my self employed income (until I file my taxes), so it's hard to gauge how much I will owe (I also don't know what my summer 2019 employment will be like).

So, am I better off paying taxes on my earnings or paying interest on the same money as a loan that gets lumped in with the rest of my student loans?",finance
personalfinance,Advice Please: Defaulted Student Loans/Credit Recovery,"Hello, All!

I was hoping I could pick your collective brain for some advice. Here is my situation:

I am 39 years old in the US. I am working at a job where I make about half of what I was making at a previous job due to a period of unemployment related to a pretty serious bout with depression. Things are looking better in spite of the lower income and I think it is time I get my financial house in order.

On my credit report (all three bureaus), I have no debt listed, no revolving credit, and no negative reports. My report is completely empty save some Federal Student Loan charge offs from 2004, and a charge off from an unpaid semester of college. That said, I know that I have 4 debts in default. One is to my University for an unpaid semester of post-bachelors work in 2004 that totals about $5000. I have a Federal Perkins loan in default for $950. And I have two Federal Stafford Loans in default totalling $10,500 including interest and late fees. The Perkins loan shows up only on TranUnion as have been charged off in March of 2018, but on the other two bureaus it is listed as being charged off in 2004. The Stafford loans are listed on my credit report as being charged off in 2004, but on the Federal Government's loan site all are listed as being in default.

I have $10,000 sitting in my parent's accounts that was earmarked for me in my Grandmother's will. I have been waiting to take it until I had something special and life changing to do with it. Buying a house would be one of those thing (I rent), but frankly, I am not going to be buying a house until I can get my credit rehabbed. My credit score is 603 with Equifax, 587 with TransUnion, and no reported score from Experian.

I have savings of $5k as well but it was a gift from my inlaws to be used as a financial cushion/rainy day fund so that my wife and i weren't dealing with living paycheck to paycheck as I rebuild my career.

My plan has been to take the $10,000 from the inheritance and pay the $5k I owe to my University, then work with the government to rehab the loan with the the other $6500k. The loan would be rehabbed after 10 consecutive on-time payments and the payments would be based on my available discretionary funds- which are fairly low presently do my salary cut. I think I could probably get about 4 of the 10 years out of the $5k of inheritance at which point my career should have recovered enough to have a monthly student loan payment not be too much of a burden on me financially. Additionally, once the loans are rehabbed, they will be a positive on my credit report as installation payments.

I have never had a credit card. I am planning to get a secured credit card through my bank to buy gas with every month to start to rebuild positive credit.

My goal is to get whole so that I don't have to worry about everything being difficult if I want to rent a car or order cable or whatever, but also so that I am just in good financial health with a decent credit rating when I decide in a few years that I want to purchase the home I am currently renting.

My questiosn for you are:

1. Is this a decent plan?
2. Do you see flaws in the plan?
3. Do you have better ideas?
4. Am I prioritizing things correctly by focusing my cash on eliminating debt (that isn't actually affecting my credit rating)?

Any and all advice is appreciated. Throwaway because I'm a deadbeat. :)

Please don't judge me or my past financial decisions; I'm just trying to right the financial wrongs that I'm left with. I have one cc at $6,500 (second highest interest rate) one cc at $1,500 (similar but slightly higher rate) another $1,000 credit line (lowest of the interest rates) and about $8,000 remaining on my car to pay off.

For reasons, I've just had to empty my TSP account of just over $6,000, and my bank says that I am expecting a deposit of just over $5,000. Here is where my questions start:

The TSP said that 20% of my money would be withheld for federal taxes, but the $1,000 deduction doesn't add up to 20%. it's only 17%. Am I going to owe more taxes on this money because they didn't withhold the full 20%? I don't feel comfortable using any of this money to pay off debt until I know that I won't be eating my heart out in taxes later.

Additionally, what debt should I begin paying off first? I have some immediate expenses, such as maintenance that's been overdue for a while on my car, although my car's shown zero signs of malfunction or undue wear and tear as a result I still feel it needs to be done so it doesn't turn INTO something serious down the road.

The $6,500 credit card would save me the largest bill if I paid a chunk of it, even though I can't pay it off entirely, because it's at 17.15% interest, 

The $1,500 credit card I can pay off in full, and has an interest rate of 17.99%.

The credit line of about $1,000 has an interest rate of 14.90%.

Car loan has about $8,000 remaining and an interest rate of 1.54%. 

Which of these should I dedicate my money to? My financial education is pretty slim, and so I have no idea if it would benefit my credit more to pay off a chunk of the largest credit card debt, pay off the two smaller credit card/credit lines, or pay off a significant chunk of my car.

I should say that paying all of the bills isn't a problem in any way; I make more than enough to cover my bills now, and am starting to finally get things paid down. I want to know what the best decision would be in regards to my credit. 

Thank you all for any and all help that you can give me.",finance

cybersecurity,How to finance certificates?,"A little backstory here: I’m a disabled veteran using the GI Bill for a masters in cybersecurity. I didn’t get any certs because I wasn’t sure what sub-field I wanted to specialize in. During the course of my studying, I find myself particularly interested in pen-testing. I’m at the tail end of my degree and it’s been the most interesting and challenging course and I’m on track to complete it with a solid A. 
I currently work as a cybersecurity analyst and once I’m done with my degree, I will have exhausted by GI Bill benefits, but I really want to get security + and CEH as starter certs. I’ve done the free training of fedVTE and cybrary.it and taking security + practice exams, so I’m fairly confident I can pass without the course. A lot of the security + is close to what I learned in class. But I think I’d like to take the CEH course before the exam. 
CEH is very expensive and as I mentioned, I won’t have enough benefits left to finance it. I know it would’ve made sense to get the certs before a masters but after a lot of thinking, the masters was the better use of my benefits. 
So my question is: How would I go about paying for a certification course? How did you finance yours? I work for a small cybersecurity solutions business, so I don’t think it’s something my employer would be willing to cover. They are already going to be covering my security clearance, which is very expensive itself.",technology

* Defaulted (charged off) private student loan

* Defaulted Stafford/Direct loans

* BoA credit card in collections

*All with last activity dates in 2014*


Beginning of June, I started a new job with a comfortable pay rate + benefits. VantageScore was sitting at 540 and with the new paychecks I started getting paranoid that the Feds would catch wind and start garnishing my wages. I contacted Pioneer (directed by Dept of Ed) who was holding my fed student loan debt, and setup Refurbishment on my 4 loans. The refurbishment is due to ""mature"" in March 2019. I opened a secure card with Capital One (small 250 limit but) because I didn't have any open accounts and was added to 2 credit cards as an authorized user (both of which are 8+ years old with &lt;5% utilization, perfect payment history, and combined credit of $3.5k+). As far as I’m concerned with the private student loan... I'm just waiting for it to fall off my report.

Felt pretty good to be getting a hold of my credit and taking responsibility. Monitoring changes through CapitalOne I saw my VantageScore 3.0 go from 540 to 657 when they all reported. Awesome! Felt even better when I saw that, now all that was left was to stay on top of my rehabilitation to get those Federal loans out of default...

Be that as it may... I got curious and decided to pay Experian $1 for a week-long trial of FICO score visibility. Why did I do that? Yes, I knew that the VantageScore is the ""fako"" score and that it's most always significantly higher than your FICO. I took this to meaning max 30pts higher... Experian reported my FICO at 581. I was crushed. Despite this, I’m still on my way to getting things in order and I’m seriously needing to get a new car within the next 2 months (I’m over 262,000), I’m sick of spending money to keep my car going, staying up until 3am when I’m doing repair work (I do everything myself - gaskets, wheel hubs, suspension, alternator, starter, brakes, you name it!), and the never ending stress that I’m going to break down while driving to/from work.

This brings us to the reason for this post. I'm looking to try and pick up a lease. I know a lease may not be quite popular here, but for the reasons above I **do not** want a used car - **I am VERY set on this**. I'm specifically interested in doing a lease assumption (skip the ""due at signing"" and money down jazz) of a '17 Chevy Volt. My place of employment has free charging for EVs and other than payments, insurance and occasional tolls I’m not expecting to have any additional transportation expenses. If I’m going to have a vehicle payment I’d like something that doesn't come with a bunch of maintenance cost (time and money). Furthermore, I’m hoping that because the mileage allowance remaining isn't anything I’ll be even close to reaching that the Lease-End buyout will be significantly lower than what the car will really be worth.

As I understand it GM Financial uses TransUnion’s Auto Score 9. I'm wondering if paying off (100% or settling) the BoA collections $900 will help my chances of getting approved. The credit limit was $2.5k and shows as 36% utilization on my Experian report. I'll be looking to start the assumption process mid-August and will be making an initial payment to get the monthly due to ~$300/month. Bring home just over $3k a month, after taxes and before overtime (Overtime available about 5months a year which bumps me up to ~$4.5k/month). Expenses ~1800 a month, to drop down to 1100 in about 7months.

**TL; DR: Looking to do lease assumption next month. Wondering if I should pay off or settle CC collections account to improve chances of being approved. Or other potential actions to improve my general credit that I haven't thought of/may be missing...**",finance

personalfinance,Loan Consolidation??,"Hello,

I am not sure about the benefits/drawbacks of student loan consolidation, and I wondered if you all might help answer a few questions I have. Currently, I have a bit less than 45k in student loans. I've been making regular payments of about $450/month since I left school. This amount is split into 7 different loans of varying interest rates, with an average rate of 5.31%. I'm thinking about consolidation because I missed a payment last year and my credit got dinged 7 times, once for each loan, which I'm still trying to recover from. I'm also currently employed in the public sector and may be eligible for the loan forgiveness program. And finally, I'm about to go back to school for a PhD (fully funded), during which I won't have to repay student loans until I graduate (although I do intend to continue). 

How does loan consolidation work? Could I consolidate my loans and get a better interest rate? Is this smart or stupid? I'm super clueless, and the FedLoan website hasn't been much help. Any advice?",finance

My lower interest rate cards have roughly 600 dollars on them together, and my high interest rate one has the bulk of my debt.

investing,White House latest budget projections call for a 2019 Federal budget deficit over $1 trillion.,"Economic growth is not turning out to be as robust as originally estimated so 2019 appears to be primed for [a massive federal budget shortfall](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/397445-white-house-budget-projects-1-trillion-deficit-in-2019). This is concerning for several reasons.... 1) We are currently in an economic expansion. This is the time for fiscal restraint to have a rainy day fund set aside for future recessions. 2) The current 2019 projections could get revised much lower if the economy slows down at all in the next couple of quarters. 3) Some cures for budget shortfalls are either to cut spending or increase taxes... both of which are going to be a headwind for future economic growth. 

If one estimates equity returns of 7-9% for the next 10-20 years, I would imagine this news would dampen that enthusiasm. Maybe 5-7% is more likely with a real return of 2-3%. Unfortunately fixed income and real estate both appear to be priced dearly at the moment so where does one look for decent inflation adjusted returns over the next 10-20 years? Diversification across all asset classes including lots of international appears to be prudent at the moment IMHO. 

Edit - Apparently people are somewhat confused about the difference between that US national debt and the federal deficit. The national debt is the total debt owed by the federal government (I believe it is around $20 trillion). The annual deficit, is the amount we are adding to the national debt each year (tax revenue minus federal spending). Starting in 2009-2010 the deficit was gradually declining each year until this year. It appears to be back on an increasing trajectory.",finance

investing,Mortgage offset account vs investments.. Is my reasoning correct?,"This is something i have weighed up and i'm after some feedback.. 
I currently have almost the entirety of my savings/wealth in a 100% offset account tied to my home loan. (If you are not familiar with this, you don't pay interest on your home loan in an amount that is equal to the money in the offset account)

My current home loan interest rate is 4.27% which is at the higher end of the going rates in Australia, and unfortunately i don't have the option to change lenders at the moment. However i will be looking at doing this as soon as my renovations are complete and i can get the house re-valued. This rate is however, significantly lower than their advertised rate so i at least have a decent deal with the bank.

My reasoning for having pretty much all my money in one place: By having the money in that offset account, I am not earning dividends etc, but i am however saving 4.27% on that money, which i guess equates to making 4.27% profit in a round about way. Another benefit here is that i also dont pay tax on this saving as i would with income generated by dividends etc..

Am i right in my reasoning here? It is probably not making as much as i could with high risk investments, but it is liquidated cash that is accessible and saving me 4.27%

personalfinance,Federal retirement issue,"Hi all!  This week in the midst of attempting to get a pay mix-up sorted out I learned that the pension withholding portion of my federal retirement (FERS) had been mis-coded since my start date about five years ago.  Instead of withholding 4.4%, they were only withholding 3.1% of my gross income with each paycheck.  I was told that this will show up as a debt to the federal government, which will then be withheld as a lump sum and put toward my pension.  The upside is that I still get the money, albeit deferred.  The downside, apart from the time value of money I have lost, is that I will have about $6k withheld pretty abruptly.  If anyone has been in a similar situation, how was the money taken out?  Was it over a short time or over multiple paychecks?  Is there an option to do a lump sum payment out of pocket?  My fiance and I were hoping to buy a piece of property and build as an eventual vacation rental, so it would actually be better if this doesn't look like my wages are being garnished or some nonsense that would otherwise affect credit and we could just pay it an be done.

We are both 36. I make $105k a year at new job; fiancé makes $65k. I have $110k in my 401k (contribute 11% a paycheck), $5k in IRA and $24k in emergency savings (had $36k, but had to bring money to condo sale).

Right now, she is paying all monthly bills before the baby comes, which means 90% of my salary is freed up. My question to you fine folks:

Should I take $14k out of my emergency savings right now and pay off the final debt so we are free from it when baby comes? I can then use my paychecks in the next five months to build my emergency savings back up ... or, should I just use the extra money each month to pay off the loan in five months’ time?

personalfinance,Wife and I are Adopting 2 boys. We need a bigger home and are unsure how to get there.,"Thank you for any advice you can give. We have been going around and around on this for a year. I have tried to add as much detail as possible.

My wife and I own two homes. We are both in our late 30s. Home #1 we bought just before we got married. Home #2 is my childhood home that was left to me when my mom passed. It is now a rental. A little more than a year ago we started fostering two young children (5 and 18mo now). Plans are in motion to adopt them late this year. After going back to school and changing careers, I started back to work about 9 months ago and make about $40k before taxes. My wife has been a SAHM since we got the boys. She was formerly a high school teacher and has been looking for a job in teaching or in her specialty subject (preferably part-time). So with a growing family in a house that doesn't have enough space for us anymore, we need to move into a bigger house. We just can't decide which house to sell. Keep in mind that we are looking at houses in the $500,000 - $600,000 range for a 4-5 bedroom (Welcome to Southern California)

**House #1:** A 1500 square foot house 3 bedrooms and 2 1/2 bathrooms with a small back yard and patio. We bought it and took keys two weeks before we got married six years ago. Some moderate improvements. Built in 1990. $224k when we bought it, Zillow has it at $434k now. Property taxes are around $3600 per year. The remaining mortgage and HELOC is $207k and payments are $842 per month. Interest rate is a fixed 3.875%. It is is a desirable neighborhood with good schools. We would be able to rent the house for about $2000 per month.

**House #2:** A 1200 square foot house with 3 bedrooms and 1 1/2 bathrooms with a large patio and backyard. This home has been in my family for three generations and has no mortgage. Property tax annually is around $750. It was built in 1956 and is need of some major repairs including a new roof and a leaky master bath. Zillow has it at $476k now. We rent it and without any major expenses, would clear around $20k per year. We have had consistent tenants for the last 3 years who have been dream tenants with no plans to leave any time soon. House is in a military city so rentals are competitive. If we lost them we would have no trouble finding new tenants. I haven't lived there full time for nearly 20 years, so no emotional attachment. It seems like every year we keep pouring money into the house in the form of leaky pipes, a new water heater and new bathroom.

We are undecided as to which house to sell and use as a significant down payment on a larger house. If we were to sell House #2, House #1 could be rented. House #1 would need some serious fixing up to rent as we bought it as a short sale/fixer upper. We have made some improvements but would need to pour a good $10-20k into the house before we could rent it (new fence, replacing patio, fixing a leaky spa) Selling both is also on the table but we are nervous about loosing the income since my wife is still not working. We also feel like if we sell both houses and just buy a new one outright we are loosing a chance to build wealth. For a while we had considered selling House #2 and investing it, but this doesn't seem like a good time to pour a bunch of money into the market with the current instability.

We can give more info about debt and savings if needed but this post seemed long enough.

TL;DR 2 Houses - 1 family home, 1 rental. We need a bigger home for our growing family and are unsure which house to sell or if we should sell both and either put it all into a new home or put down a sizable down payment and invest the rest.


Edit:  To clarify a few things about the house #1 and why we feel we need to upgrade.

1) One bedroom is being used as an office. Because of my career (IT) and my wife’s (photography/video) an office is a must have. There is no where else to set it up.

2) Bedrooms are tiny and if we were to put 2 beds in the room (even small toddler sized beds) there would be no room for anything else. No dressers or shelves or anything. 5 year old will need at least a twin bed soon. Also the 18 month old is still waking up in the night and because of health issues may continue for some time. So sharing 1 bedroom is out.

3) The Layout of the house is not ideal. My wife cannot see the kids if she is in the kitchen.

4) The backyard is tiny. Honestly this is the biggest issue for us. There is no place really for the boys to run around and play.",finance

personalfinance,Fortunate situation--Not sure how to best manage money with details I've been given.,"Hello Everyone, 

I'm a 30 year old (not married, but live with boyfriend) that makes 65K a year before taxes. Take home is right about $4000/month after taxes/medical/dental. I'll get a bonus of around 10k (after tax) this year. My boyfriend and I just sold his house (to make a great profit) and temporarily moved in with his parents (we will be moving states within the year and didn't want to deal with lease). My car is paid off, I have no student loans, no debt. I use my Delta Amex for everything but it's paid off completely every month. Credit score is around 760. I have about 15k in savings @ Wells Fargo (awful interest rate, of course).

I'm in a rare but fortunate position and just need to know what I should be doing with money that doesn't go to bills, etc. I never expected this, but was just told  by my father that I will have a trust/inheritance that will take care of me through retirement, essentially. His father did a great job investing, dad is basically able to comfortably live off of interest, etc. I'm not sure how much I will inherit, but I know that he is confident in telling me that I won't have to worry about saving for retirement (I was asking his advice about Roth IRAs, etc., and this is when he told me). So given that information, what should I do with my savings? He mentioned doing a regular IRA up to 5000 to reduce my tax bill--yes it would be taxed at retirement but according to him ""that wouldn't really matter to me at that time because of inheritance.""

He's going to chat with me in more detail about this soon, and I'm not sure if i should ask more detail about this inheritance--like, what age would I be able to retire, how much, etc? I don't want to sound ungrateful or too interested in the money--because I'm not. I never expected this and it's come as a great surprise. 

Anyway, I guess my question is what should I be doing with my money? Does it make sense to lock it up in long-term investments for no real reason? Are there short-term investments you recommend? Should I still save as if I'm retiring with no inheritance so I can retire earlier?

personalfinance,Selling before or after buying a new home,"I've been in my current starter home for just over 8 years and thankfully the market value has gone in the right direction on its equity. I'm just about ready to start looking for the next one but trying to weight out the pros and cons of buying or selling first. From a convenience standpoint, the obvious choice seems like buying first and then selling the current one as soon as possible afterwards. Here are the financials around it all...

* Mortgage interest rates appear to slowly be creeping back up so the goal is to move in 2019 before they get worse.
* I owe $107,000 on my current home. Comparing properties in the area and looking at the estimated values on sites like Zillow, etc, show that the current property is valued at $190,000. I've also made a few upgrades in the time I've been here so I'd like to believe I could get that asking price if/when I sell.
* Budget for the new home is $300,000 - $325,000
* House has a combined income of $150,000 a year and careers seem to be pretty stable/reliable at this point
* Currently have $60,000 in a savings account for moving. The goal is to save up to $75,000 to accommodate the new mortgage + closing costs
* My current monthly mortgage payment is $1,200/mo. Realistically I could afford $1,700/mo or a bit more but I don't want it to creep much higher than that as it would start to impact way-of-life spending.

I'm curious as to any advice or validation on if I'm headed down the right path. Should I save up more for the downpayment? Should I consider selling first, and if so what are my options (it's really unappealing to move into a temporary apartment if I can't find the next home soon enough). Is the cost range I'm looking in higher than it should be with my current income?

Finally, one of the biggest questions I have is what options do I have for paying down the new mortgage AFTER I collect the profits from selling the current house? If I were to make a lump sum payment of $25,000 directly to the principal of the new mortgage, is there a way to bring down the monthly payments or can that only be done if it's applied to the purchase prior to getting the new mortgage? I'd personally rather have a lower monthly cost than a situation where I just don't have to pay for several months since I've paid ahead.",finance

personalfinance,Getting married soon. Continue making minimum monthly loan payments or pay off one loan in full?,"So I’ve got about 15k in the bank saved up at the moment. I’m currently working but after taxes and expenses, I’m only left with about $2200/month to do what I️ want with it. 

I’m getting married soon, and in preparation, I’ve been trying to save up as much as I️ Van while only making the minimum payment on my student loans. 

The loan with the highest interest rate is around $5,100 @ 4.66%. I’ve practically got no interest, so the total would be around $5,105. 

Should I️ pay off the entirety of this loan and be done with it, or should I️ continue making minimum payments, saving up for post-wedding life, and continue looking for a better paying job, and then once I’ve got a little bit more money saved up, pay the loan off in full? 

Part of me is just nervous that I’m going to need every dollar for the future, but these minimum payments are killing me? Also important to note that my family is amazing and will be partially helping us out in the beginning with rent. 

Thank you! 

TL;DR: Getting married soon and have been trying to save up every dollar I️ can for the future while making minimum student loan payments. Pay off loan in full ($5100) or continue making minimum monthly payments while applying for a better paying job, then when I️ have more money and feel more safe, pay off the entirety of the loan?",finance

personalfinance,How to calculate taxes- help me math,"I am working on a tax spreadsheet because I'm a nut. Apologies that this is a bit mathy and in-the-weeds regarding taxes.  I just can't figure out where I am going wrong with calculating my federal tax burden and would love a set of fresh eyes to help me see where I am going wrong.

*Stats:*

**Gross income: $76,200**

Pay Periods: 24

Income *AFTER* pre-tax expenses (like HSA, pretax 401k, medical): **$57,051.60**

Filing Status- Individual (value $12,000- standard deduction)

Exemptions: 2 (value $8,100)

**Taxable Income: $36,951.60** \[calculated as 57051.6- (12000+8100)\]

This would put me in the 12% tax bracket, which seems incorrect and is where I expect that I am going wrong. However, all the resources I can find online say that both the standard deduction and federal withholding exemptions reduce your taxable income. Therefore, I'll move forward with this assumption:

Federal Tax Withholding Table Calculation-

$953+ (12%\* (36,951.60-$9526)) = $4243.57

This would be $176.82/ per paycheck

Currently I am paying $254.70/ per paycheck

Can someone help point me in the correct direction for how I am messing this up? If I take away the value of the federal exemptions I get $244/per paycheck, which is closer but still not correct. I don't just want to ignore the value of the exemptions and standard deductions and 'guesstimate' because I am trying to learn how it is calculated. Cause I'm a nut.

Thanks!

EDIT: In case it might be helpful, the things that are included in the adjustment from gross income to income after pre-tax expenses are: Pre-Tax parking expense, medical, dental, vision, HSA (only my contributions, not employers), and my pre-tax 401k allocations.

EDIT 2: Solved! Thanks guys. New tax law got rid of personal exemption values and I was using bi-weekly rates instead of semi-monthly",finance
personalfinance,Excess student loans,"Hello,

I'm a college student who will be living off-campus for the first time. If everything goes right, I'll be graduating in May with my BS in Computer Science. 

My tuition and on-campus housing were completely covered by scholarships, grants, and small federal loans. Thus, I'll be receiving a check for about $3,000 since I no longer have to pay for on-campus housing. Should I keep this extra money in my savings account, as an emergency fund, or immediately apply it to my federal loan balance (about $12,000)? 

I certainly don't need the money at the moment. I work 44 hours per week during the summer, and 26 hours per week during the school year. With two roommates, my wages cover rent, utilities, and leave me with a little spending money.

personalfinance,"First-Time Home Buyer 50K In Savings, Buying $300K Home, Putting 10% down and need help with Loan Options","First-time home buyer and I need some insights based on the below offerings from BOA:

The previous numbers I sent you were based on a 45-day lock. Since you cannot close until September 30th, we have to base our pricing now on a 75-day lock, which is a bit more expensive. Today on a 75-day lock, I can get you a 30-year fixed rate of 4.625% with no points. We would need a competitive match e-mail from you, which is no problem, as our actual rate is slightly higher and I can explain that when we talk. The APR would be 4.915% and the payment with mortgage insurance, not counting your escrows for taxes and insurance, based on the 4.625% rate, would be $1,500.58 per month. The mortgage insurance would last until you reach 78% loan to value, which would be in about 11 years. That is based on the ORIGINAL purchase price and not any appreciation, so even though the home may be worth more the day you purchase it, the PMI will not go away until you reach 78% loan-to-value, or about $234,000 in about 11 years but can be speeded up if you make additional principal payments along the way. As an alternative, we can also offer you a plan without PMI. That rate would be 5.0% and the APR would be 5.02% and the monthly principal and interest payment comes to $1,449.21. So while the rate may not be that sexy, you actually would be saving $51.26 per month or $615.14 every year by going with the slightly higher rate and not paying mortgage insurance. That amounts to $6,766.53 over the 11-year period. With regards to the closing costs, the total direct lender closing costs, not counting owners’ title insurance which is optional, and of course your upfront escrows for taxes and insurance, would amount to $4,137.00. From this amount, you would be receiving a $500 discount as a result of your platinum honors membership with Bank of America, and if we lock today, I can get you an additional personal discount off the closing costs of $1,420.00, bringing the net direct lender closing costs down to $2,217, which is very reasonable. Your only upfront cost would be $545.00 for the appraisal and credit report, both of which are part of the closing costs quoted above. 

He originally offered me 4.5%, which I think I can get it back down to. Is the 5% rate without paying PMI stupid to do? Any insight would be greatly appreciated! 

EDIT: Little more background on home: The house never actually went to market so we got a great deal. My realtor (mom's best friend) said she would have put it on the market for $320-$330 so I'm thinking of going with the higher interest rate with no PMI. It is updated and move-in ready.

personalfinance,"If you're looking for a way to help make student loan payments, consider a position with a U.S. Federal agency that has a student loan repayment program.","For those who are not aware, student loan repayment benefits are offered at a number of U.S. Federal agencies.  This typically consists of a payment made directly to lenders on a yearly basis to cover required payments on the loans:

[Student Loan Repayment](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/student-loan-repayment/) (OPM.gov)

&gt; Although the student loan is not forgiven, agencies may make payments to the loan holder of up to a maximum of $10,000 for an employee in a calendar year and a total of not more than $60,000 for any one employee.

There are typically additional limitations - e.g., minimum time working with the agency (one or two years), meeting a required performance level, etc.  But obviously, having a check cut each year to cover student loan costs is a major benefit.

There are attached reports with a full list of Federal entities offering the benefit. Departments and agencies offering the benefit include (from the FY2016 report):

&gt; **Agency . . . Number of Employees Receiving Student Loan Repayments**

&gt; U.S. Department of Defense . . . 2,857

&gt; U.S. Department of Justice . . . 1,332

&gt; U.S. Department of Homeland Security . . . 288

&gt; 27 Other Agencies . . . 1,946

Anecdotally, many of the positions that offer student loan repayments are quite competitive, such as most of the positions with the State Department or the DoJ.

I have about 110K for a future purchase of a home that I haven't found yet. Ideally I will find a house to purchase within a year. I've compared the pros/cons of money market accounts vs a savings account and the minimum balance requirement is not something that I'd like. It seems like Marcus slightly edges Ally's savings account by 0.05% (1.8% vs 1.75%) which equates to about $0.15 daily difference (for my balance) for the convenience of Ally.

Since I will probably use up all that money, I would like a savings account that doesn't have a minimum or a better alternative (has a higher interest rate and minimum balance required but no closing cost). Seems like Ally Savings account is the best choice for me.

Just wanted a head nod before I send in an account request.

ethereum,EIP-999 Drama Explained Simply --- Catch Up &amp; Discuss,"&amp;nbsp;

Original &amp; Formatted Post: [EIP-999 &amp; Parity Drama Explained @ Mango](https://www.mangoresearch.co/eip-999-parity-drama-explained-simply/)

-------------------

#Why Am I Writing This
A cauldron of drama-soup is boiling in the kitchen – and most of us are too distracted to smell what’s cooking.   Either we're too busy refreshing Blockfolio or the EIP-999 drama has too much technical mumbo-jumbo for the new members. Well, the soup is being stirred again – and perhaps it’s time we pay attention.

&amp;nbsp;

As a community we need to have an open discussion about this. For that, though, we need to first understand what is going on. In this post I’ll try to explain the issue as simply as possible.

&amp;nbsp;

#What Happened?
A somewhat comical incident led to a disastrous consequence.  An anonymous developer managed to gain ownership to a Smart Contract – and then killed it. 

&amp;nbsp;

But this wasn’t just any smart contract. It was the underlying contract to Parity Technlogies’ Multi-Sig Wallet – which held 514,000 Ether.  That’s worth around $250,000,000 as of this writing. 

&amp;nbsp;

Killing the smart contract resulted in 514,000 Ether being utterly inaccessible.

&amp;nbsp;

#How Did It Happen?
Seems like Parity goofed up on auditing their smart contracts….

&amp;nbsp;

One of the contracts was left ‘uninitialized’. And a anon developer was able to simply take ownership by initializing it. Yeah... that simple.

&amp;nbsp;

He then went on to hit the self-destructo-button and killed it. Why? I’m not sure. He probably fumbled. It seems like an “oopsies!” moment. Either way, the contract is dead. Kaput! Gone. it was a disaster

&amp;nbsp;

All Parity Multi-Sig Wallets created after July 20th 2017 relied on that contract and without it – they can’t function.   Funds in those wallets were effectively… burned?

&amp;nbsp;

#​Okay… So then what?
Around 600 wallets had their funds rendered inaccessible… indefinitely. Parity now have a lot of unhappy customers – some of which are big name ICOs.  (It’s important to note, however, that Parity haven’t lost any funds themselves.)

&amp;nbsp;

A solution was proposed a couple months ago: EIP999. An EIP is simply an “Ethereum Improvement Proposal”. Put in simple terms, the proposal was:

&amp;nbsp;

“Let’s just simply restore the contract with a patch”

&amp;nbsp;

This patch would replace the self-destructed contract with a brand new contract. This new contract basically:

&amp;nbsp;

- Allowed users to access their funds.
- Contained a fix for the previous ‘bug’. (bug or..oversight?)

&amp;nbsp;

No big deal. Right? Ah… If it were only that simple...

&amp;nbsp;

#​What’s the Big Deal?
The patch is simple – but the consequences are not. A code change like this will result in a hard-fork. A hard-fork isn’t necessarily a bad thing. In fact, the Metropolis upgrade was a hardfork and everything turned out fine.

&amp;nbsp;

It’s when we have a “contentious” hard-fork that things get really ugly. Why? Because a hard-fork requires miners and nodes to perform a software update. If the software update is “contentious” (controversial/debated) then we may not have 100% agreement on the upgrade.

&amp;nbsp;

If some participants decide to upgrade and others don’t, they will “fork” off into two different chains. We will have a chain split – fracturing the network and the community.

&amp;nbsp;

EIP-999, unfortunately, turned out to be a contentious proposal.

&amp;nbsp;

#Why is EIP-999 Contentious?
Some people say EIP-999 is the “right thing to do”. But others say that it’s not the “fair” thing to do. And then there are the “code is law” advocates.

&amp;nbsp;

There are many camps, but ultimately it’s either: “For EIP-999”  vs “Against EIP-999”. A [vote](https://www.etherchain.org/coinvote/poll/35) took place to gauge community support.

&amp;nbsp;

- 39.4% voted **FOR** the change
- 55% voted **AGAINST** the change

&amp;nbsp;

The vote was informal, but was enough to see that the community was at odds.  And this is why we should care. Because if there are enough people who disagree with the other side, then a chain split WILL occur.

&amp;nbsp;

At that point it won’t matter what’s fair, what’s right, what’s law etc.... The community will be fractured, and a narrative will be spun for both sides.

&amp;nbsp;

#What Now?
A few days ago the EIP-99 was [set as “Accepted”](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1221) on GitHub because it was “not technically objected by the devs”.  (So not saying ‘no’ means ‘yes’, now…)

&amp;nbsp;

Apparently this was done in error, and was quickly reverted. But it still stirred things up. And now it seems like there are changes being made to the EIP process to bypass community consensus

&amp;nbsp;

The cauldron is beginning to simmer.

&amp;nbsp;

#Facing The Real Issues
All of this makes for an extremely intriguing case study. It’s in Parity’s best interest to have EIP-999 passed. But Parity doesn’t want a chain split either.  So the only way they can have that is to have EIP-999 be passed without contention.

&amp;nbsp;

Well, there’s clearly contention… Now what? Are they going to pass it under EIP-1 because it is “technically feasible”?  Oh dear...that would open a new can of worms.

&amp;nbsp;

And what about the people screaming “Not fair!”? Last year, QuadrigaCX – Canada’s largest exchange – faced a similar issue and had a huge amount of Ether rendered stuck. At the time, general consensus was “Your shit out of luck – Double check, triple check your godam code!”

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Should Parity be held accountable for lack of auditing standards?

&amp;nbsp;

#Governance &amp; Audits
In the 2008 financial crisis, big banks were bailed out to utter disdain of the public. Regardless of whether the bailouts were the right move or not, people were upset. But unlike the Ethereum network, people couldn’t simply “fork off”.  

&amp;nbsp;

It’s up to the community to step up and show that we are better than the rest. Someone is going to have to bite the bullet and set the stage for future dilemmas. Who is it going to be?

&amp;nbsp;

Either way, it’s now evident that we need more thought and discussion put into:

- The Governance Process
- Auditing smart contracts with more seriousness

&amp;nbsp;

Make no mistake – none of this is going to be easy. After all, we are a community who distrust* government but are in sore need of governance.

personalfinance,Get an equity loan at 3% with no closing or annual fees to pay off credit card.,"A family member has about 4k on a single credit  card at 21% interest through our bank.  The only other debt is her mortgage at a very reasonable rate and she has no problem paying that every month.  

A banker recently reached out to her to take out an equity loan with no closing fee nor annual fee to pay off this credit card at a 3% rate.  She plans on paying off the 4k in credit card debt and then putting the rest back into the equity line. 

It would seem that she is just transferring the debt over to a loan with a much lower interest rate.  However, since the credit card and the loan are both through the same bank the offer seems too good to be true.  Why would the bank want her to have a lower interest rate?  Is that not how they make their money?  Am I missing something?",finance

I will be doing a 20 minute commute to school and my parents do not have a spare car I can use like they did for me last year so they proposed I get my own now.

I am going to finance a car because my parents said that as soon as I start classes again they will take over the car payment for me, but I am going to be putting the loan under my name. They don't want me to get a beater that is going to be prone to issues because they don't want me having to miss class in case something goes wrong, and then they will have to dump $500-1k every time it has issues like they have for my little brothers car while in high school.

I have a credit score of about 650, I have a credit card with a 500 limit that I have never missed paying it off in full for the past 7 months. My main issue is I had an account go to collections that I was unaware of that I paid off the $300 in full about 8 months ago that I'm afraid is causing issues with lenders. 

I have been applying for financing for cars around 2006 with 120k miles or more on them, is this also an issue of causing these high interest rates? I have read that a 650 credit score shouldn't give me rates that high? If I apply for financing for a newer car will I get more reasonable rates under 10% do you think? I am afraid to do more hard pulls as I want to apply for more credit cards in the future.

energy,Pipeline Uncertainty Pinches Oil-Sands Output Forecast,"Despite some recent breakthroughs, a lack of pipeline space continues to restrain production from Canada’s oil sands.

Those constraints were underscored on Tuesday when IHS Markit pared its projections for output from the world’s third-largest petroleum reserves over the coming years. The researcher forecast production of 2.8 million barrels a day this year, down 6.7 percent from last year’s projection. Output in 2025 may be 3.5 million barrels, 2.8 percent less than the firm’s forecast last year.

Enbridge Inc. and TransCanada Corp. have both received key approvals for major pipeline projects in the past year, and Canada’s federal government has agreed to buy Kinder Morgan Inc.’s Trans Mountain line to make sure the conduit’s expansion can overcome opposition in British Columbia. Yet those projects still face some uncertainties and won’t be providing pipeline space in the near term, said Kevin Birn, an executive director at IHS.

“The timing of the new pipelines will be key,” Birn said in a statement. “Even when greater certainty on infrastructure is achieved, it will take time for the impact of subsequent investment decisions to play out on production growth because of the lead time involved in oil-sands development.”

If I refinance will it effect my credit score and or negatively augment my current payoff date?

personalfinance,How do I know if I'm taking out loans that are too expensive?,"So this may seem like a stupid question, but I'd like to know what I'm getting myself into. 

I'm currently a college student at a cheaper university. I did my first year at a community college and have no debt from that year. I'm entering as a sophomore computer science student. For this upcoming year, I have taken out $10,000 in loans(federal ONLY) for tuition and other expenses such as transportation, car insurance, etc. Since I'm living at home, I don't have any rental expenses or anything like that. 

Now, if I continue on this path, I'll owe a little more than $30,000 in federal loans by the time I graduate. However, this is assuming that I continue to live with my parents for the remainder of my education. This is a problem. Since I have an hour commute to campus, I have to center my schedule around when I'll be at campus, so that I'm not waiting around for 6 hours between classes. This has already been a challenge, as the university I'm attending is small(less frequent classes) and finicky(even in the gen. ed. requirements). I don't think I'll be able to continue living with my parents in the upcoming years, so I have a few questions. 

-For my Junior and Senior years, would it be wise to take out private loans to cover apartment costs(roughly $10,000 per year and I could cover the rest out of pocket)?

-Should I take into account(in relation to how much in loans I'm taking out) the field that I'm entering? Considering how many available, well paying jobs the computer science field currently has, should I be less stingy when taking out loans?",finance

She has a bachelors in Psychology from a good state school and has plenty of research on file.

personalfinance,When is it a good idea to take variable interest student loans? How should current economic conditions (in the US) affect my decision?,"I realize that there is a basic tradeoff between lower rates and predictable payments with variable and fixed loan rates.  I'm mostly thinking about this in terms of expected value, and I want to make sure that variable rate loans are not just a scam.  I'm borrowing around 20k, so if the loans spike to 20% interest I'm not going to be homeless, but I'm not going to be happy.  

What I'm wondering is, when are variable rates generally a good idea, and what will cause the rate to go up? Is this only related to the benchmark rate of the federal reserve, or will my rate go up by 5% if I miss a credit card payment? Can and will the loan company just raise my rate because they feel like it? How did all those people with variable rate mortgages get screwed in 2008?

personalfinance,Home Loan Officer Wants to Know if I Want to Move Forward w/ Loan. I'm Really Not Sure.,"Hello,

First let's get down to it. I have about 55k saved up, and I work as an independent contractor, making about 60k a year. I've been shopping for a home mortgage loan for the last couple of months. Since I work as a contractor, 2 out of 3 brokers that I approached basically told me nicely that I wasn't going to be able to get a loan if/until I solved that. I was disappointed, but a third broker was able to do an underwriting deal and get me a loan for a 5.125% interest rate for a 325k loan with a 5% down payment.

After securing this loan, this third broker proposed to meet up with me for the first time at a coffee shop, to talk about something else I had expressed interest in: flipping houses. Like I said, I have about 55k saved up, and a lot of free time, and I was thinking about working with a partner (who already has some experience in flipping houses) and trying to earn some money as a side gig. I mentioned to the broker while at the coffee shop that I'm a little weary about buying a home AND starting to flip houses at the same time, since I don't want to go over my 55k spending limit, or end up with two mortgages I can't afford.

Today he emailed me and wants to know now if I want to submit the file to his vendor to apply for the home loan, the 325k one. He said he doesn't want to if I've changed my mind about buying a home at this time. He told me at the coffee shop that I can start to flip houses AND buy a house, but I'm not sure if that's smart or not. I'd like to and have the time to, but financially, I don't know.

Is 325k with 5% down and a 5.125% interest rate reasonable for me to move forward with, given my situation? The other lenders said that beginning in Jan next year they can get me loans, but would that be waiting too long in today's market. Can I potentially buy a home AND flip at the same time? Is there one I should start before the other? I'm smart and industrious, and I'm willing to take on some risk, but I want it to be REASONABLE!

Thanks in advance for your help.",finance
personalfinance,"I will have a lot of student debt, and I fear my career will not make enough to balance out what I owe. Should I transfer?","I go to SCAD Savannah-- the annual tuition is $35,000, but that is without including room and board/ meals, which I need. Because of this an extra $15,000 or so is needed. 

I am about to start my sophomore year, my combined financial aid and scholarships are roughly $12,000 per year. Of course, that's great news to me when I can save around $40,000 for my entire college career. (I say around $40,000 because I started college late, so the entire amount is not applied since I missed a quarter)

I come from a very middle-class family; my family cannot pay for anything out of pocket, nor can I, so that means my only help comes from loans, aid, and scholarships. That wouldn't be as much as an issue if the tuition wasn't so much. 

As of now, my 2018-2019 estimated cost for attendance is $40,000. I receive loans primarily through Sallie Mae, at a fixed interest rate. Unfortunately, their interest rates are insane. So far it's been set at 9-12%. I have already received $25,000 from them for Winter/Spring alone. If this keeps up, my debt will be well over $100,000 and I fear I may be rejected from refinancing. I'm unsure how to calculate how much I would owe monthly after I can no longer defer payments. I'm not sure if there is a way to request a smaller amount to pay back monthly as long as my payments are consistent.

My career will be an animator. There is a wide range of salary averages which could be from $36,000-$70,000, depending on the company and skill of course. Because I will be just starting out in that field, the lesser salary is most likely what I will start with. There is no way $36,000 can pay off all of that debt consistently considering the hefty bills. 

I'm not sure how to handle this. I love SCAD, and its reputation opens many doors for me. It works with companies I hope to work with one day, and if I take internships before I graduate, it may be easier to get into the workplace since my name will already be established. 

My grades have been great; the learning environment, the professors, and the location have also been wonderful. However, I'm not sure if staying here is realistically possible. I see a lot of benefits, maybe for the future, but I don't know if the debt is manageable or worth it.

Ok so I got accepted into the top university in my state, it is expensive as hell. I got a 29 on the ACT and a 3.5 GPA (Edit: 3.8 but I failed two foreign language classes because my speech impediment affected it) so I got merit scholarship to the university which is about 40% of the total cost. I got 1k from a Pell grant. plus two federal loans to cover tuition

My family is broke AF and drowning in medical aid (I had cancer, cured now).

The total cost is 26k per year for everything. So far I got tuition covered which is 10k.

So how am I gonna pay 16k per year in housing, food, transportation and books?

Student loans arent an issue, I am going to college to be an engineer and Im positive I can probably pay it off considering engineers make 6 figures

Thing is. Im not gonna be getting that salary till I figure out how to pay for this.

I got till August 15th. The reason I took so long before working on this was because I waiting for my ACT score results. if I got a 30 it would bump my merit scholarship from 40 to 100% tuition fee. I didn't get it until recently and it was 29 instead of a 30 :(

Edit: Im supposed to be getting vocational rehabilition to pay for the rest since Im disabled, but they are taking a long ass time.

CryptoCurrency,Distributed Credit Chain project review,"DCC stands for Distributed Credit Chain. The platform which is based on blockchain technology aims to become a parallel banking channel rather than just the institutions which are currently controlling the entire finance industry. With the help of decentralized platform, banking services can be provided by the various different stakeholders rather than just the registered banks.

When you look at the services of the banks that is providing loans as well as allowing to invest in various assets and other avenues, hardly any other institution is able to provide the same range of services. This makes the banks create a monopoly. However, monopoly is bad for any kind of business. That is why this platform is trying to create an ecosystem for distributed banking. Only with the help of distributed banking, the competition will increase and the level of service which will be provided will be higher. This is one of the main reasons why distributed banking holds such a lot of promise.

This platform will actually create different stakeholders so that such services can be provided. It will also be identifying the individuals or the consumers with their real-world identities. As a result, fake accounts cannot be created. With the help of the real-world identities, ID will be provided to the consumers which will be known by the name of DCCID. With the help of this ID, the stakeholders will be able to decide whether the individual can be allowed to invest in different projects or whether the individual can be granted a loan. All of this information will be available to the stakeholders which are providing the services to the individual. The exact identity of the individual will not be revealed. Moreover, there will be a proper credit system for the stakeholders to decide whether the banking services can be provided or not.

Also, based on the cryptocurrency Holdings of the individuals, the loans can be provided as well. With the help of these collateralized loans, the interest rate which the individuals will be able to get will be on the lower side. Also, there will be proper tracking of the repayment capability. As a result, it will become easier for the stakeholders to grant bigger and bigger loans depending on the credit history.

Currently, the platform is coming out with an ICO.

DCC ICO details:

Date of ICO: 28-05-2018 to 28-06-2018
Platform: Ethereum
Token acronym: DCC
Price of token: 13,700 DCC = 1 ETH
As the platform is trying to provide services to the under-banked customers, it holds a lot of potential.

Conclusion:

Thus, if you believe in the amalgamation of the finance industry with the blockchain industry, you should definitely look at this platform. If indeed, it is able to provide such collateralized services to the consumers and also provides them with the normal banking products, the potential in this platform is immense. If you’re looking to invest in ICOs, this is one which you should definitely look at. You have to make sure that you can hold it for a longer period of time in order to generate any kind of returns from this ICO.

personalfinance,"Sister (23) is $11,445 in debt, need help budgeting","Hello, as the title says my 23 year old sister is currently $11,445 in debt. The total combined is from her used vehicle loan as well as credit card debt. My sister is in the process of filing for a divorce and most of her credit card debt was because she had to take out money to pay for rent, utilities, as well as living expenses because her significant other refused to do so. Now, she is moved back in at home and does not have to pay for rent or utilities, just her expenses. I tried to help her create a budget after reading the wiki, but I feel like it may not be the best because I do not have much experience as I am just a student. 

My sister is paid bi-weekly receiving approximately $800. ($1600/month)


**Her current fixed expenses per month are:**


$100 - Car Insurance 


$200 - Phone Bill (Should go lower once she takes her SO off of her plan)


$120 - Gas


**Her debts are:**


$8,201.84 - Credit Card Debt (Interest Rate: 12.15% / Minimum payment per month: $137.00)


$3,243.64 - Used Vehicle Loan (Interest Rate: 4.790% / Minimum payment per month: $58.24) 



**The budget that I tried to make for is:**


1/2 month salary  $800


Car Insurance - Due beginning of month     (100) 


Phone Bill - Due beginning of month           (200)


Gas                     (60)


Car Loan              (200) 


**Total left to use**     $240



1/2 month salary  $800


Credit Card Debt   (700)


Gas                      (60)


**Total left to use**      $40 


Giving her a grand total of $280 to use per month. I discussed with her, and she said that she should be fine with this amount as she will eliminate eating out and will be eating food at home- as well as only going out minimally. If she were to contribute $700 to her credit card debt, she would be able to pay it off in about a year and almost all of her used vehicle loan. I do not know if this matters but her credit score is about 740ish. Is the budget that I made for her ok? Or are there better ways she can go about tackling this debt? Our mom is suggesting she gets a low interest credit card rate to pay off her current credit card debt but that doesn't seem so good in my opinion... but I am not too sure as I do not have a credit card myself.

btc,"BITCOIN PRICE: EXPERT CLAIMS CRYPTO 'STARTING TO LOOK GOOD' DESPITE FAILING TO TOP $7,500","BITCOIN’s rise back above $7,500 for the first time in a month has been met with suspicion from American economist Nouriel Roubini who claims that “price manipulation” triggered the 10 percent price spike in just 30 minutes.

[Bitcoin](https://www.express.co.uk/latest/bitcoin) had a strong breakout yesterday jumping 10 percent in just 30 minutes, reaching a high of $7,523.

The cryptocurrency failed to settle above the $7,500 mark as the day progressed but King of Crypto Barry Silbert said signs are ""starting to look pretty good"" for bitcoin.

Speaking to [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/world/?region=world), Mr Silbert said: ""A lot of people were looking for the bottom, a lot of institutional money looking with dry power looking for an opportunity to go in and I think the bears just ran out energy, ran out of bitcoin to sell.

 ""I think from a technical perspective it’s starting to look pretty good. When the chair of the FED says negative things about bitcoin, and Howard Marx says negative things about bitcoin, and bitcoin doesn’t move I think that’s a really bullish sign."" 

BTC is trading at $7,418.91 as of 12 pm BST on July 20.

The rest of the market also saw significant gains because of bitcoin’s unexpected price growth, with Ethereum trading for $461, Ripple for $0.46, and Litecoin for $85.37, according to Coindesk.

As a result of the near $600 price jump, bitcoin added some $9 billion to its market cap in a matter of minutes.

But Bitcoin prices are expected to take another hit today as the US Congress issues its judgement on whether the cryptocurrency and its peers can be categorised as real money and be regulated like traditional currencies. 

Congress is set to ""evaluate the merits of any uses by central banks of cryptocurrencies, and discuss the future of both cryptocurrencies and physical cash.""

Guy Hirsch, US Managing Director of eToro, told Express.co.uk that “today’s hearings are a great step in the right direction.""

He said: ""We encourage regulators to hear more from good actors and companies with an international presence since they would be valuable to this discussion in Congress.

""Cryptocurrencies are by design global assets and companies with a global perspective are uniquely positioned to help regulators better understand the diverse regulatory approaches and best practices.

""Any law that Congress will pass affecting cryptocurrencies will have a global impact on foreign companies that are doing business in the US or want to enter the US market and therefore it is important for US lawmakers to facilitate dialogue with other nations on this matter.""

personalfinance,Student Loans and Thrift Savings Plan,"Hello Reddit, 

I had a few quick questions and I wanted to ask the greater minds of reddit, as I have no idea and I am just thinking.  


The first question, I think would work, but I make just over 80k a year, which means I cannot deduct my student loan interest from my Income (2500$), but if I make less than 80k Adjusted Gross Income I can.  So can I up my TSP (retirement for Feds) to push me under 80k taxable income and will that allow me to deduct my Student Loan interest?  


The follow up question, which is harder for me to understand or think about.  If I am on an income driven repayment plan, is that based on gross income, adjusted gross income, or net income?  I suppose my thought is, could I put my TSP% up more which would reduce my AGI and my Net, but if it lowers my student loan monthly payment on IDR, wouldn't it be better to have the money in my retirement then into my loans which are forgiven in 8 years anyways?

Please let me know your thoughts or ideas!  Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,"How soon is ""too soon"" to refinance a home? Is there a ""too soon""?","I apologize if the way I explain this isn't 100% in the language of finances, but I'm learning the intricacies of this all. This might be a little long winded, but I want to answer any questions that you folks might have *before* you have them.  

Strangely enough, tomorrow is the 1 year anniversary of my wife and I buying our home. There's nothing particularly special about the mortgage -- no FHA, no programs -- just straight credit approval, down payment, etc.  

We paid $144k: $4k down, and we financed roughly $140k at 4.27%/30 years. We pay $891/month, which includes taxes, insurances, etc.  

My wife is a Registered Nurse and she's the one that makes most of the money. I work for the Post Office. I'm currently in a part-time position, but that's changing at the beginning of October. This is a guaranteed ""promotion"". The ""regular"" that works full-time is retiring. I'll go from a part time ""PSE"" position, to a full-time ""PTF"" position.  

I net about $600 every two weeks as it stands right now. Once the promotion kicks in, my pay will increase from $17ish/hr to about $20-$21/hr. My hours will also increase from a flat 26 per week, to 40+.  

This should net me about $700-800 more per pay period.  

Being only a year into this mortgage, which we're happy with, I'm concerned that it might be ""too soon"" to refinance. I don't know if looking into it has negative consequences, similar to how repeated hard-checks on your credit report can have negative consequences.  

I've built up a little more debt than we had when we were approved. About $4k more. We've paid off about $5k in other loans that we had and our credit score is more or less then same -- 700s for each of us.  

My *plan* was to wait for 2020, during the presidential election, on the hopes that interest rates would fall. I know you can't predict this stuff too much, so I've been watching rates over these last few months to try and get an idea of ""trends"".  

Based on all that information, is there anything else I should be considering? I'd *really* like to go to a 15-year fixed term for the mortgage once I'm established and getting more hours, but I'm not going to do anything like that until the change actually happens.  

Murphy's Law and all that.  

I guess ultimately what I'm asking is: Am I game-planning correctly? Am I not considering anything else that I should be? And if this is the right path to be on, when do I pull the trigger?",finance

I'm currently a dental student planned to graduate in a year or so with around 330k in student loans. I've been exploring my payment plan options but I am very uneasy about committing to a payment plan without knowing if its the smartest way to pay it off.

That seems daunting compared to the $1020 monthly payments for IBR and my quality of life would potentially be more stressful for 10 years than a more manageable payment over 20 years. 

Is it smarter in the long run to pay it down aggressively as possible or are there smarter plans to approach my huge student loan?

personalfinance,How to negotiate payout from State Farm over stolen motorcycle,"TL;DR for the assholes out there, over $2500 in maitence in the last few months on a vehicle that was worth 1200. how can I negotiate total loss payout?

Hello all, 

I recently switched jobs after being fed up with serving and bartending. I took a paycut after saving a lot of money to work a temp job, and I also wanted to bring my Vespa from Louisiana to NYC. I found a cheap shipper, and spent 400 to bring it up here in May 18

I immediately took it to a Brooklyn shop to do official repairs, these ran up to 1400. 

Before I brought it up, I had about another 300 dollars of parts maitence from shops in New Orleans (done in October 17) 

I had it on the street, and a pair of thieves broke it loose and walked it away about 2 weeks after I got it out of the shop and the day before it was going back In. 

a helmet with a go pro hero 4 camera was in the luggage compartment. 

I sent documentation of all of my receipts to claims at state farm, but I have taken a huge loss here. I spent a good amount, more than the KBB value to keep it maintained since I've had it for 6 years and planned on another 6. 

I'm afraid that state farm is going to look at the KBB excellent value (1200), make me take out my 250 deductible, and I'm left with under a grand. 

I just had unexpected vet bills that amounted to 535 a week after the theft. I am suffering a lot of trouble right now, and the 20 day period that I have to recover the vehicle is over Monday. 

I just don't know what to do when they call to tell me they're paying me an amount that's significantly lower than the value that I attribute to the vehicle. what can I do?",finance

My History:

I have a long history of being fed up with working for companies who show no regards for their employees. I want to be treated like a human, not a resource. Currently, I am an Senior DevOps architect and my co-workers are just fine. The pay for the role is about 20k to 30k lower than my peers. I told my boss that I accepted the job knowing that if I proved myself that I could ask for a raise. So I have proven my value and asked for a raise and they are stalling, or because they use a sister companies huge HR department they are waiting for them. However, I don't know if I would ever see that raise. Which leads me to want to move because cannot abide any company treating me with disrespect. If you expect it, you are ruled by it. I know I can go out and find a job and do counter offers, and I have done that before, but it seems that the only way to get respect in a company, is to build a company...

I also think it is time to move on because I really think I would like to start creating apps (iOS, web) that I am proud of. However, in the past I have thought I could do the same but to no success, because I did not put in the time, or get out there. Now I am out there, as a second job, and I enjoy it, and I get satisfaction for creating three apps for companies. However, each of them are not major money makers. Maybe $2k over three months. My apps are really for specific customers (3) but I would like to expand the business to help other customers in their same market.

I don't spend a lot. Although, my current 98 Civic is dying so I will be replacing it with another car. Hopefully a 99 Civic with low miles!

investing,Why Isn't the Threat of a Massive Trade War not Affecting Markets?,"Tariffs cause prices to rise. That's what they're intended for. The hope is higher prices will offset a perceived unfair trade practice. Historically the stock market reacted badly to increased trade restrictions. President Reagan used more open trade as a way of lowering inflation and invigorating the economy.

A pissing contest with China has serious risks (see CNBC article I link below). So far China has allowed its currency to devalue, virtually nullifying the U.S. tariffs while making all U.S. goods more expensive in China. This hurts, not helps, the economy.

China also holds a huge club. With north of $1 trillion in Treasuries, China could stop buying new U.S. debt or even sell. This would cause either higher interest rates or, if the Fed buys up all the excess Treasuries on the market, cause seriously higher inflation.

Every time Trump increases the trade rhetoric the market declines slightly, only to recover later as if nothing happened.

I'm interested in what people think about the evolving trade war. Will it continue expanding? At what point does it bite? American farmers are hurting bad (my dad is in the agricultural repair business and says its as bad as the early 1980s or worse).

With the economy humming along, why do we need to spike the economy? Tax cuts (I like them, but they might have been deployed better in a soft economy) and trade friction meant to increase U.S. economic vibrancy when there are so few available workers seems foolish to me. People say they want to retire as early as possible and then demand(?) more work? I don't get it.

CNBC has another good article on the trade issues with China. I'm interested in comment from outside the traditional media outlets. I see farmers suffering and less than happy they are the scapegoats in the trade war. Is anyone really willing to take one on the chin for a trade war when economically things are going so well? Is the industry you're working in feeling any affect from the trade disputes?

Hopefully this is enough information, Debt is the most terrifying thing to me and right now almost all of my spare money goes into paying down debt. I was at 9k credit card debt in january, and my net worth has risen from -55k 3 years ago to -12.5k now. The issue is that I don't save, and I don't have any slush money. Any extra money goes to debts or bills so that I don't have the opportunity to spend it inappropriately.   
I am wondering if it is advantageous to take out my 401k and use the 14k (after taxes and fees) to pay off the credit card/some of the car and student loans, and keep some money in a savings account? 

My thinking is that the interest rates of my student loans are higher than the interest im receiving from my 401k so why would I invest while I'm still in debt. Also, having the CC taken care of and having some money around will give me some freedom with work and life to be more bold and confidant in my actions. I also hope that this will take away some of the financial stress I feel panicking constantly about things that could go wrong.  


Another plan is to get the CC debt taken care of by making minimums on everything except the CC and paying it off by december, that would put me at -7.5k net worth (but still leaving me at 29k student loan debt and 7k in car debt... and still no savings.)  


TLDR; I have a budget, but I don't know where my money or energy needs to be going. My goal is to be free to do the best I can at work without the stress of losing my job (making me meek and follow orders I know are wrong) as well as the freedom to spend some of my time thinking long term rather than in the immediate.",finance

I am looking for advice on how to deal with my auto-loan. I read the rules and I am hopefully not breaking any! So long story short, I got married and divorced young. Bad divorce where I feared for my safety from ex-in laws. Because of that I moved states and went no contact with ex-husband for a while. Now we are low contact, but not really friendly.

Anyway, I have a car with an auto loan that has both of our names on it and he has a car with an auto loan that has both our names on it. I want to obviously get his name off the car I have, but from calling the loan provider, I believe the only way to do that is to refinance. But the divorce left me broke and my credit score went drastically down.

I have never refinanced a car, so I am not exactly sure how it works. My questions are,

1. since my credit score is lower than when I got the auto loan AND I make less than I used to, will refinancing make my interest rate go up?
2. given the previous information, CAN I even refinance?
3. if anyone knows the answer, will I need my ex-husband's permission (ie, a signature) to refinance?

If anyone has any further advice to give, please, it is welcome. I want my ex's name off the car, but I don't want my interest rate to go up.

We had $90k in student loans (me), $50k invested in a 20 year bond (husband), and $40k in savings (husband) going into our marriage. Our first 3 years of marriage we focused on paying off my student loans and building savings. Fortunately we advanced in our careers more quickly than we had originally expected. Any time our salaries increased or we received bonuses, we put that towards savings/debt. 

5 years into our marriage, we now make $260k combined per year, with another $20-30k annually in bonuses. The student loans are fully paid off, we have $180k in savings, and an additional $160k in our 401ks (we’re both maxing them out). We also bought a home and still owe $180 on it with a low interest rate. I lease my car ($220 per month) and my husband owns his with $5k left on the loan. We’re continuing to put $6k in  savings per month minimum plus all bonuses. We still have another 13 years on the bond before we can access the original $50k investment but it does generate $200 a month in returns that we’re saving for now.

We feel extremely lucky to be in this situation but also know it’s stupid to let a large sum of money sit in the bank not growing. But we are still extremely risk averse. For example, it took us two years before committing to buy a house, even though home prices are low in this area and we were approved for a mortgage over $500k at the time. We eventually bought a house priced at less than half this amount because the idea of a large monthly payment was daunting. We thought about putting more money into our mortgage, but we’re seriously considering moving out of this area within the next couple of years, so not sure it’s a good idea given our house value is not increasing substantially. 

We started looking into index funds  but got freaked out by all the information and the risk. We’re also considering a CD as a first (less risky) step but not sure where to go to find a good rate and how much to put in. We also thought of buying an investment property, but let’s be real, that’s just to much unknown for us to handle right now!

Would appreciate any advice on what we should do next...pay off the car, pay more into the mortgage, get a CD or index fund? And also how to get over the pinching pennies, risk averse mindset ?",finance

personalfinance,Student loans - fixed or unfixed interest rate loan?,"Hi all, I'm 24 and starting a 3 year law program in September. I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to finance the whole thing now. After scholarships and what I can get in Stafford loans the total cost (based on my schools estimate) would be $29,783 per year that I would be making up either in private loans (sallie mae etc.) or with Grad PLUS loans. I'm not sure of the exact interest rates for the private loans but it's possible that the fixed private rate could well be below the Grad PLUS rate of 7.6%. 

My question is - which should I go for? a fixed rate (constant but maybe higher up front) or a variable rate (probably lower up front but subject to change)? 

Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,I have $2500 a month I want to save for about 5 years. Advice?,"My wife and I are buying some land. We are doing pretty well and invest a bit over 50% of our income currently. This real estate deal fell in our laps and we are jumping on it, as this was always part of the plan, it is just happening a bit sooner than expected. 

We originally budgeted $5000 a month for 10 years to pay for the land, but it is actually only going to cost us 2500 a month for it (the land is vacant, we'll plop a house on it much much later). I decided to take the rest of the budget and save it, and then in something like 5 years we can just use it to pay off the rest of the land loan. 

As we have no liquid emergency fund, I though maybe putting the money in CD's might act as that liquid fund. All our savings is tied up in very long term investments, so we just use credit cards when something like a car malfunctions or we need home repairs. But having something like a cash reserve for those emergencies is appealing. 

I thought buying a bunch of CD's would get a bit of a better interest rate than a money market, and still act as that liquid reserve. But I though I would do my homework and ask first.

What are your recommendations?",finance
personalfinance,Interest rate thresholds on debt to pay just the minimum and increase retirement saving?,"So with high interest rates (like credit cards and anything above 10%), you would pay that off as quickly as possible before increasing retirement contributions (above any employer match).  

But I think it becomes less pressing to pay it off if the debt is at a low or moderate interest rate.  The flowchart has ranges for this (moderate is 4-5%), but does that threshold change depending on current economic state?

With average stock market returns being around 7%, would it make sense to only pay the minimum on any debt below 7% and put extra money towards retirement saving?

My feeling is that there isn't a definite answer to this, but I was hoping to start a discussion and hear various opinions.",finance
personalfinance,Will a hard inquiry now affect my ability to get the best rate on a loan in a few months?,"A hard inquiry recently appeared on my credit report when I requested information about rates from Quicken Loans. At some point QL asked for my SSN and date of birth and I didn't think anything of it. I don't remember agreeing to run my credit, but it's ultimately my fault for giving them my SSN and DOB. 

Anyway... I'm not planning to buy for a few more months - it was just a preliminary request to see the rates. The rates they showed on the page weren't very good anyway.

My score is at 810. I'm concerned that the inquiry will mean I won't be able to get as good of an interest rate. I won't be applying for several months, so the inquiry won't be consolidated with other inquiries. And, yes, I will be applying in the next year.

Does anyone here have any relevant experience on this? It'd really suck to get a not-as-good interest rate because of this inquiry. :\\",finance
personalfinance,"Single, in debt, need advice!","Hey everyone,

Need some advice and thought I'd share my details. I know it could be worse but I feel sick about my situation and want a way out. Here goes:

I'm a single male, 27 with a full-time job which pays gross $47k. My monthly take home is $2400. I own a car outright which is disabled, can't afford to fix. Have a 03 truck with about a  2k loan through my credit union with a great interest rate. I bought my house two years ago and am making payments on that. My only other debt is 3 credit cards. Believe me I will never use them again. If only I listened to Dave Ramsay... CC debt is $7500 and the interest rates are all around 25%- 29%. I've had them for several years. My credit score is too low right now to get a personal loan. Home equity loan sounds like a bad idea from what I remember from Ramsay and again credit score may be just too low. Reason for it being low is I missed a payment for a month and half and just within the last two weeks became current again. Also the balances are too high. Most are close to their limit. I am saving everywhere I can and will be paying more than the minimum each month.

Should I focus on one card at a time? Are there other options I've not considered? I just want to get out of this mess and never do it again. If I only qualified for a personal loan I'd make the monthly payment no problem but I don't have that option. Thanks for reading and take care!",finance

CryptoMarkets,Crypto Weekly Recap for the week ending July 20 - Enjoy,"### Developments in Financial Services

* JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. has recently filed a patent called “Systems and methods for management of asset or obligation-backed virtual receipts on a distributed system.” The patent will utilize blockchain technology to better manage virtual receipts backed by assets or obligations like bonds. These receipts can be realized as their own tokens on the blockchain and can be used to link the proprietary assets and obligations to their digital identities on the blockchain ledger, with the goals of efficient ownership tracking and transfer.
* Institutional digital-asset trading solutions firm trueDigital Holdings (TDH) announced plans to develop market maker Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) price indices.  TDH will be partnering with 10 different liquidity providers including Circle, XBTO Group, Genesis Global Trading, DV Chain, Hehmeyer, and Altonomy. These indices’ reference rates are composed of bid and ask prices from major cryptocurrency market makers and are safeguarded with anti-manipulation software.
* The Big Four accounting firms, Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC, announced plans to test a blockchain platform in Taiwan.  They will be working with at least 16 other banks on the platform which will seek verify company transactions with third parties.  They hope that the platform will aid the obtaining and evaluating of audit evidence – a process called external confirmation.
* CrimsonLogic, an electronic Singapore-backed government service, is launching a blockchain service platform focused on cross-border trade. The platform is called Global eTrade Services’ (GeTS) Open Trade Blockchain (OTB) and will reportedly streamline efficiency, security, and transparency for international trade purposes.
* Bank of America (BoA) has recently filed a patent regarding a system to allow the external validation of data using blockchain technology.  The patent cites the need for “providing a more accurate indication of a user’s financial standing by allowing external validation of data in a process data network.”1 This comes after another BoA patent filing for a blockchain-based storage system in April; BoA now has 45 live patents concerning the uses blockchain technology.
* Mastercard won a U.S. Patent today for a process to speed up cryptocurrency payments. While payments in cryptocurrencies have experienced higher usage lately, there still exists a wide disparity in the processing times. For example, the patent claims that blockchain-based transactions take around 10 minutes to be processed, while fiat payments take mere nanoseconds.1 Mastercard plans to tackle this issue by allowing users to transact in cryptocurrencies that are pegged to a fiat currency, which will use the fiat’s payment rails and security features, but the transactions themselves would represent cryptocurrencies.
* Abra, a remittance network similar to Western Union and Moneygram, has integrated the ability for users to instantly purchase Bitcoin (BTC) with debit and credit cards. With every transaction, an Abra teller will receive the cryptocurrency sent from the sender, and give the receiver cash or another type of payment. While many credit card companies like Bank of America and Citigroup have banned cryptocurrency purchases, Abra will be using the company Simplex, integrating the credit card systems with complete fraud protection.

### Regulatory

* BitPay, a global cryptocurrency payment processor, has been approved to receive a BitLicense by NY State’s Department Financial Services (NYDFS).  NY-based companies will be allowed accept Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) from users globally.  BitPay is the 8th company to receive a BitLicense from NY State’s Department Financial Services to go along with Square, Genesis Global Trading, bitFlyer USA, Coinbase, XRP II and Circle Internet Financial. Cryptocurrency companies need to comply with anti-money laundering (AML), know your customer (KYC), anti-fraud, and other cybersecurity standards in order to be given a license by the NYDFS.
* Japan’s Tax Agency, the NTA, has announced its new plan to tax cryptocurrency income.  The NTA hopes to create a simplified strategy for taxing crypto income, reportedly only to those earning over USD$1,800 per year. The NTA will be working with the Financial Services Agency (FSA) and other cryptocurrency organizations to roll out the automated profit calculation as part of a concrete tax policy before next year’s tax return.

### General News

* Chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, discussed cryptocurrencies in front of U.S. Congress today.  While speaking to the House Financial Services Committee, he had a few negative things to say about cryptocurrencies. Powell stated that cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value and that they pose a significant risk to investors, but that they’re great for laundering money.  He also said he doesn’t think the market for cryptocurrencies is large enough for the Fed to regulate it. After the hearing, a memo was posted stating that Congress will examine the uses of cryptocurrencies and if they should be considered as money.
* StartEngine Capital, a subsidiary of funding portal StartEngine Crowdfunding has announced that it will be accepting Bitcoin (BTC) as a method of investment.  StartEngine Crowdfunding helps companies with fundraising and this announcement makes StartEngine the first FINRA-regulated funding portal to accept a cryptocurrency. The company started facilitating ICOs on its platform in late 2017, these fundraising companies can now accept investments in Bitcoin.
* Grayscale Investments, a crypto investment fund, released its first ever Digital Asset Investment report. The report showed a very large inflow of money to its crypto investment funds from January 2018 to June 2018.  During this time, when Bitcoin (BTC) slid from \~$20,000 to \~$7,000, the fund added $248.4 million in new crypto assets, the most amount of money they have raised in any 6-month period, to their $2 billion portfolio.  During this time, Grayscale Investments also added funds supporting Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Ripple (XRP) among others.
* Bitcoin exchange Paxful has released a plan to CoinDesk on reaching Venezuela’s unbanked population. Venezuela is ridden with hyperinflation and a population in a desperate financial situation. Paxful plans to open an office in Venezuela this September, and release an Android app available for download. Paxful currently has roughly 2 million users and its biggest market is Africa, the continent with a higher rate of unbanked adults than any other. Paxful’s app aims to facilitate the transactions between merchants in the local currency, but using solely cryptocurrency in the background.
* Leading bitcoin ATM network CoinFlip announced its plan to integrate the cryptocurrency Dash (DASH) to its network of supported coins which include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Tron (TRX), and OmiseGO (OMG). Dash is a digital currency that focuses on e-commerce and global payments. CoinFlip stated that one of its biggest objectives of the Dash integration is to make cryptocurrencies more accessible and adopted by the public.
* The Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Institute, one of the most renowned financial institutes in the world, will be adding blockchain and cryptocurrency sections to its curriculum starting in 2019.  The material will be included in a broader subject-area called Fintech in Investment Management. Prospective analysts will also be tested on these topics regarding professional ethics. In addition to this other fintech industries such as machine learning and artificial intelligence will be included also.
* American Express applied for a blockchain patent last week that permits for a payment confirmation, including the ability to confirm the payment amount and identify the merchant.  American Express’s travel branch American Express Travel Related Services Col., Inc. filed the patent, citing uses such as hotel reservations, ticketless event access, and real estate rental.
* The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has released a framework for monitoring cryptocurrency assets to the G20. The FSB’s framework stresses monitoring crypto market volatility, the size and growth of ICOs, and crypto’s expanding use in payments and institutions. The FSB will also periodically produce qualitative reports on the cryptocurrency markets.
* Asset manager BlackRock has reportedly started taking an interest in the cryptocurrency industry, especially Bitcoin.  BlackRock is putting together a team to further research into the feasibility of involvement in Bitcoin futures.  Blackrock is already a multi-trillion dollar company and is the world’s largest provider of exchange traded fund (ETFs), so this news should prove beneficial for the crypto industry.
* The Hong Kong Monetary Authority is reported to launch a new trade solution using blockchain technology with 21 banks in August.  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority has partnered with OneConnect, a fintech subsidiary of Ping An Group for this, and aims to substantially lower paperwork for participants, security risks, and costs.  Once in place, the blockchain platform should also be able to process and confirm certain transactions in one day, when some take up to two weeks.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Have I always been misinformed regarding Roth IRAs? Would you mind enlightening me?,"Good afternoon!  


I'm currently a married 26 year old male, who only earns around $55k (before any district bonuses \[curriculum writing, summer school,  delivering professional development, etc.\]) a year as a teacher; my wife is the same, except younger and does not tend to make as many ""bonuses"".   


For the past four years (including the current year) I've put away $5,500 towards Roth IRAs, while she has been doing it for the past two years. I have always put my Roth IRAs into Navy Federal Credit Union, making between 1.8 - 3.0% APY. I never knew about the Vanguard Index Funds, until I read them in the FAQ about five minutes ago.

  
My question is, have my contributions towards NFCU and simply letting them sit been a mistake? I understand I'm still young, so it isn't a huge loss, however I'd prefer to correct my mistake if at all possible. Furthermore, if I should have been utilizing Vanguard Index Funds (VIF), should I keep my current contributions in NFCU (along with my wife), but then have us both begin contributing to VIF from here on out. If that is the case, what are your suggestions for getting started, and if the best choice is to move Roth Funds from NFCU to VIF, is that possible?

personalfinance,Balance transfer credit cards?,"Over the last year, I've had several emergency situations where I had to used my credit cards. This has led to about $6,000 in credit card bebt. I just paid $150 to my card (twice my monthly minimum) and was hit with a $100 interest charge the next day. 

So I opened a balance transfer card with 0% intro APR for 18 months. Problem is, I was only approved for a $5,000 line of credit. This means that I would not be able to transfer any substantial amount of debt to the new card without ramping up the utilization. Would it be worth it to open up a second balance transfer card ti split the debt evenly across the two? Or should I just stick to the first one and deal with the higher interest rate on the original card? 

I am trying to make my credit better and pay off my debt, so I don't want to make a move here that's just going to end up making it worse in the future. Thanks for any advice! 

Edit: I realize that balance transfer offers are not to be triffled with. I have no plans to run out the 18-month grace period, and will be making payments the second the transfer request goes through.",finance

personalfinance,Recent medical school grad—Refinance with private loans vs stay with public loans?,"I recently finished my training for medical school. I have nearly $400,000 in student loans with the federal government. I am in private practice with the ability to pay the loans off probably in 5-6 years. 
Federal government interest rate is 7.5%. I got an offer to refinance with a private company at 4.8%. 

My plan is to make the regular income based payment plus one additional payment of $5000 extra per month if I stuck with the federal government.  I should be able to take care of my loans in around 80 months (6 years)

If I refinance with a private company my payments will be $5000 for 6 years. 

My instinct says to refinance with the lower interest rate. The problem is federal student loans are forgiven upon death and private loans aren’t forgiven at death and they’ll go after my spouse or my estate. 

I know it’s a morbid thought but you never know what life has to offer. I don’t want my wife to deal with this if I end up kicking the can unexpectedly.

personalfinance,"Does it make sense to have a ""nest egg"" if you have credit card debt?","Okay, so my situation is this:

Right now, my wife and I have $11,686.38 in credit card debt. I just don't make enough money as a teacher to keep us afloat ($43k/year with 5 years of experience and a MA...I won't even get into the student loan debt). The interest rate on our cards is 8.9%, so we're paying \~$87 per month in fees, which is \~$1040 per year if we we just keep ourselves afloat at the same amount. Paying it down is probably outside of our financial reach.

With funds tucked away in a few places, I do an option to pay it off.

1. In the last state I taught in, I accumulated $11,055.60 in retirement. If I cash it out I get $7,738.92 after early withdrawal fees and taxes.
2. I currently have $1599.32 in my bank account.
3. We have a savings account that sits at $3293.31, which was intended to build up and put down on a house...not going so well right now.

If you do the math, I have $12,631.55 available through our safety net resources. After paying off the debt we would have +945.17 in our accounts and no non-student loan financial debt.

I'm starting a new program to change careers in the fall to something more lucrative, so I am not too upset about losing my retirement. At the age of 59.5 it will be worth \~$60,000 according to my investment services, and I would pull $450 per month from it. To pay off all of the debt though, and ""start clean"", we would have to use most of the nest egg. I think that it doesn't make sense to have a nest egg collecting 0.1% interest rate while being charged 8.9% of our debt every month. At our current rate, we're basically paying $1040 a year for the privilege of keeping our $3293.31 nest egg. It just doesn't make sense to me.

stocks,Basic Question About What Happens With An IPO,"**edit:** So /u/PAdogooder helped me figure out exactly what it is that's bothering me. If a large investor invests in a company during an IPO, they're getting a percent of the company based on the premoney valuation, not the postmoney valuation, which gives them a much higher stake in the company. In our example below, 50% instead of 33%.  PAdogooder explained that they are taking on more risk than the founder, so they deserve the ownership bonus (roughly 17% in this case).  Still seems weird to me.




So I may just be being really dumb about this, but I'm trying to figure out what's actually happening with an IPO.  So let's say your company is worth $100, you go public.  You let the public take a 50% stake in the company, so let's say you make $50 on the IPO. Could you just pocket that money if you wanted to? And, if you do what every company does, which is put that money back into the business, isn't your company suddenly worth a shitload more than it was before?  Like now this company is worth 50% more than it was already - $150, once you put that money back into the company.


I guess I'm just wrestling with the idea that the company is kind of getting a bunch of added value.  Like, it isn't at all like owning a physical thing and giving half of it to someone. I guess what you're giving up is control, in that if you have a scandal, or a shitty quarter or whatever, you have no control over whether people sell or not.  And if a bunch of people sell, that fucks with the interest rates you can get when you need loans?",finance

Currently am at a CUNY college to get 2 classes done, allowing me to graduate in October. 

As my last college applied for all the loans for me, neither my parents or I know anything about loans in general. Two classes in I just realized I can't just add to the bill since this is a different school and the classes don't lead to a degree there. (duh in hindsight) The classes amount to 2698 dollars and I've gotta pay em within the month
My Background: Live in NYC, dual citizen of US and Taiwan. Don't have a job (and never have yet) live with my bf, he pays for everything except my transport and loans. (so free food, rent, utilities) Planning on getting a job after the classes mid august. All cash I have is funds from parents when I visited them in Taiwan 2 years ago, I have 400 on me at this point. Paying for college so far has pretty much impoverished them (they took it out of their mortgage and retirement as interest rates are lower in Taiwan, I will pay them back after I pay off all USA debt) so I'd much rather find a way to get a loan and pay for these classes myself, I really just need time, but I am having trouble as I don't have any credit yet and don't know much about loans in the states. 

The possibilities I know of to pay ATM:

The school offered me a payment plan spread through the next five months, however would have to wire money overseas for the first payment, and also take up a part-time job that pays at least 500 + 90$ (fee to pay the payment apparently) per month, minimum wage for part time is around 360 per month so I don't think I can do this. My school also told me non degree courses can't get student loans private either, is this true?

My bank (TD) showed me an unsecured personal loan? the interest seemed really high (8.99) but I'm told this loan wouldn't look at my job history... however it would spread to 12 months and be around 230 per month instead. however it still looks at my credit, does this mean I'll need a cosigner?

Looking at the websites advertising different loans all seemed overwhelming, and most of them are targeted at people seeking full time degree seeking students so I don't even know if I can use the info.

personalfinance,"Questions about HSA, 401k, and my overall budgets in California","Hey guys,

I just accepted my first ""real"" job in California from out of state and want to make sure I'll be making the most of my income. I'm a relatively young (24-28 years old) single guy with no debt that will be making about $108k base/year, with an annual expected bonus of around 10k-15k. 

My company offers matching a 4x multiplier for up to 2% for a retirement account (traditional 401k or Roth). Right now, I have set up 8% of my income going to my traditional 401k (just started, so will only work half the year), and I will reduce this percentage in 2019 to ensure that I maximize the company match while maxing out my 401k or Roth at $18.5k.  Would it be better to switch to the Roth option, or is it better as it since it is lowering my taxable income?

Additionally, I have signed up for a high deductible health care plan, which allows for an HSA account. My initial thought was to max out my HSA each year, including 2018, although I'm only working half of the year. However, I just read that California does not recognize HSA accounts, and taxes them and their growth. Is this still the best option for me with this money? I know that the federal government does not tax on this, so the rates would be lowered. Additionally, I one day plan to move to Texas, so perhaps it would be beneficial to already have a large amount set up for my HSA at that time?

Other accounts and amounts: I plan to save about 30% in either mutual funds or a high interest Discover account to be used for down payments, additional investments, etc.. I have an emergency fund of about $10k currently, which I need to move to a high interest Discover account, and $15k-$20k liquid saved that I will save/invest. 

Do you guys have any feedback or ideas on things I should be doing differently? I've done quite a bit of research, but I'm new to the implementation of all of this, and it is a bit overwhelming. Let me know if there is any other info that could be helpful here.

personalfinance,Should I pull from my Roth 401K to pay down debt?,"I have accumulated more credit card debt than I'd like over the past 4 years since buying a house. I have two major cards - one with $23k and about 20% APR and another with $9k and about 17% APR. I also have about $3k left on a 10% APR home improvement credit card, $2.5K left on student loans with 6.5% interest rate. Then the mortgage payment that's about $700 a month. I have about $13.5K in a Roth 401K that started with a company at which I am no longer employed. Because I don't work there anymore, it seems that I can pull from it to help pay down bills now. My current gains with it seem to average about $50 a month, but I am paying hundreds in interest, such as about $110 a month on my 9K card and about $360 on the 23K card. 

I want to pull the entirety of my Roth savings to knock out some of the debt so that I can make larger payments to what I have left. Ideally, I would like to pay off the 9K card and 3K card entirely, which would cut out about $450 of my monthly payments. I only have 10 months left to payoff my student loan and its interest isn't as bad, so will probably keep paying that like usual. Money left of the 13K Roth would either be put aside in case of emergency so nothing would need to go on a card or put it toward the giant 23K card that I pay down at least $600 a month, anyway. My Roth is with BB&amp;T and they have a $50 processing fee to start distribution.

What I am paranoid about is, even though I paid taxes on the money when putting it into the account, will I get hit with taxes on the portion to which I did not contribute? Will it affect my 2018 tax return? Am I a fool for thinking it's more worth it to me to pay down debt now and start a retirement fund again later when I'm not also paying so much interest all over the place?

I graduated back in May and the job I have lined up pays about $62000/year, so with car buying I figured I would be good so long as I stayed in my budget range of 10K-14K for an used car. What I didn't factor in was financing. 

Initially I looked into my local credit union (which I've been with since high school) and Navy Federal, which is the main credit union for where I'm moving to. Both of these had great rates but I believe I got denied because of my average credit  (I didn't know that credit unions mainly want 700+, and I didn't build my credit in college so my credit sat at 657 and bumped down to 640 as a result of the inquiry). So now I'm trying to figure out what my options are. I was looking at Hertz, Enterprise and now Driveline for cars. I was looking hard at Hertz because they had a car in my range, but I know Enterprise offers a recent grad program with APR around 7-12%, and Driveline will take nearly anyone for financing but I have no idea what kind of APR I could expect out of them.

Any advice is appreciated. I really want to make sure I don't goof anything up.",finance
personalfinance,$200K in student loans,"After doing undergrad and grad school, I am now $200K in debt. These are mostly federal loans and I have been doing IBR for the past three years since graduating school. Now I'm ready to get serious about my money situation but I'm not sure if my plan makes sense.  

A few factors to consider:
* I recently moved across the country (for quality of life reasons), which was fairly expensive, and am now in a small amount of credit card debt (~3,000). My monthly expenses have gone down with the move, so I think this will even out eventually. 
* Salary: 63,000 (with bonuses that could raise me to 70,000)
* Rent: 1200 (already have a roommate)
* I already budget using YNAB, which I'm slowly getting better about checking before making purchases
* Employer has a 3% match simple IRA that I'm gonna start contributing to next month. I've got about $16,000 in a 401(K) from last job that I'm going to invest. 
* I spent $3,000 on my cat last year due to unexpected vet costs, this was the moving money that I had saved up
* Not married, no kids

Current plan: 
* $1,225/month towards student loans (with avalanche method). To make this really work, I need to get this up to $2,000 but struggling with that.
* Budget using $63,000 and throw any extra bonus money towards loans
* Pay a couple hundred towards credit cards a month (plus pay off any new purchases in full)

personalfinance,Paying for college,"Good day r/personalfinance.

I'm running into some trouble paying for college. Starting this September I'll be a third year student at the University of California, assuming I can get my finances in order.

The estimated cost each year comes out to approximately $35k, which I generally find to be pretty close to what I end up needing. My previous two years were paid for as follows:

**Year 1:**

Grants: $17k

Federal loan (to me): $6.5k

PLUS loan (to my father): $6.5k

Private loan (to me, with cosigner): $2.5k

Assistance from family: \~$2k

**Year 2:**

Grants: $17.5k

Federal loan (to me): $7.5k

Private loan (to me, with cosigner): $7.5k

Assistance from family: \~$5k

(Expenses increased due to health issues)

**For this coming year, I have:**

Grants: $16.5k

Federal loans (to me): $7.5k

There is still $8k (at least) which needs to be covered somehow. Beginning with year 2, my father was unwilling to take out additional PLUS loans. Even if he were willing, I'm not sure his credit would permit it. His credit also failed to permit cosigning my private loans, so I used my grandmother as the cosigner. Unfortunately her credit has begun to be adversely affected, and so neither she nor I are willing to continue with this arrangement. I don't know anyone else who would be willing and whose credit would be sufficient to cosign these loans, and my credit/income is insufficient to apply without a cosigner. Furthermore, my family is no longer in a position financially to provide the same level of direct assistance as in previous years. I have a part-time job now, but I doubt it will be sufficient to cover more than about $3k of that $8k. I'm going to go into the financial aid office next week to see if they can help at all, but their website does not provide me much optimism.

personalfinance,Just lost Job :(,"Hey all,

So I am just looking for some suggestive input here as I am sort of at a loss on what I should do next.

So a week and a half ago I lost my job. For what you might ask? Well a couple weeks or so prior to that my company insituted some new policies. My shift clocks in at 7 PM and goes to 7 AM, four nights on, four nights off. Since things have been going well for the company we had unlimited overtime (with a few guys working 50-60 day + in a row. It used to be that one could come in late on their respective overtime shift so long as one called ahead of time. Well one of the new policies implemented was no more coming in late on OT. If one was signed up for OT and ended up being late, that would result in half a warning. My company also did away with a six minute window (not late until 7:06 PM). Nither of these policies would have been a huge deal however my company has a long standing tradition about not being clear on new rules, so one week I was ""late"" (by mere minutes mind you) on OT two days that cycle. BAM full warning. 

Now, my company like most have sick personal and vacation. The new policies state that no longer can employees come in late (even if they have sick personal time) unless they call the office before 11 AM (night shifts prime sleeping time) the day prior to that nights shift. If the call is not made before 11 AM, then that employee will ecru another half a warning. So me, being the unlucky smack that I am, had some family issues going on that I did not learn about until mere hours before my shift. I knew that I was going to be late but figured since I had plenty of sick personal time I would be fine. Nope. Another full warning (though my manager did not bother to tell me that I would be getting another warning until the following week.)

The final sraw completely my fault. I goofed up and completely got my days mixed up and ended up pulling a no call no show (automatic two full warnings) which put me past the one week disipineary suspension and directly into the termination catagory. I went in that night having no idea that was the second day of our cycle, OR that I had encurred one full warning from the week before. So next thing you know I am being walked out by my supervisor. Didn't even see it coming really.  The bitch of it is, I had just returned back to my job after being out for five months or so due to kidney diaease. Really debilitating and really discouraging. I suppose it is possible that some coworkers or managers would have perfered to see me gone becuase hey ""you look good.""

It is what it is. I did not like it there anyway but still the money was very good. More than I have ever made in my life. The sad thing is that despite all the overtime I did and the amount of effort I put in after returning from being sick ( I was not entirely ready at all, but my disability benifits were running out). I did my fucking best so I try not to kick myself too much. Everything in my life was going great, then out of no where I am hit with this kidney diaease. One just does not expect developing a kidney diaease with relatively poor prognosis at the age of 26. Oh well. My state is a right to work state, so I assume I would not have any recourse to fight the termination? I had accomadations from the doctor but asked him to clear them so I could work more hours, THEN the new policies were impletemented. I would have had my docs modifyed the acomadations to allow me to be late if I knew that was going to be the new policy of my company.  But I did not know...

TL/DR 

Terminated from job after having a series of warnings for time infractions. After coming back from disability leave for chronic and serious kidney diaease. 

Anyway I am running out of savings. I was forced to move out of my apartment and into my mother and sisters house due to costs of living alone, and inability to take care of myself on my own. So my living expenses are low. Both of their finicial situations are poor however. I have no car payments. I am in debt up to my eyeballs from medicaal bills and old student loans for my unfinished bachlors degree. My credit score is very poor.

I do have a 401(k) with approx 10Gs in it. I am aware of the reasons why you shouldn't tap into this unless you have absolutely no choice. Well, I am not seeing much of a choice at this point. I need enough to live off of and help my mother and sister as much as I can until I find a new job. I also want to take the time for my kidneys to continue to heal, and finishing a book I have been writing for a while (it has been a real dream for me to complete it.) Should I be going in to collect unemployement while this is happening? If I take out money from my 401(k) should I cash it all out or should I transfer some into an IRA? How can I best avoid the penalties? 

Two final questions. Will I have to apply for medicaid if I was getting my health insurance from my job? Does this vary from employer to employer? I am assuming getting terminated for some reasons are more preferable than others. When the time comes do you think I should omit certain things or just be completely honest with the  interviewer? And on a completely unrelated note, on my credit score I noticed one account that I did not recognize or knew anything about. A bank of america flexible spending credit card. Opened in 2012 and still active. Last payment made june 2018. Balance of 8 grand, payments always made on time. I have a pretty good idea it is my father. I never would allow him to take out a card like that without my permission. What are my options here?

crypto_currency,Distributed Credit Chain (DCC),"Problems of the financial market

I think that many of you took a loan at least once in your life. Even if they did not accept it personally, you still know and understand what it is. You take the amount into the bank and return it with interest at the agreed time. If you suddenly do not do it for some reason, you will get into trouble. Collectors will come to you and demand their money back. Not a very pleasant situation, you will agree.

But, as practice shows, in recent years refunds on loans have not increased, which in turn leads not only to the decline of the banking system, but the entire financial system as a whole. At first glance it may seem that this does not concern us, but alas, here the reverse side of the coin is manifested.

Due to the fact that the non-repayment percentage is growing, the bank has to raise the interest rate on loans and expect payment from ""good creditors"". This, in turn, leads to a strict selection of potential candidates for a loan.

Therefore, the bank's employees began to analyze the provided documents and certificates from the client's work place in order to assess in advance whether a person can pay the loan or not. Because of this situation, the demand for loans strangely fell. On the contrary, people still needed loans and still need them.

And to somehow meet the demand, there were private companies that began to provide microcredits to the population. They issue such loans to almost everyone, but with even higher interest rates. Again, we have a vicious circle that seeks to break the long-term project of a distributed credit chain.

Constructive feature

Distributed Credit Chain (DCC) is a block-based platform that is designed to address all banking problems, as well as problems in the world of financial services around the world. Simply put, DCC will allow you to quickly and securely distribute loans between platform users through a decentralized network.

Why Block?

First, the block system is a transparent system that is decentralized and therefore does not belong to anyone. This, in turn, allows it to grow and develop simultaneously throughout the world. Not limited to the territories of different countries and states;

Second, all transactions are public, so they can be easily tracked and verified. This approach will allow you to quickly and on time track any delays on the part of the borrower.

Thirdly, registration in the system will be made once, so that the user can download all the necessary documents that he can provide very quickly and safely for study by the borrower.

In fact, the Platform is multifaceted and ideally suited for both private users and commercial organizations and companies.

The advantages of a distributed credit chain (DCC)

In fact, the main goal of the project for which it was created is a complete transformation of the financial system. DCC seeks to break monopolistic groups, financial institutions, while restoring fair relations between service providers and their users. In the future, everyone should be involved in the growth of a new environmentally friendly banking system.

personalfinance,Legal/tax implications of political work,"Location : Chicago, Illinois.

I'm awaiting an offer to do some contract work/consulting for a political group. Campaign work is rife with all kinds of awful labor arrangements, so I want to be sure I have my ducks in a row.

Based on my discussions with the group so far, I have the following details on the role:

* The job itself would primarily involve research, data retrieval, writing training materials, etc.
* Hours aren't fixed, guaranteed, regular, etc. I'd be doing troubleshooting, specific tasks, training, and the like on an as-needed basis.
* My employer would provide assignments, including specifications and hard deadlines.
* I'd be free to work from home, a cafe, wherever.

This is a part-time role, just above entry level, and wouldn't pay enough to be exempt (so, no salary). Public data shows the highest-paid person in the entire organization makes roughly $1500 a month. In the absence of regular hours or a system to track hours worked, and based on conversations about the role so far, I assume the job won't be hourly either.

I would most likely be paid A. a weekly stipend or B. on a per-project basis. If I'm not mistaken, that should make me an independent contractor who'd receive a 1099.

Also potentially relevant:

* I'm a full-time student
* My parents can claim me as a dependent on their taxes.
* I already have insurance through my parents

My questions:

1. Does 1099 classification sound appropriate for this role?
2. Besides income taxes (5% flat tax in Illinois, lowest bracket federally) and self-employment taxes (15.3%), what taxes should I factor in when negotiating a salary?
3. Are there any other legal/tax considerations I should be aware of?",finance

personalfinance,Can my mom keep her house?,"Prologue:  
My mom and her late second husband both had bankruptcies under their belts.  Mom lost her first house due to second mortgage to pay off credit cards, at an adjustable rate.  Mom is notoriously terrible with money, and has a spending problem.  Step dad passed away October 2017.  Now I am trying to help my Mom keep her house but she wont accept any of the options I have provided.    


The Facts:  
She owes $122K (4% interest rate, FHA) on a house that is worth $285K-$300K.  
Monthly Mortgage is $1,020  
Credit Card Debt (Finally got her to cut them all up and am monitoring to make sure no additional charges)  
1.  $2K, 24.15 %APR  (Paying $75 Monthly)  
2.  $1.3K, 28.24% APR (Paying $120 Monthly)  
3.  $1.4K, 26.74% (Paying $75 Monthly)  


Total Monthly Bills   
(Still paring down as much as I can, but a lot of it is debt in the form of CCs, vet, dentist, Dish, etc.)  
$1,925.37  


Total Monthly Income   
(Partially retired, combined SS/Disability and Part Time work.  If she works more, she loses SS/Disability Money)  
$2,600  


At the rate she is going, she will have credit cards paid off in 2 years.  She is barely keeping food on the table (people have been helping her out), and her health is failing (not sure how much longer she can work, and medical expenses are growing).  Worth noting that, due to her failing health, she cannot maintain the house.  I am doing what I can, but I am busy with my career and being a first time old house owner myself, I cannot keep up.  As far as I can see it, here are her options:  


1)  Sell the house, make $160K-$200K, throw it in the bank, and move into a 55+ community.  Pay half rent from savings, half from SS/Disability.  If her monthly rent was $1k a month (probably much less), she would last at that for 26 years (remember, failing health).  
a)  She cries when I bring this up and refuses.  3 bed, 1 bath house for her and a small dog.  She wants to stay in the home that her and my step dad lived in.

2)  Get a room mate.  I figure she can get \~$600 a month for renting out one of the rooms.  She could have CCs paid off entirely in 8 months.  
a)  Also cries at this.  She has anxiety, and has a hard time getting along with folks.    


She talked about refinancing, but she has $0 for a down payment, and 4% is a pretty damn good interest rate.    
She talked about reverse mortgage.  That should be LAST resort, right?  


Thank you all, I know this is long, but I am not very good at this stuff.  Trying to figure out if I am missing something, if there are options I am not thinking of, etc.  I have had to be pretty tough on her and work really hard to get us to the point where she is at least treading water.

personalfinance,Student Loan Hell,"Hi everyone - this is my first ever Reddit post, but I've been lurking here for a while. I'm hoping you all can point me in the right direction as there are obviously some really great financial minds here.

I have been avoiding really taking a good look at my student loans, and have been happily paying on an income-contingent plan for a couple of years now. I knew I was shooting myself in the foot, but a lower monthly payment was necessary due to finances. I've since become more comfortable in the salary department and I'm ready to hit these things head on. I want them gone. I owe about $53k.

I have 16 student loans, all with interest rates ranging from 2.25% to 6.55% and most are $2500 to $4100 each. I have budgeted to toss an extra $600 a month at the principal, and was planning on using the avalanche method - knock out the 6.55%-ers first, while remaining on the income contingent plan (which allows for me to have the extra $600/mo). 

Is staying on the income contingent plan while I do this a terrible idea? I need help with this. What's the best plan of attack?

I'm 30 years old. I've been driving a car that I'm finally sick of throwing money into and I'm due for a new car. The issue is my credit is in the high 500's due to poor decisions when I was younger. I also have 50k in school loans. I don't want anyone to need to co-sign for me and have anyone responsible for a car besides myself if I can help it.

I chose a used Nissan Sentra listed at ~14k just so they could run my credit and let me know what I'd get. The result was a 20% interest rate and with 2,000 down I'd be paying $359 a month. I didn't buy as I was just trying to get a feel. But is this typical for someone in my position?

personalfinance,Its time to take control,"Hey guys. Long time lurker, first time poster. I've decided to attain financial freedom and I'm not quite sure what my first step should be. I make around 3,200$ per month after taxes/insurance/IRA/supplemental life insurance.  The debt im most concerned with is around $11,000 dollars in credit card debt. I also have around $9,000 in student loan debt with one more year which should bring me to a total of $18,000 in student loan debt with the completion of my Bachelor's degree. I have a personal loan of around $3,500 and a car loan of $40,000. My monthly premium is $705. This was due to a poor financial auto decision I made in buying a sports car at high interest rate. I've since traded it in for a more modest vehicle however I did carry a lot of negative equity into this new loan to the tune of $23,000. My interest rate for this loan isn't bad, 1.9% so i dont really have much wiggle room there. The biggest hit I've taken is to my credit score which is now a paltry 560. My monthly expenses equal $2400 with the majority of that being credit card minimums. I've already eliminated a lot of monthly expenses I dont need with the only remaining being a 30$ gym membership, a 13$ netflix membership, $20 AMC membership, and a $24 Chegg membership. Now here is where I stand, currently I have 25$ dollars in savings, \~$4,500 in checking with another $3,200 coming in this friday. I dont really know my plan of attack. I have 6 cards and all of them are 95% utilized or above. Should I spread out payments to get all 6 under 70% utilization and then attack the highest interest rate card, or just immediately start at the highest interest rate card? Should I start an emergency fund now, or wait until everything is paid off? In september I will receive an additional $5000 on top of my normal income for a loan I made for a friend. My main interest is to get my credit score up to a respectable level, I have 100% on time payments and no derogatory marks. If you were in my position what would you do?",finance
personalfinance,My credit score (500s) seems like it's a LOT lower than it ought to be. What's going on here?,"I'm 43, making pretty weak money (16k) and currently a student while working. 

I have one outstanding student loan through Great Lakes for about $3600, which is not yet in repayment, though I just started making payments anyway to get the jump on it. I'm in a position to dump paychecks into this loan and pay it off by late October of this year.

I also have a credit card through my bank, which I got a year ago. What I've been doing with it is putting recurring monthly expenses like phone bills on it, then paying off the balance monthly. 

The point of the card is to build credit score and to maintain a ""bumper"" so that several bills are turned into one credit card bill, which can then be paid off monthly, eliminating the problem of small monthly fees becoming large overdrafts, which is the bane of low-income types living check to check. If not for wanting to build credit I would never have the card, because they're poison to low income people otherwise.

I had one delinquent month on this card, but otherwise have paid it off every single month. The current balance is $200 or so, which I will pay off this month once the phone bill clears. I usually start the month with zero balance on my $2500 credit limit. 16% interest rate on the card if that says anything.

I'm not delinquent on any accounts, I do not have anything coming to me as far as collections activity. 

I've just checked my credit rating and credit report through TransUnion, and my credit rating is 576. F.

It's very confusing because when I opened the credit card account through my credit union I was told that I have a score in the 700s, which was a pleasant shock. But that is the only time I've been quoted that. Other sources like TU and things like Credit Karma have been quoting me the dumpster figure I'm worried about.

I admit to PF that I don't have much (about 1k) in the bank, and I do not have any retirement stuff going. I should but I don't. My priority has been paying off outstanding debts, and the jobs I've held do not lend themselves to retirement funding. 

The full truth is that my 20s were not good credit-wise, especially with an old student loan that was in and out of delinquency. But that loan is paid off. 

Other than needing to keep more in savings and retirement vehicles there's not much to FIX. The credit card stays paid off, the student loan (taken out in 2017) is in good condition. I just started making payments on it this month. Some people would murder for just $3600 in student loans. Everyone who expects monthly payments from me is happy with me.

TransUnion's credit report is showing two accounts as Adverse. The credit card I currently have because of the delinquent month, and the old student loan that was delinquent in 2012 but paid off by 2014.

There are two other loans under Satisfactory. One is the current student loan, the other is a Care Credit account that was paid off in 2016.

I have no mortgages to speak of. No auto loans. Owning no real estate is probably not helping.

But I'm otherwise on happy terms and in a position to have decent cash flow, even with the awful paycheck. Thus the plan to kill off the 3600 by October.

That score is nasty low though. It's going to cause problems getting better jobs than this one.

Does anybody think they can at least explain why the credit union is telling me flattering lies about having great credit? Or did the one delinquent month tank my score that bad?

I know PF doesn't like focusing on the score, but I'm trying to stop working junk jobs. I need this score to stop making me look bad if at all possible.

Is there anything I can or should do about this score?

personalfinance,"30yo, jump from $75k to $135k a year (Bay area) &amp; $148k in student loans. How to balance saving for retirement/paying debt effectively?","Here’s the deal. I am 30 years old, single, and am making a jump from a ~$75k a year job to a $135k a year position in the Bay area. I currently have $148k in federal student loans at ~6.55%.

**Question:** I’m a little overwhelmed trying to plan everything. How do I most effectively balance the need to A) contribute to retirement with B) setting up a sizable 4-6 month emergency fund (~$20k) and C) paying down that student loan debt aggressively?

I’m looking at approximately $2800 in rent/utility costs. I have no car payment, but will likely spend $150 per month in transportation/gas costs. Food + life will likely bring my monthly expenditures to ~$3400 all said and done. 

**Income:**

* $135k per year (take home ~$7500 per month if no 401k contributions, ~$6500 per month if I max my yearly 401k contributions)
* RSUs vesting over 4 years, approximately $23.5k per year at current stock price
* $10k signing/relocation bonus; will be used to pay down $3k CC debt and replenish my savings used during my relocation ($4k).

**Assets:**

* $15k in my previous employer’s 401k; I will roll this over into an IRA.
* $30k in crypto; looking to sell sizable chunk of this to throw at loans during next bull run
* $2500 in HSA


**Debt:**

* $3k CC debt at 20% APR; This will be paid in full using a portion of my signing/relocation bonus in the next 30 days.
* $148k federal student loan debt at ~6.55% interest

*Miscellaneous details:*

* Employer does NOT offer 401k match
* Employer offers ESPP program
* I will qualify for Roth IRA for 2018, but will exceed the income limits in 2019. 

Basically, what would /r/personalfinance do in this position? I’ve never seen this much money in my life, so my first gut reaction is to take this opportunity to squirrel away a decent sized emergency fund in case circumstances change with my employment (e.g., company is acquired, market/tech stocks crater, etc). Next, I am balancing my worry of starting late on saving for retirement and needing to address this massive student loan shadow hanging over me. I want to kill this loan ASAP, but I don't want to completely forgo saving for retirement.

**Tentative plan:**

My initial thought was to utilize my employer’s ESPP program to build up a sizable emergency fund within the next year - contribute ~$1500 per month to employer ESPP over 6 month period, sell shares immediately and pocket the 18% returns. Do this for two 6 month periods and this will be my $21k emergency fund. Meanwhile, continue paying $1500 per month on student loans. After this one year period is finished, add the extra $1500 per month from previous ESPP plan for $3000 per month toward student loans. Each time my RSUs vest, cash them out and throw them at the loan principal. Then, cash a sizable portion of my crypto holdings out within the next ~year and throw it at student loan principal. 

What then do I do about 401k/retirement savings during this? My employer doesn’t offer 401k match and prevailing wisdom in this situation seems to be to contribute enough to get employer match and then throw everything at loans until they’re dead. I this case I wouldn't be contributing anything to 401k - I don’t like how this feels, especially since this will take at least 3-4 years and I’m 30 with a late start on retirement contributions already. 

Advice?

personalfinance,"Couple questions about debt consolidation, debt in collections and personal loans","Hello redditors, I have 3 separate debts equal to $1,650. One of them is in collections for 850, and the other two are worth 400 each with one having an interest rate of 25.24% and the other having an interest rate of 24.99%. I know this doesn’t seem like much debt but I only make between 300 and 400 a month and almost all of that goes to bills. 

Now, the reason I’m here is to ask; should I take out a personal loan to consolidate my debts AND to buy a cash car? I have no car and rely on my dad or sister to take me to work. Having a car would allow me to work more and make much more money. 

Also, would anyone be able to give me any insight on what to do with my debt in collections? I was reading about pay for delete but I’m still pretty ignorant on debts in collections.

personalfinance,This my best strategy?,"Morning PF, 

Bit of info ahead, if you read it through and care to offer your opinion, please do. TL:DR below. I did try and search around a bit, certain this “strategy” isn’t new or unique so sorry if I missed this.  

I am in the midst of putting my financial life back together after almost a decade of severe opioid abuse. Just passed a solid landmark of clean time but I still have a ways to go since it’s not something that completely change back in a year or two. However, I know that I’m lucky as I came out of this generally unscathed; I was able to keep my career in tact and am currently working towards a post secondary degree. 

On to my issue- I have some bad debt, mostly all medical that’s been charged off. My wife and I have an infant now and we’ll need to get her a different vehicle soon. I can’t compromise on either of their safety. Probably spend between 10K and 12K, hopefully with an interest rate under 5%. 

Neither of us ever had credit cards, were always of the mind if we couldn’t buy it outright we likely couldn’t afford it. Before my child was born we worked on bolstering our emergency fund, which we unfortunately had to dip into a tiny bit with some really unforeseeable expenses regarding their care. 

On to my resolution- I got a secured cc and have been paying my bad debts with that, and then paying the cc off monthly so as not to accrue interest and also buying a few other items to keep my credit utilization in that sweet spot. 

I just applied for a different secured card and now that my treatment is just about paid for, I’ll have another ~$750 a month to knock these items out. Is this a waste of time? I’m basically paying them off as past as possible, just trying to run stuff through the card. I do have some other payment history form a car I bought many years ago and never missed a payment but that’s about it. 

TL:DR - I did a lot of drugs for a long time. Got my shit together and rebuilding financially. Have some medical debt (charged off) that I’ve been paying via secured CC’s that I setup recently. Have a good reserve fund now and am basically paying down my bad debt as quick as I can, just running through said CC’s as I didn’t have any open lines and in turn utilization. Waste of time?

personalfinance,Take out student loans or live off savings?,"I'm a 33 year old woman going into my second year of a top-7 MBA program. I was fortunate to get an almost-full ride, so in my first year, I took out loans primarily for living expenses. My current loan balance -- which includes a small amount leftover from undergrad -- is $47,000. If I use loans to finance this upcoming year, I'll increase that balance by $37,000, for a final balance when I graduate of $84,000 (not including accumulated interest). All loans are federal. I have approximately $38,000 in liquid assets, so in theory, I could finance my living expenses this year exclusively with savings rather than loans. 

I am not pursuing a career that comes with a very large salary or signing bonus, but I also don't necessarily expect to make peanuts. My starting salary might be $85K-$105K if I had to guess. All potential jobs are in moderate-to-high COL areas (i.e. not San Francisco, but more like Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago).

I recognize that it would be cheaper in the long run to live off savings this year rather than more loans. But part of my calculus also includes the fact that I am 33 -- older than most MBA students -- and I am eager to buy a house and start a family in the next couple years. 

My partner also has significant student loan debt -- about $160K.

Should I take out $37K in student loans this year, getting me to a final balance of $84K plus accumulated interest? Or should I keep $10K for an emergency fund, spend $28K of my savings on living expenses, and make up the difference with a much smaller loan ($9K, for a final balance of $56K plus accumulated interest)?",finance

I’m a 25 year old college grad currently at a loss for how to proceed. 

I have about $14,000 in credit card debt looming over me, from two Chase cards that are nearly maxed out. I have $20K in student loans at very low interest rates, but my recent promotion jacked up my monthly payment over $350 dollars, and I missed a payment. I also have a small personal loan through Upstart taken to cover moving costs after a break up left me out of an apartment, and a family health emergency had be traveling more than expected. That loan is about $5K with a low interest rate as well. 

I have a large amount in my 401K already with a good employee match program at work. I think I can manage the student loan and personal loan with no issue, and would have no budgeting problems on my salary if I didn’t have massive credit card payments to cover (as in, reducing my credit card debt could put me in a place where I wouldn’t have to lean on them). 

Does it make sense to take out a loan from my 401K? Or withdraw (know this is “expensive” as you lose a lot of the savings this way)? Do I try to increase my Upstart personal loan in order to consolidate?

Forex,Currency war between the USA and China will haunt the world,"Currency war has begun.

So consider some insightful participants of the foreign exchange market, with daily trading volumes of $ 5.1 trillion.
 
On Friday, US President Donald Trump accused China and the European Union of ""manipulation of exchange rates and interest rates."" This comment was made after the yuan fell to the minimum level for the year, and the Bank of China did not make any attempts to restrain the national currency. In addition, the Euro also lost ground this year, claiming to be a factor that the ECB may have to take into account at the upcoming monetary policy meeting.
 
The world's leading powers entered into confrontation, balancing dangerously on the brink of war, and the consequences of this will be disastrous, not only for the US and China. The danger threatens asset markets from Beijing to Washington: stocks, oil, emerging markets will be victims of the redistribution of the world financial order.

*""We note the serious risks of a large — scale collapse of trade and currency cooperation at the international level, and this is depressing,"" warns Jens Nordvig, one of the most authoritative currency strategists on wall street. He adds that trump's latest rhetoric "" has clearly shifted the emphasis from the trade war to the currency war.""*

Shock therapy, associated with the devaluation of the yuan by China in 2015, is a vivid example of what the Domino effect may be, says Robin Brooks, chief economist of the Institute of international Finance and former chief currency strategist of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. It is likely that in this case the prices of high-risk assets and oil will fall due to increased concern about the economic prospects. The currencies of commodity-exporting countries, including the Russian ruble, the Colombian peso and the Malaysian ringgit, will be particularly affected, and then the rest of Asia will fall.

*""Asian Central Banks will first try to restrain the weakening of currencies through interventions, but then give up, and in the 6-month perspective, the greatest losses will suffer, I think, the assets of developing countries in Asia,""* writes Brooks.

According to Nordvig, the decisive factor will be the position of the Central Bank of China — in particular, whether it will try to restrain the exchange rate of the dollar against the yuan at 6.80 to avoid further escalation of the conflict. The expert notes that at the ECB meeting on July 26, the head of the Bank Mario Draghi may also enter into a struggle, if we remember that the January attempts of the us verbal intervention against the dollar in Frankfurt met with extreme disapproval.
 
According to Reuters, on Friday, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that the US is closely watching China to determine whether it is manipulating the exchange rate.

*""Undoubtedly, the devaluation of the currency gives them an unfair advantage,""* he stressed, adding that the States will closely monitor this situation.

The next semi-annual report of the Ministry of Finance on monetary policy, in which the US authorities officially comment on the position of countries that manipulate currencies, will be published in October. In the last April report, the Agency refrained from such accusations against China, although it criticized China for the lack of progress in eliminating the trade imbalance with the United States.

*""The exchange rate is one of the many instruments that China can use to counter US trade tariffs. At the same time, they will try their best to prove that their actions are not due to the actions of the United States, and we can not say anything for sure. As a rule, we do not know the true scale of intervention,""* says economist Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel prize winner in Economics and former Advisor to President Clinton.

The dollar is likely to remain under pressure, as investors are wary of Trump and listen to his statements, and therefore will come out of long positions on the us currency, said Shahab Jalinas, chief currency strategist of Credit Suisse Group.

According to the Commission on futures trading for the week of July 17, hedge funds and other speculators are now showing the most optimistic since February 2017 attitude towards the dollar.

*""However, now the US President actually declared a currency war, openly accusing a number of States of manipulating their exchange rates to ensure a competitive advantage. This will force market participants to start the elimination of long positions on the dollar,""* Jalinus believes.",finance

personalfinance,Second guessing myself -- pay high-interest low-balance loan OR lower-interest high-balance loan first?,"I know the strategy is to tackle higher interest loans first BUT here's my dilemma that I can't seem to stop second guessing myself on.

I'm planning on using my tax refund to 100% go toward my student loans ($1.4k)

I have one loan around 3.8k at 4.66% interest (loanA) and another loan at 1.8k at 6.8% interest (loanB). Currently the actual amount of interest on loanA is a higher amount than loanB, and if I pay the $1.4k to loanA, that interest amount is lowered by about $70.

Obviously nearly completely paying off loan 2 also significantly lowers the amount of interest I have to pay, but I'll be able to pay that off in full sooner than loanA, which would continue to cost me more than loanB currently costs me anyway.

My gut feeling is that paying off loanA saves me more money in the long run, but math has never been my strongsuit and I'm not sure about how I should go about really trying to calculate it all and figure out the truth.

These are not my only loans of course (thanks US educational system!!), so if you have advice based on the fuller picture, my other loans, interest rates, and standard automatically applied monthly payments in parentheses are here:

1. 4.66% -- $1,621.50 *($22.05)*
2. 4.66% -- $3,759.82 *($57.83)*
3. 3.86% -- $1,654.10 *($21.86)*
4. 3.86% -- $4,298.51 *($56.81)*
5. 3.40% -- $3,490.39 *($45.38)*
6. 3.40% -- $2,668.99 *($34.70)*
7. 6.80% -- $1,809.93 *($27.97)*
8. 6.80% -- $1,884.89 *($29.55)*

With my monthly payments I do pay higher amounts (usually any extra I'm able to) to the higher interest loans - usually upping them to $50-$60 when I can.

Recently had a lay-off and got a new job, which forced a costly move that ate up most of the savings (admittedly there wasn't much to speak of anyway).  


My wife and I have created a budget, and played with some snowball calculators to figure out our debt pay-off plan. We calculate that we can be clear of all debt, except our mortgage, within 5 years. Per the budget we could probably do it in less than 4, as I've picked up a second job as an adjunct instructor which will help chip away at everything.

personalfinance,Question about which account should be used take a distribution from (Inherited Traditional IRA vs. Brokerage Account vs. 401k loan),"Hi PF, longtime lurker, and big fan of PF. I have an interesting problem. For an upcoming significant expense, I need to figure out which account I should pull cash from. I understand I am lucky to have this problem where I have a variety of options to cover the expense. Below are my options and some interesting factors about them. 

1. Inherited Traditional IRA: This account was very recently inherited; however, based on plenty of research/responses from the account manager, any distributions will be subject to tax at ordinary rate (i.e., if $100 is distributed, $100 of additional income will need to be reported). Due to a variety of tax rules, this account has to be emptied/distributed completely within the next 5 years. So theoretically, I could leave the investment as is, let it grow (or shrink) and take distribution in 5th year. Or I could take a distribution of any % each year (possibly 20% each year). However, as mentioned above, any and all distribution will be taxed at ordinary income rate and a marginal federal tax rate of 32%. Although, I do not expect the marginal rate to go down in the next 5 years, there may be a slim chance the marginal tax rate. This is of course not withstanding any changes to the tax law. 
2. Brokerage Account: This account is a straight old brokerage account. Any gains would be minimal and be subject to capital gains rate at 15%. 
3. 401k loan: Although 401k loan is often supposed to be viewed as a last resort account, I am seriously considering it as an option. This gives me the option to ""defer"" making a choice between the above two. This also allows me to ""pull out"" cash from this market. Practically all of the above accounts hold equities/low cost funds which means all accounts are exposed to stock market (largely US market). 

It'd be helpful to get your thoughts on what other factors you'd consider and which account would you think is the best approach. I am having the hardest time making sense of how/when to liquidate the inherited traditional IRA (given the accounts needs to be fully distributed within 5 years). Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Need some financial guidance.,"I'm a 20 year old currently in University. 

Currently it's summer and I make around 400-600 a week depending on how many shifts I can get. (I'm a tipped employee)
During school i'll make more like 200-300 a week depending on how things go. 

My monthly expenses are something like this:


150~ Food

360 Car Insurance (I live in Louisiana, no tickets or anything, premiums are just crazy here)

150~ on Gas. 

100~ In case car needs anything

100~ Fun. 


It brings my monthly expenses to around 860 a month, I don't imagine my expenses change that much when I get back to school.
For fun and food I can really cut those down, i'm just working all the time so I eat more, but I do get the occasional free meal.

I don't live at home but don't pay rent or anything, my parents don't help me with finances other than occasionally handing me an extra ten when they ask me to pick up something from the store.

Currently I have four thousand in my bank account, which I want to get to 5,000 before I return to school. August 20th or something. Once I get five thousand into my bank account, I plan on moving that to a separate emergency account that I'll only use for something big, such as a major car repair. My health insurance is covered by my parents. My biggest issue is my tuition.

I am currently 0 in debt, but after moving out my parents won't be helping me with tuition any longer which is understandable. My tuition is something like 6800 a semester, however I have a scholarship that pays about 3700 of that. So I end up owing around 2,100 a semester. I qualify for 5,000 worth of federally subsidized loans a year. I intend to take out subsidized loans that I won't have to pay interest on until I graduate and save money during the summer and winter while I don't have classes. Hopefully when I graduate I can balloon my savings to instantly pay my loans back. The only question I have, is whether it's better to just pay them now with the money I do have, or keep my emergency fund. My parents and other family think I should just use the money I have, but personally I don't think I could be comfortable without at least 3,000 stashed away for a rainy day.

personalfinance,Have a little over $4k in a 401k from my previous employer. How do I make the best use of this in getting my finances on track?,"Hello everyone. I've recently decided (at 30 years old...) that taking back control of my financial life might help me feel a little better about life in general. So, I've established a budget, cut some costs, and set up a savings account with an interest rate of 1.75% (Ally) to begin my emergency fund, which has about a hundred dollars in it to start. 

I have a 401k from my previous job that I sort of forgot about. I finally opened my mail, logged in, and my balance is a little over $4000. It's through Voya with a ""balanced"" option - not entirely sure what that is/means; I'm guessing it pertains to investment risk? I think Conservative and Aggressive are other options available. 

I also have some credit card debt that I'd like to get rid of ($5.5k on one card at 24.65%, $7k on another at 24.49%). I bring home $1,100-$1,200 every two weeks and have set up 10% to go into savings. Annual salary is $41k before taxes.

My current job has a pension with 100% employer match depending on employee contribution. I forget what the percentage is, but I know I have it set up so that I get the employer match. 

Ultimately, I guess, my question is what I should do with the money in my 401k. My limited understanding is that withdrawing it to put toward my debt would subject it to penalties and taxation. Is it worth it? Do I leave it where it is? 

My credit isn't very good, for what it's worth. Mid 600s credit score. I'm new to to this, so if you need more information, let me know. 

My goal is ultimately to stop the miserable process of renting and get a house.",finance
personalfinance,Help With Everything... Please,"Hi guys. I was wondering if anyone had  some helpful input for what I have going on here:

FICO: 735

Take Home: $50k

Monthly Recurring Expenses: $1650

Gas/Food/ Day-to-day nonsense (month): $500

Credit Cards:  \~$500 total

Student Loan Debt: $28k (\~4.5%, federal loans)/ $28.5k (\~6.5%, parent plus)

I am looking to refinance/consolidate my student loans. I just got my first quote from Earnest with an interest rate between 5-6% depending on timeline (5/7/10/15/20). This seems a little high to me.

So my first question is what range of rate should I be getting? This seems a little high to me and I was wondering if anyone in a similar situation would be interested in comparing notes.

My next part of this question is really, how much vehicle can I afford? My 21 year old gas guzzling pickup isn't cutting it any more and I don't have the space or tools at my new place to work on  it any longer. I am very meticulous with my vehicles and I am looking to go new since I plan to keep my next truck for a while (Yes, it needs to be a 4x4 pickup truck. This is essential for my side hustle). I have had my current truck, which was old when I bought it, for 7 years. So this is how I am justifying my well optioned truck that I am considering. In my shopping I am coming across what seems to be a great deal, exactly the truck I want for 35k out the door.

Can I afford this? What type of interest rate can I expect on this auto sort of auto loan, how much should I put down?

I already live pretty lean, so please spare me the cutting out unneeded expenses and coupon cutting talk (no daily routine expenses, lunch, coffee, nothing).  I utilize the cash back promotions on my credit cards thoroughly (discover/BoA/chase) to maximize cash back based on tiered rewards and revolving categories. Though I never carry a balance for more than 2 weeks. This week I am keeping note of every dollar that I spend, recording it and at the end of the week figuring out  how much I really spend and on what.

I would appreciate anyone's input, tips or advice I am fresh out of Mommy &amp; Daddy's house and I would not consider anyone that I know to be financially savvy or even reasonable in all honesty.

Thanks.

EDIT: Just recalled I forgot to mention I owe my parents another 2.5k for move-in expenses I had to be fronted.",finance
energy,Special payments to coal power plants operating in unregulated wholesale markets pushed,"The Department of Energy (DOE) announced it’s considering invoking the Defense Production Act of 1950 to force special payments to coal power plants operating in unregulated wholesale markets. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) was previously asked to compel grid operators to financially compensate coal and nuclear plants to stay open. However, running coal-fired power plants also carries heavy liability issues, as absent expensive remediation they emit a wide range of harmful pollutants into air and water. Those include particulate matter, mercury and acid rain gasses that over time eat through stone and metal.

personalfinance,Best way to handle or lower high private student loan payments,"My girlfriend and I are having a child in September and I thought it was a good time to really start getting finances in order so we can start investing in our eventual retirement and our child (and future children). I have two smaller federal student loans left to pay off (around 10k altogether) and a mortgage. I knew that she had student loan debt but I didn't actually know how much and what type of loans they were. She just graduated with a masters degree in Mental Health Counseling so I assumed it was around 100k-120k worth of loans. I found out she has 3 private loans totaling around 100k and 1 federal loan worth another 100k. I also found out her monthly payments for all of them around going to start in August and that the private loans altogether will total around $1100 each month. This is almost 50% of our income for the month and will be almost impossible to manage paying these loans, the mortgage, utilities, and an incoming baby.

My question is: Is there anything we can do to lower these monthly payments? Is there a good way to go about handling these private loans?

Edit: REAAALY not looking for marital advice here. I understand that's a big part of finances but as far as this post goes, I'd really like to get advice on getting these private loans taken care of.",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay off my mortgage early?,"TLDR: I hope to retire in 2022, I have $250,000 in retirement accounts, $75,000 in non-tax advantaged accounts, and a pension that should pay $4,500 a month in retirement (with annual 2% increase on base amount for inflation).  Would it be wise to pay off my house early so I don't have to make mortgage payments ($1,400) in retirement?

I currently take home $5,000,  I have $1,500 extra a month.  I was thinking about putting $1,200 a month towards my mortgage.  That would pay if off the month (July 2022) I plan to retire.  My interest rate on my mortgage is 2.75%.  If I pay the regular payment ($1,350 includes escrow) it will be paid off in August 2027, 5 years after I retire.

I get paid 15 hourly but work around 190 hours a month (I don't get paid overtime) so I make around $2850 before taxes. The only bills I have are my student loans and credit card bills, and a car payment. I would say I'm in a pretty good financial situation, but I have made some stupid mistakes with my loans...Here they are: 1) I have $2,102 in credit card debt -- one credit card has a 28% APR \(T-T)/   2) $5,557 remaining for my auto loan at 6.34% 3) Three federal loans: a) $3,648 with 4.66% APR b) $5,468 at 4.29% APR, c) $2,157 at 4.29% APR  4) One horrible personal loan from Sallie Mae: $44,862 at 12.125% APR.

Who needs BTC if there's no chaos?  If there's no chaos then USD will be strong.  I like to think of Bitcoin as the anti-USD because they are both competing for the world reserve currency of the future and Bitcoin has a much better chance at dethroning the USD than the USD has at keeping that position.  Trump probably hates BTC because it does nothing for the US and he's a nationalist.  In fact his trade war isn't just bad for the USD, but it's bad for every countries fiat currency involved which is fantastic news for Bitcoin hodlers.  People with a lot of fiat are looking for alternatives and they're likely to buy Bitcoin and Gold in my opinion.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"First Post, Credit Card/Credit Score Question","Hello all, this is my first post here!

I have a poor credit score (560 is the lowest of the three, for some reason Experian is a lot higher) and I have one secured credit card with a $400 limit that I've had for about 3 years.

I've been trying to build my credit score but it's just not going up. I had medical problems a few years ago that resulted in significant medical bills that I ignored until a bit over  year ago. Stupid, I know. I've payed off all of the smaller ones and now the only one remaining is a single $24,000 bill that I've payed  $8,000 toward. 

The only other debt I have is $3000 to the IRS from last year's taxes that I'm paying $350 a month on. Next year won't have this problem.

My questions are:

- I paid off all of my small debts that went to collection, and I'm consistently paying every month to my large debt, so when will my credit score start reflect that? I quickly pay off my secured card whenever I use it.

- My transunion and Equifax scores are about 560, but Experian is 750. Should I assume Experian is wrong or vice-versa?

- Will opening another credit card help my score with the credit to debt ratio, or will it damage it more? Would it be worth it to get another secured card if I can't get a regular one?

- Sometime within the next year I'm going to have to buy a work vehicle in the 10,000 - 15,000 range and will need a loan for part of it. Am I going to get pounded with a murderous interest rate?

I'm new to all of this, so any input is greatly appreciated.",finance

The main question I have is should I pay off my loans as I get paid from work, or should I wait until I start my new job in January, since interest is not accruing until next June?

Current job = 26k/year

Job starting in January = 58k/year

age = 23

Current expenses are phone/car insurance/food/gas which is about \~250 to 300 a month. This leaves me with about $1,700 to either invest or pay down my loan with. My expenses will increase in December since me and my girlfriend are moving into an apartment together. (rent = 1300/month)

I have a grant from my school ($20k), Pell Grant ($6k), Sub Direct Loan ($2,500), and Additional Unsub Direct Loan ($7k). However my total Cost of Attendance is $41,674 and I don't believe I am able to receive any more aid from my school.

Should I be looking into private loan services through a company like Sallie Mae or should I try to set a loan up with my credit union? My credit union is a small institution with around 25 locations around the central part of my state (so not too small) and I have been with them since I was 17yo or so. 

I wasn't sure if there were any better options and I wanted to ask here before rushing in blind to see the people at my credit union because I don't want to end up getting (even more) in over my head. Additionally I'm not sure if I should ask for slightly more than what I owe to my university because (I'm a programmer) I'm in DIRE NEED of a new laptop for classes and I might need additional money to get to and from school (I commute about 70mi each way. Gas, tolls, and maintenance can be difficult). So I am considering asking them for something closer to $8,000 just to make sure I'm covered.

Do I have any better options or is going to my credit union my best bet?

Actually probably 25k. I finally ""made it"", you could say, and landed a great job, with great opportunity for growth, and will make around 55-60k this year (not including per-diem)....

My situation:

I am 27.

I work on the road--a 3wk/2wk rotation. 

I \*do not\* own a house, have rent, or a car payment. I am not married and I do not have children.

I get 364/wk of non-taxed per-diem while on rotation...

I get full benefits, cell-phone allowance (55/mo). I retain all of the points from hotels and airlines.

I've never had good financial advice. My parents made many financial mistakes and are now faced with the harsh reality of it--I do not want to be in this situation..ever.

DEBT:

Student loans:

45,127 @ 6.13% (private) -- $565/mo

48,689 @ 4.5% average (federal) -- am still on an income-based repayment of $0/mo ... (wanted to focus on private loans)

This is my only debt...

INVESTMENTS:

I will be able to open a 401k w/ the company after 60 days of employment.

I have a Roth IRA w/ Vanguard, which currently has $1,241 in it.

SAVINGS: 

$900.

Does anyone have any advice as to how I should plan for this? I feel like since I have such a small amount of financial obligations (no rent, no car payment/insurance) that I should use this as an opportunity to make up for all the lost years I wasn't investing my money.",finance

My tax preparer sent through all the forms to me via email along with the amount of money I would be receiving for my federal tax refund. Several weeks pass and I have still not received my refund. I contact her and she takes ages to get back to me, always with some convenient excuse... her computer broke so she had to get a new one, or she lost her phone, or she's going thru a divorce, or she's on vacation. In retrospect these all should have been giant red flags as they were her personal problems and had nothing to do with the problem at hand. Finally I was able to get her on the phone today after repeated attempts and she has a total meltdown and apologizing profusely. In a panicked state she then proceeds to text me her Federal login information to see the status myself, which seems like a big breach of her professional role. She says she doesn't have her business laptop with her so I can check myself. 

I decide against that and call the IRS instead. After finally reaching an agent, they inform me that my federal tax form has not gone thru and has been denied 3 times. Apparently their is an incorrect EIN number with one of my employers which accounts for the denial. I am a freelancer so there is a possibility one of my employers gave me the wrong information. So now she informs me that I need to mail in my forms to the IRS as soon as possible. She said I will also be looking at a fine of 5% per month for the amount of total tax on line 63 of my 1040 form. By my estimates I am looking at a fine of a few thousand dollars for 4 months of failure to pay taxes.

personalfinance,403(b) vs aftertax,"Howdy!

If you (yes you) feel charitable, would you mind giving me a sanity check on my 403(b) vs. aftertax calculations? The sheet does not take into account dividends, a screenshot of it is here: [https://imgur.com/a/M5qHunA](https://imgur.com/a/M5qHunA)

Background: We'd like to put money aside. We're both well into middle-age, 47 and 48 respectively. Husband has just started a healthcare job and they do 403(b) instead of 401(k). And the only plan they have is an annuity with a 1.25% fee up front (M&amp;E), plus whatever the fund charges. Ouchie. So my knee-jerk was ""screw you, let's do aftertax"".

Tax bracket is 24 fed and 5.1 state. So I plugged that into a spreadsheet. What it comes out as is - even with a 2% fee (1.25% plus 0.50% on the Dreyfus Index plus whatever these rats don't tell me about), the longer this goes, the better off I am with the 403(b). Taxing first and then taxing the gains again is between 5 to 10 percent (ish) worse than going in tax-free, not taxing the gains, and just taxing the whole kit and kaboodle at the end.

""So much after N years"" was taken from [http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound\_interest\_calculator.htm](http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm) for aftertax and [https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/retirement/403-b-calculator.aspx](https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/retirement/403-b-calculator.aspx) for the 403(b). And then just apply tax to that.

I understand that whatever my spreadsheet spits out as an end value is meaningless, because I can't predict returns, future tax rates, etc. I'm just looking at the spread between 403(b) and aftertax, all assumed things being equal.

I've seen comments that say ""run from those 403(b) fees as fast as you can"", but given my tax bracket, it actually seems as if I should just grin through it.

Am I missing something?",finance

personalfinance,Getting laid off - It's far less scary when you don't have debts and have a 6-month emergency fund. Thanks /r/personalfinance!,"So we just got word that our entire team is being laid off, because there's going to be a merger and the other company thinks they have enough people with our skill sets. This came as a shock as the merger was supposed to include our team as well. Everyone in the office is in panic mode. You can see that they're scared to their deaths. They're talking about how they're not able to afford their mortgages, car payments, other loans, student loan debts, etc...

We live in a small town and this means a lot of people with my skills will be on the market which makes it difficult to find a job that pays as much as the current job. I'm 32, married with two kids and someone like me should be scared to death right now. Indeed I would have been had it not been for this sub and other people who helped me realize that financing a lifestyle I can't really afford is like living in a house of cards, it's always ready to collapse with the slightest of winds.

Starting 6 years ago my wife and I decided that we're going to aggressively clear all debts . That included student loans, car loans, our mortgage and some personal loans from family and friends. It took a lot of hard work but just 3 months ago we paid off our house.

I have an emergency fund for 6 months of expenses. In fact we funded this before we went to pay off the mortgage, so it actually includes 6 months of paying mortgage as well which we no longer need to pay. In reality it's closer to 9 months of expenses.

So I'm going to be unemployed very soon, but I'm not scared. I would have been scared to death if I had a ton of payments to make with no or a small emergency fund. Now, it's just a matter of searching for a new job. I can spend time aggressively chasing down opportunities because I can afford the time to do so! I don't need to work a temporary job just to keep up with the payments.

Whenever I find a new job, the first thing we'll do is to refund the emergency fund to its full level.

So yeah guys, work on your emergency fund. Sure you'll lose money on it because it's in a bank account with low interest rates (compared to investments), but it's your insurance. It's there to support you when your income can't, you're supposed to lose money on insurance. You do it so that if you get into a situation like mine, you don't lose your shit. You can be calm, keep the lights on and keep supporting your family while you're focusing on your future options.",finance
personalfinance,Should I refinance my student loans?,"I currently have a total of $46,500 student loans through two different servicers.

Servicer 1 has a balance of $34,890 with 4 private student loans with variable interest rates; payoff is in 2028.

Servicer 2 has a balance of $11,622 with 11 federal student loans with fixed interest rates\*; payoff is in 2020.\* there's actually 1 or 2 variable ones snuck in there, but overall I'd consider them all fixed.

Servicer's 1 interest rates are now at 6.58% and the average interest rate for Servicer 2's is about 5%. I'm getting curious about refinancing because the interest rates on Servicer 1's loans have steadily crept up. I feel like I have 3 options:

* Refinance/consolidate all with either a 7 or 10 year loan @ 4.93%
* Refinance just Servicer 1's with a 7 or 10 year loan @ 4.93%
* Don't do anything

If I refinance everything, then I'd lower my total monthly student loan expenses by about $100. If I refinance just Servicer 1's (that have the highest interest rates), I save just a little bit more. I guess I'm just wondering if it's worth it just to save about $100 a month. I have awesome credit in the 800's, so I'm also on the fence for taking a hard credit ding.

Edit: If I refinance everything, I'd most likely go with a 10 year loan, but that technically drags out the repayment of Servicer 2's loans...",finance

personalfinance,Looking for advice on if I should take student loans,"Any advice would be appreciated.

My job pays $50,000 a year. I also have a separate business which earns $12,000 to $20,000 a year pre tax.

I have no additional debt from anything. I do have a mortgage, car payment, and bills that cost me roughly $2,150 a month. My wife pays for half of the bills and also gives me money for a portion of the mortgage, roughly $600 a month.

This brings me to $1,550 in expenses outside of food and entertainment.

I am going back for my Master's Degree. The degree will give me a $6,000 pay bump once completed. I could also potentially get a much higher paying job (earning about $80,000 a year) once it is complete.

The degree will cost about $4,000 a semester, three semesters a year, so $12,000 a year. I will finish the program in two years. This brings the total cost of school being $24,000.

CryptoCurrency,The G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors reached consensus to provide their full support for Digital Currencies.,"[https://www.astralcrypto.com/2018/07/23/g20-summit-full-support-for-digital-currencies/](https://www.astralcrypto.com/2018/07/23/g20-summit-full-support-for-digital-currencies/)

Over[ 55 Senior Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors](https://g20.org/sites/default/files/media/whos_who_-_finance_iii.pdf) met on July 21 and 22 to discuss economic cooperation in global economic policies. Digital currencies and cryptocurrencies were among the topics on the agenda. The participaants for the U.S. were Steve Mnuchin, Secretary of the Treasury, and Jerome Powell, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, who both report directly to the U.S. President. In the [G20 press conference on July 22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iw5Vp1JQV0U), the President of the Central Bank of Argentina gave a statement about how the G20 countries expressed their full support for digital currencies during the meetings. They focused on how digital currencies provide technological benefit, increase financial inclusion (especially in less developed countries), and do not represent a global risk to the financial system. The G20 countries also expressed their desire to reduce digital currency use for illegal activities (presumably for things like fraud and terrorist activities).

Read the full statement below (translated to English):

“We discussed a lot about financial regulation and financial inclusion, and here we really focused on the new technologies with all the benefits entailed, and also of course to monitor the eventual risks. We talked about the crypto assets and the cryptocurrencies. The consensus showed that they don’t represent a global risk on the financial system, but of course, as I said before, we really took into account that given the fact that these are technologies that are only beginning, that are in their infancy, we have to really control them and also survey everything that has to do with illegal activities. Now, regarding the financial inclusion, there was full consensus reached, and of course that financial inclusion contributes to growth and the improvement of the standard of living of all the citizens. There is full support of this topic and we focus especially as the Minister said on the digitalization and the benefits entailed by it, especially in less developed countries where the informal economies represent an important percentage of the economy. So digitalization will be a first step towards formality, and also always under the assumption of monitoring everything that has to do with customer protection, and as I said before, also check in any kind of illegal activity. That is essentially the summary.”",cryptocurrency

[*CoinLoan*](https://app.coinloan.io/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=platform_launch) is a lending platform with a P2P economy. On CoinLoan any person or company can become a lender or a borrower on its own terms. The platform’s primary objective is to link counteroffers and ensure the safety of the deal.

**How does it work?**

Crypto collateral protects lender’s fiat funds from the risks of non-repayment. Borrowers get a loan regardless of the credit history and don’t need to choose between holding their crypto and getting access to money.

**What makes us different?**

At the moment, the CoinLoan offers the most flexible conditions in the lending market. Any user has an opportunity to customize the amount and term of a loan, choose currency or cryptoasset for collateral, interest rate and LTV (loan-to-value ratio).

**How to start?**

It is enough to register and verify your account for creating a lending or borrowing application. If there is a suitable counteroffer, the applications will be matched and the user will quickly receive fiat money. Licenses, credit history checks or solvency proofs are not required for borrowing or getting a loan.

personalfinance,"My wife's grandfather is paying for her student loans in 3 checks, question about how to pay it.","Hey all,
My wife has about $32k of student loans to pay off and we have been given one of the most amazing gifts from her grandfather who is very generous and wealthy, he's going to assist in us paying off what's left. He's gave us $10k now, and will give us $10k towards the end of the year and the rest at the beginning of the year, for us to avoid having to pay taxes on the ""gift"". In between the payments we're going to continue to make monthly payments on the principle.

My question comes from how exactly I should apply this money to the loans. There are 9 loans total, all with varying balances and interest rates. Do I pay the entire balance of the loans with the highest interest rates? My only hesitation is that the loans with *lower rates* also have a *higher outstanding balance* than the ones with a higher interest rate. Hopefully that makes sense.

I'm merely interested in applying this money in the most effective way - if that's paying off the loans with the highest interest rates (even though it's less money) then we'll gladly do that. Thanks!

EDIT: Okay, thanks for that guys. I understand I don't have to pay taxes on it, but as far as I care it doesn't matter *how* he gives it to me (in one lump sum or in 3 checks), he's still giving us ~$32k.",finance
personalfinance,My finance plan for the next year- am I doing it right?,"I recently have started taking charge of my finances and have completed a plan for the next year. First, I will be graduating with my BS in December, will be having a baby in February (due date 02/02), and SO will be getting his MS in May. We are both applying for PhD programs to start in Fall 2019 (I will be applying to a couple MS programs as well). We are likely to get in and in our field, PhD programs and some MS programs are fully funded (tuition waiver + TAship). We will be moving next May, basically right after my SO is done with school. We are hoping to live with a relative for 2 months before moving to wherever we end up for school next, but that is kind of up in the air at the moment. So that's kind of our life setting at the moment.

* Now for our debts (smallest to largest):

1. Medical Lab bill in collections \~$120
2. Phone bill in collections \~$335
3. Credit card debt \~$820
4. Car loan \~$5,700
5. His student loans \~$8,000 (in deferment until completion of PhD program, if we get in)
6. My Student loans \~$40,000 (ending total after my last semester, also in deferment until after PhD program. We won't accrue anymore in our PhD programs)

* Our monthly expenses:

1. Rent - $725
2. Water-$30ish
3. Phone- $28.46
4. Internet-$43.94
5. Credit Card (minimum) - $35
6. Food - $300 (we could cut this cost down, but being pregnant has made me very picky. We don't eat out a lot, but I do cook fancy sometimes. We are setting this amount aside, but are going to try to go under this budget every month.)
7. Toiletries - $30
8. Fun Money - $100 (will most likely be cut all or to like $20 when baby comes, for reasons listed later)
9. Gas - $50 (this gets us a full tank, but a full tank lasts us longer than a month most months)
10. Total - $1,518.80
11. Note: I know our expenses will change when baby comes, but I have more research to do on that. I am planning to exclusively breastfeed for 6 months (as recommended by the WHO) and then move to a mixture solid foods and breast feeding. I also have to research cloth diapers more and the cost of that vs disposable, keeping in mind that I don't have a washer and dryer in my apartment and a load of laundry costs $3.00-3.50, not including soap costs.

* Now for our income:

1. From now until late August, we are ""out of work"", because our good jobs are ""seasonal"" (during the academic year). So right now I have a job with a guaranteed 11.5 hours/week at $8.50/hour and a second job which I started last week at $9.25/hour, but hours aren't guaranteed (think food service job). I think once I am fully trained, I think I will get more. Last week I trained for 6 hours, this week will be 11 hours at second job. He currently does not have any income because he is working on research for his Master's. What we have now in the bank and what I will be making will go towards our living expenses until we starting getting a steady income flow in September.
2. From September to January, our monthly income will be at least **$2,454.92.** This does not include income from my second food service job, which I plan to keep. The reason I am keeping a second job and not just working more at my first job, which pays significantly more ($15/hour) is because my hours are capped at 29 hours/week. We will also be getting an extra **$2,600** from a scholarship in August.
3. Once I give birth at the beginning of February, I plan to leave the food service job and be out of work for at least the first 6 weeks. I am still deciding whether to go back to my $15/hour job. Even if I do go back to that job, we won't have to pay for childcare because I basically get to pick my hours (like literally think I can work 1 hour chunks from 7am to 9pm, everyday of the week to work). But since I am unsure if I will go back to this job or take a longer maternity leave, we will assume that our income February to May is **$1,354.**
4. When we start our PhD programs our ""annual"" income will be $35,000-$40,000 (again, September to May), but that is further out than my year plan.
5. We should get our full security deposit back from our apartment for **$1,175** next May.

* Goals:

1. Pay off debts #1-3 for a total of $1275 before December.
2. Save at least $7,000 before the end of January.

* Plan:

Since our monthly income from September to January is $2,455 and our monthly expenses are $1,518, our ""excess"" will be $937. I plan to save $800/ month. That is five months for an ending total $4,000. Out of the scholarship that is $2,600, I want to save $1,500 ($600 will go to debts and $500 is set aside for grad school applications), bringing the total to $5,500 in savings. I hope to make up the extra with my second job's income, which I think is doable (again, I don't know how many hours I will be working). Plus we will add our security deposit to our savings in May for $1,175.

The extra $137/month will go towards the debts. So for five months, that is a total of $685. Plus the $600, from the scholarship, the total is $1,285 (which is actually perfect and I didn't realize until I typed this out haha). Some extra money might go towards debts if I make enough at my second job, specifically the next debt on the list, the car loan.

* Concerns:

The $7,000 in savings will help gap our income to expenses when I am on maternity leave if I chose not to go back to work (February to May) and help our expenses from June to August, plus moving expenses. I estimate $150-250/ month to plug the gap from February to May so a total of $600-1,000 of our savings. Then I estimate keep our monthly expenses the same after that (even though it will likely be cheaper to live with a family member for June and July, but I am just keeping an estimate) of roughly $1,500/ month from June to July, so $3,000. Worst case scenario, $4,000. That leaves us $3,000 for moving costs, deposit, and first months rent.

I want to be more aggressive with my car loan, but I just don't see a place to do it, other than my extra income that I may or may not get with my second job. But even if I get extra income from my second job, once I hit the $7,000, I am wondering if I should put the extra in savings because of baby or if I should start doing extra money towards my car loan (8.990% interest rate). Once I have more solid numbers on what our monthly salary will be when we start our PhD program, I am sure we will have money to attack this debt more aggressively.

* Advice:

1. Please critique my plan! I know that was a lot to read through, but I hope that being thorough is better. I'm super new to budgeting and my parents are super poor and have always lived paycheck to paycheck (and payday loans, yikes). I hope it makes sense to save more than attack my debts right now because of the baby on the way and the life circumstances coming up, but I am concerned about not attacking the car loan aggressively enough. 
2. I'm not super concerned with the student loans at the moment, but will become more concerned when we are in the PhD program. They are all federal loans and mostly subsidized, but a few unsubsidized. At the moment, we only have about $700 in interest from the unsubsidized loans, but I feel like the other things I have listed are more pressing at the moment than the student loans. If I am mistaken then please let me know!!
3. Any advice you can give is so appreciated. If you read through all of this, you are a god send. This is my first budget, so I know it's not perfect!",finance
personalfinance,High CC Debt and Student Loans,"Hello Everyone,

I have been browsing through this sub for a long time now and finally want to make the plunge into getting some help. I was always nervous to put my personal finances out there, but at this point I feel like I need to swallow my pride and get some help. I currently live with my long-term girlfriend who is in professional school and have been trying to support us both financially until she graduates (which is about a year from now). I am about 5 years out from getting my bachelors in social work but found my way into working for a university doing entry level project management work making roughly 40,000 a year. After taxes, this is about $1,100 biweekly. Throughout my life I have had to struggle to get by financially and have racked up CC debt in the process, about 12,000. This is due to surgeries, unemployment after a company going under, and a new engine for my car which I still had thousands of dollars on. Recently I have visited the local social services and they helped me get onto a DMP to start a 5 year repayment plan. My student loan debts are around 72,000. But I screwed up by applying for a Private Loan. I went to college for 2 years and had to drop out due to a family emergency. According to my parents (who were always HORRIBLE with finances), I did not qualify for federal loans after leaving college and had me apply for Private Loans with absolutely horrid interest rates. I now have to pay about 600 dollars between private and federal loans a month. And to be honest, this ends in the viscous cycle of using deferment time to get by financially and further increasing my interest/debt. I honestly feel like I barely have my head above water and am under significant stress living paycheck to paycheck. I cannot say I have been the best with money in the past, but I ultimately want to set myself up for the future so I can eventually marry the love of my life, buy a house and have kids. I can give everyone an idea of my major expenses and if anyone needs anymore general information, I can edit this thread and include it. I also am desperate to figure out how to get a handle on my student loans, especially the private loan. I am already on a Income base driven plan for federal and my private loan through discover does not offer any income based plans. If there is anything that sticks out after laying out my expenses, PLEASE let me know.

Income ~ 40,000 a year, this comes out to $1100 by weekly and $2200 a month.

Student Loans ~ 72,000 left, 420 a month for private, 180 for federal. So $600 dollars a month. I start a graduate certificate that my work is paying 75% of in the Fall. I qualify for deferment for these loans and may be a good opportunity to use the extra $600 for other debt, I am not sure if that is a good idea or not.

CC Debt ~ $12,000, set up a DMP and pay $262 a month with 1% interest rates now. This dropped my CC payments by about $100 dollars a month.

Car Loan - $2100 left. One more year left of the car loan and I pay $190 a month.

Car Insurance - $85 dollars a month

Housing - living with girlfriend and we split rent thank god. I pay about 274 in rent and $60 in utilities a month. So for housing a pay about $334. 

My credit score was around 680 last time I checked. This is also something I want to increase.

This leaves me with ~$729. But I also have to pay about 200 for gas a month (I essentially drive to Gondor for work), roughly 300 dollars a month in food for 2 people, and other misc expenses.

This is about all I can think of for now. Again I am looking for any advice I can get on saving money, paying of CC debt, working out a way to get a handle on my student loans, and other ways of getting a handle of finances in a responsible manner that sets myself up for the future. Thank you in advance for anyone that can give me advice, and again I will provide any more info if necessary.",finance

I found the below article which discuss this and I understand finds the optimum at IRA withdrawals to at least your deductible limit or 12% tax bracket.

How are you managing withdrawals from your various funding sources (taxable, tax deferred, tax free, social security)?

https://www.onefpa.org/journal/Pages/Tax-Efficient%20Retirement%20Withdrawal%20Planning%20Using%20a%20Comprehensive%20Tax%20Model.aspx

Executive Summary  

- A highly precise comprehensive tax model that calculates state and federal income taxes (including the AMT, the impending 3.8 percent Medicare tax, and Medicare premiums) is used to evaluate 15 withdrawal strategies (including variations) and several tax strategies for tax efficiency (the strategy that maximizes the final total account balance over a planning horizon).  


- Base model results show that the tax-efficient strategy (TDD) is achieved by long-term income stability and characterized by low withdrawal rates early in retirement, sequenced as follows: tax-deferred assets up to tax deductions, the rapid depletion of taxable assets, tax-free assets, and tax-deferred assets, preserved throughout the planning horizon. This strategy produces the highest final total account balance, gained through an average 4.5/6.6 percent pre-/post-RMD withdrawal rate, respectively.  

- Variable analysis confirms the tax efficiency of the TDD strategy and suggests it should be the new “common rule” (CR). Using tax-deferred assets to fill the 10 percent tax bracket (TD10) or the current CR (sequentially deplete taxable, tax-deferred, tax-free accounts) produces optimal results in limited cases and with minor benefits. The arbitrary use of the current CR results in significantly lower balances. Withdrawing tax-deferred assets beyond TD10 or tax-free assets before taxable assets is tax-inefficient.  

- Strategies that produce the highest final total account balance rarely produce the lowest total taxes. Several common tax minimization and estate planning strategies do not produce optimal results.",finance

I remember reading [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7vipn5/bitcoin_may_never_return_to_previous_heights_and/) here where a bunch of you retards were basically circle jerking each other on how Bitcoin sucks. That's when I realized this community is a joke and full of newbies who don't know what the fuck they're talking about. I bet 90% of you bought your first crytpo in 2017, frustrated that you can't afford an entire Bitcoin so you become Bitcoin haters instead thinking that Bitcoin dying is the answer to your shitcoin problems. The ""computer science guy"" dipshit who made that thread 5 months ago should've just held Bitcoin.... as much as Bitcoin went down this year, shitcoins got REKT even harder. But here's the main difference between Bitcoin vs shitcoins getting rekt: **Bitcoin WILL go up in time. Shitcoins may or may not.** 

Bitcoin, right now, has meaningful real world utility. A global decentralized store of value, transfer of wealth, unit of account, sound money, etc is real utility that Bitcoin has right NOW. Literally everything else, including ETH, is struggling to find any meaningful use case. This is currently the BEST product to come out of ""blockcain tech"".

The very idea of decentralized/consensus money is not only re-defining the way people look at sound money, but it's also tipping the balance of power away from central banks and authoritarian regime and towards the people. The best part is, Bitcoin currently has NO competition, not even close, of anything replacing BTC as the dominant store of value and primary unit of account in crypto. 

Until your shitcoin successfully tests its governance by rejecting a change forced by major businesses and majority hashrate (NYA/S2X) its immutability is untested and its monetary policy is suspect. Newbies don’t get the big picture and think all blockchains are the same. BTC survived attacks from all directions, has a 10 year history of proven resilience and embraces simplicity and security. Even worse are morons who shit on Bitcoin for prioritizing security and decentralization over alts that make tradeoffs pretending to be decentralized and secure. I’m genuinely not worried about my money in Bitcoin. Nothing else comes close. But it's hilarious how morons think anything with a ""blockchain"" -- like Tron, EOS, etc -- is the same as the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin has enough hash to survive a state sponsored attack, its decentralization aspect is proven and it's the name literally everyone knows, literally every single exchange that list crypto will list Bitcoin by default. It is the ONLY crypto that is guaranteed (minus black swan) to stick around and grow with the whole market. It will most definitely reach a market cap of $1T and I will save this post so I can laugh at the morons who are going to doubt me. The HODL meme came from the Bitcoin community and it belongs with Bitcoin only, I just LOL at morons who ""hodl"" shitcoins as a long term investment. Some of them will work out well, but 90% of them won't. 


If you don't have any Bitcoin and are holding shitcoins..... you're a fucking idiot. Since 2013 I've never put more than 20% of my Bitcoin stash in alt coins. Alt coins are like a game of musical chairs, there's a right time to enter and a right time to exit. Don't risk more BTC than you're willing to lose. 


Inb4 shitstrom. I'm just speaking from experience. Before you get swayed by morons who say how revolutionary EOS, XRP and NANO are.... just remember my credentials vs. the 95% of noobs here who don't know what they're talking about.

personalfinance,Prioritizing Emergency Fund vs. Student Loans vs. 401k Amongst Job Instability (28 y/o),"Hi all,

Living in NYC area and received a job opportunity that I can’t refuse. It’s a 6-month contract (with possibility of extension) that comes out to a 90k salary for the 6 months that have been approved so far (90/hr). I'm giving up an 80k/yr stable gig to pursue this potential dream gig that would hopefully turn into 180k/yr if the contract is extended.

I have about 110k in graduate student loans with 6-7% interest rates that I would love to put a dent in during these 6 months. But given the job insecurity, I’d love to also pump up my emergency fund from 3 months to 6 months (20k instead of the 10k I have stashed away) just in case my contract is not extended. Since the 401k option has no employer match, I’m thinking of ignoring it all together.

Do you agree that ignoring the 401k with no match, beefing up the emergency fund to 6 months and THEN throwing money at the loans is the right move? Or do you think that 3 months is enough, and I should go head first into the loans and ignore the 401k? Or am I missing something altogether here?

Thanks in advance...I really appreciate this sub.

**Number Summary:**

Income: 90k for 6 months

Current Emergency Fund: 10k for 3 months of living expenses

Loans: 110k at 6-7% interest

personalfinance,Advice for 19 College Student Needed,"I'm 19 years old and entering my second year of college at UCF. Currently I have just over $1,000 in my checking account and about $580 in an Edward Jones account. I started with $300 in the account last year (June, 2017) and have been putting an average of $10 a month into the account. I've seen about a 10% return since opening the account. I have $0 in a savings account.

In the 2017-2018 school year I pulled $3500 in federal student loans. In all reality I didn't need any loan money at all. I forgot to decline the loans on my account and they ended up being direct deposited into my account. Instead of paying them back I used them on various things like food and things for my dorm, along with a laptop for school.

For the upcoming 2018-2019 school year my tuition should be fully paid for and I'm expecting about $1,000 in refund money from the school. I'm living off-campus where my rent is $500/month, all utilities are included. I have no debt minus the $3500 in federal student loans (they are subsidized so I don't have to pay them or worry about interest at the moment). I work a part-time job averaging about $400/paycheck being paid bi-weekly.

I guess my question is, what should I do next? Should I open a savings account and not worry about the Edwards Jones account? How much of my current checking account should go into savings and how much should I keep in my checking? I have so many questions haha. What should my next plan of action be?

Any help is appreciated.

personalfinance,Entering grad school (nurse practitioner). What are my loan options?,"I'm new to the grad school financials. I will not be able to private pay for this, so loans are a must. I've looked at options, but I don't know what I may be missing. The federal loan costs (PLUS) seem expensive with the interest rate and the loan fee. I'm not sure if a private loan would be better considering my good credit history. Here's a short profile.

Im an RN that works at a regional hospital. I'm single father of four. I make around $65,000-$75,000 a year. Not much as far as savings go. I pay almost $800 a month in child support despite joint 50/50 custody, i have a mortgage, an auto loan, and living expenses. 

I have pretty good credit, around a score of 740-750 according to FICO.

I have a little undergrad debt. Around $5,000 left. 

I'll be doing psychiatric and mental health nurse practitioner. Starting salary in my area (southern Indiana and Kentucky) is around $115,000 a year after I graduate. 

I anticipate total cost for the 3 year program to be around $35,000. 

My employer will cover around $2,500 a year. I'll continue to work full time while attending school.

personalfinance,My 87 year old grandmother has had Alzheimer's disease for 7 years and Bank of America is going after her for credit card debt. What should we do?,"Hi /r/legaladvice,

My grandmother is 87 years old and has Alzheimer's disease which means she is living with a severe loss of memory. She is living with and being cared for by my grandfather who is 92. Both live on a fixed income of social security which is judgment proof from creditors. They live in New Jersey. She is the sole owner of this account and it is not a joint account. New Jersey is not a common property state so my grandfather wouldn't owe this debt if she passed away.

She has an unsecured credit card account that was listed as 'CLOSED' on her credit report as of March 2012. That was just after her Alzheimer's truly manifested and she stopped driving just before then. Right now the balance is $3,279.52 and I presume that most of it has been fees and interest ($489.49 has been charged in fees and interest alone in 2018). Basically, what I presume was a small amount in 2012 snowballed into a &gt;$3K mess because of her terminal illness and interest/fees. The credit card company has also been badgering my grandfather into making payments on this (which he isn't obligated to do) and it worked until I explained to him that this isn't his debt.


What is the best way to handle this? Some thoughts below:

1. Since my grandparents are married, my grandmother does share ownership of their house with my grandfather. I believe she will die first because of her condition (people with Alzheimer's live for an average of 4 to 8 years). As per New Jersey state law, her share would be wholly exempt from creditors upon death. Is the best strategy for this to just run the clock?

2. I've been in touch with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau but some of the bureaucracy has created obstacles. At first I created a complaint on behalf of the grandmother in my grandfather's name and the result was that they couldn't resolve it due to him being an ""unauthorized third party"". I re-submitted the complaint under her name completely and now they are saying that it is a duplicate. I might have success with them ultimately but I don't know yet.

3. Should I be contacting any other regulators (other than the CFPB) like the Fed or the NJ State Attorney General? Would writing to a Congressman or Senator help? 

4. The bank has been insisting on payments via letter. Is it likely to get them to waive all fees and interest charges since 2012?

5. In a worst case scenario, could the bank account her social security gets deposited to be frozen? Even though it is exempt? I imagine this would have to be put before a judge which is time consuming but again, this is a worst case scenario.

personalfinance,"Looking to buy a 2017 car, need loan for first time","My wife and I are going to buy an almost new car for the first time. We’ve always paid for cars with cash, sort of always had beaters and such. Now with a small family we need a larger car and decided to actually get something decent and above an amount we can pay for outright.

We are wrapping up 2 credit cards that we used to remodel our kitchen with last year. payments are 0% interest and we are paying off by October to avoid penalty, which frees up more than what we estimated a monthly payment to be for a car. 

We briefly met with a Toyota salesperson last week to “look” and they told us interest rates are 4.1 % or so, and that’s with us telling him we have excellent credit. We could afford to start a car payment now, but I wasn’t a fan of so much $ going out for two months. The sales person obviously told us, end of summer is the best time to buy! I don’t know if that’s a sales tactic or if that’s truth. 

My question is, never having to go and get a car loan before, where do I start?

personalfinance,Guidelines for finding financial planner,"Hi all,

Question about financial planner and possibly realtor. 

For five years I worked a high-income, high-stress job for long hours in Washington, DC. Once we had our second kid, the home completely deteriorated our marriage almost collapsed. I needed to be home more for my wife and kids, so I went to work for the federal government and have been there for two years. The federal job is typically 40 hours/week, which has allowed me to be around enough to rebuild my family. We're doing well now, and so my wife and I have decided that it's time for me to leave the federal government for a higher-paying position (though not something *quite* as stressful as before).

The issue is this. I want to have a way to compare time-to-home-ownership in various cities at various income levels. For instance, if I stay in D.C. and want a $750k house and I make $300K/year, how many years before I'm in a home? What if I made $200k in D.C.? What if I wanted a $1.2M home? What if I made $200k in Nashville and wanted a $300k home?

You get the picture. I basically want someone to help me figure out the time to home-ownership, at different income levels, in a few different cities.....taking into account my personal financial situation (tax brackets, debt, college savings, etc.).

I know we could figure this out ourselves, but frankly we are shit at math and don't have the temperament to plan this sort of thing. We are both big picture ""idea"" people, but need help translating out ideas into realistic plans. 

So the question is this: who should I hire? A financial planner, a realtor, both? I see in the side bar that there is some good information on financial advisers, but I'm curious if you all have anything to add after reading this?",finance

personalfinance,Question on my options after Grad school,"Hi PF!

I am a \[25M\] graduate student at a state school on the east coast. I will graduate with a Master's in International Relations in May of 2019. My undergrad was a double major in political science/legal studies from a state school in the midwest.

As of right now, I have no debts other than student loans. I have a small financial package with my Uni and I take out 20,500 per year so after I graduate I will have 41K in federal unsubsidized loans at about 6% each. I have an 8K ""loan"" that I sort of owe a family member after they paid off my undergrad student loan balance but its interest free and I am not entirely convinced they will ever actually make me pay it back. Let's assume that they will make me pay it for the purposes of this analysis, though. I also owe about 4k to my younger brother's college fund that I dipped into a tad to pay for my school. This is also interest free and will need to be paid back by January 2021 when he completes his last semester of school. In total I will have 53K in student loans of which I am only technically on the hook for 41K. I am very fortunate that I was in a situation to have this little amount of debt after a Bachelor's and Master's degree.

I have essentially zero money in savings, and about $1,500 in different stock investments.

I am interested in getting these loans paid off ASAP. I am fine with living like a hermit and spending no money on anything until these loans are gone. I am pretty convinced I could get a non-IR job at a company in the Midwest where I can live at home and make about 45-50K per year with decent opportunity for advancement. If I do this I wont have a car or even a rent payment so I can aggressively tackle this student loan. I plan to pay $1,750 a month for 24 months to pay this loan off.

I am also going to apply to IR and non-IR related jobs on the east coast as well, but I am pretty hesitant. Considering the high rent prices, I am automatically going to be spending about 1000 a month or so at minimum on renting. This, paired with the higher cost of living in general would mean I would need about a 15K or so bump in pay over the midwestern job to make me able to put the same toward my loan balance.

My first question is: Do you think taking a non-IR business job would hurt my chances of landing an IR related job in the future? I am not looking to do research or be in academia. I want to work in government or work in international business.

My next question is: Is taking a job that has a higher pay in an area that has a higher COL going to benefit me in the long run? My mentality is that I would have better negotiating power if my past salary was 60K vs 45K.

My long term goals are to be able to save money and get going on my retirement savings pretty aggressively as well. I do not really care about having a high comfort lifestyle or anything like that for the time being. I am happy with having very little amounts of ""stuff."" As long as I have a job that I like that pays me enough to do what I like I will be happy.

If you were in my shoes, what would you do? Are my salary estimates reasonable for a person with a Master's degree? Does my plan or my options seem reasonable or doable or am I delusional about my job prospects and pay?

New here but was told to ask for advice here from an IRL friend. I'm super stressed out by this and am generally horrible about making large decisions so any input is helpful!

I'm a 21 year old college student with about $20,000 in student loan debt so far after three years of school (2 more to go at least). I work as a waitress and currently have 3,000 saved up, my tips vary and to be honest, I haven't done very well at tracking what I make/ tip averages until very recently, but I'd say right now I average around $300/week. I also work another job which averages $250 per paycheck. My credit score is currently 722. Other bills include car insurance ($110) my aerial fitness studio  ($105) and a train pass for when I commute to school during the school year ($185). I still have to talk to my schools financial aid office to see where some of my grants went, but I may have 4 payments of $400 each this fall semester. Not sure if that's all relevant but I hope it helps. 

Basically my car crapped out of me last week and I need to buy a new one. I paid 1800 for it (2004 Saturn VUE) two years ago and it got me through some good times as a first car! But now it's on to bigger and better things, of which I basically have 3 options I can't decide between. I have already been pre approved for 12k in loans from my bank with a 4.17% interest rate for 60 months. 

Option #1 is a 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse spyder for $3,000 with 74k miles. It's a cute little car and the price is right by my hesitation that I'm going to be in this same situation in another 2 years and that repairs will be expensive, and I really don't want to do that (I sunk almost another 3k into the Saturn). 

Option #2 is a 2012 Ford Focus for ~9k with about 19k miles. Cars in great condition, not too fancy but still gets the job done. Payments would be about $160/month. Will elaborate on my hesitations on this car with the next point. 

Option #3 is a 2016 Ford Focus for an out the door price of 16k with 21k miles on it. I absolutely LOVE this car. Payments would be about $250 a month for this and I'd need to get approved for about another 2k in loans (my dad is helping me with a down payment either way). My dad seems to think this is the best option and I see his point of view as well, as there's still a decent amount of warranty left on the car and after the 60 months are up this car might still be worth some money while the other two may not. 

Reddit I could really use some help. This is all so overwhelming and I'm not really sure what I can afford/I hate spending money/not having a lot of money in my account at any one time. Any advice/words of wisdom would be much appreciated. I'm scared in general of more loans but I need a car ASAP for my two jobs and am going back to the bank/dealerships tomorrow with my decision.

So a for-cash tournament went down, and everyone spent the entire event hiding in forts and safe zones, to a point where the event was literally ended prematurely due to *boredom.* 

I've gone on record saying that while Fortnite and other battle royale style games function just fine as a toy provided for free to players who are vaguely interested and as another goofy streaming genre for people to plug into, battle royale is severely flawed as a multiplayer video game genre.

I brought up the fact before that my Fortnite sessions always went the same way - 10 minutes of wandering and hiding, followed by being shot in the back of the head. I was told to ""git gud"" by the barking slime molds who cast their spores in such a fashion, because of course I was. But I would counter that ""gitting gud"" requires *practice*, something there is no opportunity for in a gameplay experience like that. You can't practice your aim if you invariably die with your gun still holstered.

And it seems the competitive players know that. The YouTube streamers can have fun being aggressive and creative and silly, but the moment the game turns truly competitive, it falls apart. Deaths happen so quickly and are so permanent in battle royale, and your foes so numerous, that sizing up your opponents and learning their strategies *just can't happen.* That opportunity isn't there. You have one shot to survive every encounter. And you'll either live or die, with 90% of that decision being made by who got the drop on whom.

I've made the point before that with 100 people all fighting for survival, odds alone are likely to kill you, as even a good player is likely to die to an unlucky disadvantage they didn't see coming with that many encounters. Law of averages. 96 opponents, 1 life. This idea was scoffed at, but turn your heads toward the recent money match - those players were good, they were at the tournament *because* they were good. And yet they realized that having ""gitted gud"" didn't make their odds of survival out in the battlefield much better. The chances of getting shot in the back of the head moments after stepping out were just too high to risk. There can only be one. What are the odds that it's you? What are the odds that you're the best?

So what *does* this prove about the battle royale genre? Well, it's a by-definition competitive game style, one of the most competitive there is. And yet, in true with-stakes competition, it absolutely falls apart, with unlucky finalists in each match dying to random environmental effects while refusing to step out of relative safety. The high-level players have proven for us that in Fortnite, *the only winning move is not to play*. They proved that, in the minds of the top players, actually playing the game is a fool's errand if victory is your objective. And that is a *damning* proof against a competitive genre.

**tldr:** Battle royale games, especially Fortnite, are filled with conflicting mechanics that tie victory to chance and make safety the ultimate priority in the fight, and the recent ""cancelled due to boredom"" competition drew these flaws out so everyone could see the worst-case scenario those conflicts might cause. Without a massive overhaul that changes the priorities of the game, it will remain severely flawed as a contest of skill and nothing higher than casual play will survive in the battle royale genre's environment.",technology

personalfinance,Amended German tax return due to stock sale - should US return also be amended?,"I just received an amended tax return for 2016 - while I was working overseas for the entire year in Germany. I had sold ""a lot"" of stock (mix of long term and short term holdings), with approximately $50k in capital gains.

I'm now unexpectedly getting a bill for almost €15k in German taxes on that $50k - which seems about right.

However, my (very limited) understanding of federal tax laws would imply I should get a credit to my US return of the same amount - implying that the amended German return will require me to file an amended US return, and I might (ignoring delays in shuffling money around) end up financially neutral from this process.

Am I crazy? Which law should I be looking at? Should I be talking to a German tax professional or a US tax professional?

personalfinance,Feedback request: web app to help you manage loans to family members.,"Greetings r/personalfinance! Through a mix of cheap personal loans, family savings and director's loan from my business I recently setup a \~$40,000 loan over 7 years to my partner to enable her to pay back her student loan in full. Average interest rate has gone from \~8% down to around \~0.5% saving around $15,000 over the course of loan.

To keep track of this I've set up a pretty neat spreadsheet that handles payment plans, interest rates, payment holidays and easy changes to monthly payment.

investing,The yield curve doesn't always invert before recessions.,"From Variant Perception- not sure how to include the charts

One tool that many people have historically used is the yield curve. A yield curve inversion has happened before every recession in the U.S. going back to the 1960s.

So, all we have to do is wait for the next inversion right? We will show that a yield curve inversion is neither a necessary nor a sufficient reason for there to be a recession, but as a single, standalone indicator for recessions, it has no better.

### BACKGROUND:

The yield curve plots the interest rates of similar debt instruments at different maturities. It is often represented by subtracting a long-term bond from a short-term bond, for example, the 10-year Treasury note minus the 3-month Treasury bill, as in the above chart.

The yield curve is typically upward sloping/positive because borrowers require higher interest rates for locking up their money for a longer period of time. However, on occasion the interest rate on longer-term bonds can fall below the interest rates of shorter-term bonds. This is called a yield curve inversion.

### U.S. HISTORY

While the yield curve has inverted before every US recession since 1960, there were actually five consecutive recessions from 1935 to 1960 where the yield curve did not invert beforehand.

While this shows that a yield curve inversion doesn’t always precede a recession, this doesn’t invalidate the more recent predictive power of an inverted yield curve.

### INTERNATIONAL LESSONS

The yield curve is more predictive of recessions in some countries than others. While you see false positives in some countries (especially the UK), a yield curve inversion has typically occurred before recessions in other major countries as well since 1970.

Notably though, the yield curve hasn’t inverted before recessions in Japan since 1991.

It is likely not a coincidence that the lack of yield curve inversions coincided with Japan’s Zero Interest-Rate Policy (ZIRP).

This brings us back to the US, which has held interest rates near zero since the financial crisis. We shouldn’t be surprised then if the yield curve doesn’t invert before the next recession. Also, if you look back at the second chart, the yield curve didn’t invert in the U.S. in the 30s, 40s or 50s when short-term rates were held low.

A yield curve inversion is neither necessary nor sufficient before a recession. It is less likely to occur when short-term rates are low. Nonetheless, if the yield curve did invert, investors should be far more alert to the possibility a recession is as little as 6 months away.

### CONCLUSION:

The yield curve is less likely to invert before the next US recession given low rates. That’s why it’s important to look at a constellation of inputs when attempting to forecast the next recession.

personalfinance,"Please help, neglected my finances in my early 20s and just now finding out how horrible my credit score is.","Kind of a long post


Please help. I’m not very good with managing my finances. I’m now slowly trying to learn how to be more financially responsible. I am now seeing all the consequences of all my bad decisions. Hence my horrible credit score. I made an account on Credit Karma and printed out my credit report and saw there were 4 “negatives”. My score right now is 545. Bad, i know. I have 2 kids and would like to make sure that if anything happens, I can get financial help without having my credit score be an issue. 

I had student loans that started on 2014, paid some but had some past due ones that I just ignored. My account with FedLoan went into delinquency last year, and was transferred to the US Dept of Ed. I tried to paying it out for a couple months and then started having post partum problems. Tried to get back on track early this year and paid off my student loan by settling an amount that I had to pay by April 2018. Paid that off on time. 

Another one of my negatives was from a Kohl’s credit card. Used it maybe 5 times, and didn’t pay it on time and now the late payments are now on my record. I did pay off everything that I owe and now the account is closed. I tried calling them and speaking to a representative and was basically told that the late payment was my fault and by law they had to report that and that is why it’s on my credit report. Nothing they can do about that. 

I have some medical bills that I am trying to pay off. I have 2 accounts that are on “hold” due to a financial assistance application that I submitted, and now is being reviewed if I qualify or not. But none of those medical bills showed up in my credit report. 

I started reading online of what to do, I saw pay-to-delete a lot, but I think I can’t do that anymore since I paid them off already. There is really nothing to dispute because all of those late payments and non payments were true. I don’t want to be stuck in this situation. I’ve read on this subreddit some pretty good uplifting stories of people who made some changes and made their scores higher, but I can’t find any that is similar to my situation. 

My boyfriend, who has an average/ great (I think) credit score 730, offered to add my name to his credit card as an authorized user. I’m not really sure if that would help, I feel like those negatives would just keep dragging my scores down. And I have to wait 7 1/2 years to get it off my report. 😔",finance
personalfinance,New Credit Card for 0% APR Before Entering Law School,"Hi personalfinance,

I'm about to enter law school from the workforce, but I have about 1k in CC debt that I won't be able to pay off before I begin school (I've done the math and I don't have family that will assist me), and it might even increase to \~1.5K after I pay for my move and other things I need. My 0% APR period also runs out this month. I was thinking of getting a credit card that could hold this debt at 0% interest rate until I have a year under my belt and can get an internship (assuming I do well in school, an internship would pay as well as a standard lawyer's job). 

I have a great credit score (&gt;770) and I currently make \~50k, so I should be able to get a good credit card. If the wise thing is to apply for a new one, should I apply with my current salary even though I will become a student soon, or should I apply for a student CC.

# Background:

28M, single, annual salary 180-185k depending on bonus/OT with a 2% inflation adjustment per yr, planning to buy a house in the 700-800k range. I have 184k saved up for 20% down payment and 3% closing costs, plus 30k E-fund (planning to increase to 36-40k in the next few months). Assuming 20% down for a 800k house, the monthly PITI of a 640k mortgage at 4.5%, 30 yr fixed plus HOA would be around 4.5k.

# Salary breakdown of 15k/mo pre-tax:

* 30%/4.5k-taxes
* 10%/1.5k-401k (I max 401k and backdoor Roth IRA)
* 30%/4.5k-PITI+HOA
* 10%/1.5k-living expenses (utilities, groceries, car insurance, etc.)
* 20%/3k:
   * 1k-additional monthly mortgage payment towards principle
   * 1k-taxable brokerage investment account on top of 401k and IRA
   * 1k-flexible spending/replenish E-fund/splurge fund as needed

# Financial stats:

* no debt, pay off CC every month
* 70k total in 401k+IRA, invested in target date funds 2055
* credit score 800+
* my career is stable with low chance of unemployment

# Goal:

FIRE by 50 by paying down mortgage in 20 yrs and cutting annual expenses to 40-50k, living off investments using Roth conversion ladder to access the funds early (will need 1-1.25M in liquid asset according to the 4% rule).

# Questions:

1. I understand I'm exceeding the rule of thumb of getting a mortgage 3x my salary, but with the Bay Area housing market as is, I don't know if it's doable for me. Am I stretching too thin financially?
2. 30 yr vs. 20 yr mortgage. I think I value the flexibility of a 30 yr mortgage in case of a recession, but of course the interest rate is higher. Is the trade-off worth it?
3. Any suggestions/recommendations/advices, house-buying or in general? Sorry for the long post and thanks in advance.

Edit:

1. I put aside 5.5k every year to front load backdoor Roth IRA at the beginning of next year and max 401k, making them \~13% of my pre-tax. If I saved 20%/36k (24k for 401k and Roth IRA and 12k in taxable) assuming 6% return after inflation adjustment, I would have 2.2M at 50 according to [this calculator](https://401kcalculator.net/) from which I can withdraw 88k per year at 4%. Is this estimation off? How much is a more realistic figure?
2. I will aim for a townhouse as I know I cannot afford a single house. I'm looking in the Morgan Hill area as my company is in South San Jose, which makes the commute 15 min.
3. I plan to stay in this area until retirement. If I do get married and have kids, I hope my wife's salary can supplement the additional expenses.
4. How much of a maintenance budget would I need for a fairly new (&lt;5 year) 800k townhouse?",finance
personalfinance,Looking for budget advice,"Hello all,

I’m married with one child and one on the way, living in a suburb of NYC (high COL area) Looking for advice on what my budget should look like. Moving to a lower COL area is not an option right now as we rely heavily on family for childcare, and have a child on the way. Spouse keeps their finances separate and it works for us - this is what I cover from my pay. 

Here are my financial details - all of this is monthly unless noted otherwise. 

Monthly take-home pay: $4,600
This is after taxes (Fed and State), insurance (health, vision, dental - all family coverage), 401(k) contribution (I contribute 6% gross and my employer contributes 7%, which is the 3% match to my 6% and an additional 4% in lieu of offering a pension plan) HSA contribution ($100/paycheck which covers annual deductible), and FSA contribution for childcare (192.31/paycheck) 

Plus FSA reimbursements: $384.62

Total: $4,984.62

Monthly expenses include the following:
Mortgage/Taxes/Utilities: $1,000

Daycare: $440/month (for 1 child, 2x per week, family covers other 3x per week. This is heavily subsidized by my job - other centers not located at my place of employment are literally twice as much - I’ve researched.) 

Student loan payments: $600 (6 loans at two providers ranging from 3%-6.5% interest. Monthly minimum payments to each provider are somewhere in the mid- $200s, I rounded up to nearest $300 each and its autopaid from my bank acct. can give more details if necessary). 

Cell phone: $85 - Family plan with husband, brother, parents, net of 22% discount through work

Lease Payment: $278.30; lease is up in April 2019 and plan on inheriting a fully paid off car after that so this $ will free up but will likely just go to daycare cost for second child. 

Other misc “bills”: $20.99 - Patreon, iCloud

Average tolls: $50
Average diapers: $50

Monthly minimum credit card payments: $200

Subtracting this out from my total take home pay, that leaves roughly $2,200 for “everything else” - food, clothes (self + child), gifts, household expenses, “fun”, additional debt repayment and savings. 

I have $16,000 in credit card debt all at 0% promotional APRs. Don’t get on me for living beyond my means - I did, I admit it, I’m done. This was $24k as of the beginning of this year and I’ve since locked up all the cards and knocked it down this far, and have not added any additional debt. 
In case it matters, here is the breakdown of amount and expiration:

$900 expiring 8/2018
$5,100 expiring 10/2018
$1,800 expiring 11/2018
$8,200 expiring 2/2019

I have $800 in liquid savings right now in an account earning 1.0%. The rest of my “savings” is either in my 401(k) or HSA. I try to put $300/month into savings and have been using this to pay off the credit card balances as the promo period expires, if I have enough in there. If I don’t, the plan is to pay what I can to the nearest hundred and bounce whats left to another 0% offer card.

I would like advice on how to reasonably allocate this remaining $2,200 in my monthly budget among discretionary spending (food, and child-related expenses like clothes at the bare minimum), extra debt repayment and savings. Once the credit cards are repaid, where should I allocate that “extra” money? Also, will take any other general advice/suggestions on cutting costs, saving, pre-tax deductions etc.

- the SEC has 45 days from posting to approve or deny the ETF.

Except the SEC doesn't have to decide within 45 days. It can extend the deadline up to three times:

- 45 more days if ""a longer period is appropriate"";

- 90 more days for the ETF to address grounds for disapproval; and

- 60 more days if again ""a longer period is appropriate.""

This means the real deadline for the SEC to approve or deny an ETF is 240 days after it files notice in the Federal Register (45+45+90+60).

But this isn't notable at all. The deadline to approve or deny the Direxion ETF was July 23. As explained, the SEC waits until the deadline before issuing another extension.

The SEC wasn't making a decision about all of the pending bitcoin ETFs today; it was just handling the next step in the process for the Direxion ETF.

It had absolutely no reason (or justification) to address the VanEck/SolidX ETF. The fact it didn't do so is meaningless.

Bitcoin,"From an article about negative interest rate, other weird fiat proposals","So, I was trying to educate myself about negative interest rates....  and the article I was in had these doozies of suggestions....  

They make my hair stand on end:

""Economists have come up with different ingenious proposals to circumvent the zero point and regain central banks’ firepower. In the 19th century, Silvio Gesell proposed **a tax on holding cash**. In 2009, Greg Mankiw suggested **a lottery scheme for randomly picking serial numbers on bank notes and declaring them void**, making it risky to hold on to cash. In 2014, Kenneth Rogoff explained that **if we could just phase out cash altogether, there would be no alternative to paying a negative rate** on bank deposits and bonds. And there are other proposals, too.""

CryptoCurrency,Possibility that ETF will get delayed until Feb 2019,"I'm afraid this pump is based on false hope and will correct mid August when the SEC inevitably delays their decision.

This is excellent information taken from this user:

r/https://twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1021795224958455810

I highly recommend you read this and this way we know not to get our hopes up too much.

&gt;It kills me to tweet about SEC rulemaking procedures, but given the confusion on [~~#~~**crypto**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/crypto?src=hash) twitter today, it feels necessary.  TL;DR -- the SEC can, and probably will, delay its decision on the VanEck/SolidX commodity-backed [~~#~~**bitcoin**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash) ETF until \~February 21, 2019.  Thread.  
&gt;  
&gt;Some background. Unlike other types of funds (like mutual funds, closed-end funds, etc.), the federal securities laws did not originally provide for ETFs.  As a result, ETFs have to obtain an individualized exemptive order from the SEC before going to market.  
&gt;  
&gt;The timing of the ETF approval process follows a standard formula:  - the ETF files a ""proposed rule change"" with the SEC; - the SEC posts notice of the filing in the Federal Register and solicits comments; and - the SEC has 45 days from posting to approve or deny the ETF.  
&gt;  
&gt;Except the SEC doesn't have to decide within 45 days. It can extend the deadline up to three times:  - 45 more days if ""a longer period is appropriate""; - 90 more days for the ETF to address grounds for disapproval; and - 60 more days if again ""a longer period is appropriate.""  
&gt;  
&gt;This means the real deadline for the SEC to approve or deny an ETF is 240 days after it files notice in the Federal Register (45+45+90+60).  Yet, because of how the law works, the SEC can't just set a 240-day deadline from the jump. It has to do the extensions one at a time.  
&gt;  
&gt;Today, the SEC extended its deadline to approve or deny the Direxion futures-backed bitcoin ETF by 60 days; the new deadline is September 21.    This is the third &amp; final extension allowed by law -- 15 U.S.C. § 78s(b)(2), in case you were wondering.  
&gt;  
&gt;[~~@~~**Coindesk**](https://twitter.com/coindesk) reported: ""Notably, none of the ETF proposals being postponed are from VanEck and SolidX\[.\]""  But this isn't notable at all.

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The SEC's timing on the Direxion ETF is totally standard:    
&gt;  
&gt;**- Notice originally posted on January 24;**   
&gt;  
&gt;**- First extension issued on March 1 (\~45 days later);**   
&gt;  
&gt;**- Second extension issued on April 23 (\~45 days later); and**  
&gt;  
&gt; **- Third extension issued on July 24 (\~90 days later).**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;So the standard timing for the VanEck/SolidX ETF would be:  
&gt;  
&gt; **- Notice was originally posted on June 26;**   
&gt;  
&gt;**- First extension expected \~August 10 (45 days later);**

&gt;**- Second extension expected \~September 24 (45 days later); and**   
&gt;  
&gt;**- Third extension expected \~December 23 (90 days later).**  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Add 60 days to December 23 and you get a final deadline of February 21, 2019.  This could move forward or back by a few days (e.g., because December 23 is a Sunday and the SEC may be closed on December 24/25 too), but late February is the most likely target for a decision.

crypto_currency,Distributed Credit Chain,"In recent years, loans have not returned, which in turn leads not only to the decline of the banking system, but the entire financial system as a whole. Due to the fact that the non-repayment percentage is growing, the bank has to raise the interest rate on loans and expect payment from ""good creditors"". This, in turn, leads to a strict selection of potential candidates for a loan. Therefore, the bank's employees began to analyze the provided documents and certificates from the client's work place in order to assess in advance whether a person can pay the loan or not.

To somehow meet the demand, private companies appeared that began to provide microcredits to the population. They issue such loans to almost everyone, but with even higher interest rates.

Distributed Credit Chain - the platform was created in order to remove the monopoly from the lending market, thanks to the technology of blocking. This platform is a decentralized unified credit market, where all transactions are determined by supply and demand.

Advantages of the platform.jpg

• We are exterminating the monopoly. In a decentralized market with many competitors, the user will decide what services he will use and for what price.

• Protection and confidentiality. Now there is no need to store your data in the servers of third parties. With this platform, data will be stored locally or in the cloud, encrypted. The data can be transferred to the recipient in an encrypted form, that only the recipient can process the data without saving it.

• Improved efficiency of data validation. Personal data is checked automatically using specially created algorithms, which increases efficiency and eliminates the need for data verification by each authority separately.

• Data Exchange. That is, the user needs to upload his data to the ""stock exchange"" once to provide all the authorities with them, and this market will help the authorities to certify the data better.

• Control of risks through AI. This is an algorithm that helps financial institutions to process personal data of users to process without storage at their own expense in the means of the blockade and AI.

• Open loans. That is, if you have purchased a loan in one institution, it can be seen by other credit institutions to prevent fraud.

• Reviews. Institutions will be able to provide feedback on the lender to help other institutions secure the creditor's choice. This information can be viewed by other bodies.

personalfinance,Student Loan “Principle” Issues,"This may come off as amatuer-hour but please feel free to answer as bluntly as you’d like. 

Here’s the deal. I have about $70k in Parent Plus loans that I’ve been paying off since 2016. 

Recently I got a new job with a nice enough pay bump where I can now focus on paying them down faster than I was. I opted to swap from the 10year plan to the 25year plan. I did this because my monthly payments would be reduced from ~$950/month to ~$585/month. Also to focus on paying all the extra on the highest interest loans only. 

I had my parent call FedLoan and tell them I don’t want any form of future payment type allocation. To make it clear all excess payments go towards principle and principle only. Not “future payments.”

So, I pay my $585 a month for the monthly payments and then dump another grand or two into principle when I get it. It shows on the site that the principle on the specific loan now has a reduced number equivalent to the extra I dump in. Cool. 

However, after doing this for several months - I am still being billed for $585 every month. 

Why is my monthly payment not going down?

If I am truly paying on the principle - shouldn’t the interest that accrues be reduced? 

Thanks in advance for any input!",finance

personalfinance,Can I afford to buy a home?,"hi PF,

Im a male, 25 y/o, income is 92,000 plus commission (new job, not certain of how much commission I'll be making)

I want to buy a house in Chester County, PA. The asking price is 315k but its very competitive. my agent and i decided to go in at 320k and to waive any issues that come up in home inspection that are less than 15000 to repair (except for septic and termite damage if those present issues) to show how serious i am as a buyer.

here are the remaining details on my finances:

Assets:

\-20k money market ""emergency fund""

\-10k in checking account

\-28k in IRAs ( Fidelity &amp; Betterment)

\-10k in Investment account with my bank

Income: 

\-80k base salary

\-12k auto stipend (this is where the 92k above comes from, and yes i can keep what is not used for the car, paid out in $1000 increments each month)

Expenses:

\- 9.6k (12% of base salary as Retirement Contribution with matching up to 5%)

\-4.8k in auto lease payments and insurance

\-7.2k in student loan repayment ( i do \~600/month but my minimum payment is somewhere around $120, should i reduce this contribution?) 

\- 400 in subscriptions to netflix/amazon/ XB/PSN etc ( about 5-10 a month for each)

\-1.32k phone bill

I also estimate around 200/ month in utilities for the home and 450/ month for groceries for 2 adults (please let me know if these are inaccurate, this is the best i could find online)

The house/ mortgage:

320k offer

5% down (16k)

\~15k in escrow and closing

interest rate \~4.6%

annual taxes on property = 4.1k (very low for the area)

annual Home insurance = 1k

No HOA fees

monthly mortgage payment = 2k

I'll be living with my girlfriend, but she wont be on the mortgage. out combined income is around 125k where she makes about 30% of the total and i make about 70%. For this reason, she'll be paying me rent in the amount of 30% of the mortgage (\~600/ month) and i would pay the remaining (1400/month)

With all of this factored in, my Debt to Income Ratio is around 32% (recall this doesn't include commission, actual would be lower)

my down payment and closing costs would essentially take all of my checking and money market funds. i would try not to touch my retirement savings or investment account but its pretty liquid if i need it for an emergency.

personalfinance,Need motivation to reduce food spending,"See the bottom for a TLDR breakdown of our finances by the numbers.

My wife and I have been on a path to reducing our spending for the past couple of years. The way we have approached this is to look at a pie chart of our overall spending and then tackle the categories from largest to smallest. Using Mint, we determined that our top 3 categories are housing, transportation, and food  (just like most people).  So far, we have minimized our spending on the top 2: housing and transportation. We minimized those by buying a duplex to rent out the other half, and paying cash for cheap used cars to commute (mine $3,000 and hers $6,000).

However, we have constantly struggled with our food spending. We spend a lot on restaurants and fast food. We have gone through phases of cooking meals at home with a crockpot and some simple dishes, but this tends to taper off after a month or two and we fall back into old habits. We are both overweight and tend to derive a lot of happiness from food, which is probably at the root of the problem. I view food as an indulgence and find it very psychologically difficult to restrict myself in this area. I am looking for advice from people who have come from these levels of spending on food and managed to control it. Maybe we just need to be shamed into changing habits... I don't know.

**Location:** Akron, Ohio (low to moderate COL)

**Annual Pre-tax Household Income:** $120,000

**Monthly take-home** (after all taxes and paycheck deductions): \~$6,000

**Main Monthly Expenses** (ordered by current size, very high-level and not detailed): 

**Food -** \~$1,200/mo, this is usually $300 to $400 in groceries and the rest is eating out (restaurants/fast food/takeout) for lunches and dinners

**Housing &amp; Utilities -** \~$600/mo after rental income

**Student Loans -** \~$300/mo, $20k federal @ 4%, $10k private @ 7%

**Misc Shopping/Entertainment -** $200/mo

**Transportation -** \~$200/mo, just gas and maintenance, no car payments

The rest we use to pay down the student loans. Clearly the food spending is out of control and is way higher than what I see other people talking about in this sub.

**Relevant Habits:**

1. We both buy lunch every day at work which averages $8 to $15/day for each of us ($16 to $30 combined).
2. We started frequently using Uber Eats to order food delivered to our house about 6 months ago. This often totals $30 for both of us including the fee.
3. We eat at a sit-down restaurant once or twice a week to the tune of $40 each time.
4. We have a generally indulgent attitude toward food.

Thanks in advance for any advice!",finance

personalfinance,I have ~$800 a month in spare income. What kind of account should I be saving a portion of this in?,"I'm 25, turning 26 this Thursday. For most of my life I've lived paycheck to paycheck and I really want to get myself into a better financial position. I posted previously about buying a new car, but have since decided to not buy a vehicle for now.  I have have returned to a $0 debt, $0 saved situation, and want to build up an emergency fund. Beyond regular deductions on Canadian paychecks, I have made no contributions to retirement funds or pensions. 

I've used Mint in the last year to help coordinate my finances, develop a budget and dig myself out of $6000 of credit card debt. Part of my debt crisis came from my computer unexpectedly dying, and unexpected vet bills when my dog developed an upper respiratory infection last December. I want to be able to weather those kinds of issues in the future, on top of having money to pay things like a future down payment on car. I'm currently attending a fully funded PhD program in the US and earn US dollars but all of my main accounts are in Canada, where I'm from. 

**My main question(s): Are there ways to start savings accounts with decent interest rates if I'm only contributing $200-300 a month? What kind of accounts should I be looking into? What kind of accounts should I be avoiding?** 

I've seen a lot of talk about Roth IRA accounts on this forum but I'm pretty clueless as to what those are, and whether they are available in Canada. Also wondering what I'd qualify for such an account given my low income (&gt;30k a year). I do plan on speaking with an accounts manager at my local bank who helped me move to the US before. She was excellent, but I'd like to go in informed of my options. Other tips on how to save, and adjust my current budget would be great. 

*My Current Budget:*

Monthly income: $2200 USD/month after taxes (17% is automatically withheld every pay check)

Rent: $856/month

Renter's Insurance: $11.50/month

Utilities: $6-20/month (depending on the time of year)

Phone: $58.78/month

Dog food/supplies: $150/month

Groceries: $300/month

Residual income after bills: $809/month

I have it set up that 50 cents per transaction on my debit account does to a basic savings account. Switched to pulling a set amount of cash for groceries every week to curb my spending and found it really effective as well. My phone is a little bit more expensive, but I save $5/month with auto-pay and it's a North America wide plan, so I have no issues when I go between countries. To date, I've been using the residual $800 I have after expenses to pay off my credit cards. As of August 1st, both cards will have no remaining balances as I subletted my room over the summer to save on rent and pay down my cards. Currently have 2 credit cards, both with a 19.99% interest rate.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much r/personalfinance!",finance

Other than food and miscellaneous expenses, do you have any recommendations for saving for a home while building an emergency fund? I am thinking we should look to buy a home for approximately $200k as that would still be manageable on just my current salary once we pay down our debt and decrease spending. I know that the gold standard for purchasing a home is to save 20% of the cost of the home however I would prefer to not wait that long if possible especially when we have children. We also currently do not have an emergency fund so if it is remotely possible I want to build that at the same time. Neither of us is very experienced financially so we are trying to learn quickly.

investing,I just found out the size of the Federal Reserve balance sheet.

It turns out that early last year the Federal Reserve had accumulated around $4.5 trillion in government debt (treasuries, mortgages, etc...). I knew the balance sheet was big, but I honestly had no idea it was at this scale. 

As the economy started to improve the Fed decided to unwind the portfolio. It sounds like that plan is not going so well and they have only been able to sell around $300 billion so far over 1 year into the program of unwinding. 

I guess the point of my post is two fold... 1) Why isn't this a bigger deal? The entire national debt is close to $20 trillion, the Federal Reserve has 25% of this amount on their books? And 2) What happens if they can't sell most of it before the next recession? I would imagine they are not selling because if they flood the market with Treasuries and MBS's interest rates will skyrocket, but it seems like continuing to artificially depress interest rates forever could backfire someday.

I understand there are financing charges, interest, and possibly payoff charges if I pay it off sooner, but I was hoping to maybe get some sort of estimate of what the terms would be?

Adding to that, I have a fair credit score, currently 10 active accounts (will discuss below). With that info., again I ask does anyone have a guess as to what my terms would look like? Beyond that, can anyone advise how financing a lap top would look on my report? I don't necessarily need to finance it, just would probably make life easier barring high finance charges etc. I plan on paying off the lap top in 4 checks (8 weeks) max, so obviously that would be a lot sooner than the contract terms would be, which is why early payoff charge was mentioned before. Would paying it off quickly help, maybe even boost my score, or will it do more harm than good? Essentially I am looking for rationale to not finance a lap top. Keep in mind I may have to pursue a new car eventually, my baby is 11 now and is currently working great, but life happens quick and bad *choose your favorite expletive* happens quicker.

Next, I have questions regarding my credit. Currently I am mid 20s and about to start law school part time working full time. I have one card, 8 accounts for student loans, and apparently a gas bill in collections from a year ago. First things first, can I dispute the gas bill being a negative factor on my report? I was not aware of it until pulling my credit report this date. I've never received any mail about it nor an email or call. It is currently in collections, but that is weird because it's not being collected on (awful joke keep reading please). I re activated my gas online account and apparently a letter was sent in October 2017 to the address I had the services at. I canceled services in August 2017 and moved out same month. Current occupants did not send anything my way. Let me know of anything I can do, aside from paying it off ASAP (calling tomorrow).

As for debt, above I mentioned a card and 8 loan accounts, totaling about $26k. Going in to law school means I'll have more debt, and assuming most things stay the same, I'll rack up about $12k-$15k a year for 4 years, so somewhere around $90k max. Is that a lot? Dumb question, but comparing myself to most of my friends I'll only have slightly more debt than they do, and they aren't going to law school. I plan on keeping up payments on all accounts while in school as well, want as little debt as possible. Now, in terms of overall life benefit, would it be better to focus on debt like I am right now, or shift my money towards investments and savings? I know the answer is probably to find a balance between both, but I am looking for some sort of direction. Currently have 1 savings account and a 401k I just got with my job, so no real savings at all, no emergency fund. Let me know what is the best thing to do in terms of prioritizing debt vs. savings.

When my wife begins her career, her net take home pay will be approximately $2000/mo. We plan to split that between $1500/mo student loan payments and $500 save for retirement until the loans are gone. After that, the full amount of her salary will be saved.

If we stick to that plan. I think we could be [debt-free in approximately 5 years](https://imgur.com/PcIjD8O) while being on our way to hitting our retirement goals.

personalfinance,Navient Private Student Loans Increased to 10% refinance?,"So my husband has about $24,000 in 3 private student loans that are now managed by Navient. Recently the interest rate on all three was bumped up to 10%. He was doing the avalanche method but it seems the quicker he tries to pay it down the more they jack up his interest rate. Now they are offering a great interest rate through Navi Refi. Less than 5% for 10 years and less for a shorter time. I've seen all the hate for Navi Refi but the next best offer he has is 5.699 from SoFi. That's over $1094 difference (over 10 years). Does it ever make sense to refinance at another company for a higher rate (than another company) if they have a better reputation. Also, what's the deal with refinancing multiple times?

In 2014, I acquired a 7-year treasury note, par amount $2500.

There are no options within Treasury Direct for selling it or offering it up for auction.

I spoke to a private broker at a fairly large firm nearby (western Massachusetts) who said that her firm did not handle this sort of instrument, but that some banks might.

Trust or Avoid?,"*The people behind an ICO plugged by Mayweather have been arrested, Hilton tweeted about a startup whose CEO is accused of harassment and a project involving Seagal will soon end in an exit scam. Let’s work out the correct response to popular figures who join blockchain projects.*  

https://i.redd.it/27jghsad12c11.jpg

How to choose the right startup out of thousands? Where should you invest to make sure you won’t get left holding the baby? Where are the shitcoins and where is the digital gold? These questions, among others, torment millions of people worldwide on a daily basis. Fortunately, the knowledge level of crypto enthusiasts is slowly growing. Whoever isn’t too lazy to do some reading and look for the right info can have +100k scam defence stats. But even then, it’s hard to take everything into account. Fraudsters come up with new schemes all the time and you need to be extremely careful if you want to keep hold of your money.

Scam hunters are divided into two groups – those who think that celebrity involvement in a startup is a red flag and those who, on the contrary, see it as a sign of credibility. We decided to find out who has the truth on their side.

## Red Flag

Steven Seagal is at a loose end. Other people are saving ships and planes these days, his Russian passport has only brought him advertising work in that country and not even his craziest fans watch the latest films he’s starred in. Still, his 7 kids need to be fed somehow, so the actor agreed to join the Bitcoiin project. The name alone tells us it’s a fucking scam aimed at idiots (just imagine you’re launching a sportswear brand. You wouldn’t call it Nice, would you?). Take a look at the website and [road map](https://bitcoiin.com/en/roadmap), then tell us: what raises 100 million dollars in investment and still produces absolutely nothing? Hint: it’s a 4-letter word that starts with “s” and ends in “m”. Seagal himself has already washed his hands of it, just like the rest of the team.

Floyd Mayweather Jr. must be the greediest black guy in history. He earns almost $300 million a year, but is still willing to advertise anything that will pay up. That’s why he hyped Centra Tech without even bothering to look into what it’s all about. Meanwhile, they’ve raised $30m and were [about to shaft their investors](https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/centra-tech-sec-fraud/), but the SEC sprung into action in the nick of time and arrested the startup’s bosses.

Paris Hilton always loved partying and drinking, but that lifestyle needs big money. So the glamour girl did some promo work for [Lydian](https://lydian.io/marketing-platform/index.php). Then a few weeks later, she deleted the tweet and claimed she had no links to the startup. Why, oh why? Maybe because the [community managers are evil](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2389995.0) or because the website with revolutionary solutions from genius Gurbaksh Chahal was made 6 months ago for [200 bucks](https://www.scamadviser.com/check-website/davinci11.com) or because of his [court cases](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/09/25/as-founder-faces-possible-jail-time-an-inside-look-at-lydiancoin-paris-hilton-endorsed-cryptocurrency/#1d823ce17cca) for harassment and domestic violence. By the way, it’s a great story: you get sued, so you hold an ICO to raise money for lawyers or your new life on a tropical island. Profit.

crypto_currency,Distributed Credit Chain !!!!!,"Good afternoon! Today I will talk about a cool project that will bring something new to the world of financial services. Why did I call this project cool? Because he has already collected a hardcard on the ICO, which is extremely rare, and besides he was already engulfed on the stock exchange. However, I will not hurry and tell everything in order.

There are situations when we need to borrow money. Usually loans are taken from relatives or friends, who of course do not require interest on repayment. However, if we do not have anyone to turn to, then we have to borrow from the bank, that is, take a loan at a percentage.

If you look at the history of money, you can see how bankers (who, honestly, are, in fact, ordinary usurers) showed considerable ingenuity in drawing up mechanisms to increase their monetary capitals. Their main invention originates in ancient Babylon and is called loan interest. It is worth noting that for legalization of loan interest in society, usurers had to go through a number of stages. All stages of Overton Window were realized: from complete rejection of this phenomenon to the legislatively fixed norm, which we see at the moment. Personally, I do not like such a phenomenon as credit and I myself try not to use it. My opinion is that the credit should be treated as an operation - if this is a vital necessity, and you can not do without it, then of course you need to use it. But if there is an opportunity not to take out a loan, then why should it be taken and subsequently repaid interest? However, now in many countries, for example in the US, the practice of taking out loans for every sneeze is very common. Most Americans regularly use credit cards, even if they have enough money to buy these goods without credit. These are certainly extremes, but there are situations when a loan is needed. For example, when one of your relatives falls ill with a dangerous disease and large amounts of money are required for treatment, or your gas stove is so leaky from the time that neighbors begin to complain about the smell of gas, and you do not have money for a new plate at the moment. In general, such situations can be listed for a long time, but the point is that the need for such a phenomenon as a loan exists.

If you find it necessary to take a loan, then you can take it in a bank. But in the traditional financial banking system there are many shortcomings:

high refinancing rates of central banks, in connection with which credit is extremely unprofitable

the human factor plays a significant role in deciding whether to grant you a loan or not

the causal relationship of the monopoly of the Central Bank is the slow development of technology, since when there is a monopoly - there is no competition, and there is no competition - there is no desire for development

The project, which I will discuss in detail below, offers solutions for these problems.

The project Distributed Credit Chain- (in literal translation from English means ""distributed credit chain"") is a platform developed on the technology of blockages for the provision of financial services, and if more specifically for credit products.

The Distributed Credit Chain project offers the following solutions to the pressing problems of the traditional credit system:

Reduced loan rates: you do not have to overpay for a loan

Instant credit processing: you do not have to wait for a long time to approve your application

International coverage: it does not matter in which country the client lives.

Elimination of monopoly: thanks to the distributed banking ecosystem, the project seeks to break the monopoly of traditional financial institutions and return the revenues from financial services to all participants in these services

The main objective of this project is to change the system of issuing loans and loans.

One of the main advantages of this project over the traditional system is that the entire credit history of each client will be stored in the technology of the block, and it will not take a lot of time to check it, and accordingly the loan can be executed instantly without spending a lot of time on this procedure .

What are some options on how to best deal with my student loan debt moving forward? How can I minimize foreign exchange risk? Are there any tricks to my situation that I could potentially use to my advantage to help me pay off these things?

My student loan balance is about $120,000. $60,000 in private loans have variable interest rates of 10% and rising. $60,000 in federal loans have fixed rates ranging from 3% to 7%. My annual income is about $30,000. Half of this goes towards my student loans. My private loans are scheduled to be paid off in 12 more years. My federal loan balances are actually increasing because income-based repayment has lowered my payments for me. I should be able to get them forgiven in 23 more years. I will be getting close to retirement age by that time and will have no retirement savings and little social security built up, especially if foreign exchange rates work against me.

Any tips/advice is much appreciated! Thank you in advance!

So here's the situation: In 2013 I was an intern with federal government. In 2015 the government's Office of Personnel Management had a data breach, and my data was potentially leaked. Since then, they have provided me with credit monitoring service, that I have set up to send me alerts when there are any changes. 
This morning I received an email from the monitoring service telling me there was a Huntington bank account opened with my information, that was the extent of the notification.
So I printed off the notification, and stopped in a branch near my office and asked them if there were any accounts in my name. They did a search, and there were no accounts in my name, but I then asked them to search for accounts using my ssn, which turned up multiple accounts, some open since 1994 (When I would have been 3). These accounts are not in my name - but do in fact have my ssn attached to them. I asked what the next steps are, and they told me they need proof that the ssn is indeed mine before they do anything involving the accounts. I can understand this, I would hope my bank would do the same for someone that came in saying the same about my accounts.
I'm going to stop at home and get my social security card out of my safe on my lunch and stop back, but I'm wondering what all I should be considering and potentially worrying about in this case. 
I've pulled my credit reports, and they don't show any information not related to me and my accounts. My credit score is good (Had it pulled while opening a business banking account last month), so it seems like this might be a case of someone just incorrectly inputting what they believe to be their ssn. 
I've been doing some Google searching, and am trying to remain calm in doing so - but could really use some more knowledgeable, cool-headed individuals' opinions and thoughts on what the appropriate next steps are. If I've left any information that may be pertinent out, please do let me know as well.

Wife’s Car: $16000 at 10% interest (This is also her work vehicle. We can NOT get rid of this or change it for a number of reasons). The monthly payment is \~$400 and she usually pays about $600 toward it

My car: Paid off, 12 years old, pretty dinged up but very reliable so far, worth \~$3000. I commute

My IRA: $22000

My 401K: $31000

Her 401K: $22500

Wife Student Loan: An amount of money that would shatter our psyches should we dwell on it too much. We currently treat it like it’s an active volcano nearby… we just ignore it 99% of the time for now (paying $450/mo on income based repayment, won’t stay that way)

Wife IRS: $18000 at 10% (This is left over from a previous marriage where she owned her business and her alcoholic ex completely failed to be a responsible person and the wife didn’t keep an eye on him)

If she gets a job offer, she has to take it. My wife no longer trusts her current employer and we do not believe the business is financially sound and her boss is very unapproachable about these issues. The new business is in great shape and she would be set up great to be a partner and eventually and owner of it.

The pressing issue is that my credit score sucks. It was good when we bought the house, the mortgage is in my name because we used only my credit score to get it. The biggest thing depressing it is how much money is on my credit cards. Using Credit Karma’s credit simulator if I paid off my cards entirely my credit score would go up \~110 points, back into the 700s

The other issue we are concerned about is the fact that we’ve only been in the house for such a short while and barely built up any equity in the house, and then we’d be moving to an area where a house of the same size is about 40-50% more expensive.

The final issue is just how short of a time we have to make the necessary changes for this.

First things we have done

1. Dramatically reigned in our lifestyle, eating out MUCH less, finding recipes to make food in bulk thus cutting grocery bills as well. A lot more vegetarian dishes to cut down on the cost of meat/protein. Stopped getting coffee out, I switched back to tea and she’s gone back to making her own coffee in the morning
2. Stopped overpaying on debts, wife has stopped overpaying on her car and I’ve stopped overpaying on any credit cards except for the one I am focusing on snowballing
3. Much less driving. We are very outdoorsy and tend to go on trips a lot but we’ve cut down on that to save gas, mileage, wear and tear, etc
4. Moved to a new insurance company (and consolidated) for car and homeowners, reduced our monthly payment by \~$100
5. I started winnowing down my various online accounts, consolidating some old hosting accounts and that sort of thing.
6. Haven’t made any Amazon purchases for 2 months aside from our laundry detergent and other goods like that

Currently we are considering liquidating my 401k (I know this is usually a BAD IDEA^(TM) ), using it to pay off all the credit card debt and then putting the remainder into savings. I don’t know if this is the right course of action and really could use some advice on how to bring up my credit score quickly. However, once this move is done we will be making a combined $170000 annually and I believe I could quickly rehabilitate my retirement savings as well as finish paying off the wife’s car.",finance

[*CoinLoan*](https://app.coinloan.io/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=platform_launch) is a lending platform with a P2P economy. On CoinLoan any person or company can become a lender or a borrower on its own terms. The platform’s primary objective is to link counteroffers and ensure the safety of the deal.

**How does it work?**

Crypto collateral protects lender’s fiat funds from the risks of non-repayment. Borrowers get a loan regardless of the credit history and don’t need to choose between holding their crypto and getting access to money.

**What makes us different?**

At the moment, the CoinLoan offers the most flexible conditions in the lending market. Any user has an opportunity to customize the amount and term of a loan, choose currency or cryptoasset for collateral, interest rate and LTV (loan-to-value ratio).

**How to start?**

It is enough to register and verify your account for creating a lending or borrowing application. If there is a suitable counteroffer, the applications will be matched and the user will quickly receive fiat money. Licenses, credit history checks or solvency proofs are not required for borrowing or getting a loan.

I just sold my home (closed last week). I had some credit card debts and loans that I paid off with the profits from the sale. After everything is paid off I will have approximately $80,000 in cash. Bought the house is 2014, upgraded the interior completely in early 2018. I am looking for advice on what to do with this money to make it work for me.

personalfinance,Home Purchase Question: to buy or not to buy?,"Hi all, this is a throwaway as many friends/family know my username. Per the title, debating buying a home right now. Quick numbers below. My question to you all is do you think it would be crazy to buy the home right now, given those numbers and the situation? Looking for some outside perspective.

Found a home I like quite a lot, but I'm a bit worried I'd be over extending myself. I'd have to pull the down payment and closing costs from my Roth-IRA, basically reducing it to $8,000. I'm attracted to the idea of the home because I think theoretically it is cheaper in the long run than renting, but in order to do it I'd have to greatly reduce the amount I can save over the next year or so while renting. I can get out of my lease without issue, at no penalty. I think the safe play is to continue renting and building up my savings for a larger down payment, but the idea of having a place to really call my own and start building equity is also very attractive. Thank you and please let me know if you have any questions. Sorry for the long post, too!

personalfinance,Plan for paying off a car in 2-4 years. Do you think its practical?,"So I financed a new car for 18,000. (4000 less than MSRP) but the term is 72 months. I love the car and the payments are 350 a month which is a small fraction of my monthly salary.  But of course. No one wants to pay that much for 6 years. So I downloaded an app called 52 weeks and set a plan for 2 years to create a separate savings solely for this car. The first year. (Current) I started off small with $5 increase every month and its automatically withdrawn into an account I cant access with a decent interest rate that increases with every consistent deposit over $25. Which should grant me $6,800 at the end of the year. During this time. I will be refinancing my car loan and aim for a lower payment, and I will be 25 years old at the time, hopefully lessening my insurance payments significantly which would grant me more saved income

So For the second year. I set the amount to a $10 increase deposit every week which should give me around $13,500 for a total of $20,300.  Not including my already existing savings account. My plan is to make a big pay off mark after two years (or four if issues arise) 

My idea is that if I pay off on my car for two years in a row, I should be at 11k in debt with my current interest rate. Or less with my new rate a year from now. Which means I would have almost twice the loan in cash to pay off the entire remaining loan and still have almost 10k. Worst case scenario is that I still take off about two years of the loan term. 

I'm about 34% done with the two year challenge",finance
personalfinance,Want to refinance car down from 13.49% interest. Help.,"I bought my car 10 months ago when my credit  was in poor shape. I had never checked my credit score before and didn’t even have a credit card. My only credit history was my previous car loan (3 yrs, on time payments) and delinquencies from medical bills I never paid. Before I purchased my current car, I made sure to pay the delinquent accts and have them deleted from my report (thanks to browsing on personalfinance this wasn’t too difficult.) In the months following I got myself a credit card w CapOne that I use every month and pay the balance off completely. I also got another card from a dept store which I use and pay off monthly. My score hopped from a 630 last year to a 702 currently. Not the best, but I am proud my finances are coming together. Here is the details of my loan. 

Term : 60mos (50 left) 
Payment : $384.99
Interest : 13.49% 
Bank : Capital One
 

I am eligible for early payoff because I pay extra every month, and I am projected to pay it off in 46 months instead of he original remaining 50. Hopefully this helps me when I’m looking for someone to buy my loan.

* https://imgur.com/a/7MCM9wK here is my budget, i currently contribute 7.5% on my 401k as my employer matches up to that.
* my only debt is $30k in student loans, all interest rates are 3.5-4.7%. the price i have in my budget is the minimum payment however i am willing to contribute more monthly to get them paid off
*i have a good vehicle (2014 chevy, 35k miles) which is paid off
*i have $1.5k ""saved"" just sitting in my bank account

so right now i just dont know what to do with my funds. one of my biggest concerns is what to do about my loans. initally i planned on putting $1500 a month to just get rid of them. however, people were saying to pay the minimum and invest the money instead to get more money. but, invest in what..? also, i like to have extra money around so i can go on impulse vacations and trips, so i dont want 100% of my dollars budgeted.

personalfinance,Student Loans v.s. Investing,"Hello r/personalfinance   


This is not a burner account because quite frankly, it doesn't matter to me who knows my financial situation.  And anyone who legitimately needs it can see it on a credit report anyway (right? I think so anyway).  Regardless, I have a little situation I want some pointers/advice on.  

My current student loans balances and interests are as follows:  


1. $26,946 (7.09%)
2. $16,425 (6.49%)
3. $18,303 (5.23%)
4. $14,418 (5.23%)
5. $4,500 (4.66%)
6. $2,320 (4.66%)
7. $4,000 (4.45%)
8. $5,995 (4.35%)
9. $5,500 (4.29%)
10. $2,209 (4.29%)
11. $3,510 (3.86%)
12. $2,351 (3.86%)
13. $5,500 (3.76%)
14. $2,107 (3.76%)

Now, the private ones are 1, 2, 3,4, 8 and 8 is on a 5 year payment schedule.  The rest are Federal.  My original plan was to put the 6% of my income into my 401K and have my employer match it.  Then dump the rest into student loans in the order you see paying off highest interests first.  I have about $2000 a month I can utilize, about $900 of that is base payments.  Currently, I'd have 1 paid off by December, 2020.  2 by December, 2021. 3 by September 2022.  4 by March of 2023.  The rest all then fall out by the end of January, 2024.  

Based on what I've seen here, it doesn't sound like I should pump money into 3 through 14.  Or at the other end, at least 5-14.  What do you guys think?  Again, this is with $2,000 monthly, $900 of which is for minimal payments, while matching my employer 6% on the 401k.  

Other things worth mentioning, I graduated in June.  I make about $90,000/yr after bonuses.  I do not own a home and have no car payment (for now).  Also my loan payments aren't due at all until January, if that matters.  Until then I was going to use all the $2,000 a month on the first loan which will throw off my previous projections.",finance

personalfinance,"Recovering from debt slowly, might have just been hit with a scam? What can I do to protect myself?","Good afternoon everyone! I hope this is the right place to post this. If it's the wrong spot, I'd appreciate any pointing in the right direction!

So after years of seemingly insurmountable debt, I'm finally digging out of it. I'm so excited! Just about $10k left and I am DONE! But, there may be a hiccup.

A couple months ago I was hit with a scam, one of those ""call and threaten to take you to court"" ones- which I thought was for a legitimate debt, but is not of course. Made a single payment, wizened up, called the bank and had them stop my old card and issue a new one. All seems to be good.

Today, I was taking a quick nap on my lunch break and got a phone call from a local number I didn't recognize. We've had some events in the household that makes me think I could be getting a call I don't recognize the number for, so I answer.

I should have just hung up. It was some robo voice talking about my auto warranty expiring (I don't own a vehicle). It was followed up with an option to press 2 to be placed on a do not call list, then rung to a person. She started in with ""Hello this call is regarding your auto warranty, I'm going to read you a few things..."" At which point my half-awake self stopped her and said ""Yes ma'am, I'm sorry, but-"" BAM. She hung up.

Tried calling the number back, and of course it was spoofed to my area code. I've read a few things that said that pressing the number or speaking to anyone is enough for them to know it's a legit phone number, but the part I'm terrified of is that my boyfriend reminded me that all they needed was my verbal ""yes"" to use my other info (that they already have) to sign me up for services. I didn't give so much as my name on the call, but it's possible they do actually have my info already.

I've been much better lately with my debt and money in general, and mentally in a better place for it, but right now I'm panicking a bit. Without anything showing on my bank account or credit report, I don't have anything yet to go on, but is there anything I can do to guard against things before they happen? Was this one slip-up enough to potentially doom my poor credit score that's clawed back up to a meager 545, back down to 400? :(",finance

stocks,US spending &amp; national debt aren’t issues if you’re in investing long term,"The US Dollar is the primary global reserve currency and represents over 60%(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#United_States_dollar) of all reserve currencies held by other countries. The dollar is considered the safest currency in the world because it’s guaranteed by the United States. The Dollar is widely accepted for purchases globally. Countries around the world, like China have accumulated massive reserves of dollars because this allows them to create their own currency for spending purposes and its accepted by other countries because they know if China can’t pay its bills it can always borrow money, because dollars are a hard asset accepted everywhere even if its own currency is not. The US Dollar is called a fiat currency for this reason (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp).

Because it’s currency is in such high demand means that the United States gets to play by a unique set of rules when it comes to borrowing. The majority of the national debt is owed to either the Fed or the American public (mostly represented by their pension or investment assets). In this regard the national debt is a positive thing because it creates a safe asset for investors and pension plans to save in to help manage their investment risk while receiving a modest return. The US has only run a budget surplus a handful of years since WW2. The ability of the Fed to control interest rates means if debt servicing ever becomes a serious issue they can raise inflation thus decreasing the value of each Dollar (within reason given the economic situation at the time). Essentially the US can inflate away the value of the national debt over the long term as compared to GDP even if the actual dollar amount of debt never decreases. Each dollar is worth much less now then when they borrowed it years before. 1, 5 or 10 year bond means the government agreed to borrow that money from you for that period for an interest rate set by the market, interest is typically paid when the bond matures.

A far better way to examine the debt is using something called Debt to GDP ratio. It uses a percentage to compare the total national debt to 1 year of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The media will cite the current US debt to GDP ratio as alarming because it is over 100% of GDP, the highest since WW2. But debt to GDP ratio doesn’t tell the whole story, we have to look at debt servicing costs as well. You may be able to afford a $250,000 mortgage if the interest rate is 3%, but if it’s 20% all of a sudden a $100,000 house can become out of your price range because the monthly payment (debt servicing cost) would be so high. It’s true that the national debt has almost doubled as a percentage of GDP over the past couple decades. However because we’ve been in a prolonged low interest rate environment even though the US is borrowing record amounts of money, it’s paying less of a debt servicing cost today for twice the debt it had a decade or so ago. As long as rates remain low they can continue to borrow within reason. Should the debt get to high and the market get scared it will raise US borrowing costs and force the government to cut spending and the cycle repeats, this has happened many times in the past.

Americans represent around 4% of the global population but own almost 40% of global wealth. The United States has a national net worth (assets - debts/liabilities) of $93.5 Trillion (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_wealth).
How that wealth is distributed is a totally different debate (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient).

In part this wealth comes from the US economic system which creates trillions of dollars per year in tangible wealth but also from its geographic location. This article expands on that further (http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/04/16/how-geography-explains-the-united-states/). The current global order is governed by an imperfect system of rules and laws that are enforced by independent bodies that each nation state is a member of (UN, IMF, World Bank, WTO etc…) , but for the most part functions very well. It allows for freedom of navigation for any nation to freely trade with another without interference from another nation (over 90% of global trade is shipping). This has meant global trade has prospered and no country are benefited from this more then the US. The global system is underpinned by the enormous US military, especially the Navy who conducts regular freedom of navigation operations around the world to enforce free shipping (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_navigation#United_States_""Freedom_of_Navigation""_program).

The US is often criticized for high military spending but this could arguably be justified because the status quo benefits America more then any other nation. But they’re also picking up the tab.

personalfinance,Making $50k/year. No debt. What do I do with the money?,"Throwaway for reasons.  


I live in the US under international student status and recently started a job which pays $50k/yr. I've got a social and started building my credit. Fixed payments like rent, food, internet, etc. take up about half my monthly salary. Company doesn't offer 401k. I want to stay stateside but I still have at least a year before I can shoot for permanent residency.  


As far as I checked, interest rates in saving accounts are not that encouraging, so my money is basically just sitting there. I know absolutely nothing about investing in the US, because frankly I'm not sure if it'd be worth the time or risk. How can I use my money so it can better serve me in the future?

investing,US national debt &amp; spending levels aren’t issues if you’re investing for the long term,"The US Dollar is the primary global reserve currency and represents over 60%(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_currency#United_States_dollar) of all reserve currencies held by other countries. The dollar is considered the safest currency in the world because it’s guaranteed by the United States. The Dollar is widely accepted for purchases globally. Countries around the world, like China have accumulated massive reserves of dollars because this allows them to create their own currency for spending purposes and its accepted by other countries because they know if China can’t pay its bills it can always borrow money, because dollars are a hard asset accepted everywhere even if its own currency is not. The US Dollar is called a fiat currency for this reason (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiatmoney.asp).

Because it’s currency is in such high demand means that the United States gets to play by a unique set of rules when it comes to borrowing. The majority of the national debt is owed to either the Fed or the American public (mostly represented by their pension or investment assets). In this regard the national debt is a positive thing because it creates a safe asset for investors and pension plans to save in to help manage their investment risk while receiving a modest return. The US has only run a budget surplus a handful of years since WW2. The ability of the Fed to control interest rates means if debt servicing ever becomes a serious issue they can raise inflation thus decreasing the value of each Dollar (within reason given the economic situation at the time). Essentially the US can inflate away the value of the national debt over the long term as compared to GDP even if the actual dollar amount of debt never decreases. Each dollar is worth much less now then when they borrowed it years before. 1, 5 or 10 year bond means the government agreed to borrow that money from you for that period for an interest rate set by the market, interest is typically paid when the bond matures.

A far better way to examine the debt is using something called Debt to GDP ratio. It uses a percentage to compare the total national debt to 1 year of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The media will cite the current US debt to GDP ratio as alarming because it is over 100% of GDP, the highest since WW2. But debt to GDP ratio doesn’t tell the whole story, we have to look at debt servicing costs as well. You may be able to afford a $250,000 mortgage if the interest rate is 3%, but if it’s 20% all of a sudden a $100,000 house can become out of your price range because the monthly payment (debt servicing cost) would be so high. It’s true that the national debt has almost doubled as a percentage of GDP over the past couple decades. However because we’ve been in a prolonged low interest rate environment even though the US is borrowing record amounts of money, it’s paying less of a debt servicing cost today for twice the debt it had a decade or so ago. As long as rates remain low they can continue to borrow what appears on the surface like unsustainable amounts. Should the debt get to high and the market get scared it will raise US borrowing costs and force the government to cut spending and the cycle repeats, this has happened many times in the past.

Americans represent around 4% of the global population but own almost 40% of global wealth. The United States has a national net worth (assets - debts/liabilities) of $93.5 Trillion (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_wealth).
How that wealth is distributed is a totally different debate (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient).

In part this wealth comes from the US economic system which creates trillions of dollars per year in tangible wealth but also from its geographic location. This article expands on that further (http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/04/16/how-geography-explains-the-united-states/). The current global order is governed by an imperfect system of rules and laws that are enforced by independent bodies that each nation state is a member of (UN, IMF, World Bank, WTO etc…) , but for the most part functions very well. It allows for freedom of navigation for any nation to freely trade with another without interference from another nation (over 90% of global trade is shipping). This has meant global trade has prospered and no country has benefited from this more then the US. The global system is underpinned by the enormous US military, especially the Navy who conducts regular freedom of navigation operations around the world to enforce free shipping (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_navigation#United_States_""Freedom_of_Navigation""_program).

The US is often criticized for high military spending but this could arguably be justified because the status quo benefits America more then any other nation. But they’re also picking up the tab. Countries like China and Russia are actively working to undermine the current international order. Corruption thrives in those nations and in a rules based system it’s much harder to escape justice, people like Vladimir Putin don’t like this because they like to play by their own rules.",finance
personalfinance,"Help to find funding for last semester of school. Federal Loans, grants, scholarships have fallen through. Minimal to no family support.","Hey guys, I’m in a bit of a tight spot at the moment and need help figuring a way out of it. I’m a college student in South Carolina who is attending his final semester of college in August and am set to graduate in December. I’m not great at putting my thoughts into words but I’ll do the best I can and hopefully you guys will understand.

Up until today I’ve had enough money to support myself financially through the end of the year, provided that I receive the same amount of money through federal loans and grants as I have every year. I’ve taken multiple semesters off of school to go work a well paying internship to pay for my living expenses each year. I don’t have any financial support from my parents, as every conversation always ends with how I should’ve worked harder or done exactly as they say as they say it, or this, or that (it’s a rather controlling and emotionally abusive situation which is neither here nor there, but I thought it might be important to include). The bottom line is every penny I’ve spent as far as tuition or living expenses are concerned has either been earned by me or provided through grants, scholarships, and federal loans.

Here’s where the problem is. Like I said, up until today my budget was planned out and I would have enough money to make it through the end of the year, at which point I would find a full time job and begin earning money as an adult does. This was all assuming I receive the same amount of financial aid as I always do. Unfortunately, according to FAFSA I’ve reached the maximum borrowable limit for direct loans. To make matters worse, my income from the 2017 internship has made me ineligible for the need-based grant funding, Pell Grant, and Federal Work Study Program (according to my financial aid supervisor at college).

After asking my financial aid supervisor if there were any other grants that I’m applicable or other methods of getting the money for tuition, she informed me that my two options are a Federal Parent Plus Loan or a private loan. I’ve applied for a private loan and naturally I was denied without a cosigner. I asked my parents to cosign and I’m still dealing with the fallout. The gist is that since I haven’t done everything they’ve said to do financially for the last 5 years (mind you I’ve managed my own finances to get where I am today) that I don’t deserve a cosign and they refuse to do it. That being said, that means the Federal Parent Plus Loan is also out.

So there’s all the background information. Here’s the numbers I have to deal with right now. Note that I typically try to over budget as much as reasonably possible so I don’t put myself in a worse situation than I started in. I’ve also tried to give myself a 3 month buffer for living expenses in the worst case scenario that I don’t have a job lined up at the end of the year.

**Savings/Checking/Credit:**

Saving Account: $496.69

Checking Account: $8,648.03

Credit: $1,500 credit limit, currently 100% paid off.

**Automotive Information:**

Car: 2012 Honda Civic

Auto Loan: $7,163.90

Auto Insurance: $94.12 / month

**Monthly Expenses**:

Misc. Spending: $150

Groceries:  $150

Gas:    $80

Rent:   $415

Car Payment:  $277.10

Electricity:  $50

Water:   $30

Car Insurance:  $94.12  (as stated above)

Dental Insurance: $21

Miscellaneous: $300

**One Time Expenses:**

Tuition:   $8,075

Textbooks:  $500

**Requested Loan Amount:**

$13,000

**Justification:**

I’ve included a monthly $300 Misc. value in my budget from August through December because I want to over budget this as much as reasonably possible given that I don’t have any parental support if things don’t work out. It will also give me a 3 month buffer window in the worst case scenario that I don’t have a job lined up at the end of December. If i’ve included all of the values correctly, this would put me somewhere around $1,760 left over at the end of March. To further justify the $300/month value, I have two dentists appointments coming up at about $250 each, a small low-maintenance dog with a $200 appointment coming up, and two weddings I need a suit for in the fall as one of the groomsmen for both. The remaining money would be a further buffer/emergency fund.

**Other Information:**

My lease is a one-year lease. Without getting into it, it was the best option for me given my living conditions/relationships and financial ability. Other options for 6-month leases would’ve been more expensive short term.

If I seem to have left anything out or you guys need additional information, just let me know. I’ve been throwing numbers around in my budget while I write this so if any of the values don’t check out for the information I’ve given then I’ll do my best to correct it. Hopefully I put it all into an understandable format. What I’m looking for is other potential means by which I can pay for my tuition this fall, how I can better my budget, maybe any advice on reducing my auto loan if that’s a thing (my knowledge of financial management extends as far as numbers, not so much on terminology, loopholes, way to reduce auto-loans/payments, etc).

Thanks again for any help that can be given.

personalfinance,"26, with a low income and bad debt. Hoping to turn it around.","I am a 26 y/o male who has dug myself into a big of a hole financially, so throwaway time.

Some basics in terms of outstanding debt:

748 credit score, never missed a payment on anything.

$8,013.26 left on car loan with 3.74% interest-$270/mo

$175.62 on one card (will pay it all off this month) 17.74% interest

$6,686.41 on diff card 23.74% interest, making the $50 minimum and whatever else I can afford (very little) to pay off ASAP.

$200 in penny stocks just hoping it blows up to use it to pay off debt, I feel okay just letting it sit there.

Not a penny to my name in savings.

My income is bleak working in the service industry right now and being mid summer people are out of town so it's slow making it worse.

I'm trying to find a career or at the very least a second job to improve my income and have less free time to spend money and live above my means, but alas it hasn't occurred yet. A real career or job would help cut some costs of life too, such as a super high health insurance premium.

I've made a spreadsheet showing my monthly dues and I'm coming short about $500 each month. So at the least I know I've got to cut my spending significantly, mainly with non-important things such as TV subscriptions, dining out and buying booze more often than I should. A large part of my financial ruin is my pot habit that is costing me $300-$400 a month, which needs to be handled first and foremost. I'm taking the steps now to cut this cost out completely because its wrecking me.

So, knowing that I need to cut my spending significantly my question is this:

Should I apply for a new CC with a low-trasnfer rate and a long 0% APR time frame (and if so, which would be the best?) and move my high interest debt over so to not be screwed by interest. I think this is something that could really help me manage my debt and not have it continuing to grow.

Regarding my vehicle, I have a decent amount of equity in it and it has held its value very well. Do I refinance a lower payment/interest rate so I have another way to free up some money month to month and use it to pay off CC debt?

I know that I've put myself in this situation and I want to work to rectify things. Harsh comments of reality are okay and welcome, I just need to get things together.

personalfinance,"Is a UTMA the right type of account for a ""digital piggy bank"" for my kids?","I've got two kids, (age 2 and 0), who've been given some money by relatives (on the order of a couple hundred dollars each). I want them to personally have the money to seed their savings accounts as they get older, but currently it's just all deposited and commingled in my normal bank accounts, and their 'balance' is tracked on a post-it note. 

I'd like to formally separate it out such that I don't have to personally remember to track their balance, and I had considered opening a pair of UTMA accounts with Ally for them. 

However I'm a little bit wary when I see some of the legal terms and IRS requirements of these accounts, saying that the deposit is not revocable and all withdrawals have to pass some kind of IRS test that the money was used for the primary benefit of the child. 

Now I consider myself 'honest' and I have no designs on ever stealing this money back for myself, but at the same time I don't want a lot of 'friction' every time my kid wants a dollar out of the account. If at age 5 he wants to buy a $20 toy, and I give him a $20 out of my wallet and balance this by transferring $20 from the UTMA to my bank account... am I going to run into trouble? Are we going to get audited and sniffed by the IRS anytime the kid wants to pull a couple bucks out of the account? How do you 'prove' that these transactions are kosher for the account when dealing with little kids?

Or is the UTMA meant more like a lockbox that gets passed on at age 18, and difficult to access before then? That's not really what I want since I'd like this account to be their personal savings account as minors.",finance

personalfinance,New levels of theft?,"Longer story somewhat shorter: I was at work all day. My bank (USAA) called me from their official number twice but I was busy so I didn't answer.  A couple hours later they called again back to back so I answered. The USAA rep (male) told me my debit card had fraudulent activities today. He *read me my full address* to me, to confirm it was correct. He said USAA froze my account after the second failed possible-fraudulent withdrawal. My bank cancelled my card while I was on the phone and was sending me a new card in the mail. I'm covered for all losses  due to my bank's policy. Before hanging up, the USAA rep asked me if I got my notifications on my app today when the activities posted. I said no, I've been at work. He asked me to log onto the app while he was on the phone. He said to verify two notifications so USAA knows my app is working. I verified the first notification even though it was a bit odd, it was asking me to verify I approved a potential fraudulent charge. The second notification the USAA rep instructed me to approve was a withdrawal limit increase on my checking account.


At that point I knew there was no way my bank would ask me to approve a special notification like that just so ""USAA could verify my phone app was working"" because ""a lot of customers have had issues lately with the app so we need to be sure"".....  I told the USAA rep I respect he's doing his job but I have to hang up, I said I'll call him right back on the USAA number he called from (the same number posted on the USAA website). I got his extension after some reluctantcy on his side. He said ""I can just transfer you to my manager, he can verify whatever you need"" but that wouldn't prove anything (obviously) so I was immediately even more suspicious.



I hung up and called USAA right back. The rep that helped me had no record I spoke to anybody at USAA. And there was no extension 804. There are other details I figured out that confirm the first rep wasn't actually a USAA rep but that's a lot more to type. WTAF?


My accounts are frozen for several days while an investigation is underway on me and my accounts by USAA.

There were actually 12 attempted transactions on my account today, not 2. One was in a city &lt;2hrs from me, I'm assuming to test if the fake card worked with my info. Then at least 2 transactions were made in California today shortly after. Typical card skimmer BS. But what's crazy to me is somebody somehow spoofed my bank's actual phone number and called me, with a 15min phone call end-game of luring me into this grand fake phone call supposedly saving me from fraudulent charges, just to get me to log onto my app to actually APPROVE the fake charges and approve a withdrawal limit raise so they could drain the rest of my checking account.


I don't use that debit card on gas pumps, EVER. I have a gas card I use for my work car. I don't own a personal car. I have Amazon Prime linked to Paypal. I don't use my card to buy stuff online.

(Monthly payments for student debt = $470; car is $158)

And of course, after being denied my credit score has taken a hit. If it helps, my interest rate on one card is 24.44% ($2600 on that one) and 17% ($4900). My payments don't seem to make a dent. 

I'm about a year off from my bachelor's in Psychology and my plan has been to continue on to grad school for Neuroscience. I really, really love school and I have always known I wanted to pursue a higher education. I have no idea who I am if I lose that. I've been trying really hard to postpone the inevitable and try to graduate and get a decent job so I can throw money at my debts. Unfortunately, I've come to the conclusion I just need to drop out of school and focus on working full time and starting some other career. It feels like there has been just one obstacle after another when it comes to getting my Bachelor's so I'm starting to feel like the responsible thing to do is to just give it up. I know if I quit school I will probably lose momentum and not want to start back up again in my late 20s.  I feel like this is my only viable option at this point but my boyfriend has been badgering me to post in here and see if there's any options I don't know about, so here I am.",finance
economy,How is a Line of Credit Loan Created?,"So I have some Credit Card debt to pay off. Thinking about the best way to pay it off which seems to be getting a line of credit from my bank. I've also seen suggestions of transferring the credit card balance between low introductory interest rate credit cards. Please leave a reply with a better suggestion if you have one.

However my bigger question is to how a line of credit loan is created. I've watched a lot of videos about how banks create money out of thin air when it comes to loans. Is this true? If I get approved for a line of credit which I'll have to work for to pay off. Does the bank simply make a record in their accounting books that so much money has now been created for Mr. Joe which he will now have to work for to pay off while we the bank collect interest on that loan created out of nothing.

Does  the bank simply create this money out of thin air with an entry into their computer database or on some physical piece of paper? Please red pill me on this process and how it is fair if true?

Thanks in advance to any replies.",finance

personalfinance,Would snowballing work on IBR loan payments?,"I have about 8 different loans, all serviced by Navient, ranging from about $5k-$49k, interest rates appear similar, for the most part. I'm currently on an IBR payment plan because the normal payments would be 100% un feasible for me right now. 

I've heard advice about instructing the, to allocate more to one loan, and knocking a few out this way. Would this be allowed on IBR, or would the other loans that aren't being paid toward incur fees? I'm likely looking at being on IBR for the foreseeable future, but if this could improve anything I'd like to know.

smartphone,Apple Support Nightmare,"Background info:  I am in the USAF and was stationed in Japan for nearly 5 years.  While overseas, I bought an iPhone 7 that happened to be one of the iPhone 7 models that was afflicted with an issue where the phone would search for a cell signal and never find it.  It took over two years for the problem to manifest (4 days before I moved back to the States), but Apple replaced it quickly with a different model iPhone 7.  Three months later my new iPhone 7 began showing that same symptoms.

This is my Apple story:

Day 0 – Friday, 13 July 2018.  I noticed my phone searching for service randomly through the day.  I restarted my phone and all seemed okay.

Day 1 – Saturday, 14 July 2018.  My phone had the same “searching” issue as on Friday, but this time it happened more frequently.  I restarted my phone and repeatedly turned airplane mode on and off.  The phone seemed to work after each reset, and all was mostly good.

Day 2 – Sunday, 15 July 2018.  Today my phone decided that the resets were no longer good enough and refused to find a cell signal no matter how hard I tried.  I called Apple support, and the technician had me run trough the usual troubleshooting steps (restart, toggle airplane mode, all the way through restore/update).  This is where it got really fun – my phone failed to restore and ow it is a $700 paperweight.  

I called Apple support back and was able to speak with Markus, a senior advisor for Apple’s customer service.  He understood the situation and was very apologetic.  He told me that I could either have a replacement shipped to me or I could go to an Apple store and have it replaced.  Being that the nearest Apple store is 1 ½ hours away, I elected to have one mailed to me.  That night he tried to mail me an express replacement free of charge but was unable to due to system updates, so we set up a time for him to call Monday to get this all straightened out.  All seemed good up to this point.

Day 3 – Monday, 16 July 2018.  Markus never called…

Day 4 – Tuesday, 17 July 2018.  Having seen that I had an appointment with Markus, Apple customer service called me to tell me Markus hadn’t been in since Sunday.  “That’s understandable,” I thought.  I eventually got to speak with Katy, another senior advisor, who went through my options with me again.  She informed me that some of the information Markus told me was incorrect. “Oh boy, here we go,” I thought.  She told me that I would be charged a $29 fee for the express replacement.  I told Katy that I would think it over and call her back.

Day 5 – Wednesday, 18 July 2018.  I thought about the $29 fee and decided I would call them the next and just pay the fee.

Day 6 – Thursday, 19 July 2018.  I called Apple support and told them I would just pay the fee that Katy mentioned was unavoidable.  Caroline, the new senior advisor du jour, set up the express replacement and took my credit card information.  She said she would look into having the fee refunded.  All seemed good again, until an hour later when I received an email that the replacement had been cancelled.  Already past Apple’s customer service business hours, I decided it would have to wait until the next day.

Day 7 – Friday, 20 July 2018.  Today, Apple support’s senior advisor, Mike, was far less than helpful.  After I told him my story, he somewhat scoffed into the phone and said that he wasn’t surprised it failed because it was a Japanese model (I was stationed in Japan for almost 5 years with the USAF and just recently moved back to the States).  I then asked him if an exception could be made to which he quickly replied with a no.  I asked to speak with his supervisor (I had already elevated my case from a typical customer support representative to the handful of senior advisors that I had been speaking to).  He quickly dismissed my request and said he would not be elevating my case further.  He, like many of the other senior advisors, told me I would have to go in person to the nearest Apple store to have my phone replaced.

Not wanting to accept defeat, or drive 3 hours to have my phone replaced, I decided to call Apple support late that evening in hopes of reaching someone more accommodating.  Bryan, another senior advisor at Apple, seemed more than willing to help.  He tried to set up another express replacement but due to difficulties would have to call me back the next day.  So, I go to bed disappointed once again but hopeful that tomorrow would bring resolution.

Day 8 – Saturday, 21 July 2018.  Bryan never called.

Roughly 45 minutes after our scheduled appointment time, I get a call from an Apple customer service rep letting me know that Bryan did not come in to work today (I swear I have heard this before…).  The Apple rep says she will gladly get me in touch with a senior advisor to continue to work on resolving this issue.  She puts me on hold to get the senior advisor.  I wait, and I wait, and I wait.  Nearly 10 minutes later Krishandra (sp?) picks up.  We go through the normal spiel about the issue and the different options.  I tell her I would like to speak with her supervisor.  She willingly connects me with Mellissa from customer relations after another 15 minutes on hold.  I again explain the situation and my disappointment with Apple’s inability to make exceptions to the rule about express replacements for phones purchased outside of the States.  She says that she also cannot make an exception to the policy but that she does not have a supervisor that I can speak with.  I asked for the corporate headquarters’ phone number.  She directed me to the Apple website to find it.

Day 9 – Sunday, 22 July 2018.  I called the corporate phone number from Apple’s website, but it is the weekend, and they are obviously closed on weekends.

Day 10 – Monday, 23 July 2018.  I called the corporate number again.  This time, I was met with a fairly cheerful operator.  I briefly explained the situation and asked to speak with somebody who could make decisions.  She told me that the highest level she could transfer me to was back down to the senior advisors and that they could elevate me to corporate customer relations.  “Ah ha!” I thought, “A new piece of information.”  After a short time on hold, I was put in touch with Valerie, another senior advisor to add to my list of new best friends.  She eventually transferred me to Eric from customer relations.  I told Eric my whole story – about the first phone, having this phone for only 3 months, the 10-day adventure I have been on thus far to have my phone replaced, my disappointment, EVERYTHING.  After roughly 30 minutes on the phone (nearly half of it on hold), Eric tells me that it is impossible to do the express mail replacement and that I would need to go in to an Apple store to have it replaced, there was no other way given the restrictions placed on them from the computer system.  He told me that I could walk into an Apple store with my Japanese phone and walk out with an equivalent American iPhone 7.  

At this point, I accepted defeat.  My wife had to make a trip to Oklahoma City (2 ½ hours away) for an errand anyway, so I decided I would just go in and have it replaced later that week.

Day 11 – Tuesday, 24 July 2018.  With defeat accepted, my wife and I plan on making the trip to OKC either Wednesday or Thursday depending on work obligations.

Day 12 – Wednesday, 25 July 2018.  I made the 2 ½ hour trip to OKC to have my phone replaced.  Eric told me I could go to either a Best Buy or dedicated Apple store to have it replaced.  The Apple store didn’t have any appointments available, so I decided to go to Best Buy, thinking it would be a rather painless swap.  The workers at the Geek Squad counter immediately told me that they couldn’t help me because they were not a fully-qualified Apple repair facility.  “That’s okay,” I thought, “There is an Apple store a mile down the road.”  

I arrived at the Apple store and check-in to be seen by a technician.  She is nice, and I explain my situation.  She reassured me that the problem can be resolved.  She then began to explain to me how she can give me a loaner phone, ship off my phone to be fixed, and I can come back to pick up my phone once it has been repaired.  I immediately explained to her how Apple customer service said I 

could simply have it replaced.  She stared at me with a blank expression for a moment before realizing I was serious.  She excused herself to go speak with her “Leader” about getting me a replacement phone.  Nearly 30 minutes later she comes back out and says that they cannot replace my phone because it is a Japanese model.  I told her that customer support told me I had to go to the store BECAUSE it was a Japanese model.  She disappeared for another 20 minutes in the back, occasionally coming out and immediately turning around before she got to us.  When she finally came back to the table, I asked to speak with her supervisor.  She called over Allison, the store manager, so that we could get to the bottom of all of this.

Allison explained to me that even if she did give me a phone, they would not be able to complete a transaction for it because of my Japanese phone, therefore I would be unable to actually use the new device.  I asked her if I could buy the phone and be credited the amount, or if she could simply discount the phone to $0.00, or if she could call somebody to have an exception made.  To all of which, she simply said no and that she didn’t have the authority or ability to make such a decision.  I will admit that in my frustration I shouted that this was unacceptable, to which she seemed startled.  We continued talking for a bit about different options that we could pursue.  Ultimately, she said she would try to order another Japanese iPhone 7 so we could do a direct swap.  She said she would call me when she had an answer if that became an option.

I decided I would give it one more shot and call Apple support.  I went through my directory of senior advisor phone numbers and extensions and began calling.  Each and every one went to voicemail.  I was just about to call the normal support phone number to try my hand at an eighth senior advisor when my wife’s phone began to ring.  Lo and behold, Eric from customer relations was on the other side of the phone returning the call I had just made to his direct line.  

I told Eric that I made the trip, as he told me I would have to, to OKC to have my phone replaced and that the Apple store said they were unable to replace it because it was a Japanese model.  He seemed utterly confused by the bombshell just dropped on his end of the phone.  He quickly recovered and said that he hadn’t left the issue alone when we hung up on Monday.  He told me that he would be sending me a new phone, free of charge, in the mail and that I could return my phone in the paid-for box when the replacement arrives.  He put me on hold while he filled out the paperwork and then took my credit card information for the mandatory hold for the replacement phone until they receive my phone.  Finally, some good news, end of story, fin…or is it?  Before hanging up, I asked Eric when I could expect the phone to arrive.  “Well, it should be approved in a few days, then it will be shipped out, he replied.  “What do you mean approved?” I asked.  He then proceeded to tell me that he hasn’t officially received the approval to do the replacement.  Our next scheduled follow-up is on Monday.

In all I have come to notice something about Apple.  They have planned for most every situation from a customer service standpoint and have a course of action that their managers and customer service reps are allowed to take.  However, there is no flexibility in their model for situations they haven’t planned for.  It appears that Apple does not have faith in its lower leadership positions (store managers and senior advisors) to use sound judgement to make decisions for day-to-day operations.  Apple is killing innovation in its leadership core by squashing their ability to truly lead and make decisions.",technology
oil,Saudi oil shipment halt: A potential watershed in the Yemen war,"By James M. Dorsey



A spike in oil prices as a result of a temporary halt in shipments through the strategic Bab el Mandeb strait may be short-lived, but the impact on Yemen’s three-year-old forgotten war is likely to put the devastating conflict on the front burner.



The halt following a Saudi assertion that Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen had attacked two Saudi oil tankers traversing the waterway drives home the threat the conflict poses to a chokepoint in international trade and the flow of Gulf oil to world markets. The Houthis said they had attacked a Saudi warship rather than oil tankers.



An estimated 4.8 million barrels of oil are shipped daily through Bab al Mandeb that connects the Red Sea with the Arabian Sea off the coast of Yemen, Djibouti, and Eritrea.



The halt of oil shipments could provoke an escalation of the conflict with external powers intervening in a bid to assist Saudi Arabia and the UAE in defeating the Houthis and dealing a blow to Iran’s regional presence.



By the same token, the halt potentially offers Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates an opportunity to focus international attention on resolving a civil war aggravated and turned into a regional conflict by the two Gulf states’ military intervention in March 2015.



Rather than proving to be a swift campaign that would have subdued the Houthis, the intervention has turned into a quagmire and a public relations fiasco for Saudi Arabia and the UAE.



International criticism of their conduct of the war is mounting as a result of its devastating human cost. Voices in the US Congress, the British parliament and other Western legislatures as well as human rights groups calling for a halt of arms sales to Saudi Arabia are growing ever louder.



The armed services panels in the US House and Senate released earlier this week joint defense legislation that demands that the Pentagon tell Congress whether US or Arab coalition forces violated federal law or Pentagon policy. Another provision restricts mid-air US refuelling of coalition aircraft if the UAE and Saudi Arabia fail to demonstrate efforts to support United Nations-backed peace talks, resolve the growing humanitarian crisis, and cut down on civilian deaths.



The war has killed at least 10,000 Yemenis and left more than 22 million people –three-quarters of Yemen’s population – in need of humanitarian aid. At least 8 million Yemenis are on the brink of famine, and 1 million are infected with cholera.



In a most immediate response to the halt, the United States and Britain, eager to benefit from increased arms sales, are likely to step up their support of the Saudi-UAE effort in the Yemen war.



Viewed from Washington as well as Riyadh, the war is one more front in US efforts to force Iran to halt its support of Middle Eastern proxies.



Since the war began, the US and the UK have sold more than $12bn worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia alone - including some of the warplanes and the payloads they drop.



The US military, moreover, provides mid-air refuelling for Saudi and UAE aircraft, and both British and US personnel assist the Saudis as they target their strikes.



The US, Britain and other powers could look at expanding operations of an anti-piracy alliance in the region created in 2008 in response to Somali piracy. The alliance includes warships patrolling regional waters from all five United Nations Security Council permanent members – the United States, China, Russia, Britain and France – as well as other European and Latin American nations, Australia, Japan, Pakistan, Singapore, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Thailand.



The potential for a breakthrough in peace efforts increases when the halt to oil shipments is coupled with a Saudi-UAE threat to besiege the strategic port of Hodeida that could jeopardize the crucial for the flow of humanitarian supplies potentially creates an opportunity for more forceful efforts to bring the Yemen war to an end.



In a letter to US congressional leaders, UAE ambassador to the United States Yousef al-Otaiba said in June that the Saudi-led Arab force fighting in Yemen is giving the Iran-backed Houthi rebels “the greatest possible opportunity” for a peaceful withdrawal from Hodeida.



UN envoy Martin Griffiths last week put forward a proposal that would avert a fight for Hodeida that has yet to be accepted by all parties. 



The plan reportedly calls for a phased Houthi withdrawal from Hodeida and two other nearby ports, a gradual pullback of UAE forces, UN assistance in staffing the port with Yemenis who would also govern the city of 60,000, and the revival of stalled peace talks.



The possibility of the halt to oil shipments propelling efforts to end the war is enhanced by the fact that the Saudi move has ramifications that go beyond energy security.



The Middle East’s multiple conflicts, including the Saudi-Iranian rivalry and the dispute between Qatar and a Saudi-UAE-led alliance that has imposed a 14-month old diplomatic and economic boycott of the Gulf state has spilled across the Horn of Africa with the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey and China competing for influence by gaining control of ports and establishing military bases.



The UAE’s strong military and commercial presence in the region is one reason why Chinese President Xi Jinping recent stopped in the Emirates for three days on his way to a tour of Africa.



China likely would favour capitalizing on the Saudi halt to propel peace efforts while the Trump administration more probably will lean towards military intervention that confronts Iran.



Said scholar and author Ellen R. Wald: “The Red Sea is a very important shipping lane. If there is a major disruption European powers, Egypt and the United States would all have reason to intervene. They have significant interests in protecting the freedom of the seas through the passageway. An international intervention against the Houthis may be just what Saudi Arabia wants.”

My student loans currently add to about $100,000 (around $20k is from undergrad) with an average interest rate at 6.3%, and I still have three more years at a U.S. medical school---tuition + fees sum to around $60,000/year. Cost of living is another $20,000/yr, if not much less.

In a few days, I might accept up to another $80,000. A little over half at 6.6%, a little less than half at 7.6%. 

I know typically the advice given is to pay off all your loans first, but I'm not sure if the significant amount of inheritance I've received changes this advice; or the fact that interest rates are rising on the loans I'll be taking out. 

I have two siblings who have received equal amounts, and the three of us are open to pooling our inheritance to make the most of our investment potential. 

I'm just at a total loss of where to turn for advice---wikis are helpful but I can't find enough information to make this decision alone; I also called my financial aid advisor who reassured me that any decision I make is a good decision so long as I don't blow off the cash. People on this subreddit generally seem to be wary of CFPs, so I'm not sure where else to turn if that's not an open door.

personalfinance,"Deep in debt, though I have a promising new job. Navigating my way out.","Hey everyone,

Long story short I’ve spent the last six months unemployed and quickly accruing debt. This has mostly been through multiple credit cards as well as a personal loan I took out to pay for school. Currently I’m about $22k in the hole.

The good news is I recently got a new job, and it pays decently (65k a year). I’m ready to start fixing this mess. The first order of business is paying off one card in particular, which had a 0% introductory rate that has since jumped to 25%. Most everything else is either reasonable (10%) or still in the 0% grace period.

My current plan is to take out a large loan, either through my credit union, or through one of those debt relief companies and using the money to pay off the thornier interest rates. I know that if I go through my credit union I’ll probably be looking at a rate of about 12%, though I’m curious if there’s any reason to avoid the debt relief companies. If not are there any in particular that are better? Advice sincerely appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Student loan debt or increasing 401k contribution?,"29 y/o M,  single, RN, no kids, minimal assets.

Here is my situation:

Income: 52k per year with the goal of moving back home to CA and at least doubling my income within 2-3 years (with further low single digit percentage annual increases thereafter). Current take home pay is about 1200/biweekly but will likely rise to 1400/biweekly next month due to fewer deductions.

401k: Currently contribute 17% (12% of mine with 5% company match) of gross salary but am starting a new job which won't vest me for 3 years. Will increase my contributions to 15% to make up for loss of company match. Current balance is 27k with ~14% annual return which I know is unlikely to continue.

Debt: 15.7k with variable 10.375% interest (yes, I know, very high) Sallie Mae student loan
Currently paying 510/month with plan to pay off in 36 months. Unable to refinance unfortunately.
~10k unsubsidized federal loans with 6.6% interest. On IBR and pay 96/month for this. Attempting to pursue PSLF when eligible several years down the road from now.
~1.2k CC debt with variable payments every month but have plans to pay off in 3-4 months.

Expenses (per month): 800 rent and utilities, 2-300 food/entertainment, CC (varies), 600 student loan payments, 100 insurance/gym membership, remainder goes to miscellaneous expenses/savings.

* Purchases of new homes are at their slowest pace in eight months.
* Inventory, which plunged for years, has begun to grow again
* Prices for existing homes climbed 6.4 percent in May, the smallest year-over-year gain since early 2017, and have gained the least over three months since 2012, according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency.

However, the core sentiment of the article is that the ""hot"" housing areas have become overpriced and are, as such, starting to cool, while areas that are not typically as ""hot"" (Alabama is cited in the article) are still showing price growth as people look for cheaper homes. 

Honestly, this looks more like a housing market shifting towards equilibrium vs. an actual ""cooling"" - and the end of the article even states that this trend may help to avoid a second bust a la 2008.",finance

Neither of my parents went to college, and they’ve been zero help when it comes to student loans or debt. I know I took out around $7k from FASFA and the rest I took out on a federal PLUS loan. I know nothing about this. I was never taught how to start paying off loans or what to really be doing. I’m just lost right now. 

I also no longer have health insurance since I was ensured by my university and I do not think I qualify for insurance at my part time job. I’ve only heard horrible things about “cheap” health insurance, mainly that it’s far from cheap. 

My parents are no help to me since they don’t know or understand what I’m going through. I’m just lost on what I should be doing right now financially. I can barely save up money right now due to the fact that it costs me about $20 in gas just to go to my current job in Maine. 

Help!

TLDR: I have a lot of student debt. I’m only a sophomore. I don’t know what to do about health insurance. I have no clue what I’m doing.",finance

personalfinance,American Express Online High Yield Savings Account,"Hi, PF.


I'm very new to online banking and it still gives me a bit of a nervous tick - however, due to obvious reasons, I'm reading to make the switch and move the majority if my liquid funds to AMEX.  They offer a competitive 1.75 rate which after doing the math, is several hundred dollars of interest a month, vs $15 bucks at Chase.


However, I do have a few questions:


In my online statement (just opened, no current funds) it states:


CURRENT INTEREST RATE: 	1.73491%
CURRENT APY: 	1.75%


What exactly is the difference of these numbers?  Is one the obvious current rate and the 1.75 the projected average for this year?


Second question:  When creating my account I had to sign a form for tax withholding and to confirm I had no back taxes (which I do not) - is this normal?  I assume this means that I owe the IRS no money and essentially give the IRS permission to take money from this account if I do end up owing taxes and not paying in the future?


Finally, after doing hours of research and reviews and knowing my funds are federally backed and secured and outside of obvious phishing and account security - is there any other possible risk or point of concern you wish you guys knew before creating an online savings account?


I graduated in Computer Science and I'm a 33 year adult, I still just can't shake the feeling of everything (in my sum) being online.  It's a funny feeling.

personalfinance,Drowning in debt and monthly bills. Is there a way to consolidate into a single payment?,"Hello all, 

Hoping you might be able to provide some advice for me. Below is my current financial (debt) situation:

Debt and interest rate: 
Mohela student loan 4.2%: about $22,000
Car loan 1.9%: About $6,000
Best egg loan 6.1%: $19,000
Chase credit card (approx. 17%?): $7000
AA Mastercar (approx. 17%?): $8,000

I terms of monthly payments, my student loan is $440, my car note is $330, my best egg loan is $602 and I just try to put as much down on  my cc's as I can.  On top of that, I currently pay about 1700 a month in rent, however, beginning in November I will only be paying 1100. 

My income is not bad: 4766.36 per month, but I have literally zero savings and cannot seem to start saving anything because all my money is going towards paying off all my debt.  

My main question is, what is the best way for me to deal with all this debt? Ideally, I want to take out a single loan to pay everything off  (student, cc and car loans) and then only have a single monthly payment to deal with and a single loan. This seems like it would be easier to tackle than having 5 separate debts that I'm hardly making a dent in. The only problem is that the interest on any loan I would take out for that much would far exceed what my current interest rates (minus the CC's) 

Would this be considered ""debt consolidation"" and is that a smart option? 

I'm really struggling as of late. Any advice would be much appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Should I negotiate salary for a federal government job?,"Hi everyone,

I have an offer for a dream job! I’m so excited. I want to decide today if i’m going to negotiate on pay or accept the offer as-is.


Reasons to ask for more pay:

1. The salary they are offering is about $7,000 less than the lowest listed on Glassdoor for this position.

2. I want to stay in this position for a long time, and I hope to make my career here. I don’t expect to be able to move jobs to get more pay, so I want to start out with a good salary.

3. I’ve heard people, especially women, should always counteroffer.


Reasons not to ask for more pay:

1. They’re literally offering more money than I ever expected to make.

2. I’m somewhat under qualified —  this is typically a PhD level position, but I just have a master’s.

3. My master’s degree is in a tangentially related field, so I don’t feel qualified for this position at all, and I don’t want to mess this up.

4. They’re paying off all my student loans(!) and are offering a decent signing bonus as well as relocation expenses.


It’s a federal government job. Should I agree to the terms (which are very good!) or make a counter offer? I got a tentative offer letter today, and all correspondence over the past few months has been by email. Later today, I’d like to email back with my decision.",finance

personalfinance,"US, 22. Salary Negotiation. Manger quit- I absorbed her duties with no pay increase.","Hi all, kind of in a weird situation.

As you can tell, I'm young. This is my first time trying to navigate a pay raise negotiation. I work in the HR field, and if you didn't know, it's hard as HELL to break into the HR industry if you've never done HR. There are a ton of available certifications to earn to make you more competitive, but you have to have working HR experience to make that happen..and nobody hires someone in HR without HR experience. It's a cycle that's hard to break into but I managed to do it somehow.

I was hired at my current company 6 months ago as an HR Coordinator, kind of an Assistant to the HR Manager. I had talent acquisition experience and I wanted to turn that into HR eventually. It was perfect for what I wanted. The company wanted someone that wanted to learn the ropes and help our with whatever was needed. It was a great fit. I wanted to be able to learn the ropes of HR at my own pace and have a mentor showing me the way. Again, it was a perfect setup and I felt incredibly lucky.

Now a little background about my manager. My manager was making 55k, and had 2 different HR certifications. (In order to be eligible to sit for these certifications, you have to have been working in the field for two years. Since I graduated last May, I am not yet eligible.) She was handling payroll and all day-to-day HR requests as well as tax reporting, legal compliance, etc. Sadly, about two months ago, her husband was promoted and she had to suddenly move away.

The initial plan was to hire and replace her ASAP, but after a few weeks our boss, the CFO, decided to pull the plug and not replace her immediately, and there is no date set for when they will want to hire someone else. So, that meant I was inheriting a large bulk of her responsibilities, as well as one other person in accounting who absorbed payroll and some other things.

I felt massively underqualified accepting her duties, but I made it work. I've had to improvise and learn as I go which can be intimidating when dealing with federal compliance laws, etc. So far, I've only made a few mistakes, but nothing major. I think I've done a pretty okay job considering what my situation was. I had to be resourceful, nobody else was around to help me. But I kept the ship afloat.

So now about me- my current base salary I was hired at is 31k plus a little bit of commission for people I hire. Nothing major, so probably a total comp of about 33k.

If you ask me, I think that the caliber of the work I am doing for the company is highway robbery for what I'm being paid. I am essentially doing the same work my manager was, but for significantly less. I do understand I have some factors working against me. In order to break into HR I knew I needed to take whatever job I could get having 0 background, so I knew what I was getting into. But I do think the circumstances have changed now. Another factor against me is I don't have any certifications yet, as I'm not yet eligible, and I'm young. I don't think the CFO knows my exact age, but I'm the youngest person in my company by at least 10 years and I think people know that- even though they don't know I'm 22.

My first performance review is coming up, as everyone gets one after their first six months. I want to negotiate higher, but I'm not sure how to go about it. Should I shoot for $45k? I think the industry average for the work I'm currently doing is around $50k, but we're a relatively small company (100 employees), and they generally try to stay a little under market rates for salaries.

I recognize that 31k to 45k is a pretty significant jump, but I think I deserve it. The company wouldn't be able to function without me, or at least function well, with the work I'm doing.

I'm very new to this. I have no idea what's appropriate when negotiating a salary, and I also think my situation is a little more unique than others. I know I'm young and without certifications, but the work I'm doing is valuable, and I don't know how to go about getting what I deserve.

Any advice is welcome.

TLDR; Manager quit, I inherited her duties without a pay raise. Review is coming up soon, and I'm not sure how to negotiate what I deserve because I'm young and have no professional certifications, unlike my manager.",finance

personalfinance,"A quick review to see if we're doing ok with saving, budgeting, etc.","Hi all,

I would appreciate your feedback on the below.

I am 36 and my husband is 41.  We have a 1.5 yo kiddo.  We anticipate having kiddo no. 2 in the next year or so.  We live in a moderately HCOL city.

Total income: 240k.  I make 140k and my husband makes 100k.  Husband is currently interviewing for a promotion (municipal gov so super formal process) that could take him up to 115(ish)k.

Emergency fund: 16.5k (goal is to have it at 30k in the next year or so).

Retirement accounts: 288k

I posted on this earlier, but my 401k fails discrimination testing so I contribute about $97/paycheck to my 401k.  I max out my annual tIRA contribution and then convert it via a backdoor Roth.  I make monthly contributions of at least $500/month to brokerage accounts that I consider to be my retirement accounts.  Husband has 401k, HSA and a pension.

Monthly expenses (approx. 5k/mo):

Daycare: $1,695

Auto/personal articles insurance: $205

Gas: $100

Groceries: \~$1,000

Student loan payments: $1,500 (more on this below)

Car payment: $450 (more on this below); other car is completely paid off and in good shape.

Mortgage: $2,000

Restaurants/breweries: $300

Husband has 102k in student loans spread out between three loans.  All are at about 4-5% interest.  We are aggressively paying off his private loan (current balance of 41k) with a goal of having that paid off in the next year or so.  The other two loans are federal.  We'll attack those after the private loan is paid off.

We have a remaining balance of $2,200 on our car.  That will be paid off in December, and those payments will be applied to the private loan.  Additionally, I am throwing an extra $500/mo toward the private loan.

Our mortgage is at 3.6%, and I don't anticipate that this is our forever home so I don't think it makes sense to pay off the mortgage earlier.

We have a 529 set up for kiddo that has about $16k in it.

More than anything, I worry about doing enough for retirement.  Also, I know that the loans have been burdensome to my husband, and frankly, they're burdensome to us as a family with respect to other savings goals, etc.

So basically, should we stay the course?  Make changes?  I'd welcome any nuggets of wisdom.  Thanks in advance.

ETA: based on the kind and thoughtful advice below, I've revised some of my automated payroll direct deposits so that I can put at least $1,500/month toward extra loan payments.  This should increase by about $300 after August once I've hit the SSA max.  Thank you again for your kind advice.",finance
personalfinance,Tax Planning Advice - How to pay ZERO fed/state income tax?,"Opening notes: 

* I want to pay zero fed/state income taxes
* I want to be honest - no lying, no illegal tax avoidance schemes
* I want to make positive social contributions to my local community, the state of California, the United States and the world. But I do not want to pay income tax
* I want to generate some income each year (probably via sales of appreciated capital assets)

With that out of the way... here's my situation:

I bought bitcoin. And the price went up. Now I'm sitting on a capital asset that's worth many times what I paid for it. 

In the last 12mos I sold some bitcoin and as a result of those sales I paid more in taxes than my total cumulative gross income over the last 30+yrs. And it got me thinking about where that money goes. and I decided I didn't want to pay taxes anymore. 

I'm willing to do some work and spend some money implementing a \*legal\* tax plan. So please share your thoughts even if they are complex / on the wilder side. If you have recommendations for a specific tax planner, that'd be cool too :)

And I'm happy to answer questions that will help inform responses.

To begin I apologize if this is not a good forum for this post.  I am reposting to a few subs with the same question.  


My wife and I both work (or at least she did until yesterday).  She works from home, which helps minimize child care costs as she only needs a sitter 2-3 days a week depending on work load.


Here is what I know we are eligible for:
1) State unemployment for up to 6 months
2) Disability if she cannot find work (baby due 2/6/2019)


We crunched some numbers and while we do have some savings, we are projecting we will be out of money within 2 months or so.  We have credit cards as back ups, however, we are FINALLY, after 8 years, are debt free minus a mortgage, so we are trying to avoid that if at all possible.


My question is this -- what sort of state/federal benefits are we eligible for?  I am 35, she is 34.  We have worked our entire lives and have never needed help financially, but both of us are a little worried now that we have 2 mouths to feed.


Thanks for any advice and guidance you can offer.

crypto_currency,4NEW,"4NEW is the world's first solution to eliminate the problem of energy consumption in the world. 4NEW is the world's first environmentally friendly detached ecosystem that is fed by waste from power plants. For example, there is an abuse of energy in the world. And this is due to traditional electric companies that limit the amount of energy that is not based on anything.

Concept

The concept of the project is very simple: the process of processing waste in water and organic materials create energy, and then it is used either for sale or for use in mining. Energy production costs are met through revenues from waste collection services and sales of by-products that promote sustainable operation at break-even or marginal profit. Therefore, the generated energy is not bypassed and is freely available for use or sale to the state.

Platform token

The KWATT token will represent a specific coding capacity per coin. This concept is not new; Companies like Gigawatt offered similar products to reduce costs, but KWATT Coin is extremely unique in scale. We do not charge a fee for energy for the mining industry, the only cost for the coin holder is the cost of the coin. This means that the coin holder will be able to clear all crypto emissions for life, without spending additional pennies at the expense of energy. Energy is free for us, so it is also free for coin holders.

general information

Token: FRNC

Price 1 FRNC = 1 USD

Platform: Ethereum

Accepted: ETH

HardCap $ 42,100,000

Country: United Kingdom

Distributed register 4New

A differentiated, distributed 4NEW register is a place where all participants in any industry can make transactions using a KWATT coin. Coins are intellectual contracts that establish a link between the parties to a transaction and provide the value of each transaction. The book will be a magazine that can not be changed and verified by all transactions related to the purchase and sale of goods and services on the blockbuster. Since all parties to each transaction can see the same account, the reconciliation costs and the potential dispute problem and revenue leakage are monitored to a very large extent. This will allow standardizing the waste, energy and crypto-currency industries that are striving for technological innovation. This will also allow KWATT to be used.

Advantages and disadvantages of the project

The project benefits include:

Improved mining process: users can decide what kind of cryptate they want to get, through the main coin KWATT Coin Power. They will have access to the 20 most popular coins. This system determines the hash ratio for each coin and a reward that is pre-assigned to a user account that is connected to the 4NEW code.

Green energy: KWATT energy will be used to create a renewable energy source. The energy used in the 4NEW network is converted from waste, which makes this ICO a good idea.

Innovative Blockchain: We like how 4NEW is used to create a decentralized production platform. After the company creates its own chain of custody, it will be easier for users to use and work on their own system.

Minus the project:

The project is not unique: There are many ICOs whose purpose is to convert energy. We will need to see some innovative developments with 4NEW before we can see how it surpasses its competitors.

personalfinance,Six-Month Review Coming Up - Next Year's Budget Only Has 4% Raise - How to Negotiate Up?,"I work for what can be described as a small financial services firm (\~$3 million in annual revenue). Six months ago I was hired in at $82,000 a year. I know from the interview process that the max salary for my position was $125K. I also know from the current year's budget that they actually budgeted $100K for the position over an 11 month period (or $109K a year as I was hired in February). So that means they hired me for $27K less a year than they expected to spend.

We're about to do our mid-year reviews, and I've been kicking ass. My contributions to the company have been meaningful and are highly visible to our clients. I'm also the only one in the company that can do what I do for them. My boss loves me, and I've made it clear that I really like working for the company and am dedicated to the company's success for the long term. Furthermore, the company itself is doing better than ever, with more investors / subscribers to our services and more revenue than ever before. We are discussing hiring a fifth staff person, but have deferred doing so because we want to reinvest that money in more services rather than lightening our personal workloads (especially as I continue to mature into the company and am able to become even more efficient at what I do).

Looking at the 2019 budget, it looks like I'm only getting a 4% raise (a little more than $3K). My boss does not know I know this yet, but it's on the shared drive for all to see. I'm disappointed that they are only currently planning on this large of a raise, as I've definitely proven my worth here with some really big improvements to things, including some that have direct impact on reducing our expenses. There are only four staff, including the CEO, the VP (my boss), the finance director, and me (title = manager). My boss and the finance guy both make double my salary and double my bonus if the company meets goals (15% vs. 30%).

I get that I'm new, but my compensation is clearly the outlier from the herd and it's clear they had thought they would be paying whoever came into my position would be earning more than I am from the start (but I came in from the public sector, so this was still a big raise).

I want more money. I just had a new baby, and 4% barely outstrips inflation. Interest rates are rising, and I want to buy a home for my family before too long. I know that doesn't matter at the table, but they are the ones that preached the ""we're a family and take care of each other"" when I was interviewing and onboarded. I've clearly performed beyond their expectations. How can I set myself up for success in my mid-year reviews for this?",finance
personalfinance,Sequence of Return Risk (?) on an Inherited Annuity,"Hi Reddit - My wife recently inherited an annuity with several hundred thousand in it.  The total value of her account is $320,257 with a cost basis of $128,933.42 (nontaxable) and a taxable portion of $191,324.47. 

Our tax advisor said we could take \~$73k this year without moving into the next tax bracket.

My question is regarding how to invest the rest. We have a five year deferral option but at the end of the five years the annuity converts to cash and everything we have not disbursed get distributed to us.

Therefore, we could lock in losses if the market took a turn. That said, we could put the money right back in the market as long as it is transferred quickly to us so maybe I am worried about nothing.

My inclination is to put it in equities but I am nervous because I don't want to mess up this money that someone worked a lifetime for. A friend of mine recommended VWELX as a fund that is fairly good at wealth preservation.

Dollar cost averaging doesn't seem to solve this problem as the market could still turn.

Is it best to just get it into the market now and what happens happens or since we know the money has to be cashed out in a five year timeframe we take a more defensive posture and put it in a money market or a 50/50 stock bond split (this seems wrong given rising interest rates and potentially overvalued equities).

As it stands, I don't think any company would refinance this loan. The only thing I can think to do is try and refinance with my current financier for a higher interest rate (since my credit score is significantly down &amp; the car is worth less than the loan).

I do not plan on just making that minimum payment. I have no rent, and other bills equate to around $150 a month so there will be times when I make a $1,000 dollar monthly payment or more. 

My credit score is great. From looking at my banks estimations and credit karma I would say its around 740-750. 

My parents say that its much better to go to a credit union as I will get a much lower interest rate than what the dealership would offer. 

And this is were I get stuck. Do I go to the dealership, pick out the car I want, then finance it there? Or do I get pre-approved for the loan?

Eventually realized this wasn't sustainable. No associate's degree since the university I went to only had 4+ year programs.

Began working at a call center a while after I dropped out (better pay than job I previously had that was close to campus), got 3 promotions over the next 4 years, have been using almost all money not dedicated to rent/utilities/misc. necessities/groceries on chipping away the student loans and credit card debt. 

Found out that higher ups have been considering firing 2-3 people in my department for some reason, despite the company doing well and us already having heavy workload. This especially worries me since I am one of the newest to the department. This terrifies me since I only got my current position by constantly proving myself. If I had to apply to another company, I wouldn't even be considered for something at the same level without a college degree; even if I was considered, I would likely be making less money for the same or more work. 

I have no savings, since up until my most recent promotion(and also cancelling my health insurance this year) I didn't have enough balance to avoid an overdraft fee every few months. I have no assets worth selling. My electronics are old and in need of replacement, my vehicle is borrowed from a family member, and my furniture is old and worn (or broken).

Current financial plan if I don't get fired: keep paying off loans while focusing on credit card since it has highest interest rate. CC could be paid off sometime early next year, student loans could be paid off sometime in 2020.  This is assuming vehicle doesn't need maintenance, I don't need medical attention, my brother doesn't need additional medical attention, or any other unexpected things come up.

I have no idea how to get out of this. Is there something I could do to improve my current course of action? I can't stand having this debt hanging over me any more. What should I do if I lose my job? I couldn't afford rent and my debts would grow if I couldn't make payments.

*Also, health insurance offered by company would take $300+ out of my checks each month, and it doesn't even cover anything until after a $5000 deductible - which is an amount of money I can't even imagine having laying around.

*Forgive any grammatical errors, I haven't slept since I heard about the future firings 3 days ago",finance

personalfinance,My father had a stroke... Now what?,"Sorry if this isn't the correct sub to be posting this but I'm kind of confused and have no idea what to do or where to start. If anyone could lend their advice or assist me in the right direction I would be plenty appreciative. 

My father who is 67 had been having trouble with his right leg, to the point the didn't want to drive because he couldn't hit the breaks without getting his foot off of the gas pedal. Recently he felt different (numb) on his right side and the he was taken to the hospital where they said he had a mini stroke. 

They kept him a few day and spent about 29 days in rehab. He then was sent home, that was until his right side went completely numb. He was sent to the hospital again yesterday where they have done another MRI and said that he has had more than 2 strokes since being back home. He doesn't know what's going on or where he is or who the president is at this point.

He owns a car that is paid off and a townhouse with a mortgage where his sister is living with him.  He is retired from the federal government and also was in the Navy. I am being asked who will be making decision for my father by the Dr. I never had to deal with anything like this and have no idea what kind of decisions would need to be made.

I'm told that his insurance covers 45 days of rehab where he already spent 20 days the first time. So after 25 days of rehab this time then what? How does his bills get paid? What if he can't take care of himself when they discharge him? The house has maybe 19 steps from the entrance to the fist floor so my aunt has been calling the fire Dept these last couple times because she couldn't move him to get him down the steps since he couldn't cooperate. 

I guess what I'm asking is what are some steps that should be taken now assuming things get better? What are some steps that should be taken if things get worse?",finance

personalfinance,Advice re: inheritance (taxes and investing),"A close relative (non-spouse) recently passed away and generously named me as one of the beneficiaries on his company 401k and life insurance. I don't have a final number, but my portion will be in the lower six figures, and I'm fortunate in that I don't need this money for living right now. The paperwork for the 401k includes literally 12 pages of IRS-speak about payout methods (annuity, lump sum, etc), and while I have a meeting with a financial adviser next week, I'd appreciate some feedback on the 401k specifically, plus other stuff.  

Stats: Mid-30s, single, self-employed clearing about $40k/year after taxes, less than $5k student loans in repayment, no CC debt (finally paid off the bad choices from my 20s about 6 months ago), about $6k liquid emergency fund, $10k IRA, both of which I've beefed up since paying off the CC stuff. No housing costs for now as I live in my grandparents' old paid-for house, and I'm in a relatively low COL area. Healthcare is my biggest expense. The last 8 or so years I've been putting almost everything toward paying off debt, and I know I have serious catching-up to do as far as building savings and planning for retirement. Questions: 

1. I know the life insurance is not taxed, but what about the payout from the 401k? 
2. If the 401k is taxed, is there one best way to receive the payout that minimizes tax burden?
3. What's the best way to utilize this money? I.e., paying off remaining student loans, investing for retirement, or other?
4. How aggressively should I try to invest this, assuming retirement in approximately 30 years?",finance
personalfinance,In need of financial advice - Debts,"Me and my partner are struggling with our finances and are afraid of being overwhelmed by our debts. We are looking for any advice on how to refinance our car, or otherwise deal with that loan. We are also looking for advice on my partners student and medical debt. 

When we bought our car we didn't know a thing about it. So we've ended up with a loan on a 2011 Chevy Aveo. We put $1,800 down and financed $10,572. Currently have an unpaid balance of $8,595 at an interest rate of (an embarrassing) 29.90%. We pay 385 a month, but are unable to start any savings. We have Geico car insurance costing us $190 (it needs to be full coverage). 

My partner is about to start getting her wages garnished for her US DoE student loans at 15%. She has a current balance after fees and whatnot of $10,744. She is trying to rehabilitate them but is having a hard time figuring out where to send the forms to.

She filled it out and uploaded it in the payment section but hasn't any way to figure out if it was received nor heard anything back for over a week now. 

She also has some recent medical bills stacking up to around at least $2,000.

My credit is currently 643, while my partners is in the 400s.

We don't qualify for food stamps and our lease is coming up at the end of October. We pay $800 a month in rent but it's going to go up a bit if we stay here. We really want to move but can't find the breathe to start any savings.

investing,Small Cap / Low Volatility Investing Ideas,"I am looking for funds or ETFs similar to Vanguard Global Minimum Volatility, if there are any. 

I haven't found any so far that I would consider truly comparable but I would love to hear your ideas.

The fund:

* More small and mid cap stocks than the market.
* Unique security selection process - a quant fund that looks for low volatility stocks that also have low correlation with each other. That second part is important so you don't wind up with a ton of utilities or something and get screwed when interest rates rise.
* Super low fees, only 0.17 for admiral shares.
* Hedges away all non-USD currency exposure.

I like the small-mid, min vol strategy for personal reasons. I'm kind of ambivalent about the hedging - I would rather they lower the expense a couple more basis points.

Closest things I've found so far:

* Combining some iShares Min Vol ETFs, say SMMV, EFAV, EEMV (US Small MV, Developed MV, Emerging MV respectively). Problem is they don't have an international small MV ETF. I also lose the benefit of having everything in one fund (keeping stocks in the fund with low correlations with each other).
* Combining some AQR Defensive Style mutual funds, say AUENX (large cap), ANDNX (international), AZENX (emerging). I lose the small/mid focus and expenses are high.
* Find a Global Small Multifactor ETF, such as ROGS or combining SMLF/ISCF (iShares US Small and International Small Multifactor). But multifactor isn't the same as low volatility; these funds are usually screening on some combination of value, quality, and momentum.",finance
personalfinance,Open HELOC to pay off CC debt?,"So I bought my place a few years ago. It was a foreclosure and I got it for a steal. The property value in the area has gone up like crazy (last estimate has my property at almost 3x the value I purchased it for). For maths sake, here are some fake numbers that show my situation:

Purchased @ $100k

Mortgage @$80k (now about $75k after a few years of paying) 3.9% interest

Current Market Value \~$300k

I have about $20k in CC debt (interest rates 16-24%) that is killing my monthly cashflow and making it very difficult to save or pay it down. I've been trying to find side hustles, but my work hours are erratic, so it makes it hard to consistently do something. 

Since my LTV would still be pretty good, do you think opening a HELOC (or getting a second mortgage?) would be a good option? I haven't used my CCs in a few years, but I was a fool when I was young and am paying for it now. I'm open to whatever, but am looking for advice before making a decision!",finance

personalfinance,"Want to pay down 80k in student loan debt ASAP, what are my best options?","I am a new college grad with a fair amount of student debt (80k) that i'm looking to aggressively pay down, and hopefully eliminate, as soon as I possibly can. I have 3 student loans, all with varying rates and principle/current balances:

|Bank:|Principle|Interest Rate|Start Date|Term|Current Balance|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Citizens|$20,000|7.35%|8/01/2015|15 Years|$24,001.21|
|Citizens|$30,000|7.99%|8/01/2016|15 Years|$34,127.42|
|SallieMae|$20,000|6.75%|8/22/2017|10 Years|$20,930.55|
||||||Total: $79,059.18|

Like I said, it's a fair amount of debt, with some pretty high interest rates, so i'm looking to attack this as quickly and effectively as possible. All 3 of these loans are in grace period until 12/01/2018.

On the bright side, I do have a job, salaried at $50,000/yr before taxes. While it is a ""salary"", I am paid hourly at $24.04/hr with OT eligibility averaging about $5,000/yr. They also offer a 401K match plan: 100% on the first 2%, then 50% on the next 4 percent. As well as additional retirement contribution at 6%(3 year 100% vesting schedule).

I live in MA, so taxes will take a relatively good amount from my bottom line. Estimating to net somewhere between $40,000-$43,000 (based on potential overtime) after all state and federal taxes

My parents are basically supporting me in full so I can take down this debt, meaning I have very limited expenses. I have a pretty long commute, and spend \~$40/week on gas, and that is my only true expense. I would like to have some spending money on the side but I'm very willing to be conservative.

So r/personalfinance, my question is: how can I erase this debt as quickly as possible?

Should I wait for my grace period to end or should I start paying these down immediately? Are there fees if I start to pay before my grace period ends?

Should I consider consolidating these loans? Will I even be able to?

Should I participate in the 401k match program? Or save that money and put it towards my loans?

Without doing much calculation, it looks like this will take me about 2 years if i can commit 90%+ of my income, what can I do to shrink that 2 year window? Or if that's the best I can do, what can I do to achieve that goal?

personalfinance,[18yo-US] Is investing in a Roth IRA a bad idea if I need that money to pay for college?,"I've been lurking on this sub a lot recently as I get ready for college and living on my own this fall.

One thing I've gotten interested in because of this sub is a Roth IRA. Ideally I want to open one right now so I have 4/5 extra years to build interest, but I also need every penny I have to pay for college. Basically, I'm not going to have enough to pay for college out of pocket. Worse case scenario is about 10k in federal loans and 50k in private loans (the private loans won't be until 3rd/4th year if it matters). If I put say, $1k in a Roth IRA index fund, that's $1k more I'm probably going to need to eventually take out in loans.

So with that said, which makes more sense, investing that $1k in retirement or keeping it in savings for college?",finance

Since moving from my parents home about 7 years ago, I have lived in 9 different places and I am really ready to just settle down, stop renting, and live in a place for a good amount of time. Pair that with a desire for equity, and I am searching for a decently priced, small house to buy.

I currently have $22,000 in my savings account as my emergency and housing fund... should I offer that full amount as a down payment or is it critical to keep at least 10k of that for emergency? I'm afraid that if I dont offer up a decent enough down payment, I may end up with a worse interest rate. I was pre-approved at 4.35% with a $12,500 down payment (for $250k purchase price), but I would like to be a little more aggressive about my interest and time frame of paying off the house.

I have about $3,200 in my 401k which I understand can be used as collateral for a first time home buyer.

personalfinance,Credit Card Journey for 18 year old,"I’ve been doing a lot of research ever since I began high school on credit bc my parents have the worst and I don’t want to be in that situation. So naturally a couple weeks after I turned 18 I figured it was time to get a credit card to use responsibly before I moved out to go to university. I currently hold a part time job at $10.70/hour and a minimum of 20 hours a week is guaranteed for me, worked at this place for just over a year and got my promotion and 20 cent raise a week ago, looking to grab another part time job as well. I initially applied for the capital one secured card, and was denied for “lack of credit history or missing information”, which initiated 1 hard inquiry, then I applied for a discover student card bc I’m a student and the card is made FOR students who have no to little credit history, and was denied for “high number of recent credit inquiries” which is understandable considering there was 6 days between applications even though it was only one inquiry which isn’t “high”. My friend went through this same scenario, 2 hard inquiries in a short period of time, and was allowed to supply bank statements and such to supplement her application and they decided to approve her second application, that however, was not the case for me. Discover shut me down and said to apply for the secured card, so I did a prequalify to see if it’d even recommend it, it did, and she said since I applied the same day for the secured card it shouldn’t pull my credit again and the system would use the one it pulled for the student card as a discover rep said. I check my equifax report, 3 hard inquiries, the secured card application pulled my credit again. I ended up qualifying for the secured card with discover, chose to start low with $200 limit, still waiting for them to take my deposit. My question is, can I dispute the second credit run from discover or not, and how will 3 hard inquiries affect my credit since all 3 were performed in a weeks time? And due to 3 hard inquiries, does anyone have any recommendations as to how to build my credit and if I have to wait longer than normal to add another secured card to my mix or to raise my credit line with another deposit? I’m assuming 3 inquiries means I have to tread lightly and settle with this card and it’s graduated version, if I get it, for the next two years until the inquiries disappear.

economy,"The yield curve is near an inversion, but the real fed funds rate isn’t positive yet. Which recession indicator do you trust more?","The real Fed funds rate is a cousin of the yield curve. It indicates whether the Fed is expansionary or contractionary in a crude manner. It’s crude because inflation doesn’t determine which policy the Fed has. The rate of change of inflation and growth tell us where the Fed is. 

For example, there is a big difference between rate hikes which are trying to slow rising inflation and rate hikes which have already slowed inflation. The real Fed funds rate has been positive before every recession except one. Since the real Fed funds rate is -1%, this indicator is far from signaling a recession.

CryptoCurrency,Monero is good money.,"It has all the properties of good money. The 2 most important, privacy and fungibility. There are no coins with any amount of adoption with these properties currently today except Monero. Fiat currency is better money than Bitcoin because fiat has privacy if you pay with paper cash. With Bitcoin you must announce to the world with a digital timestamp everytime you want to make a transaction, a governments dream. If everyone is using Bitcoin they can finally track all of those illegal deals and keep tabs on where everyone is spending their money. Bitcoin may as well be Fed Coin.

Remember when all of the media used to despise Bitcoin? It's because they thought it was anonymous. Once they realized chain analysis can be used to trace transactions, a lot of them suddenly like Bitcoin. Guess what? They still despise Monero, which is a good thing, in fact, it's the main coin they hate. That's a badge of honor that Bitcoin used to hold but now passed on to Monero.

Monero is essentially digital fiat that cannot be hyper inflated.  Other than the obvious downsides of fiat, it does work very well for private transactions which is necessary for currency and a store of value.  Not just because privacy is important but because privacy enables fungibility.  Your dollar bills that were probably used to buy drugs are still treated the same way as dollar bills that weren't used to buy drugs.  This is a necessary feature of money.

All Bitcoins are not created equal. If someone sends you BTC you better do a chain analysis to make sure it hasn't been used for illegal purposes or you might have trouble converting it to fiat. Fiat, unfortunately, is better than Bitcoin, and always will be better than Bitcoin. Bitcoin cannot and never will be used as real money, nor a store of value. What good is a store of value if it's not even private? You hear the lightning network is going to make Bitcoin private but all it's going to do is re-create the banking system, further centralize it, and give those intermediary lightning nodes the ability to spy on your ""private"" transactions so no one will know about it.....except them. Monero is better than fiat and Bitcoin in every sense and I have yet to find any coin out there with a better use case: Good money.

personalfinance,Deciding on what debt to take on first,"Hi all,

I've started a new job that is a large increase in what I was making before, so I want to pay down some outstanding debt. I'm not sure how to go about it due to some factors. I understand the debt snowball vs debt avalanche but I've got a mix of zero interest debt and some credit card debt.

medical debt is:  
1 450- I pay 50 dollars a month

2. 1300- I pay 50 dollars a month  
3. 4600- I pay 100 dollars a month

Now I've also got roughly 9k in credit card debt which is at 10% APR. The minimum is 250 and I pay 300 right now.

After all my other expenses are taken care of (I can list them all if necessary) I have \~1000 left over (I'm putting about 250 aside in savings.)

So, should I pay off the medical debt first even though there is no interest on it? Or should I take care of the CC because it does have a 10% interest rate on it?

Thanks",finance
personalfinance,I have to wait 2 business days to use funds from a stock I sold on Vanguard?,"I just transferred a bunch of ETFs from one of the robo funds to Vanguard. I sold about $6k worth of stuff that came in and now I have that money listed under ""Funds available to trade."" However when I go to make a purchase using those funds, I get a pop up of:

""Please be aware that you are using unsettled funds for this purchase.
It is considered a trade violation under Federal Reserve Regulation T when unsettled funds are used to make a purchase and the security purchased is subsequently sold prior to the settlement date of the funding sale.""

And then it says: ""The settlement date is one business day from the trade date (T+1) for Vanguard mutual funds, and generally two business days from the trade date (T+2) for equities.""

personalfinance,State of my finances: Am I doing it right?,"Hello everyone, 

I have never posted on r/personalfinance but I thought I may want to give it a try and would like to hear your thoughts on the state of my personal finances and see if there are any rooms for improvement. I will try to be as thorough but at the same time, not be too long winded. 

I am from Singapore and I am a  30 year old single male. I graduated with a Bachelors in Biological sciences and I am now a research officer doing skin research in a government backed research institute. I take home decent pay every month, comparable to most graduates like me. 

I have been working for nearly 5 years, and earned an average of S$65,000 annually. So far, I have S$70,000 in savings, of which S$10,000 have recently been invested through a robo-advisor which manages my investment through a pool of ETFs, bonds and commodities with a 5% potential returns on an annualized basis (This is based on my risk appetite). I started investing only about a month ago. I invest S$500 every month. The money invested is highly liquid and can be withdrawn at any time.

 Any extra savings to saved in a bank which now has a total of around S$60,000. On average I save about S$500 to S$800 every month (that is on top of the S$500 invested monthly mentioned before).

On top of that, Singapore has this scheme called the Central Provident Fund or CPF, that acts as a retirement fund for Singaporeans to save for their retirement. The usage of the fund is restricted and can only be used under certain circumstances, like buying a home.

This fund can be used to buy a home through HDB, or Housing Development Board, a government statute that provides affordable housing for Singaporeans (80% of Singaporeans owns a home built by the HDB, so these are quality homes). It can also be used to pay medical bills when you visit a public hospital. 

 CPF calls for a mandatory savings of 17% of your salary and another 20% to be paid by the employer. That amounts to about S$1500 of monthly contributions to the CPF. Funds in a CPF accumulate interest of around 3.5% - 4% on average on an annualised basis. 

After working for 5 years I have accumulated $105,000 in my CPF. 

I am currently living in a one bedroom rented apartment for about $800 a month. 

I am planning to buy a house in  couple of years. I have no outstanding credit card debt or any other debt. 

I am also studying part time for my Masters Degree through a local university. Fees are subsidised and paid for in full already as it is subsidised for Singaporeans. 

I have a term health insurance that covers hospitalization fees. It costs about S$400 a year at my age, which pays in full should I be hospitalized in a public hospital. 

I do not smoke, I exercise regularly, of a healthy weight and have no pre-existing medical conditions.

My question is this:

I started quite late in investing my extra cash to accrue a higher and more steady returns. Do you think I have too much cash lying around in the bank, and if so, do you think it would be wise to channel more money into the ETFs, bonds and commodities to earn a high interest rates compared to banks? 

As a 30 year old single male, am I on the right track when it comes to managing my money? Do you think there are gaps like insurance coverage etc that might be useful in protecting my wealth should something happen to me? 

I am thinking of getting an additional health insurance plan to protects me from critical illnesses, giving me a lump sum payout should I be diagnosed with critical illnesses like cancer or other long term diseases that prevents me from working for a period of time. But the premiums are pretty hefty and I am not sure given my age, it would be a good form of protection as of now.

personalfinance,I'm Behind in my 401k - Don't know if I'm not saving enough or if my investments are too conservative?,"I'm currently 30 and started my 401k at 21 when I started working.  I'm a Federal Employee so I have a TSP but I think that it works pretty similarly to a traditional 401k.  I've always invested 6% and my employer matches 4% (100% of the first 3% then 50% of the next 2%).

When I started I made $43k for salary, now I make $93k.  In the past 3 years I've gotten ~$30k pay bump.  

I have $67k in my 401k right now.  So, I'm very short of the 1 year's salary goal.  I've been saving 10% of my salary including employer contribution.  I did the math on that at my various salary levels, and between mine and my employer's contributions I would have put in about $61, 305.  So that means that over the years my investments have only grown $6k.  

I'll admit that I messed up at first, and was kind of scared of the stock market and invested too much into Government Securities.  But 5 years ago I moved my money.  I have 44% in the Lifecycle 2050 Fund, 17% in the Government Securities (G Fund), 9% in the Fixed Income Index (F Fund), 20% in the Common Stock Fund (C Fund) and 4% each in Small Cap Stock Index (S Fund) and International Stock Index (I Fund).  This discombobulated method came from a bunch of random advice from co-workers, so maybe I should just put everything in the lifecycle fund and be done with it - However, I haven't seen much of a return at all on the money that I've put in.  These have been my allocations for a few years.  

Any advice is greatly appreciated, thanks! 

eta: One piece of advice that I've gotten is to have your age in bonds, as in I'm 30 years old so 30% of my 401k should be in Bonds...given my low returns on my 401k so far though, I don't think I should increase my contributions to Bonds? 

eta2: I probably should have also mentioned, that I go to grad school at night and pay for it myself out of pocket, so I live all other aspects of my life as though I make more like $75k before taxes because I just pretend that school money doesn't exist.  I do this to avoid student loans, because the interest rate or grad school loans is something like 7-8%, but I'm not sure if missing out on the compounding interest is worse than paying on loans for a few years (I don't trust PSLF to rely on them enough and don't think that my loan balance will be high enough that it'd even be worth it to pay for 10 years).",finance
personalfinance,Will refinancing ONLY private loans effect my federal loans in any way?,"Apologies if this is a dumb question. I just got approved to refinance and consolidate my 5 private student loans through SoFi (all private, no federal), but before I sign I want to make sure it's not going to effect my Federal loans. I know if you refinance your Federal loans, you are no longer eligible for the income-based plans that's offered for Federal loans, but it's not made clear anywhere if anything happens to your Federals if you're just refinancing privates. Currently, I'm under the income-based repayment for my Federals, and not being eligible for that would eff up everything for me.

personalfinance,Reaping the benefits of frugality - actually spending the money you've been saving,"Hello friends.

This may be a selfish search for approval or permission from internet strangers, but hey, this sub has been super helpful to me for a long time so I figured I'd throw this out there to see if anyone else has been in the same boat and could offer some perspective.

The tl:dr is I'm hugely frugal, have lived like a pauper through college and a few professional years, zero vacations, *very* little impulse buying (and never on anything big), extremely careful with my money and saving.  And I'm so glad - it's afforded me a peace of mind I could never have had if I was hapless in spending whenever I wanted to!

On the other hand, I think I've dug in a few shovelfuls too far, and, now that I am gainfully employed and sitting on a rather significant savings account/investment potential, horribly, painfully, kicking-and-screamingly unwilling to spend the money I have on the few things I've wanted and gone without forever.

Sound familiar to anyone?

As /r/frugal would say, the *point* of saving and sacrificing is to *enjoy* life and the savings you make, not to be miserable and old and rich and have never enjoyed yourself.  Which, logically, I agree with, but emotionally ""NOOOO that's MY money I saaaaved that for sooo loooong noooo""

What are your tools and tactics for justifying spending, even/especially on things you don't technically need?  

In my personal case (because I know that'll be the first comment), I make ~75k a year, have a bit more than that stuffed in savings (yes, I'm planning on investing once I can enter into my 401k, yes I have an emergency fund, yes I'm planning on maxing out retirement and contributions) and roughly 1.5k monthly expenses (rent, utilities, food, NO car, debt, payments on anything) Of course, my main priority is to hit retirement hard and max out what I can these first few years (as well as HSA etc.) 

I've always wanted a fancy, sexy gaming computer, and have been scraping by on reeeeally old/crappy ones through school that can barely handle solitaire on low settings.  A *top of the line* one (self build, of course) would run around 2k, where a more reasonable one for more higher-end-casual use may be looking at 1.6k or so.  I don't *need* one, I can certainly get by on my current old clunker, and to my frugal brain it seems like a horrible waste.  But, again, I've been saving and sacrificing and do *want* to build some healthy *spending* habits, ironically.  

How do you allow yourself to spend on incidentals/discretionaries?  How do you stop being the dirt poor college student deciding between the $0.79 and the $0.99 bag of rice and buy yourself the $600 monitor instead of cheaping out on the $150?  How do you justify completely unnecessary purchases, vacations, spending *just because you can and want to*, within reason and means?

Really appreciate any thoughts/experiences/advice.  I may or may not simply be looking for random people to say ""dude buy it you've earned it"", but really am moreso hoping to build healthy PF habits that go BOTH ways - saving and budgeting but also actually spending money.",finance

personalfinance,Financial stress is starting to seriously impact my mental health,"This is going to be a bit of a ramble because i'm not totally sure what I'm looking for, but bear with me, I'll hopefully find that along the way here.

I am currently extremely stressed out about my financial situation and not sure how to begin to turn things around. There is also a small possibility that maybe I am stressing over nothing, because I know this is definitely not as crippling of a situation as I could be in. I am currently 23 and I have a stable job that I don't particularly enjoy, but I am one who is willing to be unhappy with my job if it means I can meet the financial means to find happiness in other areas of life. I make a pre-taxed income of $61,770 and should be getting a substantial (min of $10K) raise in the next six months. I also will receive my yearly bonus of around $5K in March of 2019.

Debt Breakdown:

I have $49,000 in student loans with an average fixed interest rate of 4.158%. I am making monthly payments of $500. I plan to use my yearly bonus/tax return as large payments towards these loans and hope to wipe out this debt in about 5 years.

I have $24,400 in credit card limit which I am utilizing 7% of at the moment. I have around $1900 on two different cards: $1095 on one with a 24.74% APR and $765 on another with 19.9% APR.

My credit score is in the 750s so I am doing OK in this aspect...but I still stress. Those APRs are high and I am unable to get these balances to $0 anytime soon. I am definitely dependent on these cards for things like groceries, trips, day to day needs as my rent and bills eat up much of my income.

When making a strict monthly budget, one where I am eating Kraft Mac every night and only allowing myself one ""night out"" a weekend, I have $458 remaining each month which I was planning to use that extra bit to pay off my CCs by the end of 2018. But this is so draining. Every card swipe makes me tense and I can't enjoy anything when I am out. I can suck it up and live this way for the next few months, but is it necessary?

I basically am looking for someone to tell me I am doing alright at this point in life or advice on what to do to get me on the right track. I am able to make the minimum payment on my credit cards right now, but from what I've read online, this is a drop in the ocean. Should I open another credit card with 0% APR for the next 18 months, transfer my debt and then use my bonus/tax return next year to pay this off? I know this should be a priority over the SL since the APR on my SLs are minimal compared to the CCs. Should I continue living on a strict budget? Should I relax a little bit because 5 years from now this should all be under control and the \~$1K I'll pay in CC interest is nothing in the long run? This is all so draining and I haven't been able to sleep or enjoy anything I do lately. I want to not worry about it, but it's such a slippery slope I've watched people very close to me get sucked into.

I am ready to go ahead and put those amounts aside for tax filing season. No problem.

So here goes...

1. My wife changed employers and wants to cash out her 401k. She doesnt want to roll it over to her new jobs plan because shes only planning to stay there a year and her check is short enough thanks to health insurance deductions and taxes. The 401k is only $500. So she will probably get like b/w 200-300 after taxes and penalty.

2. I have 2 retirement accounts. One of them is a traditional IRA with $3000 in it. I want to cash it out to pay off debt. According to my calculator, i will have about 1700 left minus taxes and 10% penalty. 

I really just wanna get rid of all this debt which is about $1400. I dont want anymore interest to accumulate.

Id rather put that 200 per check towards buying a condo or towards rebuilding our emergency fund which had sustained losses over the last 2 years thanks to a bunch of emergencies that happened back to back.

My concerns are will this negatively affect my credit score or her credit if we withdraw early in this case? And how does it affect if when we plan to purchase a condo?",finance
personalfinance,Lending clubs?,"My husband and I are in a really bad financial pickle. We both work 60 hours a week and can’t really take on any more work. We have been managing debt for years now and it’s really draining on our budget. We haven’t accrued any addition debt for about two years now, we’re just paying it down. But we just got hit with a heavy bill that needs to be paid immediately so we looked into personal loans from a lending club.

It’s obviously a shit loan. We are going to end up getting $22,000 to consolidate all of our credit card debt and one other personal loan. But it will take 5 years to pay it off, and by the end of the 5 years we will have paid 38,000. But we feel stuck. Also most of our debt is at a high interest rate anyways, so it’s not like it’s much worse than what we’re already dealing with. And it’s going to save us about $300 a month from what we’re already paying. 

Here’s my question: is there anything we need to know about getting this loan that we don’t already? Scary things? It’s a little nerve wracking. Does anyone have any advice going into this?

Edit: the loan is for $23,500. They are charging us $1,500 to grant us the loan which puts an actual total of $22,000 into our account. The rate is %21.6 for 60 months for a monthly payment of $628. We will end up paying $38,000 for this loan at the end of 5 years. However we do hope to pay it down faster once we can. 

Edit 2: I appreciate everyone taking the time to read my post and offer advice!!! I understand that this loan is super shitty and if we had ANY way of not needing it we should find another option first. Unfortunately my husband and I both made really irresponsible decisions early in our adult years and are now paying the consequences of that. But there really isn’t anything else we can do. Our budget is tight and we stick to it. And we do not spend money unnecessarily. We review our spending habits regularly and are constantly making sure we don’t have anything we don’t need. 

I was really only looking for insight on lending clubs, and if there was any “hidden fee” or “dirty secret” I should know about. We have used up every resource available to us, and it is really our last hope. If there’s anything you think I should know about lending clubs I’d love to hear it! But otherwise, there really isn’t any advice that can help us have more money. And “work more” isn’t something I’m going to do, I’m done wasting my youth working all day every day.",finance

personalfinance,Is this a new scam? Getting weird calls,"*So full  disclosure, I do have debt over the years pilled up. So I do get calls from bill collectors. I have been steadily knocking my debt out the past 16 months, but I can't knock it all out in one go unless I sell my house and cars...so a few thousand here one month, and a few thousand there the next is my current speed.*

I own a business. A small business. I have gotten those scam calls for years, about owing IRS money, Windows sending a error code back to ""Microsoft"" and so on. I don't know if these scammers target businesses more, but these people would relentlessly call me non stop even when I would explain to them that I know it's a scam. Lately they've died down(guessing thanks to the federal busts they did).

So the past 2 days I have got 2 very weird calls. Here is how they went:

Ryder004:&lt;Business name greeting&gt;How may I help you?

Call guy1: Hello I is this &lt;Business name&gt;?

Ryder004: Yes how may I help you?

Call guy1: Hello sir I am from&lt;mega vague and generic business name&gt; and we are in your area in \*PROCEEDS TO READ MY ZIP CODE OUT FROM HIS MONITOR\* and we are doing a job and will be needing supplies.

Ryder004: Ok just tell us what you need

Call guy1: Ok may I have your email so I can send you over what we need?

Ryder004: Sure it's &lt;my email&gt;

Call guy1: OK thank you...and may I have your full name sir?

Ryder004: \*HESITATED FOR A BIT, BUT CUSTOMERS IN THE PAST HAVE ASKED ME FOR MY FULL NAME BEFORE\* \*Proceeded to give my full name\*

Call guy1: Ok and what is your title?

Ryder004: \*give title\*

Call guy1: Ok excellent, and what is the address of where the product would be coming from?

Ryder004: \*give my address\*

Call guy1: Ok thank you sir. I will email you that list shortly.

Ryder004: No problem, have a great day.

Convo over. This guy never sent any email inquiring about any products. I also checked the number and it also bounced back to 1 search with a generic business name with 0 reviews and is labeled as ""mens fashion""....and no I am not in the business of mens fashion.

So today I got another weird call. This one was a different person, I could tell by the voice. This one was more specific than the last. Some context here: I do have products I sell on Amazon.

Ryder004: &lt;Business name greeting&gt;How may I help you?

Call guy 2: Hello I is this &lt;Business name&gt;?

Ryder004: Yes how may I help you

Call guy 2: I see you have &lt;item&gt; for sale on Amazon.

Ryder004: Yes we do

Call guy 2:  Great, I need 20 of them, do you have this many?

Ryder004: Yes, we have hundreds

Call guy 2: Ok great. Can I get your address so I can calculate shipping?

Ryder004: \*Now I am getting sketched out so I start messing with him a little\* Ummm it's ok sir, we can do free shipping. No need to calculate anything.

Call guy 2:  Are you sure? Because according to Amazon, I have to pay X amount in freight.

Ryder004: Ya but don't order from Amazon, call here directly and I will give you free shipping.

Call guy 2:  OK great. May I have your name?

Ryder004: \*give fake name\*

Call guy 2:  And may I have your title? This is just for my notes

Ryder004:  \*give random title\*

Call guy 2:  Ok good, we will be in touch for this order.

So a few things.

1)Both calls were from a heavy Indian accent. Just like all the other phone scams

2)They had same accent, but it was not the same person at all. Very different voices in each.

3)First one called claiming to be a construction company but number came back to mens fashion in New York(I am in California)

4)Second guy called from private number

5)Second guy knew my real business name. On Amazon this is not displayed, and when I answer, I don't say the full business name. He knew the full business name somehow.

6)First guy has not emailed any product list of what he supposedly called for

7)Second guy has not been in touch to follow up on the product. If he was truly interested in this product, he would call because I gave almost $800 off by giving free shipping. If this guy does turn out to be real, I would make less than $10 on an order this big because I would be waiving freight.

So I may be thinking paranoid but it was very very clear that both callers were just trying to gather information. My first instinct was bill collectors, but I have gotten hundreds of calls from bill collectors for years, they NEVER use these kind of tactics.

Can anyone think of what this may be, or what kind of scam? I feel a little paranoid because the first one I gave all my real info as well as by businesses real info.",finance
personalfinance,What type of account should I use?,"I am heading into college this year, and have some money (a little over $1000) saved up from working that I don't plan on using for the foreseeable future. My parents will support me financially through college (yes, I know I am very lucky), so I would like to hold onto this small sum of money for later on, but I don't want it to lose value from sitting in the savings account it is in now.

I have considered putting it in a CD, but I would like to add onto it since I plan on working during the next few summers when I am back home from school. Is there another account I should consider that gives decent interest rates, but allows you to add on over time? I understand that this isn't a whole lot of money, so there isn't a huge difference between gaining a small amount of interest or leaving it in the savings account, but every dollar counts and I feel like this is a good way to introduce myself into investing and money management.

So, is a one year CD the way to go, that I could add to the money I make each summer and keep making new ones for a few years, or is there a better alternative? Any advice is appreciated! Thanks!",finance

btc,10 minute blocktime vs 1 minute blocktime vs 1 second blocktime: an analogy to Inflation,"I have been thinking about this blocktime suggestion from Haipo yang  [https://twitter.com/yhaiyang/status/1021699498291027968](https://twitter.com/yhaiyang/status/1021699498291027968)

It seems the biggest risk that people bring up in this discussion is related to orphans which altcoins like Ethereum experiences and which bitcoin community has debated for many years (see e.g., [https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=232297.0](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=232297.0) )

But it seems 1-2 minutes is not a significant orphan risk given the experience of, e.g., LTC. And the other points made on this issue relate to blockchain data bloat (more blocks = more data), but that is not a concern for BCH community.

One analogy I have been thinking in relation to this topic is inflation. When a central bank is conducting monetary policy they target and influence some rate of inflation by playing with the money supply. As many here probably know from reading Friedman and other economists: the quantity of money itself does not add value it just adjusts the distribution (debasing holders, benefiting receivers of new supply).  The more and more inflation you get, the more unstable the economy gets. If no inflation at all gets generated it can be a restrictive hard money supply that constricts growth. But then economists argue there is some ""sweet spot"" around 2-3% that generates an incentive to invest in the economy and not hoard money, and provides a psychological anchor for wages and consumer prices.

Reducing blocktime is like boosting inflation. If you overdo it like Ethereum you get orphan blocks left and right. If you are overly harsh and have high blocktime as some argue BCH is now, then people end up waiting hours for 6 full confirmations (setting aside the 0conf debate).  But maybe the 1-2 minutes ends up being the sweetspot that does not trigger a significant orphan risk while delivering meaningful UX gain.

Ultimately, i dont think there needs to be a change in blocktime. Because as inflation is just shifting around numbers without changing real wealth, i think changing around blocktime does not fundamentally change the underlying substance of the network and if anything can be destabilising like inflation (even if with good motives by proponents...)",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Need input on how to handle some new money in my life,"Situation:  My spouse passed away . Through various policies we've picked up along the way, I have approx. $400K in life insurance heading my way. Ignoring my mortgage, I have about $100K in debt, the result of many years of decisions, good and bad, made by my spouse and I. We had always told the other,  ""if something happens to me, use the funds to pay off the debt!"". Its credit cards, some bills, student loans, etc. The bill collectors haven't been calling YET, but I have a feeling they are not far off.   


Dealing with life insurance companies has been a major pain. ""We misspelled your name, sorry, start over"". ""We never received your paperwork, start over"", etc. One of them has paid me, and I have $100K sitting in an EFT right now, earning 3.5% annually.   


I am tempted to access this $100K, write a bunch of checks, and in the span of an afternoon, have myself out of every dime of non-mortgage debt, stuff that has been dragging at me for years. The downside is, if I do that, I give up that guaranteed 3.5% a year.   


Should I act NOW, like...this weekend, paying off my non-secured debt with this new influx of funds OR do I wait for the checks from the other insurance companies, which will eventually be deposited into my bank account at paltry interest rates? These funds will eventually be set up as an emergency fund (6 months of expenses, maybe 9), and the rest invested somehow (Vanguard or similar).   


I'm writing this on Friday...by Monday, I could be debt free (mortgage ignored). I need some advice from dis-interested parties please.",finance

Would putting more each month at first reduce the amount it increases by if I did the graduated plan? I just don't want my minimum to be too high, I'd rather it be low and I just choose to put more towards it. For my Parent Plus loan my minimum would be much higher, I think it's around $300-$400 for either plan since it's based off my parents income and not mine...

We spent almost all of it in paying off a lot of debt. And we are close to debt free. Knowing that we will have to pay taxes on that income next year I changed both of our tax withholding from 01 to 00 through our employer. Just to have more taxes taken out throughout the year.

personalfinance,Help with inheritance,"I received a 100K inheritance recently and am trying to figure out how to best utilize it to both help pay down some debts and/or invest so it's not just sitting in a savings account! Here's some info:

personalfinance,Help Paying Off Student Loans,"So I just graduated from college, and have started to realize just how much student loans i have. In short, about 80k in Parent Plus Loans (6.8% interest) and 20k (4.5% interest) in federally subsidized student loans. I was fortunate enough to land a job which will pay me roughly 145k my first year (i got really lucky and landed a gig in high finance). Right now, I am wondering how I should structure my payment plan to get rid of all this debt as quick as possible. I will be living in NYC, so after taxes my take home income will be around 95k. I am planning on living rather cheaply, and will most likely be spending a maximum of $1500 a month on housing.   


I had a few questions about paying off my loans. Should I re-finance the Parent Plus Loans to put them under my name? Or is it better for me to just sign on as a payer and make payments in lieu of my parents. Also which loans should I pay off first? Should I tackle the 20k loans or the 80k in parent plus? And beyond that, how much of my discretionary income should I use to pay off my loans? My initial plan was to basically pour all of my discretionary income into paying off my loans. However, that seems a bit too aggressive. I want to have some savings and I want to enjoy myself a bit.   


I am completely lost on what the right approach should be. Most of my friends are in a similar boat and my parents don't have the best track record financially speaking. So I thought here would be the best place to ask. I really want to get rid of this debt, while still being able to enjoy my first few years out of college.

personalfinance,Car financing question,"So after an accident I am in the business of purchasing a car. After jumping through the hoops with my insurance company I will be receiving a shade under $8000 for a replacement. They have told me the check will be delivered to me in 3-5 days from yesterday, so I am going on the assumption I will receive the check on this upcoming Friday. The problem is I need a vehicle for Monday. I have been doing some looking and found a perfect replacement, which after taxes and fees will cost me a little over $8200. I have no problem covering the difference between what I will get from insurance and the final total of the car. The problem is that because I do not have the check yet and obviously the dealer will not take a post-dated check from me I am looking at two options in order to get the car.

The first is asking a few family members for the money and paying them back as soon as I get the check on Friday. That is the first plan, however if that does not work I have a backup which is why I am coming to you for advice.

Would it be a mistake to finance the vehicle, put a little more than the difference between the insurance check and the final cost down as the down payment, and then just pay off the rest of the loan in full on Friday when I receive the check? This is obviously contingent on getting a deal with a bank that does not have any pre-payment penalties. But in a world where I am able to secure financing without any such penalty is there a downside to this plan? I have to imagine the amount of interest that would accrue over the next week or so is negligible, even with a high interest rate which I am expecting due to the age of the vehicle (2009). But I can't find a reason not to do this because I am guaranteed to have the money to pay it off as soon as the check arrives. However this is not my area of expertise and I would not be surprised if there is a part of this I am overlooking.",finance
personalfinance,Looking to pay of my debt to raise my credit score,"Right now I am looking to pay off some debt to raise my credit score. My current credit score is around 600.  A little background, I was involved in a car accident late June and received $6800 for car (totaled). My parents (who I love dearly) are letting me use their car till I need. My plan is to borrow it till April of 2019. Here is where my financial question comes in. I currently have to major bills I need to pay off: a) credit card with $8300 left and an interest rate of 19.49% and b) a loan for a water treatment system with $2500 left and an interest rate of 17.99%. I also have 2 medical bills through the hospital and ambulance where I am paying a combined $155 a month but no interest and I have not seen them come up on my credit score. These will be paid off by April of 2019.  

Each month I typically $1000 - $1200 left after all bills are paid. I usually spend $400 in groceries and my gas cost may be up to $350. Gas I will not be able to cut down just based on my job but I am going to try to cut down my groceries to about $250. I know it doesn't leave a whole lot left but I am able to make. I am also going to look cut off some other cost and see where I can save some money on bills based on discounts.  

My plan is to use  $4800 of the $6800 to pay of some of the debt. I want to keep some money in case of emergencies. I would put $3300 toward the credit card and $1500 toward the water loan treatment system. That would put but me down $5000 on the credit card and $1000 toward the other loan. Then I would pay $350 a month toward the credit card and $150 toward the other loan. This would have both loans paid off by April 2019.

My question are 1) does this seem like a good plan (if not what changes would you make) and 2) would I be able to get my credit score up to around 675 by April 2019? I know any extra money I have come in monthly use that toward the loans. I would like to save about $2000-$3000 for a car down payment. 

Please be honest. If you think this is the dumbest idea in the world say so. Any changes or thoughts, or any other way to help pay off these loans let me know.",finance
personalfinance,Please help me understand the consequences from withdrawing from 401k early!,"Hello friends. I left my employer after 3 years and found a better job. I have a vested balance of ~$10,000 401k from my former employer. From what I've read on the sidebar and a few posts, the smartest decision would be to roll over to an IRA or to my new employer if they allow it.

I know that I don't have any state federal tax in Texas. If I withdraw early, do I pay that 15% in addition to the 10% penalty as soon as I get it? Or do I pay it when tax income arrives? Will this only effect my tax income for the following year? Or is it something that will effect my tax income year after year? 

I apologize again if this has been asked a million times. I've searched a few things in the search bar and read the FAQS on the sidebar, but I have trouble finding the answer. Any additional information is greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,Create budget - check; Debt strategy?,"Hello,

I recently (very recently) set up a ""Budget"" for myself (family of 4).  I took 7 months of checking account statements, classed each row in each of the months to a specific budget category and then used Excel to identify what the average per month is per category, as well as the highs and lows for each category over the course of the time period.

Immediately I've identified where we have room to improve in terms of over-spending.  Not much can be done about the fixed costs (i.e. mortgage, gas for commuting, daycare, etc), but eating out, groceries, beer, entertainment... all the discretionary categories can likely come down cumulatively by about 700 per month.  

We have about 20k in credit card debt.  I think there are 3 cards, one two with zero interest, and one with a normal/average interest rate.  

Question - as I go through the next month, stick to my budget, and free up excess cash flow, how/where should I apply the ""profit.""

Ideally, I would like to be credit card debt free.  My assumption is that I should apply 100% of the extra money to extra credit card payments, starting with the higher interest rate card and working down.  Should I be saving any of this extra money (we have always been paycheck to paycheck and I'm at the start of turning around our financial situation)?  Or should all my extra cash go to the credit cards until they're done?

I'm reading through [budgetsaresexy.com](https://budgetsaresexy.com) and will likely come across info related to this, but if anyone has any info on concepts to focus on or feedback as to whether my strategy is correct, I'm all ears.

Thanks!",finance

I have been a subscriber/lurker for a long time now and I thought I would finally make my first contribution to the sub. Full disclosure, my goal for this post is two-fold. First and foremost, I hope that this post can serve as some sort of inspiration for someone or, at the very least, provide some sort of value. Second, maybe someone more experienced than I can give me some pointers.

Full disclaimer, I'm don't consider myself to be an expert at investing or finance. I'm just a guy who a) has always found it to be more fun to stash my money than spend it, b) believes people have a hyper-inflated and misguided expectation of what they need to be happy/content, and c) doesn't really want to be a slave to the dollar my whole life.

So I thought it would be fun to share my story up until this point.

**Background**

I grew up in the Pacific Northwest, lower-middle class. Mom was a single mother of three. No inheritance, no money for allowance. I jut had to get a job if I wanted money. So I did. I was always fascinated by technology so I ended up eventually landing a job at a laptop repair store after working various other jobs from lawn care to restaurants.

I think my mother did a remarkable job and prioritizing where her limited budget went. We always had quality food to eat, we were always warm, and we all had the opportunity to pursue higher-education; a privilege I will forever be grateful for. We still had to pay for it later but she made sure we knew it was an option.

I went to college and ended up getting a job in Software Development.

I would love to hear some opinions about it.
___
**Notes on Expenses**

I have always been shocked by the few colleagues I know who are living paycheck to paycheck. It absolutely amazes me how a single person with no dependents in the technology industry could possibly manage to spend all that money. Most people just have a bloated expectation of what they need to be happy.

Some months I live off less than $1,000 for the whole month but I don't feel like I am living an abnormally frugally lifestyle. Some months I spend more like $1,500. Last month I spent a little under $1,200.

Here is a list of things that I have found to be incredibly helpful for me:

* **Food:** The vast vast majority of the eating I do is food that I have cooked at home or food from work. In addition to being expensive, the food is just terrible for you when you eat out. I also don't eat meat so I don't really have a lot of options for eating out; particularly where I live. My food and beverage budget would probably be far lower if I didn't go out for drinks so much. I value social time and I enjoy drinking.
* **Transportation:** I ride my bike to work. The metro system is also quite good where I live and it's only about a buck to ride it as far as you want. If the metro doesn't run where I need to go, Uber is also quite cheap.
* **Work Perks:** I take full advantage of every perk my work has to offer. We have catered lunch and free self-serve breakfast. We have free coffee and beer. It always blows my mind when people go out to eat anyway. My work allows me to expense my cell phone bill. If I work asks me to expense something, I gladly do it so I can get cash back on my credit card. Last month, I expensed 5 laptops for my team and got $180 in travel credit on my Chase Reserve card.
* **Research:** When I do decide to buy something, I actually do some research instead of just dropping and absurd amount on the first deal that comes along. When I was paying for my cell phone bill last year, I ended up signing up for Google Fi and paying like $35-50 a month internationally by just not using a ton of data while no on WiFi networks. Really not that hard of a habit to get into. On the topic of research, I would also note that well-research and cheap aren't always hand-in-hand. I would rather buy one good jacket that lasts me five years than 5 shit ones that last me one year each.
* **Accommodations**: I rent flats with other people. I enjoy living with others. This tip clearly isn't for everyone.
* **Credit Card Perks**: I only buy things on credit cards and pay them off at the end of every month. It's free money. A lot of credit cards also have other great perks that saves you even more money like free food in airports.
* **Location:** I have found living out of the country to be cheaper but not that much cheaper where I live. I'm in one of the more expensive area in South America. This tip clearly isn't for everyone.
* I found that selling all my stuff when I left the United States really helped me break out of a consumer mindset. I no longer mindlessly buy material objects. When I buy things, I ask myself the following questions:
   * Is this object going to save me money? I have no issue buying a coffee maker for $100 or even $300 is it means I'm not going buy coffee everyday at Starbucks. I have no issue buying a more expensive laptop if it's going to increase my productivity at work and lead to more money.
   * Is this object going to raise my standard of living in a way I care about? For me these are things like a decent quality produce, a yoga mat, a good jacket, bed, or office chair.
   * Is this object going to stimulate my brain? For me these are things like books, art, classes, and music. You'll notice that I have a whole category in my expenses for continued education. That's because it's a thing of value to me.
   * Is this object going to improve my relationship with people I care about? For me this includes things like going out for drinks. Social interaction is important to me.
   * Is this a hobby or passion that truly makes me happy? I have been a long-time skateboarder and, if my skateboard breaks, I will buy a new one without even thinking about it. Instead of having a ton of hobbies that I am sort-of into I have a few hobbies that I am really into.

I don't think these guidelines are for everyone. Maybe not even for the majority of people. My point is that, if you can identify what's important to you, then you can set rules that you can use to determine how/when you want to spend your money.

I would love to hear your thoughts on this stuff because it's incredibly interesting to me.

**Regrets &amp; Staying the Course**

Everyone just wants to get rich quick. At one point I was up to $60k in crypto. Now I have less than $20k. I play poker games. I put money into individual stocks even though I hardly know what I am doing. Deep down I know that my best chance is staying the course. As you can see from my monthly plan, I am still planning on diversifying into these other high-risk areas a bit but I'm not going to let it ruin my chances of an almost sure-thing. Remember, there's a reason this approach is so popular. It's because it works.
___
**Final Words**

The last thing I want to touch on here is around depression. I know a lot of us are in offices. I sit in one every day and I see what it does to people. Instead of looking towards a future where we don't let money guide our decisions, we need to remember that we are in control of our decisions now. It doesn't have to suck along the way and this goal isn't worth your mental and physical well-being. Don't be afraid to make a change. You can take a pay cut to get out of a situation you hate or completely pivot your career without giving up this dream. Don't be afraid to alter your plan in exchange for a healthy mental state.

personalfinance,Cash out refi to pay debt?,"20k in debt on a personal line of credit at 7.xx%.  I have about 150k equity in my house with a current 30 year 210k mortgage 4%. I’m 5 years into this.

Refi rates are above 4% but was considering moving to a 15 or 20 year Loan and taking about 30k out with the refi. Takes care of debt and a few things we want to fix up around the house.

We’re about a 150k family income. Only debt is the personal line of credit. Credit cards paid off monthly, no car loans, etc. preschool is 650 a month and the kids will be in kindergarten in 2019 so that will be a chunk of change back in our pocket.

We haven’t added to our debt in the last two years but outside of my yearly bonus (8-10k after tax and most of it goes to this) were not paying down our debt that fast. Probably 2-300/month extra.

Just wondering if I keep at it, plugging small chunks + 2 years of bonuses to be done or does a cash out refi make sense?  The fact that I’d have a higher interest rate makes me think this is a clear NO.",finance

I just finished nursing school. I got hired immediately into a hospital. Right now, the way im seeing this, is that Ill be making roughly 3-4k a month. This is a big range, because im bringing home after taxes on the first few checks about 1500-1600/bi-weekly.  Im switching to nights (this is what im originally offered, but im currently training on days), so this amount will be close to 2k after night differential. This is just for 40 hours. Anything after 40 hours, is payed a time and a half, and there is not a limit of pick up shifts. 

So down to my finances. I currently have 4.5k in CC debt on Chase slate card(9k limit), about 700 on paypal credit, and about 1.5k in student loan. So roughly 7k overall. I have ZERO savings. Nursing school and part time work ate up everything. 

Now to the good stuff, My wife and I have no car payments, I pay no rent. We've been living in one of her father's rental homes for the past 5 years. Good people, they dont ask for anything. So I dont have to worry about that.

Car Insurance: $70 monthly
Health insurance (offered from employer): $420 monthly for me, wife, and son
Hulu: $10
Internet: $86
Electricity: ~$120
Misc: $100
My wife picks up everything else as far as recreational activities which include, going out, son's soccer and jiujitsu classes, Pre-school, cell phones, car insurance (im switching her over to mine this month). 
So far, everything we pay is sorta split 50/50. 

We plan on building as soon as possible on those 5 acres, but before that, I need to pay down all my debt. I really want to enjoy a bit of time for us, maybe a vacation (We never did our honeymoon, because we had a small destination wedding in Destin, Florida only with the immediate family, and then the next day after we came home, I started nursing school.), so somewhere in this, I want to be able to treat her to one because I never got the chance to do it. 

Interest rate is killing me. 25.99% or around there. So this brings me to my question. Should I get a debt consolidation loan to bring in all my debt into 1? Last time I checked my credit, It was about 740. Is there other options that I wont just dump money on the interest?",finance

Ive been on this subreddit for a few years now and the one thing that always stood out to me is that I should be applying for federal loans, however as Im doing research for those it seems that FAFSA is the only way to acquire those and I was only eligible for a measly 2.5k a year, which seems incredibly low considering what my parents make.

However, I've realized this is very tax inefficient, compared to an ETF. The interest is taxed at my marginal tax rate (rather than a long term capital gains tax rate), regardless of how long I've had the money in the account. Since the interest is paid monthly, I have to realize the gain every tax year, rather than letting it compound tax free and paying taxes down the road at a future date. Finally, since the interest is considered ""interest income"" rather than ""capital gains"" I am not able to offset an indefinite amount of these gains with capital losses harvested from Wealthfront. 

Any suggestions for something that is more tax efficient, has a similar return to current savings account rates, is very low risk, and it's subject to volatility when interest rates fall. 

I've thought about something like SCHP, Schwab's ETF of TIPS (Treasury Inflation Protected Securities) but even that has had [negative returns](https://imgur.com/a/GaUSPB0) over periods of ~1 year when interest rates drop and most (if not all) of the gains will be distributed as dividends, which are a little more tax efficient than interest, but not terribly so.

Does what I'm looking for exist? Is there an ETF that just holds CDs and savings accounts, and reinvests profits rather distributing them for tax efficiency?",finance

personalfinance,How to avoid credit score drop when selling a house?,"I'm getting ready to sell a house and move to a new city.

I know once we sell the house, my credit score will take a hit because my credit mix will be low, and my number of open accounts will be few.

I know my credit score will go down, because when I paid off a car loan last time it dropped nearly 20 points... I was shocked... I'm trying to avoid that.

Other than the mortgage I have no debt, and a single credit card I never pay interest on.
No auto loans, no student loans.

I will list the house in a couple weeks.

**Is there any way I can minimize the hit to my credit?**

**I just realized that when we go to buy a house in new city that our interest rates might not be as nice because we could actually drop into a lower credit score due to selling our current home.**

Financial

I never really considered how owning a house ties up a TON of your wealth into one thing, and reduces your ability to invest in much better performing assets.  I was very lucky to buy when I did in this area, however I don't get any financial benefit unless I sell, unlike if I had gone the stock market route I'd have $63,296 in liquid high-performing assets vs $78,362.79 in non-performing, inaccessible cash.

I always thought owning a house was much better than renting from a financial sense, and I thought I played this really well, but looking at the numbers, if the housing market was normal (1-4% gains each year) I would have not only made less money, but also that money wouldn't be accessible.  Something to consider on top of the ""unexpected costs"" of repairs + the ""expected"" extra maintenance costs.

Also, I probably should not have made extra payments beyond getting to 20% down, with only a 3.375% interest rate.  I plan to make only the minimum $900 mortgage payment from now on, especially with my bank account giving me like 1.7%.

Lifestyle

Money aside, I enjoy having a place to call home.  In the end it's a lifestyle choice I suppose.  Nowadays with the prices up I'd still probably buy a house knowing it would very likely cost me in the long run, just because I like the privacy and autonomy of having my own place plus 1BR is too small for my boyfriend and I.


Anyway, hopefully this is interesting to see a complete example of the numbers behind home ownership.

personalfinance,Newlyweds looking for advice on how to move forward,"Hey PF, 
I have been lurking here for a while and have really appreciated all the great advice on here. I am hoping you guys can help my husband and I figure out how to move forward financially. 

We are both 33, recently moved to Denver, and are hoping to buy a home early 2019. We have both made some terrible financial decisions in the past but over the past few months we were able to pay off a significant amount of old debts (credit cards and medical bills) to collectors and would like to make more solid decisions about our finances moving forward. Our combined income is $140k. We don’t have any students loans. We have ~$2500 in credit card debt that is on track to be paid off by the end of August. We got rid of his car and currently share mine, I owe ~16k on that still. No other debt. We are cleaning up our credit scores (mine is 653 and his is 570) by using and making timely payments on the credit cards. Our monthly take home is around $8k. Rent and bills equal $3k. $2k has been going towards paying off debt and now the credit cards. $800 towards groceries/toiletries etc. $350 a month goes towards paying off a personal loan from my parents. And the remainder is being put into a saving account; so far we have saved $10k for an emergency fund. I have a retirement plan through work, he has a 401k through his where his employer matches up to 3%. 

Come the end of August we will have about $2000 “extra” that we want to put to good use. So here are our questions: 
1. Should we get a Roth IRA and put extra money there?
2. Should we start an investment portfolio? 
3. The housing market in Denver is nuts and everyone says its better to buy now before interest rates rise. But we don’t have anything saved up for that. We pay $1800 in rent now and would rather put that towards a mortgage but is it wiser to wait another year and save up the 20% down payment or bite the bullet and use the 10k (and not have an emergency fund)?
4. We are going to talk to a financial planner on Tuesday through our local credit union. What kind of questions should we be asking her (besides these) and what are some red flags to look out for to make sure she doesn’t take advantage of our financial naivete? 
5. Any other advice?

I really appreciate any feedback at all from you, we really don’t want to make any more poor decisions financially! Thanks in advance for taking the time to help!",finance

My interest rate is 6.875% and I want to refinance but I'm not sure it's the right call.,I can't renegotiate payments because I theoretically make too much money.

short term 1 year tbills have rapidly risen in yield and currently yield \~ 2.4%. 6mo tbills yield \~ 2.1%. For comparison in January 2015 the yield was .25% on 1 year tbill [https://ycharts.com/indicators/1\_year\_treasury\_rate](https://ycharts.com/indicators/1_year_treasury_rate) so it is very recent that tbills have become a viable alternative to bond funds.   

It seems attractive right now to place 100% of bond investments into individually purchased tbills ranging from 6mo to 1year maturities. 0 risk of losing my money with a yield almost as good as BND.

personalfinance,Allocation Advice,"Hello guys,

I have a general idea of what my financial goals are, but I am not sure on the order in which I should complete them. I graduated from college with an engineering degree two years ago and got a full time job in my field one year ago. I have massive student loan debt, most of which is in my parents name under federal Parent Plus Loans. I have a job in a cyclical industry, so there is mass hiring and pay increases during the good times and mass layoffs and pay cuts during the bad times. The outlook for the foreseeable future is looking good (knock on wood). My main objectives are:

* Pay off CC debt
* Buy a house
* Pay off student loans
* Build nest egg/investments

My parents have a very low income so they qualify for income contingent repayments on the parent plus loan (the 25 year forgiveness plan) which is why the payments are so low. On the plan, interest keeps building behind the scenes but is not compounded upon. They insist on me saving up for a house before I begin large payments on the parent plus loan. They want to see me set up financially before I worry about paying off the loan in their name. I feel like I need to decide soon whether I am going to attack the loan aggressively or pay minimum payments on it until student loan forgiveness kicks in. Regardless of what my parents say, I feel guilty leaving all that debt in their name even if I am paying it off every month. 

At this point my company provides my housing for me. I am on a 2 week on, 1 week off schedule. I can stay in the house they pay for on my days off or use that time to travel. As of now I am alternating between 1 week off in town, 1 week off visiting family, 1 week off in town, 1 week off traveling, then back to 1 week off in town. All extra money after bills and leisure is throw at cc debt and student loans. Total debt has been reduced by $30k so far over the course of a year. 

My question pretty much comes down to this: what timeline am I looking at for the above 4 goals and how much should I be allocating towards each? A summary of my finances is below. All advice/criticism is welcome.

personalfinance,Need some advice on where to put this extra money from my new job.,"Hello PF, have an advice/decision question. I started a new job recently where I’m making a good bit of money that I want to put mostly towards debt and savings. This is probably going to be a long post, but please bear with me.

My sister wants to sell her car, and knows I’ve been looking for a work car. She wants to sell it for $2k. I don’t absolutely need this car, but I would like to ease off the miles I’m putting on the new car I got in September, which now has almost 25k miles on it (I have a long commute to pretty much anywhere). 

I checked my budget, and I have about $1,800 I could put towards her car if she would sell it to me. However, that almost cleans out all my savings, and I would really rather keep that safety net right now of savings of about $800. I put 10% of every paycheck into my savings, so it is growing, even if slowly. I hope to increase that percentage soon.

Another reason I’m backing off of buying my sister’s car is that I have a project car that I’d like to fix ASAP. I wouldn’t have a need/want for my sister’s car if I can get my other car running. A new motor for the project would cost as much as it would cost me to buy her car. This isn’t considering what other things the project would need, though, as I had other issues besides just the motor when it finally failed on me.

Further, I have some debts that I would really like to pay down ASAP. Other than the two most major debts I have, my student loans and my car note, I have a couple credit cards and a small personal loan from about a year ago. The credit cards are each about $2k right now (about $4k total), and the loan has about $1k left on it (started as $2k). One of my credit cards is in an interest rate free time period.

Because of these factors, I’ve basically already decided not to buy my sister’s car. However, I’m still not sure what is the best option is for at least the extra $1k I’ll have at the end of the month. I want to put it towards my precious car, but I know paying down debts right now would probably be the more intelligent option.

TL;DR: I have an extra $1-2k that I want to either put into “instant gratification” of fixing my project car, or put it towards some debt. What would be the best option?",finance

personalfinance,"I need help immediately. I've been scammed out of $2,400 and need to figure out the next course of action","Alright, I'll start from the beginning. I live in LA and I was in the process of looking for a new job on indeed. I applied for this digital marketing company called d.e. Foxx and associates, which appeared to be a legitimate business, so after a day or two I got an email from them saying that they were no longer looking to fill the position I applied for but gave me the name of an associate that might be looking for help. I sent my resume to the e-mail address and was put in touch with a woman named ""Sandra Mccann"" who told me that she was looking for a personal assistant to help her with the day to day management of her personal schedule, booking travel, shopping, etc. and the pay was going to be $780 a week with health insurance and 401k. She told me she believed my credentials would make me a good candidate for the job and offered me the position via e-mail. She told me that she is a retired real estate attorney and that she owns investment properties all over the world, so she was currently out on business in Toronto but needed me to start doing things for her before she got back. The first thing she asked me to do in addition to planning her flight back to LA was to deposit a check that she overnighted to me in the mail for $2,480.00 . I got this check from a company called Meyer's RV Superstores in Churchville, NY signed by a guy named Mark Calzone. The store has a phone number and website and everything, so I called and asked to speak with Mark Calzone but was turned over to voicemail. I decided to deposit the check anyways. Once I deposited the check and received the funds in my account, she told me that she needed to ""pay off a premium she owed"" to Silvergray services (a non-existant business) in Richardson, TX to an address that was actually in hindsight the address of a Comerica Bank. I still have the address and the suite number, so I'll try following up with them tomorrow as well and seeing if they have any video footage of who signed for the package. I took out three money orders, two for $1,000 and one for $300 and sent them to the address with the receipt of purchase to the address via Fedex overnight for $97. She told me to leave the money orders blank to avoid errors in the deposit. I thought nothing of it and got on the phone with my mom, excitedly telling her that I just landed a new position and put my two weeks notice in at my job. After I told her what had just happened, she was like dude, are you a fucking idiot? You literally just got scammed out of $2,400. She scared the fuck out of me and so I got on the phone with Bank of America to report fraud and see what I could do on my end. They basically told me that checks will clear after the initial deposit, but once the bank tries to collect the money from the account number on the check and the funds aren't there, it will bounce and I'll be down the money that I purchased on the money orders money. They gave me the number to the department of fraud which I plan on following up with tommorow. Seems like theres a slim possibility of getting this money back. I transferred all of the money I have in my bank account which is only enough to pay rent to a friend of mine so that I could make rent for this month. 

I called Fedex and gave them the tracking number, and the package was delivered and signed for by an ""S. Smith"" so I'm assuming that the money order has been cashed out and I don't have the receipt for because sent with the money orders. The check hasn't bounced yet and I still have my money, but I'm just trying to figure out what my next course of action is to try and get this money back. I mean I just can't understand why the bank would clear a check and make funds available to me without physically making sure that those funds were available in the other person's account. Maybe I can make a case for myself that way. I have friends telling me to liquidate my account and close it before it goes negative, which I think would fuck me up even harder if I had cops knocking on my door. I think the best course of action is to try and settle it with the bank and figure out what my options are, but I zelled my friend all the money in my account today and the transaction is still processing, so once they figure out what's going on they might take the money back from him and slap me with a negative $-800 balance which will anally fuck me. 

I'm looking for any general suggestions and advice here. If I go negative, I need a way to take out a personal loan or at least start paying that shit off in bits and pieces with bank of america before my social security number gets flagged and i can't open up another bank account to cash out my paychecks from work and continue to pay my bills.

This means nothing to most people, but basically I have a very specific set of skills.  I would say maybe I'm a relative expert in my field, even compared to most veterinarians.  I am plenty busy enough with my ""real job"", but wonder how to get my name out for consulting or side jobs.  What websites are legit for posting info, connecting with other professionals, advertising your skills?  For example, how does a renowned neurosurgeon get asked to consult on important cases?  Basically just get famous enough that people ask for you, you don't even have to advertise?

How does one get involved with telecommunications/telemedicine, consulting?  If you were an expert in your field, how would you use that to make more money?  This could be any occupation, such as an engineer, MD, anything.

Is there a better spot to ask this?",finance
personalfinance,Suggestions for budgeting software with a specific feature?,"OK, so I am looking to tighten up on the amount of money I waste every month so I can maximize my savings. I can save around $1000 a month or better if I can control wasteful spending like eating out or spending 3 days building an Amazon cart and then checking out with it. Right now, I am saving $600 or so a month, so I am wasting around $400 to $500 this way.

Anyway, what I would like to have is a program for PC that can connect with my bank account and import all my transactions automatically, but ALSO let me split my money into virtual accounts. I would like to be able to get paid and deposit it all into my checking account but then on my PC, I could go in and say OK, so this much of my check  goes to the virtual savings account, and then from that point on, when I opened the program, it would update my transactions and whatnot, but subtract them from checking, but there would actually be that amount plus all my savings in the checking account. It would just show them separately in the software. I hope that made sense.

You may wonder why I don't just make an actual checking account and do this  that way, and the reason is I would lose the good interest rate I get from checking. As long as I meet a few qualifications (I forgot what they all are, stuff like maintain a $1000 min. balance, use the debit card once a month, do at least one direct bill pay) I get an interest rate of 2.25%. That only works out to less than $15 a month, but it's free money and $15 is $15, so I just don't feel right about having money in the bank that could be drawing a better interest rate and isn't.

I think Quicken has this feature? I dated a lady like 8 years ago that used Quicken to do this, I believe, but I was looking for something a little more toned down. I don't think I need anything as robust as Quicken. I don't have investments really, other than a few thousand in cryptocurrency, and all my other finances are straightforward enough that I don't feel like I need all that.

If anybody has any suggestions or just suggestions in general, that would be appreciated. I don't mind paying for software, since I think it would be a good investment if it helps me save an extra $400 or so a month.",finance
personalfinance,Best lender to borrow $5300 from as a personal loan?,"Hey there PF! I want to borrow $5300 for a postgraduate certificate program.

Here are some stats:

- I'm 22/M

- Salary of $27.5k

- DTI of 15.4% or 31.1% if you count monthly rent

- FICO (Experian) score of 720-740

- Credit history of 3 years 2 months, with average age of accounts 1 year 7 months. 

- 8 Hard inquiries in the last 2 years, 5 in the last year (thanks /r/churning)

Does anyone know of a good place to look, or if I even have much of a chance with these variables? The program that I would be applying to is not eligible for federal student loans because it's a certificate instead of a degree. Maybe private student loans?",finance

I get into a golf cart after looting, pick up my squad, and drifed off to dusty. My squad saw enemys, so I try to get out while my squad was dying one by one and im helpless. I tried to flip the cart, but of course I couldn't build and I didn't want to get too close to the fight but id die. Tried to break it, took too long. So I said fucking, ill go to the gun fight and find a ramp to flip my cart. What do you know, I get out.

business,Deception Detection Ability Survey,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently conducting research for my honours thesis and would really appreciate your participation in this anonymous survey looking at deception detection ability of individuals (especially those with experience as a job interviewer).

You are invited to participate in the following academic research project conducted by researchers within the Faculty of Health at Federation University.

The aim of this study is to examine differences in deception detection ability of experienced job interviewers compared to laypeople with no interviewer experience. This study will also examine beliefs held by these groups regarding cues of deception.

Participation in this research involves completing an online survey, which is expected to take between 10 to 15 minutes to complete. In this survey, you will be required to answer some standard demographic questions including age, gender, language, education and employment information. You will be required to identify any prior experience you have in conducting employment interviews, if any, as well as respond to questions regarding your beliefs about cues of deception exhibited by people lying. You will finally be required to watch three video clips of mock interviewees answering two standard job interview questions and one opinion question, subsequently judging if their responses are truthful or non-truthful

If you decide you would like to participate in this study, please ensure that you have a reliable Internet connection and are in a quiet and comfortable space. As stated above, you will be required to watch three video clips of mock interviewees answering typical job interview questions. Therefore, prior to commencing the survey, please ensure you are able to clearly see and hear video clips on your computer and you are able to complete the survey uninterrupted.

By opening the survey link below, you will be provided with further information on the study, including contact information of researchers involved.

Thank you for your participation

The rental is currently occupied and cash flows right under $300 per month.  Between the two houses we owe roughly 240k with about 15k of equity.  The rental has an interest rate of 5.7% and there's 77k left on the mortgage.  Most of the equity is built in that house, as we put 15% down.  The house we live in has a much lower rate (3.8%) and we didn't put any money down.  The only other debt we have is our two cars.  Car #1 15k @ 5.9% - Car #2 (leased) we're halfway through the term of the lease, so in a year and a half we will have to option of walking away, or buying the car for 16k.  We have about 85k invested in mutual funds that we are hoping not to touch for long time. (kind of forgetting it's there and letting it grow) We also invest $200 a month into theses funds.  We have a couple of retirement accounts as well.

personalfinance,How to End a Wage Garnishment?,"My wages are being garnished for a federal student loan. Long story short is I didn’t know it existed, and was so inundated with requests for payment (both legitimate and scams) that I ignored it - and now here we are!  
 
They’re currently garnishing 15% of my pay each paycheck, which is coming to ~$550/month. I am able and willing to make payments, however, I’m trying to move (aka save up money) so I’d rather NOT be paying quite that much. On top of the $500/month I’m currently paying in private loans.  
  
I started making payments myself on top of the garnishment ($200/month) - naively thinking that maybe if they received payments they would stop garnishing my wages, which clearly hasn’t happened. But at least it could work in my favor now, since I can show I’ve been proactively making payments!    
  
So what are my steps now in trying to end this wage garnishment? Should I sent a validation letter at this point? I’m guessing since they were able to move forward with garnishing my wages they’ve probably sufficiently proved they have a right to the debt? Do I just sent a letter saying “hey, I’m making payments, let’s end this”? 

My loan is currently held by some collection agency, so would I be negotiating payments with them? Or do I contact the Department of Ed directly and make plans with them? 

ETA: I just realized: I’ve been sending monthly payments to the US Dept of Ed, not to the company who holds the debt and is garnishing my wages. How much of a fuck up was that? Does it change who I should be communicating with at this point?",finance

personalfinance,401(K) Loan for Home Down Payment Question,"Hey guys,

So, the long and short of it is that I’m considering taking a loan from my 401K (TSP) in order to use it for a down payment on a new house. The background is as follows:

We own our home right now but want to move to a better school district. Homes in our neighborhood are selling in 2-3 days, so I have no doubt that I can sell my home quickly. But, since the market is so hot, and it’s a seller’s market, our realtor advised us that people aren’t really considering contingent offers, meaning we will have to either sell our house first, then buy a house if we can find one (they also go fast), or we need to buy and then sell our house.  This second option doesn't give me a chance to use any of our equity towards the new house.

We’ve saved up 100K for a down payment, which is exactly 20% of the houses we’re looking at (around 500K), but we’d like to place a bit more of a down payment to lower our monthly payments. Our house currently has about 120K in equity, which will net us about 100K after closing costs. I’m aware that we can only borrow 50K from the 401K, but that’s enough.

The plan would be to borrow the 50K, buy the house with a 150K down payment, then sell our house and repay the 401K loan. The turnaround will probably be 90-120 days, more or less. So, yes, I’m aware that I’ll be losing some money in interest/appreciation while the balance is outstanding, but I think it’s worth it in order to save money on mortgage every month.

My job is steady: I’m a federal employee who’s been there 18+ years. I don’t plan on quitting or moving jobs, so I don’t think I’ll be in any trouble of having to pay it back before my house sells or of defaulting on the loan.

So, am I missing something? Is this really a bad idea but I’m fooling myself into thinking it’s not that bad?",finance

personalfinance,Still underwater 4 years later: Question about getting the most out of my 80-month car loan + a rant,"I currently drive a 2010 Honda FIT that I owe a few thousand dollars on. I'm planning to pay it all off at once soon (not in a rush, interest rate is something like 1.99%). After checking the KBB value, my car is probably worth about $6,700 if a sold it privately, $4,300 - $5,400 if I traded it in. I wouldn't be underwater if I sold it privately, but would if I traded it in.

I've had my car since April of 2014, when I was 18 years old. My dad and the salesman convinced just-out-of-high-school-for-less-than-a-year me that I needed an 80-something month loan and several other add-ons, including gap insurance and other things that drove up the cost. Basically, I've been paying for a 2010 Honda FIT that was priced $13,000 on the lot for $18,500 (total cost of the loan) that I'm probably still underwater on, considering I paid the minimum payments all throughout college because I couldn't afford it otherwise (I worked part-time in college, probably made $600 per month, car payment was $255).

I look back on it and feel I wasted THOUSANDS of dollars with this decision, and wish that I had the financial knowledge I do now about these kinds of decisions. I let the salesperson convince me that I needed this giant loan and all of these add-ons on this car I didn't even want that much. Salespeople love me -- I can't say no to them because I'm so timid and don't want to upset anybody. I let that get in the way of a very bad financial decision. 

With all of that being said... what is the most economical choice with this car? Should I just keep owning it as long as possible to make up for how much I paid? I will have paid over $18,500 total over the course of the loan -- way, way more than it's ever been worth. Would it save money in the long run if I kept it another ten years (it's currently almost a 10-year-old car now, rapidly losing value by the minute I'm sure)? Do I trade it in now for something else (I have enough money to trade this one in and put at least $6k down for another one)?",finance
personalfinance,Fixing a negative escrow balance,"My lender just completed my escrow analysis for the coming year. Due to a switch in home insurance policies, my escrow is in a negative balance--requiring me to either pay a lump sum or have my monthly payments increase for the next year. Makes sense. 

However, I have one big question: how is my lender able to ""spend"" my escrow money and ""overdraw"" the account without alerting me or preventing me from making a decision that would compound the problem? The balance is due because, according to them, law requires two months worth of money in the escrow account but yet they're allowed to put it into a negative balance?  

Here's what led to this situation:

1) My lender paid my previous policy in November 2017 for, let's say for ease of math, $1100. Supposedly this was paid out of my escrow at a time when it only had ~$375 in it. Result: negative balance. The lender then paid my property taxes in March, increasing the still-negative balance. 

2) Then I goofed (apparently). Unaware that my escrow was still negative (in spite of my monthly escrow payments), I switched insurance companies for a better policy (more coverage, less expensive premium). My lender then paid *that* policy in full, further driving my escrow into the negative. I returned a refund of my premium from the initial insurance company back to the escrow (about $400). 

3) But to remove the negative balance and have the two-month required cushion, I am still on the hook for the $1200. 

What gives? I know I am ultimately responsible for monitoring my accounts, etc. so I'm not blaming the lender. I just want to know what to do to avoid something similar in the future.",finance
personalfinance,can't get over the mental hurdle of prioritizing retirements savings over paying off debt,"I have home mortage at 3.2% and car loan at 3.75%. I have enough  in my savings from a recent bonus and will have more coming at me to erase my car loan and throw more at the house loan. 

however, I know that I am supposed to put that into retirement instead, since it will yield a higher return than my low loan interest rates. 

but I HATE having the debt. the fact that I could erase my car loan with one swipe of my checkbook and avoid the 300 dollar a month payments or pay off my house quicker really would make me happy.

personalfinance,Investment Losses as a Student (CAN),"tl;dr idiot gap year student loses a lot of money in stocks, feels stupid, unsure of how to be responsible with money without being so cheap she does dumb things like investing in dangerous plays.

Hi - I just wanted to get some advice and maybe a scolding about my situation. All values in CAD.

I'm 22, and going to be starting medical school in the fall. For the past ten months, I've worked. My income after taxes was $31,000. It's been a gap year, and I realize that my lack of direction really fucked me up.

Let's start with investing. I had $10,000 earmarked to pay my student loan off entirely, which I invested in a NASDAQ index fund in March 2017. It made me $1300 by the time I sold in September. By September, I decided I wanted to be a ""stock market"" guy and invested in ""stocks."" I bought every dumb thing and panic sold every single time. In total, I've now lost $8400, after continuing to pour my paycheque into it each month to recoup previous losses. I feel like absolute shit - and am finally selling all my holdings and taking the money ($13500) out. I feel so terrible about it, and I realize that my cheapness (I'm extremely cheap) is what made me want money more, and made me chase fast money. I've told my friends and brother, but feel guilty about ever telling my parents. When I first started losing money, I decided to move back in with my parents to save that money (which considering my rent of $850 + utilities and 8 months rent saved, would have been close to what I lost). I also picked up another job for the summer and made about $6000. I'm in the process of starting a small online business, which might also make me some money.

I still just feel like an absolute idiot, and almost want someone to scold me. I was invested in the notorious XIV (100% of my portfolio) and pulled out the day before it crashed - so in a weird way I'm thankful I didn't lose everything right there.

I've got medical school to start worrying about and paying for. I'm not in a bad spot - I'm going to an extremely affordable Canadian school. After everything (including rent, living expenses, tuition, and the government grants I'll get), I should have $26,000 in government loan debt. I saved about $22,000 this year (even after my idiotic losses.) As an aside, I've been given a $300,000 Line of Credit, which I don't intend to use unless I have to. I have a max of $38,000 of government loans (which are interest free for four years) after which I'll move whatever government debt I have to the LOC which has an interest rate at half the price.

My question is this: how shitty should I feel? What lesson should I take away from this? I'm trying to count my blessings (not losing everything in XIV for example, getting into the most affordable school I could, and learning this lesson before I did something dumb like invest my LOC into XIV or other risky positions). I know this is survivable, and because I'm not asking my parents for money now or in the future, it's not necessarily their issue. My mother would likely yell at me and tell me to stop, and I don't want to disappoint her.

I just feel idiotic. I feel like I need to stop, forgive myself, and also get over my extreme cheapness. By focusing on living happily and spending at a level to maintain a semblance of happiness, I don't think I'll strive to make money in these risky ways.",finance
personalfinance,"Getting on top of $85K OSAP (Canadian) Student loans, in default.","I'm posting this on behalf of my fiancé. I'm a little out of my comfort zone, as I'm not from Canada, so I don't know how all these systems, are meant to work. She's Canadian but this is also outside of her comfort zone.

**Personal Details**

* Recently engaged and just starting to save/plan for a wedding next year. Still working on a budget for that, at the moment.
* I'm from Europe, she's from Canada
* We both live in Australia
* Plan on buying a house/having kids in the next few years. Not in Australia, possibly in Europe, maybe even in Canada.
* I want to help her get on top of her student loans, in advance of that.
* Current savings for her and myself are about $10,000 and $45,000 , respectively. These are in term deposit accounts with an average APR of approximately 2.5%.
* She's in a very secure job, a job for life.  I'm in tech, working in a medium sized start-up, so less secure but pretty easily transferable and pays twice as much.

**Debt details**

OSAP loan has been in default since January 2015. I've pulled a credit report for her and seen that the OSAP loan (approx $70k) shows up as being transferred and closed, with no other records on the credit report around that amount. The information for this, on the credit report was 2.5 years old. There is another smaller amount (approx $20k) that is listed as being with a collections agency. I'm working under the assumption that it is the provincial part of the loan. We have rang a few different numbers, which eventually lead us back to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), who currently have the federal portion of the loan and don't seem to be able to give us any information about the provincial portion of the loan. OSAP told us, that for the loan to return to them, we would need to pay off the owed interest, with CRA and demonstrate the ability to pay 4 monthly payments. After ringing the CRA they gave us the following details.

For the federal portion of the loan, the CRA told us:

* Current Total:  $65,000
* Current Interest: $12,000
* Interest rate 6.2%
   * They also said this was approximately $8.75 per day. The math of this only checks out, if the interest is only calculated off of the total, without the cumulative interest. Is this correct? Seems like a strange method of calculating it.
   * They also said this interest is high, because the loan is in default and will lower as regular payments start to come in.

Here starts my dilemma, when we rang the CRA, they told us that we need to ring them back tomorrow and start to agree to a plan to get into the ""Rehab Program"" or else they will start raising the interest rates. Can they do that? I was just trying to find out all the relevant information. What should I do? Do I need to follow up with the CRA tomorrow, can they raise interest rates, if we don't. We're still trying to work out a budget, so we don't have a clear idea of the amount we can/are willing to pay, per month yet.

For the smaller amount, with collections, here are the details I have currently. I haven't rang them yet, for fear that they will try the same tactic as the CRA. I have more recent information, from earlier this year, on the credit report and I have some information that I've used to estimate the interest rate.

* Held by: ARO Collections
* Assigned Date: May 2015
* Reported Date: May 2018
* First Delinquent Date: Feb 2015
* Original Amount: \~ $19,000
* Reported Amount: \~20,500
* Estimated interest rate: 2.8%
   * This is based on the real numbers, @ 36 months, of interest accrual (assigned date to reported date), to get from the original amount, to the reported amount. Does this sound correct? It seems very low to me.

**Payment Plans**

As I already said, we haven't really got into this stage of the planning yet. There's a few possibilities.

* I think it's important she keeps her savings as a rainy day fund, so if there's a lump sum to be paid, it can come from mine.
* I'm wondering if it would be worth paying a lump sum, just to get out from under the CRA?
* She's pretty clear that she wants to take on the responsibility for clearing this debt herself, including looking at other income streams. I intend on matching the amount that she is paying off monthly.
* I'm intending to pay off the federal loan first, since it has got the highest interest rate.
* We may have to may smaller payments, in year 1, so we can save for the wedding, withe the intention being to ramp it up later.
* I'd prefer to negotiate repayments, based on just her ability to pay, so we're not going to run into issues, with my job security. Are there reasons this could be a bad idea?

Anyone have any tips? Anything I'm missing/not thinking of?

Thanks in advance for the help

personalfinance,401k loan to pay off debt?,"I currently have $62,000 in various debts. I pay $1,600 per month for these debts. This does not include $127,000 in student loans. This costs me an additional $975 a month. So I’m screwed, lol. My 401k allows me to take a loan against it up to $50k at less than 3% interest for a maximum 5 year term. My debt interest rates are from 7% - to my highest card at 17.4%. This 401k loan will prevent me from earning interest on the balance and on average I am earning around a 10% return. Taking that loan and paying off debt will free up about $1,600 a month but cost $800 per month to pay back over 5 years. This sounds tempting but I am nearing 40 so savings is important and 50k is about all I have in 401k so far. So I am confused. Is this a good idea? I would miss out on the compounded interest in my 401k but save a ton of interest every month being thrown away on debt. 
My thought is paying 3% is better than 7-17%. I would loose out on the interest it’s gaining, around 10-11% so I guess it would be like I am paying 14%?
When we created this problem we were young and broke, dealing with layoffs and low paying jobs. After finishing school, hence the student loan debt, we more than tripled our income but the debt we have accumulated is dragging us down. We had 13 credit cards but are now down to 2. We now live below our means but feel like this debt is dragging us down and will be around for a while if we don’t do something drastic like the 401k loan. I’d like to retire early and not be a slave to this debt.

I just received a notice that I owe for taxes from 2007. I don't have any of my tax information for that year, nor does my ex-husband (to whom I was married at the time). I'd received a similar notice about five-seven years ago and just finished paying it off three years ago. Per the IRS, they re-audited and found that we had under-payed (we didn't make much that year, so I can't imagine how we could owe this much more, let alone the first amount). All of the information I am finding online says that there are only a few reasons they can extend the time-frame to re-audit to 6 years, and very few cases in which they can re-audit indefinitely.

Edit: I've spoke with the IRS (twice now) and have ordered my tax transcripts for that year. I guess I will wait and keep my fingers crossed. Thank you all for your input!",finance

personalfinance,Cleaning up credit post divorce,"This fall will be 4 years divorced from my wife. I am now starting to get the itch of buying a house and have my credit issues off my back so I can have financial freedom.

I will start off by saying that during my divorce I was denied a bank loan of $2k. At that time, my name was still on the house loan, joint credit cards, and car loan. I didn't know that we were late on the house, car, and cars were maxed.

We divorce and I gave up the house, I took the car, and we split the credit cards. There is no financial connection to my exwife present day except for my child support. I paid off my share of the credit cards within 6 months. 

My current debts are my car loan and my credit card which I'm 25% under my credit limit. I pay rent for my condo, internet, life insurance, insurance, cell phone, and electricity. I have not been late on any of my car payments but my credit card was put on hold while I paid 2 huge payments to get it under the limit which was at the beginning of the year and I have not been late since. I have very little debt and I make roughly about $70k per year. 

Now, if I remember right, when I bought my car over a year and a half ago, my credit score wasn't the best. I don't remember the number, all I know is I'm pretty sure my interest rate reflects my monthly payment. 

I know I need to get a copy of my credit report. How do I go about that? What are ways a divorce affects credit? What hurts credit and what are ways to rebuild?

personalfinance,Should I continue leasing?,"Edit: thank you to everyone who responded quickly. I’m an idiot and I didn’t realize they won’t charge for extra mileage until the end of the lease... I still got a bad deal with the lease, but I’m a bit more happy not stressing about miles every month. 

Good morning/afternoon,

I messed up. Backstory, I recently came back from some overseas assignments with about $30k in my bank account. After marriage, buying a car, and buying a house I’m nearly living paycheck to paycheck. Luckily my wife got a new job so we are starting to settle into a better financial position. One of the biggest debts I have concern about is my car lease. I get frustrated anytime I think about it and severely regret my decision to lease in the first place. 

My lease payment is around $414 a month for a car with an MSRP of $28k (2017 VW GTI). I have been paying the lease for about 10 months and my payoff quote is $25k. The worst part that makes me cringe every time I think about it is how much money I put down. $5k plus a $1k incentive. I was chasing a low monthly payment and I didn’t have the credit history for a good enough loan. 

My biggest concerns are the money down and the mileage limit, which is 10k a year. If I was to payoff the car, that down money is factored into the payoff quote so it would disappear. If somehow I survive the entire lease (4 years by the way) would I get that money back? I put around 1500 miles on the car a month just for my work commute so I bought a beater for my wife and a motorcycle for myself. 

We absolutely love the car and I just wonder if there are any solutions that include keeping it.

personalfinance,Online checking. Atm question,"I have been using BOA as main checking and my direct deposit. I then pull a monthly set amount in to Cap360 savings I've had since it was ING.

I have 6 savings accounts at Capital one for various bills, emergency fund, etc. The monthly money from BOA is split up here.

I don't see much of a reason to keep BOA. I've had large amounts of cash a couple times in last few years and I have access to Navy Federal credit Union if I need that.

However Ally and Schwab reimbursement of ATM fees is very tempting. I don't need cash a ton but to be able to just walk up to any ATM seems nice. But the entire point if using Online checking would be to have checking/DD in same place as savings for instant transfer. So if i used Ally or Schwab I'd want to move all savings also.

ATM really not that big of a deal?",finance
personalfinance,Steps to take before purchasing a house,"Just looking for steps to take before purchasing a house. I’m about 2 years out before I’m going to seriously consider it, but I would like to take steps to make the process go smoothly and obviously get the best interest rates.",finance
personalfinance,"(TX) Any help would be appreciated, trying to get my life in order.","Thanks, in advance for the comments anything helps me out obviously. (TX)

OK, I basically would like some pointers to help me get things in order regarding my finances and I'd like to invest in myself. Get a house one day and have a nice car with a good interest rate. I feel like I'm just living and not doing much in life. Because my life's finances doesn't give me the opportunity to do so.

So to begin, I bring home $1,300 bi weekly, I recently interviewed with BOA and they suggested a potential 58% increase. I transitioned into the accounting and finance industry b/c I know that it can be quite lucrative. I currently have 4 years experience. I enjoy the work and have been passively looking for another job being that I have a very plush job now that I love. However, there is no room for advancement. The raise that they gave us this year was a whopping 2.5%.

I dont have a 401K and I'm 35 (but I need to just do it), I got a bit turned off by the match, which was 3%. I know i'm leaving money on the table. I believe that they also offer a ROTH. I've been here at my current job for 2 years.

I have a car note that I recently got modified and I have 11 months left and they lowered the payment to $259 a month and then it will be paid off. They initially (Capital one) fucked me and put in a 7 year loan with an interest rate at 15%. I slowed paid that car note and as a result my credit has suffered. I currently have a 580 as a credit score. I don't have money for a secured card (the deposit). A positive from this car note is that since it has been recently re modified drawing 0 interest. I have just about a year to make on time payments and they report it to the credit bureau every month. That will give me an opportunity to raise my credit to the 600's. The minimum credit score for a house is 618, but we'll get into that later. I would like to get a new car a year or so after paying my car off. Hopefully the new credit score and the paid off car loan on my credit will allow me to experience better terms this go round.

I attended Penn State and graduated 2011. Accumulated $106K in student loans including interest and fees to date.  I also, defaulted on these loans and got in a repayment plan with the servicer and they took the default off of my credit and it is now income driven and they barely charge me monthly, its like less than $40.

I rent, as stated I would like to get a house in two years or three years once my credit is better. I  also feel like I can't afford a house right now, but thats why I'm looking for another job as well. My current rent is $1,150. Love the place, pretty sure they are going to go up on the rent, being that I had to negotiate my current renewed lease. They tried to go up $65 they took $20 off of that suggested amount which brings it to $1,105. I calculated water etc. to got the $1,150. I'm assuming they are going to go up again I will need to figure something out.

I'd love to vacation, provide financial support for my mother whom doesn't have much and is on a fixed income. I don't have a savings, an IRA, ROTH, 401K a plan, nothing. If you guys can steer me in the corrections direction I'd really appreciate it. Maybe suggestions on budgeting, investing in myself, credit score, house buyer, please be feasible suggestions.. As you see I need help and all the wisdom that I can gather. Thank you.

I'm 25, have a 2 year daughter 3 days a week, and have a ton of student loan debt. I am starting my new career as a software developer in 2 weeks.

Income - 
$57k a year + 2 bonuses, so probably $60k a year. 
$5.8k available for benefits - anything not used here the company will pay towards my student loans. Not taken from income.

So yeah. I have been looking at refinancing my student loans but until I have a few pay stubs from my new job I can't get much refinanced. At this rate I'm looking at what, $10,000 in interest a year? Every year that goes by I owe $10k more? Seems really silly to me. 

My only real plan is to refinance in order to get rid of the highest interest rate loans and pay them down as fast as I can. My employer will pay any of my benefit money I don't use of the $5.8k towards my student loans. I'm going to probably just get medical, dental, and vision for my daughter and I and life insurance for me, then put all the rest of my benefit money to student loans.

I already live so frugally that I'm losing weight and stuff my face to make up for it whenever I visit my parent's house. 

I know my loans are the biggest priority but I would like to also start investing. I don't think I should because the rate of return is not going to be higher than any of my loans, right?",finance

My sister makes sure that she is fed, bathed, and not being physically abused (it's a nice facility, but you can never let your guard down). My grandma's account officer called me recently because she noticed that her account balance has gotten very low in the past two months. I will admit that with some recent changes made at work I have neglected to check her statements, since they get mailed to me. 

We discovered, so far, hundreds of dollars every month to scammy vehicle warranty companies, Aflac insurance, and vitamin and magazine subscriptions. I spent the whole weekend and part of today calling these companies and faxing my power of attorney to at least get someone to speak to me regarding these charges. I even spoke to my grandmother and what has been happening is that she gets calls in the evenings from cold call telemarketers selling her everything from vehicle warranties (she does not know how to drive) and male enhancement pills. She says its nice to talk to people on the phone and i reminded her that not only do we (my dad, sister, and I) text and call her daily, that she doesn't need to talk to strangers. She seemed confused that I referred to these people as strangers, since they have her cell phone number. I tried to explain how auto-dialers worked, which was a fruitless endeavor, but I digress.

I'm sitting here wondering if I can dispute these transactions and be covered by Visa's Zero-Liability policy for unauthorized transactions. Like, if my grandmother has dementia and does not really understand what is happening when she gives out her debit card number?",finance

Would it be smart for me to use the money I get from selling my car to pay off the entire cost of the 3-year lease at once in order to avoid the high interest rates? Or would I be better off investing that money and hoping my return is higher than than the interest rate on my lease?

CryptoCurrency,CryptoConfessions! CMO of GAME Credits confesses insider details of a $50m ICO scam!,"Original Post: https://np.reddit.com/r/GameCredits/comments/92warz/jack_kuveke_july_30th_transparency_ama/

-------


&gt; Hi everyone, this is going to be the thread where I will answer as many questions as possible about GameCredits/MobileGo. As many of you know there have been ongoing changes at the organization. I would like to provide a summary of what is happening before I jump into the AMA:

&gt; As many of you know, I’ve been working for GameCredits since October of 2016. At the time I was one of the first 10 members on the team, and had been a community member for about 6 months prior to that. I joined the team because I always believed in the idea of GameCredits being a universal currency for the gaming industry. However, since the MobileGo crowdsale which ended around June 1st of 2017, things have been changing for the organization.

&gt; To begin with, the Sholom brothers Sergey and Maxim took over as CEO and ‘Product Director/Financial Director’ (in actuality Maxim has acted much like a CFO, managing the finances for the company). Sergey and Max decided to put Alex Migitko as the COO, and Alex appointed his own CTO named Nikola Djokic. These executives began expanding the team quickly. Into the late Summer/ Fall of 2017 (August-September), they realized that their applications wouldn’t be ready to go to market, so the original roadmap was pushed back. At the same time they launched the idea of GNation, which was to be a gaming brand to help the cryptocurrencies get partnerships without being labeled 100% crypto focused. In this same period Sergey and Maxim began traveling extensively, and would only come to the Belgrade headquarters for a couple days at a time leaving the company in the hands of Alex and Nikola.

&gt; In April of 2018, a faction of developers came forward and said that Alex and Nikola weren’t doing a proper job. Alex had created a number of side projects such as Blinking, a crypto wallet management application called Prometheus, a crowdfunding application called Real Market, and more. These projects were supposed to help with ‘GNation’s” goals but resources were being spread thin, and many of us were very concerned efficiency was not optimized. Alex and Nikola were removed, and a new C-Level team was put in place to help turn things around. Sergey and Maxim also decided to stay in Belgrade more often. However, as they stayed it became apparent that they had a larger vision that they weren’t sharing with the rest of the development team. We still believed and had been told that we were focused on creating universal payment opportunities for GAME and esports applications for MGO. Sergey on the other hand wanted to focus on charity which confused and disturbed many team members, myself included.

&gt; Things became even more complicated in May when Sergey told the team that the GameCredits and MobileGo currencies weren’t going to be used extensively in the Mobile Store (GPlay) or GShare. This alarmed many of us, because our entire development team was building products with the idea that GAME and MGO would be the focus of the application. GShare was still paying out GAME to users and was only designed to pay out GAME, and our beta esports applications were paying users out MGO. Sergey then told the development team that GAME should not be in the GShare application by June 12th, or E3. They were told to remove GAME just three weeks before the event, which alarmed many of us even further. It didn’t seem like Sergey had a good grip on the scope and challenges of implementing major developmental changes in only a couple weeks. Instead of using GAME/MGO as the universal payment method, Sergey wanted to create a ‘GNation’ coin (a regular virtual coin like you would find in candy crush) as the non-crypto payment method for “legal reasons.” The GNation coin could be purchased using XSolla which accepted GAME/MGO as a payment method, but as just 2 payment methods out of more than 700 options. Sergey believed that offering discounts for purchasing GNation coins with GAME/MGO would be sufficient for creating demand for the cryptocurrency. The blockchain team and I objected to this move because the mobile store was supposed to be crypto focused: that was the basis for the community’s investment and the express purpose outlined in the original Mobilego Whitepaper.

&gt; Given this unexpected turn of events and deviation from the original mission, a portion of the team (myself included) wanted to see the currencies split from GNation so they could have separate and concentrated focus placed on them. However, Sergey and Maxim didn’t like the idea of this and maintained that their “new” vision would lead GameCredits/MobileGo/GNation to success. Our group didn’t feel this was rational thinking given the leadership’s repeated failures meeting timetables and deliverables over the year and nine months since they took over.

&gt; As you may know, I was a 19 year old full-time college sophomore in the Fall of 2016 when I began working for Gamecredits from my dorm. The leadership at that time, including Nele and Jon Comer, agreed to pay me monthly in Gamecredits for my work as the Community Manager. As the community was not yet built, I worked round the clock building a following and a social media presence for the coins. As the community grew and the crypto-markets took off, I worked more and more on the projects and less and less on my schoolwork. In the spring of 2017, I devoted myself to supporting the MobileGo crowdsale and the same leadership team paid me a lump sum (which was agreed upon before the crowdsale began), for the countless hours I worked to ensure its success and manage the technical difficulties encountered along the way.

&gt; Following the MGO crowdsale, the old leadership handed the reins to Sergey and Maxim Sholom. Although I continued performing my increasing job functions as Community Manager for GAME AND MGO, my monthly pay stopped abruptly. When I tried to question Sergey about this, he made excuses always promising to work it out soon. I continued to do my job without any ongoing pay through the fall of 2017 and into the winter. Sergey told me during that time that I would receive an ownership interest in Game and as a owner, should not expect any salary. However, I never received legal acknowledgement of my ownership in the GameCredits company or any pay for my ongoing efforts for Game and MGO.

&gt; In October 2017, I accepted an invitation from the Gamecredits team to visit the office in Belgrade. My father accompanied me and we met Sergey and the rest of the team face to face. During that visit, everyone was supportive of me and encouraging about expanding my role. As a result of that encouragement and my personal commitment to the projects, I decided to drop out of school and go to Belgrade to work in the office for a while. At that time I had not been paid, and in hindsight I should have been more skeptical. However, my father met with Sergey in New York in January of 2018 and during their meeting, Sergey assured my father that I would receive compensation, perhaps in the form of a greater percent ownership in the company than originally contemplated. In fact, this never occurred. I worked for Gamecredits from June of 2017 to April of 2018 without receiving any compensation. To make matters worse, the pay I had received earlier was in cryptocurrencies which had decreased in value. In April 2018, while I was in Belgrade working with the team full-time, Nele managed to get me a one-time payment which I needed to pay taxes on the prior compensation. While the price of the cryptocurrencies had declined significantly, my accountant advised me I owed U.S. income taxes based on the values at the time of payment.

&gt; Despite Sergey’s failure to pay me, I continued to work with the team doing my best. However, as Sergey’s leadership drifted off the original roadmap, he failed to inform me about his activities and he refused to provide me much needed support. Sergey &amp; Co. never hired cryptocurrency experts/marketers requested for the GAME/MGO team. Instead, I was left to bear the responsibility of managing the community, writing all of our social media, managing branding, coordinating ad campaigns, coordinating graphic design, writing all newsletters/blog posts/articles,taking over as Product Owner for the GWallet, and expanding the team (which was nearly impossible to do when already doing 15 things), all without any compensation for my efforts.

&gt; I tried my best to convince Sergey that he owed his investors, represented by our community, an obligation to use the ICO funds raised for the purposes set forth in the Whitepaper roadmap to the extent the plans were viable, and to full transparency and logical alternatives if not. Before leaving Belgrade on July 14, I met face to face with Sergey along with a number of team members who were similarly concerned with Sergey’s leadership and the future of Gamecredits and MobileGo. We suggested a split of the organization and a share of the funds be allocated to an opensource Gamecredits Foundation. To date, Sergey has refused to cooperate in the split or share any of the funds. He has also not committed to investor’s demands for an accounting of the ICO funds despite the promise to do so in the MobileGo Whitepaper used to attract investors.

&gt; Recently, Sergey and Maxim denied much of the foregoing and blamed me, a recently turned 21 year old volunteer, for all their failures and their complete lack of transparency. I want to assure all of you in the community, that I did my best in the face of impossible odds and despite being fed misinformation/lies from them. I was likely naive along the way, but I sincerely believed in the project throughout. I personally lost almost all of what I made and I bear responsibility for losses incurred by many of my family and friends as well. The hardest part is that none of this had to happen. The original projects remain viable and many incredibly talented team members believe in the vision.

&gt; For the past couple weeks, I’ve stepped back from the communities as I waited to hear what would happen regarding separating cryptocurrency from GNation. However, it seems that the Sholom brothers are not genuinely interested in providing a fair split, so I would like to provide transparency ASAP. Please feel free to ASK ME ANYTHING. I will answer as many questions as I can starting 10:00 AM EST Monday July 30th.

&gt; P.S. Right now there is a group of long time community members, blockchain developers, whales, and other former team members who are in the process of establishing the ‘GameCredits Foundation’. The purpose of the foundation is to create a transparent and independent organization that builds blockchain resources using GAME for the gaming industry. This organization will most likely be self funded through a mixture of contract work (potentially helping other blockchain projects) and donations (either from foundation members or community members). GNation will continue to maintain MGO because they control the crowdsale funds and because they are working on the existing esports application/store.

&gt; Thanks:

&gt; I would like to formally thank all of the people who have helped and continue to help GAME. First I want to thank Nele (one of GameCredits founders) for constantly providing me with resources, time, honesty, and generosity. When people at GameCredits would be slow, Nele would foot the bill with his own money, or pay salaries out of his own pocket.

&gt; Thank you to the community members like Samad (N64) for giving their time, money, and personal resources to help GameCredits.

&gt; I want to thank the entire blockchain development team (Filip, Uros, Vuk, Divic, Rade, and more) for their dedication to the GAME/MGO cryptocurrencies despite being asked to pivot from project to project or being tasked to do maintenance work.

&gt; Thank you to Coa, the newer community manager, who took on helping our community despite facing a lot anger/hostility (due to the lack of transparency). You did a great job being as honest and as transparent as possible despite being drastically underappreciated/underpaid.

&gt; And thank you to everyone else in the company who remained unnamed to the community but constantly fought an uphill battle to service our investors, improve efficiency, and better the company.

&gt; I’m proud to have been a part of this organization, and have made many lifelong friends/connections both inside the company and among the community. I may be stepping out of a direct role with GameCredits but I’ll always stay on as an advisor/supporter to the initiative and do what I can to promote the original goals we all envisioned.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,3.99 loan for a more expensive car with 150k miles or less and 10 yrs or younger. Or go with a 10.99 personal loan for a cheaper car,"I have found myself looking for a new used car. We’re comfortable with higher miles if we feel like the car was taken care of and driven well and the price reflects it. 

We’ve found a 2009 Honda Civic Coupe with 168k miles on it. The car is from a single owner and was well maintained. It is completely up to date on maintenance. We feel comfortable buying this car for about $4,000. 

However, we need to take a loan out to get the car. We’ll make a down payment of $1,000. 

We are approved for a loan with a 3.99% interest rate. However, this rate requires the car to be 10 years or younger and 150k miles or less. So we would not be able to purchase the Civic this way. 

That means we either look for another car that meets those terms....

Or we could get a personal loan. This rate would be 10.99%. 

Because the car is so cheap, we want to get the personal loan. Although we don’t have 4,000 now, we are almost confident we will soon. I know that sounds naive. But my husband is a new college grad in the middle of a job search and my boss is currently in the process of filing the paperwork for my raise. What does r/frugal think?

personalfinance,Mid-20s and looking for investment advice,"I am in my mid twenties, finished my masters two years ago and have had a well paying, stable job since then. I've been doing a good job of living below my means and saving money (usually at least $1000/mo), but I'd like to start helping those savings grow. My company has generous benefits so I am not concerned with my retirement fund right now. I have a few questions about what my next steps are. 

My first question/scenario is where to keep my money while saving for a new (used but new to me) car. I'm looking to buy a new car next December when my current lease runs out, and I already have enough money saved up for what I'm looking for. However, this money is just sitting in my savings account. Are there any safe options for storing this money with better interest rates than a savings account? I've read about money market accounts, maybe that is a good option. I'm also concerned about a lack of liquidity or penalties if I withdraw from the account after only 15 or so months. 

Question 2: Student loans are a significant expense for me. I can currently pay off my highest interest loan (6.5%), but is this the best decision? Could I reasonably find a safe investment with a higher interest rate? 

Question 3: What are good starting places for investing to grow a passive income? Any recommended stock brokerage websites?

Thank you for your responses. Sorry if my investment vocabulary isn't great; this is not an area I am very knowledgeable in. Investopedia should be required reading for me.",finance
Vechain,Long time VeChain supporter being critical here...,"Hi,

First and foremost, I am a long time VeChain believer. I believe that VeChain will inevitably be the ""Apple"" or the ""Facebook"" of the blockchain industry and I'm extremely excited about the future ahead. I don't think any other ICOs or project remotely match VeChain's professionalism. Can you think of any other ICOs that does:

\- Disaster Recovery Plan (carried out PWC)?

\- Quarterly Financial Report?

\- Consistent updates and progress?

\- Flawless transition to Main-net?

However, the high standard set by VeChain also means that any other minute details that seem off can be easily noticed. And here I am, talking about the one aspect that VeChain doesn't live up to its hype: the Website.

Every single one of us believe in VeChain's vision, because we've been around in this company long enough to realise its potential, its dual token economy and its massive partnerships. But what about newcomers? The first thing they will do is to go to the main website to understand what VeChain does. And here is what I believe VeChain has missed some marks:

\- The intro video, whilst fancy, does not help illustrate what VeChain is trying to achieve. If you're a serious investor (like I am), then you don't need this CGI effect movie. I would want an informative video of what VeChain does (you can put on the winner's VeChain summary video and I think it'll do more wonder). In all honesty, if VeChain is aiming to be an BaaS Enterprise Grade Public Blockchain, we don't need gimmicky videos to illustrate its technology.

\- The website's front page is extremely scroll intensive. It just does not have that seamless experience. When you scroll through the website, the images move as much as you scroll. Sometimes it is stuck because you didn't scroll enough for the next section. I personally think the front page scrolling system should go. There is nothing wrong in having a standstill 1-pager, as it doesn't distract the audience from other sections.

\- A much more information intensive roadmap. If you haven't seen this medium [article, ](https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/a-timeline-of-actions-and-events-leading-up-to-our-vechainthor-rebrand-85730330aa88) I suggest you have a look. Unfortunately it finished around March but you can see how exciting and informative that was: a technology deployment section, a partnership section, a foundation / governance section, a marketing section and an exchange section. If we can keep this section updated and put it on the website, it'll be much better than the existing one.

I'm sorry if you guys think I'm critical. But you need to understand this: we are an ENTERPRISE solution to large corporate companies. If you think our competitor is Ethereum or Neo or EOS then you're actually incorrect. These platforms are aimed primarily at startup companies that are trying to penetrate their industry with the use of blockchain technology.

VeChain's partnerships are with PWC, DNV GL, Renault, BMW, Yida, Bright Food and so forth... they are BILLION dollars valuation companies. This means our competitors are actually AWS, IBM, Microsoft who offer their own BaaS. We have a big challenge ahead of us: we need to provide an BaaS at an Enterprise Grade AT A PUBLIC BLOCKCHAIN level. Because of this, we need to be even more professional, more so than other platforms.

Having a Diablo III promo trailer does not help. Period.

personalfinance,Does a 401k loan make sense - This time?,"Am I dumb?  I see a clear benefit to 401k loan in this situation.

We need a loan to fund a major renovation (about $50k).  Looking at home equity interest rates they are 5.5-6% versus 401k loan that is 4.5%

We are thorough savers, 12% each in our 401k (near max contribution) and another 10% of income into Brokerage (long term savings, IRA has minimal tax benefit).  

Currently our 401k are exclusively index (mix of S&amp;P500 and NASDAQ).  At age 32 I am thinking we should put 10% into bonds in the near future.  

I want to avoid paying taxes on capital gains by selling stocks to fund the project.

We would lose on the 401k gains, but it seems time we deleverage a bit.  If i am going to move some 401k into bonds, aren't I treating the 401k similarly by taking out a loan?  We can pursue a home equity loan or dip into our brokerage holdings to pay if the worst happened.",finance

personalfinance,"Trying to prepare for life after graduation next year, 30k in student loans","I'm currently 21, and I'll be graduating next May with my BS. I've received a job offer from the company I've been interning with this summer, and I'll be making 80k. I currently have 30k in federal student loans, so I'm hoping to do as much as I can now to make the transition out of school easier.  

During the school year, I live on campus, so my only expenses are food, gas, car insurance, and my phone. However, due to my class schedule, I only expect to make ~$7-800 a month. I'm going to try to build my savings to 3-5k by May (have about 2k now) to make moving out easier. I'm also planning to keep paying interest on my two unsubsidized loans, so that there won't be any interest to capitalize after my grace period.  

My real question is how to budget/plan out my life once I graduate. Housing is relatively expensive where I'll be living, and I can't decide if I can afford to splurge and get an apartment (around 1.2k/mo) or if I need to be throwing as much money as possible at my student loans. I think I could find a room in a shared house for ~$600. The budget I'm playing around with is:

take home pay after taxes, 15% 401k: $1944 twice a month 

* rent: 600-1200  
* loan payment: 300 minimum, but I could probably afford to throw a max of 1k/mo  
* car insurance: 150 (should go down more by then, though)  
* phone: 43  
* gas: 120  
* food: 300 (that's a guess, though)  

I know I should also budget out more money for an emergency fund, and I'm not sure how much I'll really be spending on food. I have an old car (99 Camry), so I'd like to have money saved up for maintenance as it gets even older. There are probably other expenses that I've left out, as I've never lived on my own before. I'm sorry if this post is too specific; I don't really have any family in my life to ask these kinds of questions so I'm trying to figure it out on my own.",finance
personalfinance,Household income will double. What to do next?,"I'm 22, my husband is 28.  Once I start my new job, our gross income will be about 120k.

**Financial situation:**

55k in student loans at about 4% interest.

No credit card debt or car loans.

Credit scores are in the 750's (pay off CC balance every month).

Savings: 1,000 emergency fund &amp; ~2500 in sinking funds (car insurance, repairs, medical, small trips, etc.)

Nothing saved/invested for retirement, not currently contributing either.

My company offers to match 403b contributions up to 4% of pay.

Living in 1 bedroom apartment paying 950/month + electricity.  We don't love it here, but a move anywhere will increase our monthly expenses and we have no need for it yet.

Thinking about starting a family soon, but would prefer being in house (that we own) before having kids.

We're loosely following Dave Ramsey, so the original plan was to pay off student loans then save 20% down payment.  That would take about 4 years if we don't have any changes in living expenses.

However, we don't want to wait that long before starting a family.

**edit to add:** we'd also save an emergency fund of 6 months expenses along with a down payment

The way I see it, our options include:

1. Do the original 4 year plan (pay off loans &amp; save 20%, don't start retirement investing until home is purchased).
    Pro: super financially stable and consumer debt-free before kids
    Con: live 4 years in 1 bedroom apartment, longer wait to have kids

2. Save 20%, buy house, then pay off loans when we can.
    Pro: in a house sooner, money going to equity, can have kids, etc.
    Con: losing money on student loan interest, may never pay off loans as fast as intended b/c of other stuff (kids, childcare, house projects, emergencies, etc.)

3. Pay off student loans, then save 5-10% and buy house
    Pro: in house quicker than 4 years, have kids sooner, no debt
    Con: pay PMI and larger monthly payments (we'd be able to handle it)

Of course, all these also have variables like:
    When to start retirement investing.
    When we officially decide to have kids.
    Interest rates/market prices in the next 5 years.

**TL;DR, what should we do with our money that will be best in the long run, but also allow us to be in a home sooner?  Without being completely reckless?**

TLDR: The ills Vitalik talks about are primarily about psychology. New scalable solutions can fix it partially, but we have to deal with people first.

Before I dig deep into this post, I want to let you know what it's about. Yes, you'll see some emotional content. You'll see ideological ideas. However, this post ain't about ideologies. It's about something I deem as a real problem. Its about the corrupt mindsets that we have as community since the prices spiked early 2017. To advance forward, I want to analyze them, distill the problem into the most basic form possible, then point people into a direction I deem would be good for the cryptocurrency community. The format will go like this:

1. My history with Crypto/Blockchain. Why I'm here in the first place.
2. My analysis of the problem Vitalik talked about
3. My perceived solution to the problem.
4. The steps I've already taken towards the problem

# Why I'm Here

Time travel back into pre-2017 and you'll see that the cryptocurrency/blockchain community was filled with hopeful young nerds that dreamed of making the world into a better place; A much more open, peaceful and freer place. I was going through a hard time with my life 2015-16 -- my twin died, I was on the verge of going homeless with nobody else to rely on, had to go unbanked in America, almost entirely dropped out of college and my first contracting business failed. I couldn't get my life right at all, and I didn't see any hope. The future was bleak to me. However, I found people here in the blockchain community actually trying their hardest to do things that would solve the world's problems, **\[**[**even if that was mainly reporting the news for people and addressing people live in chat to create a community**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdUSSt-IEUg2eq46rD7lu_g)**\]**.  **That drew me in well before the price of cryptocurrencies spiked;** almost in a manic like way -- I read about it constantly, practiced solidity, talked to everyone I could that would have the capacity to understand cryptocurrencies and more.

Even now, when I attend conferences, I meet good-hearted, sleep deprived developers, marketers, business owners and specialist that aim to solve the world's greatest problems in the best ways they can. Many are in small corners of the world helping each other out. **Inside of this community I found hope and meaning. My depression lifted, my anxiety went away, my life got back on track, and that hope propels me though the field years since I joined this movement**. I'm now more confident than ever knowing that collectively this industry will possibly be the epicenter of change for not only money, but for everything. We'll \[[***eliminate poverty***](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nikolaikuznetsov/2017/07/24/how-emerging-markets-and-blockchain-can-bring-an-end-to-poverty/#3c3d76444a0c)\], \[[***solve global warming***](http://regen-network.gitlab.io/whitepaper/WhitePaper.pdf)\], \[[***prevent hyper-inflation like we've seen with Venezuela***](https://makerdao.com/)\], \[[***improve supply chains***](https://www.mattereum.com/)\] around the world, improve healthcare, and solve the \[[***social ills of the world like corruption***](https://hackernoon.com/blockchain-for-voting-and-elections-9888f3c8bf72)\]. That's just the tip of the iceberg. I believe intensely in the vision set for crypto.

*The community is filled with brilliant people that will make a difference. That excites me.*

I'm for freedom, boosting happiness of individuals, increasing health, making life more fun and less stressful for the common person, open discussions to progress everyone forward, and a more livable planet. I'm thinking of all people and I'm not against any group. However, I'm not for FUD, greed while abusing others, bigotry, trolling, hatred, racism, evil acts and stealing. Those are against my values. I think that's against the values of many of the cryptocurrency community's foundational members.

# A problem we can't ignore

In 2017, as the prices exploded and the returns grew in for the average person, I noticed the community was starting to get tainted. People were no longer focusing on technology, freedom and community. No longer focusing on creating better lives for people in their communities around the world. **We were missing the altruism I originally felt in the community.** \[[**If I were in Vitalik shoes, where I'd invest 80-100 hours a week into a vision, I'd feel extreme frustration too**](https://www.businessinsider.com/ethereum-founder-threatens-to-leave-if-the-crypto-community-doesnt-grow-up-2017-12)\]. People are instead focusing on \[[***needless politics***](https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/the-bitcoin-threat-20180202?mod=topStories)\], searching for the next big price pump, the next big score. Instead of people figuring out about how to use blockchain and crypto for making people's lives better, I've heard people say HODL and scam more than I ever have in the history of the community. This saddens me and frustrates me at the same time. On one end I see great potential and beauty in the community, and at the same time I see the beast within us come out that hasn't been even thought about deeply enough to be accurately tamed. Trolls, profiteers running away with ICO money, market manipulators and scam artist ruining the reputation and  progress of the community.

While I could complain about what I see, ***I decided to instead dissect it in this post***. I wanted to know what's causing this on a larger scale. See, by training I'm a psychologist, social scientist and computer scientist. I've been transitioning over to economics and data science because I feel it's a solid cornerstone of the industry. My perspective will be coming from those first. Allow me to explain. If our community is going to *""grow up and actually solve problems""*, the corruption of minds because of money needs to be fully explored first.

Only by understanding the problem thoroughly can we solve it.

Explicitly stating the problem: Its the extreme predatory, egotistical, harsh behavior we as a community have adopted.

# The Psychology And Behavioral Science Of Finance

Let's start with the biggest premise. Money is an idea. It exist because people communicate, produce, share, trade, have scarcity for goods and have needs. Money is an ideological binding agent for people.

* It helps us exchange two irrelevant things with a medium
* Helps us do more things in knowing the value we hold will help us improve productivity in the future
* Helps us determine value in an abstract way
* Helps us navigate the world.

**Money is about as social and psychological** as anything in the world can get outside of direct human interactions. Coincidentally, this psychological/social aspect isn't talked about very much inside of the cryptocurrency landscape. However, it's the foundation of everything we have here today. If we can't talk about how money is connected to the mind, we can't solve the maturity problem Vitalik was talking about. **My intent is to explore that deeply so a firm direction can be at least set.**

# Money and the Mind

Our mind is complex. Beyond the usual processing of information people have (our 11 senses), we people have 2 primary centers for decision making and control.

**Limbic System**

The first one is the limbic system. It has gone by the nickname of ""the lizard brain"" in recent history. It's responsible for storing memories, handling stress responses, attention and emotional processing. In a sense, it controls all of intuition and fast heuristic choices you make.

https://i.redd.it/xvpw95ate8d11.png

**Prefrontal Cortex**

The second system is known as the prefrontal cortex. It controls higher order functions such as planning, reasoning, serial processing and how we think about emotions.

https://i.redd.it/if5p4n90f8d11.png

These two centers are not mutually exclusive. You brain has circuits to make decisions about everything. The two parts talk to each other to do so. Any dysfunction in behavior is usually due to a lack of communication between these two decision centers, rather than a lack of communication between the centers of your brain. This is heavily seen in mental disorders. According to the book \[[***Upward Spiral***](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QUIAK0G/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1) \],  a book that looks at mental disorders from a neuroscientific view and explains how to reverse the ill effects of them, here's now some disorders can play out inside of our heads:

1. **Depression** \-- A poor link between the Anterior Cingular Cortex and PFC. It means you will notice more negative and therefore act on negative impulses and thoughts.
2. **Dissociation** \-- A poor link between the Anterior Cingular Cortex and Anterior Insular makes it so your attention can't be accurately directed towards yourself. There will likely be a poor understanding of pain and out of body experiences. It can be reversed with meditation and yoga.

# How Crypto Fits

This should hopefully be the first question we have. It's easy to only pay attention to the ill behaviors of the more recent cryptocurrency industry and say ""shame on you!"". But what if people had a hard time actually controlling themselves? Inside of the book Upward Spiral, Alex Korb, the neuroscientist that wrote it explored that people with depression and anxiety had a hard time not being depressed and anxious by choice. Because the depressed person's circuitry is skewed, they act on it subconsciously in a forever perpetuating loop. ***In fact, the only way to reverse depression is to reverse the circuitry that holds it together.***

Part of what makes anti-depressants more effective is that the serotonin improves sleep and makes a person's brain more susceptible to positive changes. That would be doing things like doing gratitude journals everyday to make your *anterior cingular cortices notice more positive events*, being around people who love you to boost your serotonin and cut down stress hormones, or getting a little exercise everyday to send oxygen to your brain.

So that leads us back to the original question. What if people didn't have a fully conscious control over how they acted about money and crypto? I did some research between many different articles and found that this was absolutely the case. People don't have much control. They tend to be on extremes of some end all the time.

**How Does Finance Play With The Brain?**

Of the many ways, there's one key way it does. Money plays with people through the the hypothalamus stress response. It charges people into fight or flight mode, and can literally destabilize the homeostatic systems. This can do all sorts of things. It can make the anterior cingulate weaker in strength (known to help us control emotions and learn), and therefore reduce the power of our prefrontal cortex. When people are stressed about finance, or even excited about it, it will put **people into extreme states.** **\[**[**Meaning the lizard brain takes the show\]**.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/elizabethharris/2017/11/28/new-neuroscience-study-reveals-what-worry-about-money-does-to-your-brain/#6217b9a3385e) **That can make people easily make haphazard decisions.**

Of course, there's other things that happen with the introduction of more money, but that **IS** the most intense thing to take note of.

If we want to solve the problem of relinquishing poor community, like Vitalik continuously makes comments about, we need to look at the problem in this way. If we don't see it this way, we're screwed. The problem wont be solved, companies like Microsoft will continuously kill off their implementations due to price fluctuations, the cryptocurrency community wont pass go and wont make a huge impact. Instead we'll blame, shout at each other, and create another Wall Street 2.0. In fact, we'll become worse than them. We will have more leverage over resources than any other group in history and the corruption will be strong.

Money affects decisions, period.

# 

# Solving the Cultural problem

I'm nervous. As I type this response, I know that by revealing my idea to the public I could be condemned by the community for ""shilling"", and even worse, somebody else can pick it up and run with it. That is the most nerve wreaking thing I could ever consider. Months of 80 hour weeks and extreme sacrifices to bring out a vision because I didn't see much of a choice. If we don't remove what limits us soon as a community we will get engulfed by outsiders that don't want to create virtuous society.

**My solution: Algorithmic Trading**

Now, before you tell me that the market is entirely unpredictable, I'd like to be one to say that the notion is false. We see everywhere that people using AI and more complex forms of math to be able to make reasonable gains in the financial world. Companies like Bridgewater predicted the financial crash of 2008 with reasonable accuracy, and other people like **\[**[**mathematicians are able to do the same**](https://www.ted.com/talks/jim_simons_a_rare_interview_with_the_mathematician_who_cracked_wall_street)**\]**. Realistically, the market has some degree of predictability. However, much of the access to that is limited.

Even beyond that, the financial industry is one of the only social fields that is highly transparent to many actors, through the news and price information, and reflects ideas and beliefs through the markets. If we can better analyze markets, we could discover all sorts of social phenomenon that previously made no sense. With algorithmic trading we're heavily incentivized to learn, as that will produce a direct outcome of earning money.

We could better solve the social ills of the world quickly and efficiently over time. On top of that, we will be able to stabilize the market and protect against bad agents if algorithmic trading becomes coordinated and effective enough throughout the industry.

**Again, How Does it Fit With Cryptocurrency?**

Bitconnect could answer how automated trading fits.

Before I continue, let me be clear. People lost their money through that scam. It was awful. I know some people that had a lot of money taken from them. Many of them are now fearful of cryptocurrency.

However, **I don't think Bitconnect was 100% wrong with their idea**. Yes they were a ponzi scheme, yet realistically many of the people I met that fell for it felt as though the crypto markets were already complex. They were losing money while HODLing, making rash decisions and trading.

Bitcoin and the entire industry carries too much of a cognitive burden for a person to keep track of beyond their normal everyday life. News, prices, scams, hacks and technical information. That's a lot to keep track of if you have 3-4 part-time jobs as a single mom or dad while raising 2 kids. That's a lot to keep track of if you're old and don't have the technical capacity to read into the crypto markets all day everyday.

Therefore, even while people were making less money from investing into Bitconnect, on paper it required less thinking and they were still getting benefits that they cared about. They could share with friends because they thought that there money would not shrink in value heavily due to a random market crash. **As a consumer, it isn't wrong to believe that you can be apart of something big without having to work an extra 5 hours everyday reading blogs and watching youtube videos just to keep up with the happenings of the industry.**

It doesn't require us to be judging  people for falling into a ponzi scheme. It requires a bit of caring and empathy to see people's main intentions. They want a better life compared to the one that has been crushing them with student debt and poor job prospects. **People want to have a better life without being as stressed beyond belief like they currently are.**

And for the everyday trader, giving them the incentive they seek, while giving them the capacity to do some research for themselves is important. **Choice matters a lot for some people.**

# Steps I've taken towards this:

Here comes the shill part you've been waiting for. Over the last year I've been building an application that would help us solve the problems we face today as a community. It I'll reduce the stress response of people worrying more about money, with technology like it getting standardized throughout the entire industry, it'll make things a lot more stable. It's an automated AI-based trading platform that aims to make reduce the cognitive load and worry about holding your funds in crypto. The aim of it is to dynamically trade for people while also letting them have 100% control over their funds. For now, that's by using exchange API keys. Though in the future, that can be through decentralized exchanges, meaning no middle man.

*My product's name: It's* \[[***Funguana.com***](https://Funguana.com)***\]****.* \[[***Internally meaning the interconnection of all Dhrama in the Huayan Buddhist religion***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huayan#Interpenetration)\]*.*

I've already received controversial reviews, and feel crazy for putting it back out there. However, I'm now confident I can follow through, and maybe by explaining my reasoning behind why I built it the community will respond differently this time.

To make it more trust-able, 4 months after public release, if my resources allow me to, I plan to open source the infrastructure code so people can implement their own platform within a matter of weeks, then systemically open many of the algorithms so they can appropriate powerful algorithms together over time (many not based on AI). I have to be strategic though. If I open it too soon, too many bad actors can enter the space and cause havoc early, without much chance to keep them in check.

personalfinance,Military bonus- use for school or invest in retirement?,"I’m in the Air National Guard and I’m also an undergrad studying animal sciences, hoping to be going to vet school in 3 years. I got a $20,000 sign on bonus for the Air Force. My plan has always been to use it for tuition in vet school. Vet school tuition will end up being anywhere from $22,000-$50,000 a year (for 4 years) depending on the school. The AF is paying for all my undergrad tuition, although I still have $7,000 in loans from my first year.

Anyways, if I use it on tuition directly it’ll get taxed and I’ll end up with around $17,000 of it instead of 20. However I just found out I can put my entire bonus into my military retirement funds and it is estimated to grow up to $700,000 in 40 years. (According to the thrift savings plan calculator). I’m 20 years old now. The recommended fund accounts are the “C” “S” and “I” funds (have fancier names that I don’t know)

I’m really stuck between wanting the money to grow extensively with retirement but also wanting to use it to avoid another ~$17,000 in loans. The loan would probably have anywhere from 3-6% interest (federal loans). My other funds for vet school include money I’m saving now from the guard and my GI Bill will be used during vet school which will give me $750 per month for 36 months. The rest will be loans.

Any advice on if I should use the money to have ~$17,000 less in student loans or if I should put it in these investment accounts and let it grow over 40 years?",finance

personalfinance,"Is it possible my state taxes weren't filed properly, even though I got the refund?","I did my 2017 taxes online through H&amp;R Block. This was the first year I was doing them by myself, so I was constantly double checking that everything was correct and that they submitted ok. Everything seemed to be fine and I got the direct deposits from both the federal and state refunds soon after.

However, the other day I was browsing over tax stuff and pulled up my account on the H&amp;R Block website. When I clicked to review my 2017 taxes it listed the federal taxes as 'filed' and the state taxes as 'ready to be filed'. But I remember filing them both and  I've already recieved the refunds.

personalfinance,"received signing bonus for new job, need help paying off debt!","Hi personal finance! I really enjoy this community. Reading posts from others has helped me get my finances (that were once shockingly terrible) into better shape. However, I'm still carrying a large amount of credit card debt.

My wife and I have built a budget and stopped spending with these cards. However, due to a combination of very bad luck (20k in medical expenses we had no money for) and bad choices (overspending) we are still carrying way too much debt.

I recently took another job where I received a 10k signing bonus. 10k is the amount I'm taking home after taxes etc. However, I did take a 10k pay cut throughout the year, from 52k to 42k. The new position also has bi-yearly bonuses and commission, once I get off the ground and can begin to contribute. I'll list my debt below-- should I use the entire 10k to pay off some of these cards? Should I attack the high interest rates first or eliminate a couple of the smaller balances to use those minimum payments towards the higher balances? Avalanche, snowball, some other way? Give me your wisdom! FYI, my wife also works full time and together we take home (after taxes) around 72k.

personalfinance,Home Equity Line interest versus Mortgage Interest,"Is the way they calculate home equity line interest different than how you calculate a mortgage interest?

I guess what I want to know is, what is the tipping point where although my interest rate on a heloc is higher it makes sense to leverage that to zero out my mortgage principal and make monthly payments on that line of credit versus the mortgage.

personalfinance,I have a new car loan at 16%. Refinance now? Or wait?,"I'm in the early stages of rebuilding credit, after many years of irresponsibility. My auto loan provider reports my ""FICO Auto Score"" at 600. I have 2 solid years of on time payments with this loan, and I'm now starting to put extra money towards the principal every month.

I really want to go to my local bank and try to refinance for a lower interest rate. As I understand it, that'll mean new loan fees, and if the new rate isn't low enough, it won't really help me save money.

Other details:

My wife had almost no credit history, so she recently got one of those secured Discover cards. Now Discover reports her score at a little over 700, which we find surprising.

Two of the worst items on my credit history are supposed to be cycling off at the end of the year. I also have a secured Discover on the way, to help me rebuild.

We'll be moving apartments in a couple of months, and I don't want to do anything that will hurt the application process.

Car loan opened at $18,800. It's down to $14,700 right now. Monthly payment is $401, but I've started paying $500/month, about 7 days before the due date.

So, do I refinance the car? What interest rate would make it worth it? Should we see if my wife can cosign the refinance loan? Or should I just hold off until after we move? Or even after those 2 bad items on my report are gone?

personalfinance,The best way to get through these loans,"So here is the situation. I am currently $46,695 in student loan debt, $3,198 of which is unpaid interest. 

I currently make about $1,400 biweekly ($2,800/month) and want to spend this money as responsibly as I can. I want to rid of my debts while also planning for my future ones. I want to get my masters in about a year or 2 and will need to money to pay for it.   THE LOANS:

all are direct stafford loans

4 are subsidized

8 are unsubsidized

4.18% average interest rate

my first question is would it be a good idea to consolidate these loans? what would be the benefits and draw backs. 

Secondly, I came up with 3 options for myself I was hoping someone could help me choose the smartest option or even come up with a completely new option in terms of payback and saving. 

OPTION A:

pay back the loans as fast as possible so I will not owe anything during grad school.

I would pay back about 700 a pay check and would be able to pay back my loans in a little over 2 years in time to go to grad school with no debt. however this leaves little money for me to save for grad school and even less for my retirement or any spending.

OPTION B:

I realize that the loans require me to pay off the unpaid interest first before I am able to pay back the principle borrowed amount so I was thinking of making large payments of about 800$ till just the interest is paid off and then do the minimum payments of $250 ($500) a month while putting that exact amount in saving so that i am able to make payments in grad school and will also be able to save more money for grad school.

OPTION C:

only make the minimum payments while saving more money so that I can make payments while in grad school and am able to save even more money for grad school.

I am very open to any other options you may come up with.

personalfinance,"$50k in IRS debt, payment plan rejected","UPDATED at bottom 8/1/2018

Hi,

Wife and I had just over $50k for 3 years worth of federal tax debt and $50k plus of other debt.

Sold our house 4 months ago and paid off everything except IRS. Paid up on estimated for 2018 for Q1 and Q2. Have about $15k in the bank.

IRS reps told me I could make one payment to get the sum under $50k. It was around a $600 payment. In doing so I could get an installment agreement over 6 years, WITHOUT subjecting to a financial status review or some such thing where they review income/expenses, etc, and a cost of $699/mo. 

Submitted the form in June stating monthly payment of $700 to begin in July. Just got a letter yesterday stating our plan was denied. No reason stated, as is the IRS way. IRS LTR 484C.

We had built a budget that would scrape by including this $700 payment.

My 1st action point is to call the IRS today after work and see if they can tell me anything useful. And try to speak to a superior if that cannot. I followed the steps as they told me to take care of this debt and they shut me down. It is frustrating to say the least, and wife is panicking.

Looking got advice on similar experiences, or from people who work with these situations as tax professionals.

I don't believe my wife and I would qualify for a settlement. Take home is average $4400/mo. If they garnish we will likely not be able to pay our bills. If they levy, we lose our nest egg and still owe $35k.

Edit: Duration of payment plan, from 5 years to 6. Added IRS LTR number 484C

UPDATE 8/1/2018: Call to IRS seemed fruitful. Rep said that when I made my initial payment I did exactly as I was told by the first rep. I logged online, made a payment, and selected my oldest due tax year (2015) to have it apply there. Rep proceeded to tell me what actually needed to be done was apply it to 2015's penalty for not having health insurance. She said ""this isn't your fault, yadda yadda, you did as instructed, I will change how/where your payment was applied, re-fax the 433-D to my fax number (vs the general fax number for her department) and I will re-enter it and get it set up. There should be no issues this time. You'll receive the paperwork in a few weeks""

I will update again when I learn the outcome, successful or not.

I will also take the time contact a few other professionals to see if it's worthwhile to try and alleviate any of the amount owed.",finance
CryptoCurrency,White paper overview of DCC project,"Hello dears! Today we will talk about loans. Nowadays, many people take out loans to make serious purchases, for example, to buy a car or an apartment. Basically, we go to banks or open a credit card. We have no choice and we have to pay high interest rates. But there are situations when we can not pay off the loan in time and find ourselves in the black list. Our credit history is ruined, and there's nothing we can do about it.

Just recently I took out a loan. I had to collect a whole package of documents to get it and the percentages were higher than those, because I did not fulfill all the necessary conditions. I did not have joy from the loan, only disappointment. All banks have almost the same credit conditions. In Europe, where my friends live, credit rates are several times lower than ours. With the distributed credit system Distributed Credit Chain that I've learned about, people's lives are changing for the better. I was interested to know about it.

What is the uniqueness of the project?

The platform is characterized by blockchain technology and the presence of a decentralized system. It can be used by people around the world. Very impressed with the passage of ICO. Twenty minutes were needed for public sales, HardCap gathered very quickly, although it was within 49 million dollars. The project attracts a good prospect in the future.

Users of the platform will have information about its participants. As for the lenders, they will monitor the borrowers and their credit history. All the necessary information is stored on the blockchain. If the lender wants to, he can see your credit history. It is impossible to replace it and if it is bad, the credit will simply not give you.

This project has serious investors. About the partners of the project also need to say. Not to mention the partnership with Usechain. In this project, the team uses a technologically special method-personal data are identified. The sphere of Finance is perfect for them. What is very pleased, is the entry of DCC in the list of fifty best new blockchains in 2018.

The work of the platform

To get a loan, you need:

\* register;

\* make a request;

\* specify the expected amount.

The application is considered by the program automatically, and then it will be received by creditors – it is also automatically redirected to them. They carefully study the information-they are interested in the history of loans. If it is transparent, the credit is secured to you. No contract is concluded, respectively, time costs for consideration is very small.

""Distributed Credit Chain"" – protected platform, so work with it safely. It transmits credit data, performs operations on finances openly. Admission to DCC is available:

\* institutions, enterprises related to Finance;

\* the departments of the government;

\* nonprofit organization;

\* users.

If a person connects in one country, he can see that in the other the interest rates are lower. Thanks to this, banks evaluate risks and offer a loan to a person on more favorable terms than all banks in the country of residence.

The project has a personal token-DCC. To create picked reference point Ethereum, ERC20. It is used to pay off credit debt or to perform operations for Distributed Credit Chain. The sophisticated technology can reduce the costs as well as the risks of different service providers. Also reduce costs and Commission, which is charged to users.

The data stored in the DCC cloud is provided to the right institutions, on their basis, can give credit to a person and keep his information about loans in the blockchain. Credit cards on the blockchain contain data about the loans taken in various institutions.

About the project team

The team consists exclusively of qualified professionals. They have extensive experience in such areas:

\* computer science and mathematics;

\* financial engineering;

\* financial science.

Judging from this, we can say with confidence that the project is really unique and promising. It is worth paying attention to.

Summary

I want to note that this project is able to solve problems with lending anywhere, anywhere in the world. This is the main advantage of the platform. And everything happens on the blockchain, so the conditions are transparent and open.

""Distributed Credit Chain"" is a decentralized banking system, which unites all of whom require cash and most lenders. Contains the recognized leaders of the blockchain:

\* Huobi;

\* DATA;

\* IOTA;

\* Binance.

It is safe to say that the project has reached great heights, so interested in a huge number of people. All thanks to thoughtful details and a well-coordinated team of professionals who have behind them experience in this field.

personalfinance,I need help creating a simple budget and figuring out what to do with my money!,"I have used Mint and Every Dollar before, but I still struggle with making a budget and sticking to it for a few different reasons. 

First, some info:

My credit score bounces from 720-750 often. I have a Discover It credit card that I haven't used in a few months and generally only use if I forgot my debit card at home. 

I have student loans, totaling $4,638.80 with Fedloan Servicing. 

	-$2,108.70 at 4.04% fixed interest
	-$1,540.93 at 4.41% fixed interest
	-$983.19 at 4.41% fixed interest

I just paid off my car loan, which was $5,900, including some interest (paid off within a year). 

I just stopped my paper delivery job, so I currently don't know what is normal for my gas expense and car expense, besides the fact that I need new brakes &amp; rotors soon (likely around $300+).

**Income:** I work at an hourly rate, but I want to plan for $600 paid biweekly. 

	-$600 per 2 weeks
	-$543.50 currently in my ""bill"" account 
	-$233.41 currently in my ""spend"" account
	-$1,510.40 currently in my savings account

**Expenses:** 

	-Rent: $210
	-Car Insurance: $50 
	-Electricity: $40-60
	-Internet: $20
	-Subscriptions: $40
	-Loan payment: $55

I can always create a budget for these expenses, as these are always the same. I struggle with the gas expense because of differing gas prices, but my job is only 4.7 miles away from my apartment. I also don't know how to plan for groceries because my boyfriend and I don't do one big grocery trip, and we don't do well with planning our meals. We also eat out a lot more than we should. How do I move my money around in order to have enough in my bill account and know what I'm able to spend in my spending account? How much should go into savings every check? 

I am planning on going back to school in the spring, if I get accepted into the program in November. I should have enough grants and scholarships to pay for school. Since I've lost my second job and my pay is lower, I don't want to throw everything extra at my other loan payment just yet, but I definitely plan to once I can up my pay.

All of these things said, I've never been in a situation where I had to rely on credit cards or go without to make a payment. 

**TL;DR** I need help figuring out what to do about my gas and grocery bill, if I should be contributing to anything for retirement (and maybe changing my exemptions to get paid more per check?), and loan payoff.",finance
personalfinance,"I am a recent graduate, with $48K in the hole (without interest factored in). How best to tackle this?","I am living in Phoenix, AZ with my wife (medical school student, no loans). I just got an hourly job in my field and I am estimating about $45,000 for my adjusted yearly income. 

First loan - Discover Loan - current balance: $35,674 at 8.61% interest
Second Loan - Federal - current balance: $11,975 at 4.1% interest

Other significant payments: 
Rent: $700/month
Commute: ~$50/week in gas a week at $2.70 a gallon 
Groceries: $70-100/week depending

I am thinking maybe 15% of my income goes to paying off the Discover Loan, and maybe 5-8% for the Federal Student Loan. Does this sound feasible starting off? In 4 years my wife will start a residency and we will have a joint income that we can more aggressively pay off this debt.

personalfinance,Should I strategically default on my private student loans or try to get them discharged for hardship in bankruptcy?,"I also asked this on /r/legal advice and it was suggested I also ask here.


I have about 70K in private student loans and 3k in federal loans and my abusive mother is the cosigner. 

I'm fine on my federal loans (0$ IBR) but my private ones are about to default. There is no way I can afford to pay this back and will never be able to with my job/field.

I was reading up on strategic default and it seems like an option to just try to run out the SOL.

Or. I could try to hardship discharge on bankruptcy. I have a mental illness that has caused 5 hospitalization and I have to visit the doctor and take medication constantly.

personalfinance,"Never had a lot of money, now a 225k heritance &amp; 170k salary and I don't want to mess it up","Hello Reddit! Long time lurker, first time poster, hoping for some financial advice! Thank you in advance for any responses--I truly appreciate you taking the time!!


In less than a month my financial situation is going to change dramatically and I've found myself pretty anxious about it b/c I don't want to mess it up.  I grew up pretty poor so I don’t have much experience with real money.  My immediately family has all passed away and my friends don’t know anything about it either—so I thought I’d come to the hive mind of the internet for help.


In short, I’m going to inherit 225k, tax free. I’m also going to be starting a job that pays 170k/yr plus bonuses and 3% 401k employer contribution.  I don’t know what the best thing to do with it is.


**Relevant details:**

Early 30s;

Single (w/ girlfriend, and no immediately plans to change that) and no kids (same);

Current salary is about 85k/yr;

Own my car outright;

Own my home in a mid-sized city (est. worth: ~325k), w/ mortgage.

**Debts:**

Mortgage: 247k remaining, 3.75%, 27 years left. (My portion w/ insurance and taxes is 775/mo.)

Student Loans: 175k, federal loans between 5.8-7.6, averaging 6.8%. (Current payment is 689/mo, income based).

Credit Cards: about 5k, as a result of estate related expenses following my grandma’s passing, 16.75%, paying about 400/mo.)

**Other monthly expenses:**

Car Insurance: ~135/mo.

Pet care (3): ~600/mo. (medication/prescription food/vet/walks/etc., I know.)

Restaurants/drinking/going out: 750/mo. (I know.)

Groceries: 150/mo.

All Utilities/Gym/Cell: 375/mo.

Vacation fund: 100/mo.

**Current investments (nothing substantial):**

Emergency Fund/Cash on hand: Approximately 3k.

401k: Approximately 21k (currently in a Vanguard target fund) to which I contribute 10% and to which my current employer does not offer a match.)

Acorns: Approximately 2k (gotta start somewhere?)


I don’t anticipate lifestyle creep to be too much of a concern because (1) we already go out way more than we should; (2) neither of us have expensive tastes; and (3) we don’t know anyone with money so it would be a lonely life.  I don't want a new car. I don't want a new house. I don't know any Joneses to keep up with.  


Based on the above, and even assuming some quality of living increase and about 35k in taxes, my very rough calculations tell me I should/might have around 7k a month in investable money (about 10k a month take home (?) minus expenses), which would be about 80k a year to invest, on top of the 225k in inheritance.  


My current thought is to use the inheritance as a reset to immediately: (1) pay off the 5k credit card; (2) pay off the 175k student loans; and (3) bulk up my emergency fund to 10k, leaving about 38k left over.  Then I’d use 3k to take a weekend vaca/buy a new bed/get some better work clothes, leaving me with about 35k to invest straight out.  


Then, once I start my new job next month, I plan to immediately set my 401k contributions to max that out over the course of the year.  And despite the fact that my understanding of what to do with it ends at this point, I will still have a significant amount of money left over for investments.  My initial thoughts were to max out a traditional IRA or back door Roth (but I’m still not sure what this actually is or how to do it) then dump remainder every month into Vanguard or Schwab Index Funds (leaning Vanguard?) at a 80-20 total mark stock/bond mix, with 60% USA and 40% international.


So I guess my question is: How would you invest the 35k lump sum and what should I do with the extra 7k a month?  Also, is paying off my student loans rather than investing the whole 213k as a lump sum even the right thing to do? My gut says yes but I’ve gotten some conflicting advice.  If you wouldn’t pay of the SL debt, why not and what would you do with the 213k?

personalfinance,Should I pay off all of my credit card debt before enrolling in University?,"So here's my predicament. I was accepted to UMD College Park for 2018-2019 year as a transfer student. I'm an incoming sophomore. I've found housing off-campus and have paid off the security deposit as well as first month of rent, and I'm supposed to sign the lease tomorrow. I waited longer than I should have to apply for private student loans and am in the process of doing so now, but I have to have a cosigner and my parents need to refinance their house mortgage first before they can cosign. I have $1.5k debt on a Capital One credit card and $5k debt on a Chase credit card. Interest is accruing on the Capital One card but not the Chase card yet because it has introductory 15-month 0% interest. The introductory rate is good through June 6th, 2019, then it becomes 22.49% variable APR. I currently work part-time locally and get $15.63 an hour. I can get 30+ hour work weeks if needed. If I were to attend school this fall, my plan was to quit said job and find a new one closer to campus and work like 16 hours a week at minimum wage ($12.25) probably. The main reason for this is because my local job is an hour commute from campus. I don't want to work more than 16 hours a week because I know from previous experience that I will be overwhelmed and my grades will suffer. I might also be able to internally transfer stores so I keep the same pay but live closer to campus, but this isn't guaranteed yet. The total cost of attendance for the 2018-2019 year is [$30k](https://imgur.com/a/iblwGgx). I was awarded $6500 for the whole year through a combination of federal subsidized and unsubsidized loans.

*$415.84/month at 16% APR - 60 payments (Origination fee: $900.00, interest rate 13.68%)

*455.06/month at 12% APR - 48 payments (Origination fee: $720.00, interest rate 9.83%)

*547.11/month at 8% APR - 36 payments (Origination fee: $540.00, interest rate 5.94%) 


I would select the last option ($547.11/month) as that is actually $31 cheaper than what I pay total for my credit card debts in monthly payments. The current downside that I can see is that I would be paying a steep origination fee however, I feel like for my life, this would be the best way to paying down my debt in 3 years vs. however long it may take me with what I'm doing now. 


The credit cards I have open right now range in APR's of 18% up to 24% and I am currently paying $578 ($286.80 of that being in interest) in monthly payments. From what I've done in my research, this would be ideal for my situation but would love to hear advice on what everyone thinks or peoples experience in using this website. 

Please let me know if additional information is needed.",finance
personalfinance,Solar investment to offset taxes?,"Due to some peculiar circumstances that I won't get into here I am expecting to owe approximately $7500 in Federal taxes for this year. 
In this scenario does it make sense to offset the taxes with an investment in solar panels for my home? The out of pocket cost for the panels is $21,000. Accounting for the 30% Federal tax credit it would reduce my tax bill by $6300.  Reducing my tax burden and dropping my cost to $14700 since I'm out that tax credit money regardless. 
 Additionally it would increase the value of my home and reduce/eliminate my electrical bill. 

I already max out my 401k, hsa, and dependent care. 

Any thoughts?",finance
personalfinance,I used 28k in savings to pay off 4 student loans on which I was primary owner. So why did my FICO credit score drop 60 points?,"Student loan information as of September 2017 (before I paid them down)

* Private Loan 1: $14,000 balance, 8.75%, joint responsibility w/my dad as cosigner
* Private Loan 2: $4,000 balance, 3.50%, joint responsibility w/my dad as cosigner (NOT paid off - very low interest rate)
* Four Federal Loans: $14,000 total balance, all at 6.55%, individual responsibility


My other accounts:


* 4yo car loan with about 10k remaining
* Checking, savings, and credit accounts with Wells Fargo that are about 11 years old. I keep my credit card at $1000-4000 balance of a $9500 limit. Obviously my checking account took a nosedive when I made the payments, which may have raised a flag?
