1. Taking out the $35k for each year of school, while using the 50k in savings to pay for living expenses throughout school

2. Financing the first year entirely out of pocket, and taking out loans years 2-4, adjusting amounts as needed

I read all the permabull posts everyday.  But no one here is discussing about some of the factual road blocks ahead of which there are two:

1) Inversion of the yield curve.

2) Demographic shift of baby boomers moving out of equities and into fixed income as interest rates move higher will accelerate it.  3% on the 10 year treasury seems to be the magic number.

Which is why the equities seem like they will moon but if the yield curve gets closer to inverting, they'll be a huge market correction.",finance
personalfinance,I owe taxes but can’t afford it. What are my options?,I just went to file my taxes and I owe 3k between state and federal.

personalfinance,Job decisions!,"Hello r/personalfinance,

Short time lurker, first time poster here! I’m seriously torn between two job opportunities!

A little back story: I am 20 years old, I plan on going back to University in September 2019, and I am currently working two part time jobs. I work as a sales associate for a clothing store where I only get about 4.5 hours a week due to over staffing and the recent wage increase (also I live in Toronto, Canada) so that is not sufficient for saving for school next year. I also work as a server in a restaurant where I get about 15 hours a week (also over staffed and affected by the wage increase but the tips are nice). I don’t pay rent, but I own a car that I pay insurance and gas for. 

I have been applying for full time work on top of my serving position for quite some time and have just been offered a position at a 4 star hotel as a server. The wage is 13.50 an hour with pooled tips, and about 25-30 hours a week guaranteed. I know two people who work there already which is how I got the job and they tell me the potential for tips is 40-100 dollars in the mornings and 100- (a maximum)300 at nights. The hours are not fixed so I would have to coordinate every week my hours with the restaurant AND the hotel. It comes with benefits after 3 months and is unionized. I am expected to sign employment papers tomorrow at 10 AM and start training on Monday. 

On the other hand, I received a call from a family member not 2 hours ago and they offered me a job with an electrical company they work at. The wage would be (around) $16/hour with 40 hours a week and fixed hours. Also has benefits. Managing the hours with my serving job would be a lot easier but it’s also a farther travel which means more money on gas. I’d be working with a few cousins and friends, but there are no tips. Also I’d get weekends off, which is just a little bonus. 

So, r/personalfinance, do I take the job with tips and the potential to make a lot of money (but also the potential to not make a lot) with wonky hours or do I choose a fixed schedule with a set amount of money I’ll be making?

The math again, but more organized;

Hotel - $13/hour + (Min.) $40 in the morning shift, (Min.) $100 in the night shifts. Only 25 hours a week. 

Electrical - ~$16/hour, 40 hours a week and overtime potential. 

I know this is a long post but I’ve wracked my brain and they both seem like viable options.  Thanks for reading!",finance

personalfinance,Federal withholding on W2 - 70 cents. How??,"I have much bigger financial problems I'll ask about in another post, but this thing is throwing me for a loop. I worked one job this year from January 1 - April 4. I made 7966.97 in wages; I had 493.95 taken out for social security and 115.52 for medicare. The box that says federal income, however, shows a grand total of 70 cents. 

At first I thought maybe I had told the former employer not to take out any federal withholding. But then, shouldn't the amount be 0? Then I thought that maybe I had told them that, realized it at the last minute, and corrected my W2 right before I left the job. However, even if I only corrected my very last paycheck, and even if my final paycheck from them was only for my final day, I definitely worked a full 8 hours at 13.25 an hour. 70 cents still seems far too low.

personalfinance,Laid off and now stuck paying off work phone and car. Help!,"Alright so I was just laid off for the first time today and need a little help/advice. Quick backstory first...


I graduated from college a few years ago and currently owe on private and federal student loans( roughly around ~50k) and started a new outside sales position last February. 


Over the course of my first year my branch struggled and was in a steady decline over the last few years. We have also lost several key members in management and weren’t replacing their positions, so long story short, this afternoon after work I was let go. When given an explanation I was basically told they had to reduce costs. Which sucks for me but made sense for them because I was the newest AM and had the lowest sales last year. Which brings me to some of my concerns...


- My phone: When I started this position I was given an $80 monthly allowance for my phone bill. I created a separate line for my work number and am currently one year into that contract with Verizon. Regrettably I bought an iPhone 7 thinking I would need the best phone for work. Is this something I can have my company reimburse me for? The phone is in mint condition so I can always try selling it, but I’d like to see if they can buy out the rest of my contract.


My Car: Having a job in outside sales and needing to do a lot of driving (~100-200 miles/day), I was reimbursed monthly through a service our company used. I received a fixed monthly payment plus mileage. The problem is, I was leasing before this job and was going way over the mileage. After a few months I decided to get out of the lease early. Basically I was backed into a corner with Honda and my best option was to buy a new Accord. Plus, to be in compliance to receive our car allowance I had to have a car within 5 years old so buying used wasn’t much of an option. So now I’m stuck with a car I can’t afford.


This just happened today and I have not had a chance to speak with HR about these issues yet. I’ve only spoken with my manager and when I asked him any questions he basically said I’m not at liberty to say. 


I have 2 paychecks left to receive over the next 2.5 weeks. One is tomorrow, but sadly almost half will be going to rent tomorrow:( 


My next steps(besides updating my resume and creating a linked in) are to defer my student loans and apply for unemployment.


I’m still worried about what I’m going to do about my phone and car though. Any advice for on either of these situations before I call HR tomorrow??


Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,"Got divorced and stuck with lots of credit card debt, in school and unsure how to continue","Hey all, looking for some advice; I'm not in a desperate situation just yet but it's definitely a tough one.  The backstory isn't too important, but the short version is that I was in the military and my wife maxed out most of our credit cards while I was deployed.  I got medically discharged and am now divorced, but I have about half the debt (cards were in both of our names.)  

I'm currently looking at nearly $14,500 in credit card debt and $7,000 on my car.  I'd rather not sell the car if entirely possible, as I've had unreliable vehicles before and it's a lot of stress wondering if it's gonna need repairs at any point; however I do understand if it's unavoidable.

First off, my income.  I'm 24 years old and working part time while attending college.  All in all, I make around $27,000 a year if I take student loans (and I don't want to do that), or $22,000 if I don't.  That's ~$1,833 a month with the option of taking an additional $5,000 in loans.  I don't have any time for an extra job or more hours, as this is hard enough to handle as is.

**My Finances**



Item | Debt | Monthly Payment
---|---|---
Credit Card 1 | $7,500 | $155
Credit Card 2 | $7,000 | $140
Car Payment | $7,000 | $231
Car Insurance | -------- | $134
Internet | -------- | $70
Utilities | -------- | $70
Cell Phone | -------- | $70
Rent | -------- | $650
Misc | -------- | $50
**Total** | **$21,500** | **$1,570**

Now, this isn't an awful position for me to be in.  While throwing in random information such as gas, groceries, etc., I wind up being in the positive (albeit barely), there is a problem that's arisen for me.  A large portion of my income comes from my student aid, and due to an issue with my schedule I just found out I will be attending school for an extra semester, making me graduate in December 2019.  However, my student aid runs out in August of 2019.  

My original plan was to graduate in the Spring and start working that August (I'm to be a high school teacher, so I need to be hired in early Fall/late Summer) meaning I would have no interruption of income.  It would have been tense, but doable.  Now I've realized I will be out of Student Aid and waiting from December 2019 until August 2020 before I can start really working, aside from substituting for other teachers occasionally, while paying back the couple of student loans I do have.

I'm wanting to try and get something figured out now, while I still have about a year and a half to prepare.  I'm lucky that this wasn't suddenly sprung on me, but it's still worrying as I have no idea how I can get my debt payments low enough to clear them out and be ""safe"" once I graduate.  I know I could sell my car and I have considered it; the downside is that I'll still have to drop a few thousand dollars to pay for a cheaper one anyway, as I cannot go without a vehicle in my area (rural).  

I'm sure there's more info necessary, so please just ask and I'll provide anything.  I'm just trying to get things settled in before they become a real problem; I'm wanting to focus on Credit Card 1 first because it has a higher interest rate.  Credit Card 2 is obviously my next focus, with the car being last.  I've settled for the lowest internet packages available to me right now, my utilities are fairly low for my area, and my housing is very cheap for here as well.  

Thank you for any help you can provide!!",finance

personalfinance,Small settlement into retirement,"Backstory:
So my ma is looking at getting a small settlement for an injury suffered while at work.  Might be in the range of $20-40k.  She is one year away from retiring at the age of 65.  At the time of retirement she will be getting almost $1k  more a month (minus Medicare costs) than she is getting while working, due to widow social security benefits and a pension.  She has almost nothing in her savings account currently and is far underwater on her home.  

I don't want this money to be pissed away, but would like to see her be able to enjoy retirement by having a safety net, being able to splurge a bit, and have this money work for her.  

So the question: Where or how should this money be put away for her?

1.  Could throw into low interest rate cds-found one at 1.6% apy for 11 months.  Would generate a few hundred dollars each year

2. Put in an investment account like Betterment.  Could go super aggressive or heavier in bonds.  She would pull out a percentage every year to have some cash (hopefully not pulling out as market dips)

3.  Invest heavy in some MLPs or other high dividend receiving stocks, siphoning off the dividend to use.  

4.  Other options

Just looking for some help with what to do.  First time in her life she will have extra money on hand.  Any help is appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Taxes - State I moved from claiming I owe income tax from 2013,"Ok y'all this might be long but I will do my best to summarize. 

Firstly, thanks in advance for any tips you might have. My partner recommended this subreddit to me for advice on my situation.

Backstory: I was in college from 2009-2013, being claimed as a dependent by my parents (who live in Indiana) in 2009-2012. 2013 was the first year I filed alone, and I filed a federal return and state return in my state of resident (Massachusetts) through turbotax. I do have a copy of this return.

Last May, my mom received a mailing to me from the department of revenue of Indiana that I owed them back income taxes from income in 2013. My mom wrote ""no such person at this address"", told me about it and we moved on with our lives. The department of revenue sent my mom a few more mailings, and I contacted them that I was not a resident in the state of Indiana in 2013. Below is a copy/paste of exactly the email I received:

""In order to verify proof of residency status with the Department whom is requesting verification you will need to provide 3 documentations:
(Acceptable Supporting Documents: Property Tax Receipt, Lease Agreement for Full Year, Drivers License, Voters Registration, Utility Bills for Full Year and/or Drivers Records)""

I do not have any of these ""documentations"" because I was subletting, didn't own property taxes, forgot to change my drivers license, and the gas was on another roommate's account. 

After this, my mom received another letter. She sent back the ""she doesn't live here"" letter with a copy of my 2013 MA tax return. 

I received an email from my mom today that she got a note (which she didn't have to sign for?) that the ""debt"" I owe the state of Indiana has gone into collections.

How do I prove to the state of Indiana that I was not a resident? I don't know if this is an r/personalfinance or r/legaladvice at this point. Maybe it makes sense to go to a tax firm and pay someone to address this?",finance
personalfinance,I am trying to figure out how to drop down my taxable income. How does the standard deduction play a role?,"So I just started a new job and I am trying to figure out how to reduce my taxable income through contributions to 401k, etc. Here is the scenario I am working with and please correct me if I am wrong. 

* Gross Income = $63,000
* Benefits = $1,856
* 401k Contributions = $14,500
* Taxable Income = $46,644

With the new tax law, if one is under $38,700, then a 12% federal income tax applies. With a standard deduction of $12,000, that brings my overall taxable income down to $34,644 which leaves me with the 12% tax rate. 

Edit: I know state taxes, etc. are different. But I am mostly concerned with the federal income tax brackets that will effect me the most. 

Is this correct? I figure that lowering my taxable income this way will be more beneficial for me in the long run, but I wasn't sure how the standard deduction comes into play.",finance

gaming,Why Square Enix Should Make A Star Wars Game Based On Final Fantasy,"Imagine a Star Wars game made by Square Enix. 

1. A completely new game with no returning characters, taking place within the Star Wars universe. No cameo appearances either.

2. A JRPG with turn-based combat. Doesn't have to be exactly like FF7, FFX, or FF13 but something turn based.

3. Final Fantasy styled plot and music. Preferably with the music composed by Nobuo Uematsu but inspired by Star Wars &amp; FF themes.

4. Character weapons could be lightsabers instead of swords (single blade, dual-blade, dual-wield, etc...), blaster rifles or bows instead of guns, bare fists, etc...

5. Instead of magic there would be force powers. Force lightning instead of thunder/bolt/lightning, force choke instead of gravity/demi, etc. We've even seen Jedi use haste in The Phantom Menace: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky28L5l64kk

6. There are lots of ways the plot could go. You know how they have different ranks in SOLDIER in FF7? They could have different Jedi ranks and the main character could start out trying to go through the training and climb through the ranks, but then maybe halfway through it the emperor/king/ruler reveals his true identity and decides to take over the galaxy, and then the game goes from trying to be a Jedi Master to trying to save the galaxy. It could even be a little like Star Ocean here and have you go from planet to planet. It would be cool if maybe Rian Johnson and Yoshinori Kitase could team up on the plot. According to wikipedia it says ""at the age of 11, Kitase watched the movie Star Wars for the first time and was deeply impressed with it."", implying that's what got him interested in the industry: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshinori_Kitase 

7. Characters - Star Wars has a wide variety of different character types that would be interesting. Jedi, Sith, droids, wookies &amp; creatures, non-force users, etc. Preferably Tetsuya Nomura could do the character designs here to give it a Final Fantasy feel but still have it be Star Wars themed.

8. Post game dungeon - It could be in a new Death Star and when you get to the center you have to fight an ancient Sith Lord. It could be divided into 4 or 5 layers with a save point on each layer.

9. Vehicles - Star Wars has lots of cool vehicles and ships but maybe here they could kind of mix FF &amp; SW by having futuristic-looking airships. Smaller ones for travelling around on a planet and bigger ones for travelling from planet to planet.

10. Other ideas - in addition to the regular Final Fantasy styled gameplay there are also lots of other potential gameplay sections. Maybe include some airship vs airship fights like Skies of Arcadia. You know how they had the huge clone army scenes in Episode 2 and the Gungan vs Federation battle in Episode 1? Imagine an army of Storm Troopers vs an another army with the main characters caught somewhere in the middle. What if by the end of the story the main character is so strong he can force-throw an AT-AT out of the way? Lots of possibilities.

11. Realistic graphics - not stylalized, cell shaded, or anything like that.

12. Locations - there are plenty of great locations within the Star Wars universe with a variety of conditions. Even new settings created just for the game would be fine and some could be based on Final Fantasy settings.

personalfinance,What is the best way to find rates on personal loans?,"I resigned from my job earlier this month because I was accepted to a well-regarded coding bootcamp (session begins in early March, ends in early June) with a relatively small amount of savings. Not the best plan, I know, but I decided to go for it--needed the career change and wanted to spend every waking moment preparing for this program to be the best prepared student on day 1.

I have decided to pay the deposit for the program by paying for it via credit card, and then transferring the balance to another credit card with 0% promotional APR for 12 months (3% transfer fee). This will just about max out this credit line. I currently have a good credit score (~730 per creditkarma) although this should also take a small dip--I applied for a credit card yesterday with 0% apr for 15 billing cycles on all purchases/transfers and was denied.

I have enough money saved to get by but not enough to finance all of my needs between now and early September (80% of graduates place a job within the first 3 months after the program). What is the best way to secure a loan of ~4k and how would you time it? I assumed an unsecured personal loan is the best way via bank or credit union. I worry that if I wait until I need the money to secure the loan, I will have a harder time securing it/get worse interest rates since one credit line is maxed out. Alternatively, if I secure the loan earlier, I will begin paying it off earlier which is also a concern. If there is a smarter alternative to unsecured personal loans, please suggest it. Otherwise, how would you recommend I search for rates? Is nerdwallet a reliable source? 

**tl;dr** Need ~4k to cover costs between now and Sep. Best way to finance this? If unsecured personal loan, how to search rates? When would you time it if you're worried about declining credit score affecting loan rates the more you wait?",finance
personalfinance,Secured Credit Cards to boost my credit score?,"Hey guys I am looking into getting a secured credit card, because my credit score is an absolute mess. I hadn't been making payments on time towards my student loans, mostly because I didn't have a stable job and had more important expenses to take care off. However, I recently learned that the D.O.E. fully paid them off without notifying me, has this happened to anyone else before? 

Well now that I don't have to worry about my student loans I have been looking at ways to boost my credit score (450) back to at least 600. I applied to a regular Discover card and was declined, although this was before the D.O.E. paid off my loans. I'm pretty sure I will get declined again if I try to apply for a regular card and I don't want another decline to further damage what is already wrecked. That's how I came across secured cards.

Right now I see three cards that look decent and I may have a chance of being approved for: Discover Secured Card, Capital One Secured Mastercard, and OpenSky Secured Visa Card. The Discover and Capital One have pretty high variable APRs, but are also an ideal pick if I'd like to upgrade to an unsecured. On the other hand OpenSky has a relatively low APR (although I'm not sure about current rates) and no credit check to apply. However, OpenSky can't be upgraded to an unsecured card down the road.

So my question to you guys is basically which card should I apply for? Is having the option to upgrade more valuable than a lower APR? If OpenSky doesn't do a credit check should I apply to either of the first two AND Opensky? I figure if I have both and they are constantly reporting to the three bureaus then I will boost my score faster, unless my logic is flawed. I now also have a steady income ($14/hr plus tips) and no longer have any immediate expenses since I am living with family, so managing such a low credit line won't be a problem. 

The only thing I will use the card for are groceries (twice a month, about $100) and transportation (once a week, $40). Of course I plan to only use the card as a debit card, but I've heard that with the way they report to the credit bureaus it is best to set up an automatic payment for the minimum rather than immediately paying the card off every time. Is that true? The interest rates on these cards makes that idea seem very undesirable. but if that's what will help me boost my score I'm willing to do it.

Thanks for sticking till the end! Any feedback would be GREATLY appreciated.

TL;DR: Are secured credit cards worth it? If so which one should I get, and should I apply for two, if one of them doesn't do a credit check? Apologies for any typos.",finance

personalfinance,How do I calculate how much mortgage interest I will pay in 2018?,"I know at the end of the year I'll get a statement from my mortgage lender about how much interest I paid for tax purposes but for planning purposes I'm trying to figure it out now. I made my first mortgage payment today, Feb 1st. The starting balance is $485,000, the interest rate is 3.6%, and I'll make 11 payments this year (of $2,750 but that includes taxes and insurance). I will pay a tiny bit extra toward principal but for this calculation I'm disregarding that, I just want a ballpark of how much of the money is going toward interest.",finance
personalfinance,Just some prepaid tax card questions i need amswered...Explain to me like im 5 please!,"I feel like the websites dont give me the answers i need or word them in ways i find confusing.

Simply put. I did my taxes thru turbo tax and i decided to recieve a prepaid card for my return.

Now my question is with this card will i be charged monthly fee?
Is there a fee for withdrawing money from every atm or is there specific atms i can go to that wont charge?

Also once the card is empty is that it? Or will it continue to try and charge me for having the card activated?

Im completely lost on this and when i try to find answers its all worded in odd ways i cant understand.

So talk to me like you would a toddler please lol


Also im in california if it helps any



Also to add...im not exactly sure it this card is with netspend or greendot (or if theyre the same darn thing) so i still keep getting confused.

Also i read that there is a monthly fee but thats waived if you put at least 1000 in it (which my return is a little over 1000) 

So if im right can i possibly just get the card, go to an atm and withdraw it all out (says i can take out up to 3000 from an atm apparently) and then make sure the card is closed and no longer active?


Also will the card include my federal AND state return or just my federal? This is my first time recieving a state return so im not sure if theyre seperate or together",finance

personalfinance,Filing Tax Return Advice,"For years now I've done my own taxes through the various software applications out there. Just imported in my w-2, add mortgage interest and off it went. I didn't worry about deductions or other ways to maximize my refund. With the new tax law and life events in 2017, Im concidering getting a tax pro. 

In 2017:
- I maintained the same job.
- I pay a mortgage 
-Got married in October(woot woot)
-Opened an 401K through work

-My wife also maintained the same job
-She is paying off a Federal and Private student loan 

With that in mind would it be beneficial to get a pro or stick to doing my own taxes? Thanks for any advice in advance. Asking a few friends it seems that 150-200 is the range they in the Chicagoland area.

CryptoCurrency,Why I Am Holding LoMoCoin (LMC) (LoMoStar),"There are so many things I want to say about LoMoCoin/LoMoStar that I'm not sure if I'll be able to cover everything in one post.. Well, unless you want to read 20 pages.. Let's just see where this article takes us and go from there.. In order to understand why LoMoCoin is undervalued you must understand the market it's targeting..  In fact this is a difficult post to write because there is so much to cover, but I will do my best.. 

'Incentivized shopping' is a big deal in Asia..  In China, if you wanted a coupon for Burger King you simply open WeChat, follow burger king and within seconds you have access to coupons. This has been so ingrained in society that nearly every reputable business now has a WeChat account.  On top of that, many businesses offer VIP cards or VIP memberships which gives you additional deals on your future visits.. When it comes to offline shopping, the creative battle to get people in the door is becoming ever more prevalent.

To see how LoMoCoin plays in the big picture we'll start with explaining the LoMoCoin (LMC) Blockchain and then we will follow up with the primary application, LoMoStar (the star of the show). In the end I hope those who read this can understand the scale of this project and don't  under-estimate what we're dealing with here. In my opinion this asset has been undervalued for far too long and I believe its presence will be well known in the future.  

**About LoMoCoin (LMC)**

 &gt; ""The built-in LoMoCoin (LMC) of LoMoStar is similar to Bitcoin, which is a cryptocurrency with real value based on our own blockchain technology. Compared with traditional cryptocurrencies, LMC inherits the advantages of the related currencies which includes that the total amount is limited and cannot be over-issued.""

LoMoCoin is it's own blockchain and the consensus mechanism is Proof of Stake (PoS). Instead of a fixed interest rate like most currencies, LMC uses the coin age as a means to take part in the consensus process. The LMC blockchain supports cold staking. Functions such as a single private key address and multi-sig address are supported. It is also mentioned in the whitepaper that smart contracts will be integrated in the near future.

Now I know this stuff may sound like technical mumbo jumbo to you, but its important to know and well get to the more exciting stuff soon here..  In the meantime let's look at the LMC Blockchain.

**The LMC Blockchain**

The LoMoCoin (LMC) blockchain can be divided into 5 levels from a technical point of view..  (See whitepaper for full details.) 

* **Data layer** - The cryptography, Merkle Tree, and distributed ledger technology.
* **Network layer** - LMC uses a p2p protocal, which is also the basis of the decentralization of the LMC blockchain.
* **Consensus layer** - Proof of Stake (PoS) to reduce energy consumption.
* **Incentive layer** - Calculating interest depending on number of tokens staked.
* **Application layer** - The main application of the LMC application layer is **LoMoStar**. A number of applications based on smart contracts, such as virtual games and micro-asset-backed securitization (mini ABS), will also be introduced and encouraged. 

So think of it like LoMoCoin is the decentralized framework for the LoMoStar ecosystem.. (LoMoCoin was rebranded to LoMoStar in v2.0) So now that we have covered the technical details of LoMoCoin (LMC) let's take a look at the LoMoStar app..

**What is LoMoStar?**

LoMoStar is the main primary application built on the LMC blockchain (available on Android and iOS). When your talking about LoMoStar it's more then just getting discounts at local shops and collecting crypto on a map.. LoMoStar is a vast social ecosystem that evolves around people-to-people, people-to-asset, and people-to-organization (and vice versa). The vision set forward by the CEO 'Xiong Lijian' has been overlooked by nearly every investor.. (I say nearly because there's only a handful of people who actually research with an optimistic outlook on blockchain technology long term..) So before I begin, I would like to applaud the CEO Xiong Lijian for taking on a massive project which I believe will turn many people's dreams into a reality.

**LoMoStar - Social Events Platform with Cryptocurrency**

&gt; ""LoMoStar will integrate ones geographical position with its virtual environment and will use cryptocurrencies as its social medium to introduce new forms of relationships with one another. Also, by allowing for global (group) interactions, LoMoStar will facilitate international social relationships. In addition, people can develop business relationships at LoMoStar to enhance the influence of individuals, increase brand awareness, and/or improve business development.""

For example, in the LoMoStar app, I can geographically drop a red envelope that contains any cryptocurrency.  Before I drop red envelopes I could include an image and a short message. Anyone who opens this red envelope will be rewarded with cryptocurrency and will automatically join my group. (You can quit a group after 48 hours).

**Red Envelopes**

&gt; ""Airdrops of red envelopes, which contain cryptocurrencies, can be organized at certain geographical locations that have a sufficient density of users, for instance cities or popular public locations. Additionally, automated trading between users and investment opportunities will become available and people can use LoMoStar to perform many social related activities, such as marketing activities, group-related activities, organizing events, participating in treasure hunts, digital investments, and more. All these features enable LoMoStar to become a unique social and economic platform. The establishment of these social relationships and global interactions can fulfill both individual, group and corporate interests and desires, forming a win-win or multi-win situation.""

For example, let's say there is a sporting event like the Super Bowl where a large gathering of people will attend. A corporation could Airdrop red envelopes specifically to this geographical location for sports fans to pick up. Or let's say a local festival wants more attendance they can arrange an airdrop at the festivals location. You can pretty much target any area that contains a sufficient density of users. 

* Users can add personalized design elements to red envelopes to target the specific interests of the group.
* Users can select any supported cryptocurrency to send/drop using red envelopes.
* Users can grow their fan base and enhance their influence by continuously launching new and exciting red envelopes.
* Offer special discounts and promotions that can only be found through red envelopes.
* Airdrop red envelopes in a geographical location of high density.
* Take part in a hidden treasure hunt looking for red envelopes.

Users will use their own ingenuity to create new forms of social entertainment. (As outlined below in the whitepaper)

* A birthday party invitation can be airdropped to a doorstep.
* A welcome gift could be left at the airport for an out-of-town visitor.
* A breadcrumb trail of red envelopes can be left along the Great Wall of China for people to follow.
* You can mark all your favorite restaurants geographically with a red envelope.
* Whole networks of virtual relationships can be called into real-world action.
* By specifying areas, people, functionality and other conditions, users can invest various new and interesting ways to develop social relationships with one another.


**Peer-to-peer Cryptocurrency Trading**

&gt; "" LoMoStar supports using any cryptocurrency to conduct trading, whether it is for physical goods, services or digital assets. LoMoStars underlying technology will therefore enable peer-to-peer trading with one another.""

The plan is to support any cryptocurrency to exchange for physical goods, services or digital assets. (LoMoStar hand selects and reviews each supported coin.) In addition LoMoStar allows messaging between users and groups with the ability to send/drop red envelopes.

**Digital assets based on Location-based System (LBS)**

&gt; ""Through LoMoStar, people can also invest in many real-world businesses on certain geographical locations, such as retail, real estate, attractions, and more. LoMoStar will allow users to utilize cryptocurrency for investing in retail, real estate, attractions and other various immovable properties in order to gain profits.""

This is a very ambitious vision and I like it... The thought of being able to invest in real-world businesses and assets using crypto is music to my ears.  Let's look into this a little more and highlight some things from the whitepaper..

&gt; ""By connecting users to each other in the virtual world and then to assets in the real world, LoMoStar creates a novel setting where unpredictable social and economic relationships can spontaneously flourish within user-created scenarios. This will promote the use of cryptocurrencies in the real world and allow completely new ecological models and scenarios to emerge.""

Here is an example noted from the white paper.

&gt; ""Taking the vending machines as an example, which is one of the most common automatic trading devices, the holder can divide the income rights of a predetermined period and then launch the installation address of the device on the LoMoStar map. The (1) the product service description, (2) investment price of the income rights after division, (3) income distribution overview, and (4) other related information will then also be given. There are other types of devices that work similarly as a vending machine (e.g. self- service photo machine, self-service massage chair, and/or a doll machine) that can be used as a similar example. If LoMoStar users are interested, they can use cryptocurrency to invest and purchase the rights of these devices on the virtual map and thereby allow the possibility to generate an income from their (virtual) investments.""

So now you can see, LoMoStar is not 'Just a game where you pick up cryptocurrency on a map'. LoMoStar aims to promote the use of cryptocurrency in the real world by acting as a bridge connecting the two worlds - ultimately revealing the true value of cryptocurrency.

**Functional Level of LoMoStar**

* **Payment transaction function** - Users can make use of various cryptocurrencies in order to invest in assets.
* **Red envelope function of cryptocurrency** - One of the most important functions of the application. Red envelopes with cryptocurrencies creates a new social landscape to be explored. 
* **LBS Geographic location components** - A lot of LoMoStar is based on one's location. Scenarios such as regional red envelopes and location based advertising can be made available.
* **Cryptocurrency wallet** - Because most interactions involve cryptocurrency, the use of a wallet is necessary.
* **Group function** - Group holder can invite others to join their group. Users can then drop red envelopes and communicate in this group.
* **Cryptocurrency marketing** - Businesses can make use of red envelopes with cryptocurrency inside of them as a new way to promote their brands and increase sales.
* **More functions in development.**

&gt; ""LoMoStar will also allow ICO's to integrate new blockchain projects. Only cryptocurrencies and projects with high investment value will be made available to our users.""

**Construction of the LoMoStar ecology.**

* Completed : The foundation has been laid by connecting the global cryptocurrency framework.
* Expand the financing of blockchain enterprises with mainstream participation.
* Integrate the boundary between the real world and the virtual world using the O2O marketing model. (Offline-to-Online marketing)
* Expansion of Smart Contracts.
* Integration with the Internet of Things. (IoT)
* Integration of ""Big Data"".

&gt; ""LoMoStar aims to integrate the physical world and the virtual world through the blockchain. The physical world lacks channels for democracy while the virtual blockchain world lacks social innovation. The goal is to bring these two worlds together.""

**The LoMoStar Team**

When we look at the team, it is truly an impressive force that delivers results. Building a new social ecosystem requires engineers in all fronts. From developing blockchain technology to F5 Lab to the LoMoStar app for android and ios.  Let's also not forget [xStar.io](https://xstar.io/) the Digital Assets Exchange aimed to strengthen the LoMoStar ecosystem. The team is building all the essential components needed to improve asset liquidity and long-term asset stability.. the bottom line here is.. the team is quite large and well organized.

Last year in an interview with the LoMoStar CEO Xiong Lijian, he mentioned they had more than 30 people on the team.

&gt; ""LoMoCoin’s core team has been working together since 2013 and has experienced the mining and trading of Bitcoin and Litecoin in the early days. We are also one of the first teams in China that begun R&amp;D application and development of blockchain technology. At present, there are more than 30 people in our team and we have started to recruit talents all around the globe with the ability to settle in various countries and regions to jointly promote and help develop LoMoCoin.""

Today they now have over 70 employees (so I hear) and are expecting to exceed 100 employees in the near future. Now since we are looking at the team, let's take a look at a few questions and answers from some interviews. (Interview links are posted in references.)

-----

**Interview Q&amp;A from Xiong Lijian (CEO) / Taoji Zou (Chief Marketing Officer)**

**What kind of advantages will LMC have within the application in comparison to BTC/ETH/LTC, etc.? This is still unclear.**

&gt; This can, for instance, be when ICO projects are promoted and only LMC holders will be able to participate. More than 10 projects have recently already discovered the value of LoMoStar and hope to promote and even accept LMC as an investment. We choose projects very selectively and they are still under review.

**Can you tell us how XStar will help with the growth of LMC?**

&gt; XStar is a trading platform that I and some other friends in the Chinese community have set up, not only to provide liquidity to LMC, but also because we are optimistic about the future of the blockchain industry. LoMoStar and XStar will be mutually reinforcing each other. Moreover, XStar is a trading platform that will provide a different and larger trading experience, which is not exactly the same as that of LoMoStar. This is what we have discovered in the Chinese market. Also, from a perspective of marketing theory, different needs of user groups can be mutually relocated. Therefore, LoMoStar and XStar may adopt different approaches and strategies when they are promoted in various countries. In any case, if LoMoStar first enters a country, it can help XStar; if XStar first enters a country, likewise, it can in turn help LoMoStar.

**Do you think your marketing budget is enough to cover all your future plans (e.g. exchange costs, hiring foreign specialists etc.)?**

&gt; Our company has a healthy financial position and we are fairly certain that it is enough to support our marketing efforts. We will also use our budget to participate in conferences and events all around the globe.

**Are you going to integrate Augmented Reality (AR) features? And if so, does the current app functionality allow for it?**

&gt; We have a well connected partner that we have a good relationship with, as their founder used to develop mining machines with our CEO. This enterprise is experienced in developing chips and advanced AR techniques. In the future, sooner or later, AR will be adopted in any location-based system (LBS) application. Inside our firm we are always talking about AR and we believe that when the AR techniques and implementation possibilities get improved we will certainly adopt it in LoMoStar.

**How will you protect LoMoCoin (LMC) investors and increase the interest of using LMC inside of the app, since you have also added other currencies such as Ethereum and Bitcoin?**

&gt; A key feature of a currency is security and liquidity, which will also affect LMC. We will add more digital currencies in the future. Global users and transaction volume will be increased this way. Additionally, when you run a club and have a lot of guests invited. There will be social demand for every guest. Nevertheless, you as the host will almost always get prioritized in the long-term by all of these guests.

**Can you tell us about the F5 lab? How many full-time employees are there? Is it a subsidary of LoMoStar or is it an independent research lab? What are they working on now?**

&gt; F5 Labs is a professional technology collaboration, and the technology we develop and share inside is more ‘professional’ and complex than that of the general programmer community. It will be focusing on B2B relationship initially.

**How will you ensure exclusivity for LMC within the LoMoStar app? What will ensure the app will use LMC?**

&gt; There is no doubt that many exclusive features will be implemented in the future within the app where you must use LoMoCoin to complete.

**How will iBeacon/IoT be implemented? Will it be implemented onto the LMC chain?**

&gt; We are very interested and involved in the development of the Internet of Things. Our CEO next week will also visit the Lenovo Group training session as they are looking for solutions that is combining blockchain technology and the Internet of Things. I think everyone may have heard of the Lenovo Group, they acquired IBM personal computer business in the past.

**What is your future plan to attract more investments?**

&gt; From the scope of my responsibility, I am more concerned about the ecological construction of LoMoStar. Overall when it comes to marketing, it is something that money can solve. Moreover, we have always kept in touch with prominent exchanges and we have made some progress here. We will inform you when we are able to confirm more.

Well I guess that turned out to be a long article! Remember you should always do your own research and come up with your own assessment before investing. There is a lot more information available in the links below. I am just giving you my personal insight on LoMoStar (LMC) and why I feel this is one of the largest and most undervalued blockchain projects in China. Remember, everything you invest in should be for the long-term and patience is key.

BTC2018

**Using LoMoStar**

You can download LoMoStar for Android at the Google Play store and it's also available for iOS.  After you register and login, you can begin opening red envelopes and collecting cryptocurrency. Members who complete the AML/KYC verification can send/drop red envelopes in the ecosystem. When you open a red envelope it will use 1 vitality point. (You will earn 1 vitality every 2 hours) Given there are a bunch of red envelopes to open (but not enough vitality) you can spend Diamonds to open the red envelope containing the largest reward. (Diamonds can be purchased from the shop)

personalfinance,"I owe $4000 in taxes but I only make $15,000 a year","What happened?! I work as a teaching assistant at a special needs school and don't make very much. Usually I qualify for an earned income credit and get back a few hundred at tax time but this year they are saying I owe 2600 in federal and 1300 in state taxes. What should I do?

I did get some federal health insurance premium subsidies this year, which I was expecting to have to pay back, but they only provided me with $2000 in benefits for the year so it just doesn't add up. 

The biggest thing was I acquired control of my dad's stock account. He saved up around $15,000 for me for college and I never used it. He set it up as some kind of stewardship and they forced him to give it to me completely once I turned 26. Before it transferred over though he sold all the stocks and the money was just sitting in a money market waiting to be reinvested. I'm thinking they are taxing me on the stocks sold since it happened in 2017, even though it was in my dad's name when it was sold. 

I don't have that kind of money, and paying a third of the college money is some bullshit. Is this normal? Should I try and avoid taxes by opening an IRA or something? Or did I just mess up somewhere on my taxes and it's all a mistake?",finance

personalfinance,New federal tax structure + dependents = higher state tax liability?,"So I finished up my 2017 taxes last night.  Federal came out owing $20.  Congratulated self on careful management of withholding.  

Colorado state taxes came out owing $970. And combing through the forms showed no problems.  Colorado's tax form just copies over the federal taxable income from the 1040, adds back a couple income categories that are federally deductible but not state deductible (like the state income tax deduction), and multiplies that by a flat 4.6%.  My actual tax liability was higher than my withholding by almost $40 per paycheck.

Colorado doesn't have a state-specific version of the W-4, they claim you can use the federal form, use that same number of allowances/filing status/paycheck frequency, plug into CO's withholding table and it'll work out.  

I think the federal allowances accounting for the child tax credit is what made things get out of whack.  We have two kids, and our income qualifies for the full $1000/kid credit, so I'm claiming 8 federal allowances.  BUT, that credit has no impact on my ""taxable income"" (get's subtracted later), so won't actually reduce my state tax liability.

Ok, so I can give a different number for state allowances, pay a little more each paycheck, and come out more even.  Colorado's ""underpayment penalty"" threshold is $1000, so fortunately no extra costs were incurred, but it was pretty close...

But then (and finally getting around what I wanted to ask about) it occurred to me that this would be an even bigger problem on my 2018 taxes.  For 2017, I was able to subtract $30,150 from my AGI (13950 in itemized deductions + 16200 for 4 exemptions) to get taxable income used by the state.  Next year, we'll only be subtracting $24,000 (new MFJ standard deduction, no exemptions).  Federal taxes will still be an improvement with its increased child tax credit, but again that credit is ""invisible"" to the state tax form.

I guess I'm not sure what I expect from writing up this post.  On the one hand, I think it may be valuable to look into your state's taxes and allowances to see if this will impact you.  I suspect it'll only be an issue for families with two or more kids, since that's the point where the new standard deductions becomes less than old standard + old exemptions.  I also have no experience with taxes in other states, but I'm assuming (unless the state doesn't have its own income tax) that they all get fed your Federal taxable income number as a starting point?",finance

personalfinance,Can you change the bank your new auto loan is with?,I just bought a new car 2 months ago.  My Credit is perfect and the interest rate was the same with everyone. The dealership didn’t deal with the bank I usually used but they dealt with BB&amp;T and since it was all the same price and everything I figured it would be simple sure just go through them.  I’m only 2 months into it and it has been a nightmare. You call their 800 number it has never been less than 30 min wait. My first payment was sent back with no explanation.  They somehow screwed up my address big time so I’ve never received a payment booklet. I’ve been to the local branch 3 times over problems. They suck so much.   How can I change the loan to my bank or any other bank?   Is that refinancing?  Are there fees?   I just wanna switch it to my bank they’re awesome.  Can I do that now?

Also should I still be depositing the maximum £200 in to the help to buy Isa each month and then transferring it into the Life time Isa towards the end of the tax year, or simply transfer my money straight into the lifetime Isa each month and stop depositing money into the help to buy Isa?

Let's say your tax return is $3,500. At 1.5% interest rate, that's $52 per year. For a lot of Americans, a one-time refund of $3,500 is worth the loss of $52 of potential interest.*

Sometimes finance is not about the perfect technical answer but rather what works in practice.

*It would be even less than $52 because that $3500 would be deposited over 12 months, not all at once on January 1st.",finance

litecoin,Recent Charges From Using Coinbase And Credit Card (Important),"Hello Friends,
Some of you may or may not know that COINBASE transactions have currently changed in regards to fee for many credit card transactions. It may be showing up as a ""cash advance"" on your statement for those who have their credit card linked to the account. There was a change in the MCC code fore digital purchases, and the fees can be quite high. I contacted my credit card and the interest on such 'loans' are 26+ percent, and also 10%$ or 5% fees on each transaction. Be aware of this, because it surprised me when I inquired about such fees. Here is the conversation I had with a credit card rep.

Hello, good morning. I have a few questions in regards to COINBASE transactions, in regards to fees incurred on my account. It shows that these transactions are showing up as 'cash advances', what kind of fee will be attached to such transactions? Also, I do not see any additional fees logged or shown near these transactions, are they already applied? Thank you.

Credit Card Company Rep Kourtney at 8:29, Feb 1: To clarify, the way a Coinbase transaction is put through is based on them, the merchant, directly, although, if it is submitted as a cash advance, there will be a fee of 5% or $10, whichever is greater, and a variable interest rate of 26.49% accruing daily.

Kourtney at 8:30, Feb 1: It does show though, that the Coinbase charges on your account are indeed, cash advances.

You at 8:31, Feb 1: COINBASE CHEAPSIDE GB Collapse Details Additional Details Transaction Type: Cash Advances Posted Date: Jan. 29, 2018

Kourtney at 8:31, Feb 1: Yes, correct.

Kourtney at 8:31, Feb 1: It's a cash advance.

You at 8:31, Feb 1: So it shows this on my side, dose that mean i am getting a cash advance charge?

Kourtney at 8:31, Feb 1: Yes.

You at 8:33, Feb 1: And how will that work? 10$ on each transaction, a one time fee? or a reoccurring 26.49% charge. im a bit confused

You at 8:33, Feb 1: It shows no charge under or on the transaction

Kourtney at 8:34, Feb 1: Your current Cash Advance Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is 26.49%. This APR is a variable rate based off your Prime Rate of 4.5% plus 21.99%. Interest will accrue daily on cash advances until the date the cash advance is paid in full. The fee is 5% of each individual advance total or $10 minimum per advance.

You at 8:37, Feb 1: I just am a bit confused at the fact that it is showing up in such a way. And that I would be penalized for taking a 'cash advance' out from a third party. Although it is not actually a cash advance, but rather a purchase in a stock like commodity.

Kourtney at 8:39, Feb 1: To clarify, you are not being penalized, though, cash advances do have fees and interest.

Kourtney at 8:40, Feb 1: Also, based on the type of transaction it is, the merchant, Coinbase, submits them as cash advances, as you are essentially purchasing digital currency.

You at 8:42, Feb 1: So cash advances not taken out directly from the credit card are also considered cash advances?

You at 8:43, Feb 1: I do not see the fees listed anywhere near the transaction, so its hard to follow/ track.

Kourtney at 8:43, Feb 1: Correct. A cash advance is when this card is used to withdraw money, purchase currency, etc.

You at 8:45, Feb 1: So if I pay it off instantly on credit cards end, will the 26% interest not apply?

You at 8:45, Feb 1: Just recurring debt correct?

Kourtney at 8:46, Feb 1: Interest begins accruing the day the advance is processed, until the day it's paid in full. If paid the same day, there will be 1 day of interest.

You at 8:46, Feb 1: Ok, got it. Thank you for your time

personalfinance,Paying off debt - How to apply tax refund,"Hi all; 

I'm looking for a quick bit of advice as to how to apply my tax refund this year. 
Right now, my plan is to apply it to car/credit card debt with a bit set aside for savings.

Here's the rough numbers:
My wife and I have a combined income of around $60,000 per year. 
Currently, we have have the following debts. 
-credit card for $3000. 0% interest until October '18. 
-credit card for $800. ~20% interest
-car loan with $2500 remaining at 7% interest
-car loan with $5100 remaining at 4% interest. 

Now, here's my initial plan. We've already filed our tax returns and are expecting about $4700 back. 
My thoughts:
-Save $1000 (used to double emergency fund) 
-Pay off $800/20% credit card entirely
-Pay $2000 towards $3000/0% until Oct. 18 credit card
-Put remainder (~$900) towards car loan (7%/$2500).

So, that would leave me with:
$1400 on car loan @ 7% ($150/month payment)
$1000 on second CC
$5100 on car loan @ 4%. 

I've been paying above the minimum on the first CC (20%/$800), paying $100 per month rather than $25 (minimum payment). By my count - if I pay this card off entirely and apply that same money to my second CC, I'll have it paid off by Sept-October, before the 0% interest period runs out. 
Similarly, I should have my car (7%) paid off by around this time at well - at which time I'll be able to dedicate that payment towards the other car (4%/5100) which should be able to get paid off by early 2019. 

So, does this all seem sound so far? By my math, I'll have eliminated all ""short term"" debt by about May-June 2019 and will have avoided paying interest as best I can. My thinking is that the 4% car loan is a low enough rate that I should prioritize the other payments first.

The only other wrinkle here is that I have around $30,000 in student loan debt, but the majority of it is at a decent interest rate (around 5-6%). So I'm of the opinion that it makes more sense to pay off the short term/high interest stuff first then focus more of that money towards student loans, but I'm willing to entertain other ideas.

Mostly, I'm just looking for confirmation that this is a good plan and am interested in hearing your input. Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Can you contribute 100% of paycheck to 401k and can you change the?,"I earn $16.00 per hour and get paid biweekly.  Currently, I withhold 0 personal allowances and am single.

Well...as I was doing my federal taxes I'm going to be getting a $2,000 refund so the next paycheck I want to deposit all of it into my 401K. 

And can I change my 401k contribution each pay period? So 100% back to 7%?

personalfinance,Is a master's degree worth the debt for me?,"Hey all! Here's my situation; I have $28k in current loans with an average interest rate of 4.3% for an undergraduate degree in psychology and sociology. I also have a car payment that is $286 per month. I will be graduating in May and hoping to find a job as a TSS. It's low pay, but it's good experience for future grad applications. I highly doubt I'm going anywhere with these degrees, and the plan has always been graduate school. However, I've been crunching the numbers for tuition and cost of living, and I'm starting to get really bad anxiety.

I am looking mostly at in-state public schools in Pennsylvania for school psychology. The programs range from 63-70 so credit hours with ~$500 per credit hour, so even without considering cost of living I'm looking at an additional $60k in debt without factoring in interest if I don't get any funding, and my resume is not very extensive; there is a good possibility I won't get funding and the funding for these programs is poor anyway. The ""living stipend"" at some schools is $5k per year. After cost of living and other expenses, I could be looking at over $100k in debt. There is also a required internship in the third year, full time, and possibly unpaid.

The career prospects for school psychology are supposed to be really good; there is a national shortage. I have seen estimates for median salary around $63k, and estimates for starting salary range from $40k-50k. Late career, I could be looking at upwards of $80k in salary, assuming the education budget actually gets funded by the government.

There's also the fact that it's my ideal career, and if it weren't for the debt I'd do it in a heartbeat. I really want to be a school psychologist, but the debt is making me anxious and depressed. My financial goals are to live alone after grad school; I am willing to live in an efficiency apartment and sacrifice many of the ""goodies"" in life for a few years, but I don't want to be in debt forever and would like a reasonable standard of living at some point.

Is pursuing this financially sensible?",finance

Leftover Income: $275

My assets currently: $50k in my 401k, $3200 in savings. I'm 34 years old. My credit score is 760. I'm single with two healthy dogs. My savings is my emergency fund for things like vet bills or a car breakdown/accident.

Bitcoin,Coinbase BTC purchase coded as Cash Advance -- Is it Coinbase or CC companies who code the transactions like that?,"I've read a few related threads on this &amp; thought I'd share my own experience, in case it helps anyone...

I made 3 (small) purchases of BTC on a Chase Ink CC this month.  Then I got an email yesterday from Coinbase warning users that sometimes CC companies list these as cash advances. 

The first purchase on my Chase Ink CC was listed as a sale. But, the next two were indeed listed as cash advances.  Thus, they will:

* incur a 26% interest rate (although I will pay them off)
* incur a $15 transaction fee for EACH ""cash advance""

Needless to say, I was pretty alarmed.  I called Chase &amp; showed them that the first one was a ""sale"" ... and argued that the others should also have been sales.  

Almost immediately, the rep WAIVED the two $15 fees. So, that was good.

I asked her:  ""Who codes these as Cash Advances? Is it the MERCHANT, or is it Chase or the Visa network?""

She said that the MERCHANT (ie Coinbase) controls how the charge comes through.

However, Coinbase's email seemed to imply the contrary. It said: ""Recently, the MCC code for digital currency purchases was changed by a number of the major credit card networks.""  This makes it sound like they ran the CCs the same as always, but that the CC companies simply treat the charges differently.

Seems like someone is wrong... either Coinbase is in control of how their transactions show up at CC companies, or the CC companies treat Coinbase transactions as they like.  I'm being told two different things.  

In the end, I got my ""transaction fees"" reversed pretty easily with Chase. I hope others do, too.  And, I guess I finally learned not to buy BTC w/ a CC anymore.  Still, it seems like Coinbase and/or the CC companies might see some class action-type suits over this, I'd wager.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,I want to start paying off my student loans before I graduate.,"Hi, 
So I'm currently in my second-year in college and I will be graduating in Spring 2020. I've realized that my scholarships and grants pay for my tuition and housing so I don't necessarily need to take out any more loans. Before, I never had any guidance with how to finance college so I just accepted all of the federal loans that were offered to me.
Anyway, I want to avoid the massive debt from when I graduate. I know I can't pay them all off with my minimum wage job but I figured that if I start decreasing my debt with money I would have spent eating out or shopping I would be doing myself a favor. The problem is that I don't know which loan I should pay off first. I want to have to pay the least amount of money using the Avalanche Method.

Here are all of my loans: 
1. $3,500 Subsidized Loan with a 3.760% Interest Rate
2. $2,000 Unsubsidized Loan with a 3.760% Interest Rate (I already owe $94.55 in outstanding interest)
3. $1,000 Subsidized Loan with a 3.760% Interest Rate
4. $4,500 Subsidized Loan with a 4.450% Interest Rate
5. $2,000 Unsubsidized Loan with a 4.450% Interest Rate (I already owe $23.11 in outstanding interest)

I was thinking that I should either pay off the fourth or the fifth loan because they have the highest interest rates but I would like to know what you guys think. 

Also, what does paying off my debt before I need to do for my credit? My credit score is fair but I want to start increasing it so I will be getting a credit card soon.

18000 at 3.0 with 450 monthly
29000 at 5.0 with 450 monthly

She will be quitting her job soon and wants to roll her existing 401K with her current employer and one she had with her previous employer to Vanguard. She has ~ $22K with the previous employer and $5K with her current employer. 

She's in her late 20s, so I'm thinking of telling her to put $5,500 into a Roth IRA and the rest ($22K) into Vanguard's Target Retirement 2055 Fund (VFFVX). She's thinking about going to grad school soon, so my understanding is that she can withdraw money out of her Roth IRA for grad school expenses. 

She hasn't secured her next job yet, so she won't have the option of rolling her 401Ks into a new one unless she just waits until she gets a new job.

Couple questions:
1. When she rolls over her two 401Ks, does she just put them into a traditional Vanguard IRA and then roll over $5.5K into a Vanguard Roth IRA?
2. Is using IRA money to help pay for grad school a bad idea? She already has some undergraduate loans and depending on how much she needs to borrow for grad school and at what interest rate, it might be beneficial to at least have the option to use money from a Roth IRA to spend on grad school expenses.

OPTION#7: Makes sense in the long run, but would be nice to increase cashflow or pay mortgage instead of rent.

Any help is most welcome.

personalfinance,My unconventional personal finance tip: buy an HP-12C and learn how to use it,"What's an HP-12C? It's a financial calculator released by Hewlett-Packard way back in 1981. And in the intervening 37 years (or 13,302 days - you can calculate days between dates on this thing or what date will it be ___ days from today!) nobody has invented a better one. These things are fast to use, useful, and built like tanks. Wall Street bankers still use them and the finance officer at your local car dealership will wilt like old spinach when you pull yours out during a negotiation. 


They have a *ton* of features that you may never use like discounted cash flow analysis, bond yield calculations, and even statistical functions. You can even write basic programs with it for multi-step calculations you need to do repeatedly. So why get one? Because the basic financial calculations are so useful to understand and easy to manage. Essentially the five keys in the top left are:

n: number of periods

i: interest rate

PV: present value

PMT: payment

FV: future value


And if you know any four of these values you can quickly find the fifth. 


For example: if you know what your maximum desired mortgage payment is, how long your loan will be, and what your interest rate is you can find your maximum mortgage amount. And once you have that amount you can tweak your variables and easily see what your new mortgage could be if your payment were $100 more. You can calculate how much interest you will pay over the life of a loan. You can calculate remaining balance of a loan at any given point in that loan’s life. You can see how much money you'll have at retirement (or whatever future date) based on monthly contributions of X and growing at what interest rate. I’m often using my HP12C while reading questions on r/personalfinance so I figure other people posting on here might benefit as well. With a solid grasp of the time value of money concept you can handle any finance question that's likely to come your way in life!


I also think our education system in the US fails a lot of people by not teaching personal finance classes. I don’t want to by cynical but I think there’s a lot of money to made off our financial ignorance in this country and perhaps that’s why there hasn’t been as big a push to teach us these things in high school. Buying an old HP-12C and then sitting down and working through the problem-solving guide is actually a *great* primer on these financial basics. Not only will you learn how your calculator works but you can learn some valuable information at the same time. And once you learn how to work your calculator you’ll be ahead of 90%+ of Americans in terms of financial savvy and understanding. 


Pro Tip: you can buy a new HP12C for $50-70 but for the same price, or even less, you can buy a vintage HP12C from eBay. I've had a couple of new ones (made in China) and they've both been lightyears behind the old 1980s made in America models in terms of build quality and construction. 


Here’s the one I use on a daily basis. I actually returned a newer one I had just bought after I found I used this one 99.9% of the time https://imgur.com/a/aB2P0",finance

The interest rate on these loans is significant -- ranging from ~5.75%-7%.

I have about $30k in savings in an account that earns ~1.5% a year and no debt, and think I will have about $60k by the end of the year. We are hoping to buy a home in the next year or two with a down payment of around $60-80k needed in our area.

Once we are married, should I pay off the parent plus loans or keep my savings to work toward a down payment? He will not be able to pay off a significant amount of the parent plus loans any time soon, as he also has over $100k in student loans that are on an income-based repayment plan that he's paying ~$600/month toward. He hopes to have that forgiven through the public service repayment program in the next ~5 years.

personalfinance,Couple Questions During Filing Taxes [Federal and PA State],"Hi, I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7uerqm/selffile_using_software_or_pro_multiple_state/) yesterday about finding this years taxes really confusing. This evening I decided to try the HR Block online filing and have made it pretty good so far but have come across a couple questions I'm not quite sure on. 

*  PA Tax: I paid Personal Property Tax in VA, but am not sure when PA bills for it. I don't have anything in my records and the revenue site has nothing on personal property aside from rebate info links. Is anyone familiar with PA Personal Property taxes?

*  If I pay into Medicare, does that mean I'm enrolled? Kinda confused because I thought this was for people 65+, I'm not even close to that

*  So far it says I owe about $1200, this seems rather high for someone who was a full time student half the year.

* The more complex question: I am at the point for Health Insurance and since May, I have been enrolled in an HDP. Prior to May(and technically all year), I was also covered by my parent's health insurance. What should I put for Jan-May for when I was covered only under theirs? Family insurance? What do I put for May-Dec when I was covered by both?",finance

Beginning at the end of February, if you have more than one loan serviced by Nelnet, any payment amount you make in excess of your current amount due will be allocated based on interest rates and repayment status. This may help you pay down your loans with the highest interest rate more quickly when you pay extra, which may save money in the long run.*

This shouldn't prevent you from also overpaying on specific loan groups. You can also opt to continue to have the overage divided up among all of your loans. A pretty neat change, if you ask me.",finance

ethereum,Looking for developers interested in startup crowdfunding project.,"Hello all,

Me and a small team are in the initial brainstorming phases of a project to fund startups and other business ventures using an ETH token. Several other companies are pursuing related concepts, however this is novel in that our aim is to be totally SEC compliant and transparent.

This is not going to be DAO. Human oversight will serve as a ""crypto-gap"" to ensure that no funds are stolen due to weaknesses in the code.

Our general model is a hybrid autonomous corporation, where investors contribute to a community ethereum pot which is used to fund ventures. In exchange, investors receive our company token which entitles it's bearer to a fractional percentage of that pot as well as votes in the company's decisions and which ventures are funded.

As the companies become successful the profits (or part of the profits) are fed back into the pot which increases the value of the company coin. The company would be owned by the token holder and would be overseen by an elected corporate board.

We already had a conversation with a SEC consulting firm that believes that it could be possible to legally create such an entity.

We are looking for a dedicated individual with moderate to advanced ETH Dev experience (smart contracts, custom token generation, and Dapp development) to serve as the head of tech development for the project. The dev should be enthusiastic, responsible, and most importantly excited for this project. We are offering co-founder status and equity in the company as compensation.

Feel free to message if you are interested in learning more, are interested in the position, or have suggestions on how to improve the concept.

personalfinance,Taxes; Bought a house and my tax refund is significantly less...did I do something wrong?!,"Massachusetts. Hopefully this is somewhere that can assist with this question, concern, plea for help/guidance? So, I decided to attempt to do my own taxes using TurboTax. I'm basically done, but it's saying I'll get ~$600 back from federal and state combined. This is more than $1,200 less than I got back last year. Major difference is a bought a house this year, in August, with my boyfriend. We are unmarried (hence 'boyfriend') and have to split all of the amounts (i.e. interest paid, taxes, etc.). The thing that may have caused issue is I got a second job a few months ago (minimum wage). I work a couple hours a week, but I think the money I got there caused me to get less back in my refund (~$2500). I haven't filed yet because I'm concerned I've done something wrong.


My income combined was: $56,915.00


I submitted and hit the max ($2500) for student loan interest.


Noted $462 in property taxes paid (but could only see them in my closing documents, they aren't on my mortgage 1098 forms...? shouldn't it be if I'm paying it via escrow?)

Bitcoin,Price Manipulation / Options,"All, I've been a bit taken back recently since the introduction of futures markets have been created with CME, CBOE, and soon to be NASDAQ. When considering that these futures markets are federally regulated yet the underlying bitcoin trading markets are not, it makes one look at the seemingly enormous opportunities for large players to manipulate this budding asset. Consider the following scenario:

Step 1: 

Wealthy investor requests a futures contract with CME or CBOE betting on the price increas over the period of said contract.

Step 2:

Wealthy investor purchases enough bitcoin to hit the futures contract. 

Step 3:

Wealthy investor cashes in futures contract for profit. 

Step 4: 

Wealthy investor requests a futures contract with CME or CBOE betting on the price decreasing over a certain period of time.

Step 5:

Wealthy investor then sells enough bitcoin to hit the futures contract price that he purchased. 

Step 6:

Wealthy investor cashes in futures contract for profit. 

The only saving grace that I see here is that supply determines value and there's only currently approximately 17,000,000 bitcoin. That's it! Eventually the common people will learn the benefits of bitcoin over fiat and purchase enough of these coins during the large manipulation that the elite are currently enjoying. That being said, to minimize the amount of potential manipulation in suggest taking the following steps until decentralized, open source exchanges are in full swing :

 1. Research ways to protect your btc. (hardware wallets, paper wallets, etc) 

 2. Purchase bitcoin from the current exchanges in accordance with your risk tolerance. 

 3. Immediately move purchases into addresses that you control and that are beyond the exchanges control / reach. 

The above steps are, in my opinion essential in preventing further manipulation. By doing so you not only create self sovereignty, but you also have access to any Forks that may occur in which said exchanges may not have given you (i.e. Coinbase).

personalfinance,Considering selling house and renting in a family member's house instead.,"I [posted a topic the other day](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7u7gh0/considering_buying_a_house_with_my_brother_and/) about possibly selling my house to buy one with my brother and his wife. I ended up deciding against it because I didn't want us to become financially interdependent.

However, another idea came to my mind, which was for them to buy a house on their own (they likely will even if I decide not to leave), then I could sell my house and move in with them as a renter.

The advantages I see:

* It wouldn't be a big change in lifestyle. They already live with me, and we live in relative harmony. The place they were looking at would be big enough that I would have about as much room as I do now.
* I would have about 70-80k left over after selling it. That money could be invested into stocks or something else.
* Provided that they don't charge me too much in rent, my net monthly income could go way up. Right now I generally have about $550 left over. If they were to charge me $400 (an educated guess on how much they will charge), I would make a net $1200 a month.
* There is an asphalt plant being built near my house that will be done in a year. While the asphalt company assures me it won't be an issue, it will be hard to convince prospective buyers it won't be. This could hurt my house's resale value. Selling soon could potentially prevent a major devaluation of my house.
* I'm not all that confident in the future of the town I live in. 1/3rd of the buildings on our main street are empty while neighboring towns continue to grow. I don't know if investing in a house in this kind of town is wise.
* I will be freed from the hidden burdens of home ownership. Even if my house was paid off, I'd still be paying over $450 in insurance, taxes, HOA fees, HVAC maintenance, and utility bills. And I wouldn't have to worry about nasty things like major house repair bills popping up.
* I'd have the financial freedom to move on to other things without being locked into a house.

The disadvantages I see:

* I'd no longer be able to say I own a home, though the prestige of that has faded for me somewhat.
* I'd be giving up an incredible interest rate loan. I am one year into a 10-year 1.99% loan. I won't find that again any time soon.
* If the new living arrangement doesn't work out, I will need to find a place to stay rather than having the house to myself.
* I could end up being wrong about this town, and my house skyrockets in value after I sell it.

My AGI was $16000 from paying $1000 in student loan interest.

After the standard deduction of $6350, and only myself as an exemption of $4050, 

my taxable income is now $5600 putting me in the 10% tax bracket. My tax is $558.

This is where y'all come in.

**Because I put away $1075 in my TSP (the Federal government's 401(k)) for 2017, and my AGI is less than $18500, a whopping 50% of the $1075 becomes a tax credit giving me $538 tax credit.**

We would like to reduce this refund but not eliminate it completely. We would prefer to err on the side of caution and aim for a ~$2,000 refund next year (I know its an interest free loan to the government, but we would like the buffer and forced savings). How would I go about determining our W4s? 

The IRS calculator is down so I have been playing around with 3rd party calculators with wildly varying results. Turbotax tells me to set both of us single and me to have 5 deductions and my wife to have 0. Doesn’t tell me what the expected refund outcome is either. The IRS 2017 worksheet tells me to have 1 deduction, unsure if single/married, an extra $5,000 withheld (Very possible I am doing it wrong). 

Could you guys please direct me to a more accurate calculator or better method or doing this? Is there a “rule of thumb”? I seem to be at a loss as my weekly paychecks vary so much.

I am new to personalfinances and still learning, please let me know if there is any other data I can provide! I have my W2s and my 2017 tax return in front of me.

personalfinance,1098-T questions/concerns,"Hello r/personalfinance,

I am in my final year of undergrad and have just received my tax information. Over the year, I worked at the college I attend in Oregon during the school year and had an internship in New York State (I am a resident in Oregon). I pay rent, am not married, and have no dependents.

At the Oregon job I made ~$8k, in New York (not NYC or Yonkers) I made ~$10k. $350 and $1500 were withheld federally, respectively. $390 was withheld for Oregon state taxes.  I pay for all of my housing/living while my parents cover my phone bill and I am on their health insurance (although I have only gone in for dental checkups for the last few years). As such, I pay for well over 50% of my yearly expenses.

My parents have typically claimed me as a dependent in the past, even during Sophomore/Junior (2016) year when I payed for housing/rent on my own. Additionally, they have claimed my 1098-t form. Because I made nearly $18k, my school is payed for in scholarships and federal loans (in my name), and I pay well over 50% of my expenses... I believe I should be claiming myself? Additionally, I should be filing the 1098-T to claim education credits? I am pretty certain of this but I am still in this weird transition where I was claimed dependent in 2016 and my father has always insisted that I be claimed dependent (which made sense when my parents payed for my dorm expenses freshman year... but now not so much) and, to be honest, I am pretty new to this stuff.

So, I filled out (but have not filed) the free TurboTax edition. For my federal return, It tells me that $1850 was withheld, I qualify for $1700 in credits ($700 for qualified higher education expenses and $1000 for the American Opportunity Tax Credit), and I was supposed to pay $700 in federal taxes. Therefore, I am receiving a federal return of $2850!!! I am a little scared that I am supposed to be receiving a refund greater than what I actually payed in taxes. Additionally, it states that my federal deductions/exemptions is upwards of $10,400. For state taxes, I owe Oregon $360 and am receiving $350 from New York State (although I see no state deduction section on my W2). 

Now, I kind of understand the educational credits but I just wanted to hear the opinion of others. This is something that I have never claimed for myself and I am a little surprised about how it affects my taxes. I understand that it is calculated from my 1098-T, so here is a little information:

I was billed ~$11500 for 2017, my scholarships totaled ~$4200, my adjustments from 2016 were $950. Also, this includes amounts for January-March of 2018. Everything else was payed for on the federal loan. I was also a full-time student during the academic school year.

Is there something that I am missing? I am worried with the return I am supposed to be receiving and my parents still insist that I must be claimed dependent.

Thanks for your help",finance

CryptoCurrency,Some glimpses of Hope. Your investment may still be worth something!,"TLDR: HODL

First of all, this is the toughest of times for any investor. When any market makes a correction, a lot of value disappears in thin air. When a volatile market like the cryptocurrency market corrects, it corrects just as volatile as it gains. The value lost is in our portfolio and every meme about strong hands apply for any of us still believing in their investments. To those people, I can only say, don’t give up, don’t sell, keep HODLing, you’re doing great. 

For those of you, who has lost faith due to all the heavy losses, let me show you some glimpses of hope. Let me show you why your investment may still be worth something over time, and why in a few years you’ll be bragging to your friends that you made the right decision investing in crypto while you’re deciding on the color of your Lambo. 
Bitcoin was started by people who believed that the current banking system that we all learned to trust has flaws. The financial crisis of 2007/2008 showed us that banks could fail and that our money stored at the banks might not be as safe as we believed it was. Since the financial crisis, many new laws were issued to prevent it from happening again. Nevertheless, we see that our financial institutions have already forgot what happened 10 years ago, and they are taking the same risks as they did then, and when interest rates start to increase, I can only hope that they have some back-up plans. Additionally, we have come to trust these banks not only for guarding our savings, but also for acting as a middleman in every transaction we make. The blockchain technology showed that banks really do not have any added value for us consumers. A bank is not required to move value across the globe, and certainly not against the fees and transaction times they are accustomed to. The foundation for starting Bitcoin as a decentralized payment system is still valid. 

Now, one can argue whether Bitcoin really lived up to its promise. Many more coins are available that seek to serve the same purpose as Bitcoin does. May be Bitcoin was overvalued, but the market for decentralized payment solutions certainly wasn’t. The possibilities have been recognized by many, and there are still so many more people still to be convinced of the benefits. Each of the projects found on CMC with a decent team and vision, certainly have lots of room to grow, even compared to their ATH from about a month ago. Furthermore, CMC lists many more projects with ambitions beyond serving as a payment system. Ethereum and Waves are incubators for new ICO’s, Vechain offers solution for protecting luxury goods, Request wants to make accounting for businesses easier, Oyster Pearl wants to revolutionize website advertisements, and there are so many more viable use cases for blockchain technology. These usecases have not become obsolete now that we are in a market correction. These projects continue to develop their products as can be seen by the github commits, roadmap updates and testnet releases. I can asure you that these project teams do not stop working just because their coin just lost 50% of its value. They continue working because they see the final potential of their product. 
If this does not convince you, look at all the partnerships that are being announced. Big industrial players team up with cryptocurrency start-ups. If you look at IBM, who has partnered with Stellar. Do you think IBM just wanted to see XLM moon to make some quick profits. Each of these industrial partners seek to improve their business, and are evolving towards the future by investing in one of the most disrupting technologies in decades. 
Regardless of how low Bitcoin will crash, and how red your portfolio looks now, if you have invested with money you can afford to lose, I advise you to HODL. Your investment has enormous potential for the future. And by future, I do not mean end of February 2018……",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,First Credit Card?,"Hello friends, 

I have a debit card with Wells Fargo and only created an account with them because I had a $10,000 student loan that I paid off last year.

I was thinking maybe Discover? But outside of that, I don’t really know of any credit cards that would accept me because I don’t have exceptional credit (650s).

personalfinance,Joining finances when one partner budgets and the other doesn't,"Hi /r/personalfinance!

My husband and I have been married for about two years and we just recently bought a house together. We have not joined our finances at all, but it's starting to get to be a pain having to pay bills and then get a check from my husband for half, or the other way around. We keep talking about joining finances to make this easier, but we have a couple of hurdles we need to cross and I'm looking for some advice.

1. I budget religiously using YNAB. I don't necessarily *stick* to the budget I make and frequently move stuff between categories, but I'm at least cognizant of where the money I have is set to go and I have several categories that I know can't be touched. My husband has tried but doesn't really have any interest in tracking his spending or using the budget program. I don't necessarily have a problem with us joining finances and me handling the budget/account reconciliation side of things (I actually enjoy budgeting!), but I don't want my husband to feel like he needs my permission to spend money, and I am worried about the possibility that it will end up being me just basically tracking his spending rather than really working toward making sure we're setting enough aside for savings, etc.
2. I love my bank, but it has its drawbacks. I currently bank with Ally and have a 0.10% interest rate on my checking account and a 1.35% interest rate on my savings accounts. That's great, except I have no way to deposit cash. It's rare that I get cash, but usually I have to give it to my husband to deposit and have him cut me a check if I want to put it in my bank account. My husband banks with a credit union but they don't have interest checking and their savings rates are lower and they have minimum balance requirements. If we combine our accounts at my bank (my preference) we'll just have to deal with having cash on hand, but I hate that. Would it be a bad move to get a checking account with a local bank just to deposit cash in to transfer it to my Ally account?

Are there any other issues anyone's come across with joining finances that we should look out for? I read through a few older threads on this topic but nothing really jumped out as being my situation so I figured I would make a post and see what pf has to say.",finance
personalfinance,To Avalanche or Snowball?,"Many thanks to lurking in this sub for the past couple years, I have managed to work my way into a position to significantly reduce my debt, but I'm not sure the best way to do it. My current car is a lease that will mature in mid-April. The residual buyout $14K. I like this car and plan to drive it to the ground. I have the cash saved up to buy the car outright upon the end of the lease. At the same time the lease is ending I will have an additional $16K saved up. I have about $40K in student loans @ 5.53%. 


I have a couple options. I can finance the car for 3 years at 2.49% (updated from the 1.99 the credit union advertised two days ago. Rates changed Feb 1) and throw the full $30K at my student loans. I would probably refinance them at that point to see if I can get the interest rate down as it's variable and keeps going up. Estimating refinancing 4.5% for 36 months, total monthly payments would be for both the car and student loans around $700, paid off in three years.


I can pay the car off in cash and only put $16K towards the loans. This would free up about $400 a month from the car payment. Assuming I refinance around 4.5%, student loan payments would be ~$750/ month for three years or $460/ month for five years. 

Or I can do some combination of the two where I finance part of the car, throw more money to the student loans and try to pay them down as quickly as possible. 

I have no other debts, my credit card is paid in full each month. My other bills (car insurance, phone bill, rent, misc) total about $600. My rent is extremely cheap as I live with my parents but I am planning on moving out in the next year, which is why I would like to be as close to debt free as possible.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Thoughts from an Investment Management Attorney,"Hi everyone,

As a starting point, I own no cryptocurrencies nor do I ever plan on investing in the crypto market. I am an attorney at one of the 50 largest law firms in the world who practices in investment management. I help investment funds (both registered and unregistered) comply with federal securities laws, work with institutional investors and boards, and open and close new and existing funds.   
  

I have learned a lot about cryptocurrencies and find it fascinating to compare the investment strategies peddled and discussed here with more traditional investment strategies. As a regulatory attorney, the biggest advantage I see for traditional investments (mutual funds, private equity, even individual stock and bond purchases) over cryptos is the legal framework and protections provided by the government. Now, I fully understand the libertarian desire to invest in something that is free of government control, or as some believe, manipulation. However, when bad actors enter the traditional investment markets, an individual investor has a far stronger legal recourse than many realize. You can file complaints with the SEC or state securities regulators, you can file suit in federal or state court, and you can submit proxies or even nominate yourself to be a director/trustee for the fund/company to change things yourself. 
  

Additionally, the disclosure requirements for both traditional investment vehicles and individual stocks and bonds are quite thorough. Although institutional investors may have certain strategic advantages over the individual investor (more manpower, research budgets, access to expert networks, etc.), there is enough information made legally available to the individual investor, for free, for him or her to make a reasonable investment decision based on real, underlying facts about the business or fund. The disclosure that I draft is clear, concise, and legally must be written in plain language for everyone to understand. 
  

My issues with the cryptocurrency market stem from severe deficiencies in these two areas, as I do not claim to have any foresight or special knowledge about the possibilities for widespread adoption of their underlying technologies. As someone who drafts and provides information about investments to the investing public, I cannot believe that people feel comfortable investing without that type of information being legally provided and regulated. So much of crypto investing seems to be done on blind faith in algorithms and blockchain, and a hope that various exchanges don't get hacked. Additionally, when those things do happen, there is no legal recourse for the individual investor. What does an investor do when his account gets hacked? Who does he or she sue? How does he or she recoup his investment? 
  

The information provided about these currencies to the general investing market is, at best, scattered. There is much secrecy around who actually owns the currencies, who is mining the currencies, and what methods of control of the currencies are used. In a 485(b) filing, anyone can look up the directors, strategy, major institutional investors, and risk factors of any mutual fund in the United States. It appears that there is no place to get that type of information on cryptocurrencies. 

My final point is one that I am sure will not be a popular one, but I feel that it needs to be said. Cryptocurrency ""investing"" is a misnomer. It is not investing in the traditional sense of the word. Rather, it is speculating. Very few (if any) individuals who purchase cryptocurrencies have enough information about the currencies at their disposal to make their purchases qualify as investments. Rather, I see people time and again talking about how we should buy low at the market because smart people buy low, and if we HODL the currencies will surely go up in value. This reveals of a fundamental misunderstanding of what investing is. Although investment vehicles can fluctuate wildly based on public perception and speculation, long term investment success comes from the underlying strength and value of the asset. Many of these coins will cease to exist in 2018 and many more will cease to exist by 2020. It is possible that none of them will survive. It is also possible that many will continue to develop groundbreaking technologies and will become universally adopted. But the reality is the average investor here does not have nearly enough information to make that determination. That fact, combined with a lack of oversight and a lack of legal recourse, to me, makes cryptocurrencies an insanely risky, dangerous investment.

personalfinance,State taxes after moving (am I doing this right?),"Hey, US citizen here. I'm SO close to being done with my taxes but am stuck on one thing and would appreciate any help.

I moved states mid-year, from Massachusetts to Texas. Texas has no state income tax so I'm just worried about Massachusetts.

My federal return is done.

Now on my Massachusetts return, the software I'm using (TaxAct) automatically put my entire income into the MA return. 

I'm self-employed so it's self employment income or business income. Schedule C. 

My question: The MA tax return form asks you how much of your income is ""Massachusetts gross income"". 

So I simply took the number of days I lived in MA this year, let's say it's 100... and divided by 365. Then I took that number and multiplied it by everything.

So if my total annual income was $100,000, I told them my MA income was $27,397... (( $100K * (100/365 days)).

Then I did the same for all my business expenses. I had to reduce those as well to keep things fair and reasonable I figured. (Can't claim a full year's expenses for MA, when I'm not claiming a full year's income).

So, is this reasonable? I just don't know if this is acceptable at all. I've searched the MA state website for 30 minutes and found a few clues but not a whole lot.

I don't expect to find an expert on MA tax law here but I'm just hoping to find out if the actions I took are reasonable and ""normal"" for most states, in how they handle part-year residency.

CryptoCurrency,What a true Gen 3 CryptoCurrency may look like...,"Hi everyone,

I've been following Cryptocurrency for a few years now, but haven't seriously invested in any other them. Primarily because I haven't found one with solid enough fundamentals to truly compete with fiat currencies used by today's world economies. I am overly optimistic that one day cryptocurrency will supplant fiat currency as the primary medium of exchange. However in order for that to happen, three key elements need to fall in place:

Gen 1) **Solid Technology**    
Gen 2) **Mainstream Recognition, Acceptance, and Usability**      
Gen 3) **Macroeconomic Control Mechanisms**

So where are we currently? Bitcoin started us off as the first coin out of the gate. It focused almost entirely upon technology. It was in many senses, a proof of concept for the world of Cryptocurrency. Being the first coin on the Market, it has had a ton of success. However we saw the short comings of Bitcoin as the coin really began to take off. It couldn't handle a mainstream load of transaction, and it will never truly be able to handle the number of transactions that fiat currencies and world banking systems use on the regular.

Ethereum and Nano really are two prominent Gen 2 coins in so much that they focus on both Solid Technology and Mainstream Recoginition, Acceptance and Usability. However, there is yet a currency to really cover all three aspects.

What I would really love to see is one foundation/company/conglomerate produce two cryptocurrencies that would interact with each other to help achieve some kind of Macroeconomic Control Mechanism. One would behave like a deflationary, fairly illiquid store of value, we'll call this eGold. The other would behave like a true fiat currency (accessible, inflationary, minimal fees, liquid), we'll call this eDollar. Stakeholders could then vote on a optimal conversion discount/premium that would control the amount eDollar-to-eGold. Depending on the collective vote of stakeholders, the in-kind conversion could either be a discount or a premium. (There is a lot one could actually do with a system like this and truly expand upon this in many different ways. If we presume that the average individual isn't too knowledgeable with monetary policy, there could be a way to ""vote"" for a representative to serve as a proxy in the decision making.) 

What would this help accomplish?

It would provide stakeholders of the currencies the ability to help regulate the amount of inflation or deflation that would occur in a monetary system. It would help spur the real-world adoption of crypto-currencies, because when real world events happen (say an economic bubble, major disaster, etc, etc), discount/premium rates could be altered to allow businesses's to access capital more easily. 

If the future of the financial world is cryptocurrency, Coins need to start thinking past vending machines, e-commerce, darknet shops, exchanges and start thinking about the real world of finance and monetary policy. Start thinking about the problems that Europe, America, Asia face when it comes to controlling their balance sheets and see what ways crypto could supplant that.

3. **If you're not sure which challenge applies best to you (e.g., not saving for retirement yet, but don't have credit card debt), feel free to pick and choose from either challenge.**

4. **Bonus points: do both challenges!**

# First challenge

Your challenge is to pursue improving your interest rates.  You've successfully completed this challenge once you've done 2 or more of the following things:

* If you have debts, compile information on each debt including the type of debt, the amount owed, and the interest rate. Also [find out your credit score and review your credit report.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/search?q=title%3A%2830-day+challenge+get+on+top+of+your+credit%29&amp;sort=relevance&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=year)
* If you have credit card debt that you are carrying from month-to-month, [call up your credit card company and make a request to lower your interest rate](https://www.creditkarma.com/credit-cards/i/how-to-lower-credit-card-interest-rate/).
* If you have enough money in your checking account to cover *at least* one month of expenses, start building a second tier to your emergency fund by opening a high interest savings account that pays at least 1% interest rate and deposit $50 or more into it.
* If you already have a savings account, [research your options](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/rates/) and consider moving your savings account to a bank paying a higher rate.  (The wiki has some [common recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/banks_and_credit_unions).)

# Second challenge

Your challenge is to audit your investment expenses.  You've successfully completed this challenge once you've done 2 or more of the following things:

* Request a fee schedule/statement from your financial advisor (if you have one).
* Request a fee schedule/statement from the administrator of your 401(k) or other employer-sponsored retirement plan (or find out your fees by logging into your plan account).
* Look through recent statements to see if there are any charges you don't recognize.
* Calculate your [blended expense ratio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Expense_ratios#Blended_expense_ratio).

The idea here is that you might uncover some expenses you didn't know you were paying, which in turn might give you a reason to make a change for the better. The impact of [costs on investments can be depressing](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/investingtruths/investing-truth-about-cost). If you find a clean slate, sleep well knowing that your money is working for you first and your investment company second.

More information on investment expenses:

* General advice on investing be found in our [Investing wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/investing).
* Specific advice for employer-sponsored plans is in our [401(k) fund selection guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/401k_funds).

# Challenge success criteria

You've successfully completed this challenge once you've done 2 or more of the items from either the first or second challenge. You may substitute an item from the extra credit if you run out of items that apply to your financial situation.

politics,Megathread: White House releases controversial memo on allegations of intelligence abuse,"&gt;(AP) — The White House on Friday declassified a partisan and bitterly disputed memo on the Russia investigation, clearing the way for House Republicans to release allegations of what they say is FBI misconduct.

&gt;The move came over the fierce objections of the FBI and Justice Department, which have said the document prepared by Republicans on the House intelligence committee is inaccurate and missing critical context.

&gt;The memo alleges that the FBI abused U.S. government surveillance powers in its investigation into Russian election interference. Trump, who has called the investigation a “witch hunt,” has supported the release of the memo in the apparent hopes that it could help undermine the probe being led by special counsel Robert Mueller.

This is a megathread to discuss the authorization and impending release of the House Intelligence Committees memo authored by Rep. Nunes (R-CA). **Please note that off topic and low effort comments may be automatically removed**

personalfinance,I screwed up tax-stuff with my nanny and now I need help fixing everything,"I had a nanny in 2016 and 2017. I naively thought it would be simple enough to manage the payroll stuff on my own, but it turned out to be much more than I could handle. 

Here's what I did right (hopefully...) :

1. I collected a W-4 from the employee, which I still have.

2. I submitted some set of initial documents so that the Federal and State government knew that I had an employee, and now know that I owe some taxes.

3. I correctly deducted the employee's share of payroll taxes and Federal/state withholding each time I paid the employee.

4. I tracked how many hours the employee worked, how much I paid them, and how much I deducted.

Unfortunately, the list of ""good things"" stops there. I've paid some of the taxes I owe, but I'm confused about what I have paid and what is still outstanding. I'm also struggling to navigate the various online interfaces used to submit payment. I'm found the entire matter to be extremely stressful and have procrastinated dealing with it.

The State/Federal withholding, employee/employer payroll taxes and unemployment insurance over the 2 years totals to about $9,000. I imagine that I'll probably owe another $1,000 of penalties. Fortunately, I have plenty of cash on hand to take care of all of this. I just need help sorting it out.

So I have two questions:

1. What type of professional (lawyer, CPA, Nannypay, etc.) should I contact to help me sort this mess out?

2. How much should I expect to pay for someone to help me take care of everything?

Thank you so much!",finance
personalfinance,How do I pay the IRS online for taxes I owe?,"I went through credit karma to estimate my state and federal taxes. I paid online through the CA website for my state taxes just fine. But I have the total of my federal taxes I owe and the IRS website is very bland and general. I'm trying to go through direct payment with my bank account and make a payment but there are about a dozen different options (proposed tax assessment, tax return or notice, estimated tax) and I not sure which one to use. Also when I explore them, it looks like only 2016 is the latest year that comes up. Any help?",finance
personalfinance,Would you refinance right now if your interest rate would drop? Probably trying to sell in less than 10 years.,"These are the two options:

4.875% with a payment decrease of $60-$63 dollars per month with about $700 to close. ($500 of this being the appraisal) The rest of the costs will be covered by a lender credit.

4.75% with a payment decrease of $76-$79 dollars per month with about $1,368 to close. ($500 of this being the appraisal) The rest of the costs will be covered by a lender credit.

Current interest rate is 5.3% on a 210,000 home bought six months ago.

Refinance guy says he's pretty sure interest rates will keep climbing. Google says so too.

Worth?

personalfinance,Reduce savings to pay off car?,"I have a car that is nearing the end of its loan. I have about $2100 left on the loan. The loan should be paid off in just under a year if I make the minimum payments. I've been paying somewhat above the minimum so I'm a little ahead of the original amortization schedule, but not by more than a few months.

I just bought a house so my only debts are this car and my brand new one-month-old $112k mortgage. I'm getting married in June and she also has a car that is nearing the end of its loan.

After the down payment on the house, I have about 9500 left in savings. Obviously, I could pay off the car in one fell swoop and still have a relatively healthy emergency fund. My health insurance has a $3k deductible but covers 100% after that, so I feel like as long as my HSA plus my savings have 3K, I'm covered for any health emergency. Job is stable and not likely to go anywhere so I can't see many other emergency situations realistically coming up. I'd like to just pay off the car and be done with it, especially because it's a car I don't drive in the winter and I can save some cash reducing the insurance to comprehensive only during winter months when it just sits in the garage once it's paid off. That said, I don't think there is much room for savings as I'm currently only paying $45 per month for full coverage on that car and liability on the other. I'm just sick of making payments on it and would like to just be done with it. Part of me wants to pay it off, but part of me doesn't want to reduce my savings any further after spending much of it on the down payment for the house. My interest rate on the car loan is quite low (3.5%) and my savings account is 1.35% interest, so all things considered, there's only a net difference of about $50 over the next year either way. Should I pay it off and enjoy a few months of being debt free besides the house (until I inherit her car loan, that is) or should I just ride it out to avoid lowering the emergency fund any further?",finance
personalfinance,making extra mortgage payment vs. maxing Roth IRA contributions,"my wife and I own a home working approx. $1.1M, of which our mortgage is around $500K. our interest rate is pretty good (3.875%) and we are at year 3 of our 30-year loan. as you can probably tell, our loan to value ratio is so strong because we couldn’t be quality for a bigger loan. my wife self-employed and I work in a sales, so as a result our income is quite inconsistent. 

neither of us works for a company that assists with retirement. the past few years we have been focused on building equity in our home, but neither of us has any retirement saved. we do have investment holdings of a combined $350K, but no IRA, Roth IRA or 401K to speak of.

I am going to open and max out a Roth IRA this year. Because we plan to own this home forever (knock on wood), my wife asked if we would be better off making an extra mortgage payment per year (in lieu of her funding a Roth, at least for now) to cut down on the life of the loan so that we’ll own the home outright earlier. That said, our interest is so low that it seems foolish not to invest that money in other ways.

personalfinance,Buying old debt to buy house?,"This is a throwaway account and we are wondering if banks would consider our situation. 

My husband and I are moving out of state suddenly and we are looking to buy our first home in Washington State. We can put 50% down comfortably on a 150k house. Our credit ranges from 739-750. We have 200k in liquid assets that will eventually be invested after some research on our end.

The problem we are having is my husband has a derogatory account on his credit history that is worth 2k from a rental property 7 years ago. The account will come off in 6 months but I am worried we will be denied or our interest rates will be inflated if it isn't removed. Should we go ahead and pay this off, obviously with written agreement that payment will remove this account from his history?  

We are wanting to get into a home right away because it will cost us 10k 6 months rent, 75k down, and 8k moving twice vs just eating the 2k debt, 75k down, and 5k moving.

personalfinance,"24yo, Planning on Moving to Canada in Two Years, Investment Advice","Hi, I am a 24 year old male who is currently planning on fully immigrating to Canada within the next two or so years to live with my SO after paying off most, if not all, of my now 31k worth of student loans with an average interest rate of 4.22%. The main reason why we are waiting until after my debt is paid off is to take advantage of the difference in strength of the currencies between the two countries. I do not have any other forms of debt, so if I continue paying on around $2200 a month I should have that paid off in a little more than a year. One concern that has been bothering me about my current plan is whether I'm passing up opportunities that would pay off significantly in the long term such as a Roth IRA. If I wasn't planning on fully immigrating to Canada I would think that contributing to my IRA now (before the 2017 cut-off) would definitely be for the best, but I am not sure if this is a smart option considering that. We have also not yet decided how I will attempt to immigrate to Canada so I do not yet know how long until I would become an official citizen of Canada if that matters. I do not, however, plan on it taking more than 5 years at the most.

To give some more financial information about me. I currently work at a job where I get paid a non-exempt salary of 33k a year before over/sunday-time. I've been employed for three months now. In terms of investment benefits they have an a 25% company match up on the first 4% I contribute to a 401k. They also contribute a 5% bonus to whatever I earn while working with them of which will I'll be 100% vested for in 5 years (I can't 100% confirm this right now, but I believe that i have read that each year until then will increase my vesting by 20%). I am also currently living at home with my parents so that I can contribute the vast majority of my paycheck to paying off my loans. I also have a 5k emergency fund which would last me at least 3-4 months should I lose my job.

I messed up and spent huge amounts of money on unnecessary things when I was younger and am facing the consequences. I have about $13k in credit card debt and the interest rate is killing me.
I have two Capital One cards.
1. has about $2500
2. has bout $10000
I also have a couple of small accounts that have very small balances that aren't very high in interest and will be paid off soon.

My car has a lien and I owe closer to $10000 on it. I'm been trying to sell it the past couple of months to no avail. Actively seeking to find a cheaper car and cheaper payments.

I live rent free with my parents. Incredibly grateful.

I have a phone plan with my ex boyfriend that is going in the gutter. He can't afford his half anymore and the account (should be) under his name and social so since his credit is already very bad and he has come to terms with it, he is going to stop paying. I'm looking to pay off my phone and get off that plan. Not sure what will bite me in the ass. Carrier is with AT&amp;T.

Basically, I need help trying to find the best way to pay all this off. My credit score is worsening and I'm not sure about my approval chances for a personal loan that has a lower interest rate. I've accepted that I messed up and just need to change, as crappy as it will be in the process.

My game plan so far: 
I'll be getting a tax return of approx $1200 that I'm planning on using to pay off the small balances and my phone. I should be left with approx $500. I'm going to school part time, which financial aide will be covering and I'll be getting a return on the amount left. I believe that will be approx $2000 give or take. Planning on using some of that to pay off the Capital One $2500 balance. Hopefully, I'll only have 1-3 accounts left to focus on paying off. The interest sucks, however.

personalfinance,"(taxes) 5 jobs, 1 independent contractor, need advice as to where we went wrong with w4s and estimated tax.","Hey PF --
First post here but have appreciated the enormous amount of advice this community gives. Quick background. My wife and I are 26. Married 2 years. Live in Southern California. Taxes have been easy prior to this year. She had 1 income, I was a doctorate student, no assets. Filling jointly. I graduated and started part time March 2017, contracted for 1 year. This allowed my wife to quit her job and follow her passions. Considering my hourly rate for other jobs is higher than hers, I found several other part time jobs to make ends meet (and easier to find a job in SoCal market). See below for numbers. When preparing our taxes, the payment is much more than we expected (planned for more, so we can pay it, just alarming) which caused us to wonder what we did wrong. I have some ideas but would appreciate your advice considering we are new to this! numbers below:

Job 1 -- Withholding 1/2. 
 Wages: 27713 
Federal: 1912

Job 2 -- Withholding 1/1.
Wages: 15478
Federal: 1402

Job 3 -- Withholding 1/1 
Wages: 8462
Federal:559

Job 4 -- (INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR) from 2/2017-4/2017 
Wages: 5075
calculated tax: 1345

Job 5 -- (4 months of my wife's job) (withheld at single rate, 0/0) 
Wages: 17105
Federal: 2754

So my wife typically got a large ""refund"" for her taxes. we discussed changing her w4 but never got around to it. So she inputted her w2 and as expected, had a large refund. However now the confusion comes in.
when she inputted jobs 1-3, the refund decreased significantly &lt;1,000. I remember calculating the withholding rates per someones advice so take out the right amount but it appears i selected too little to withhold if it decreased my ""wifes"" refund. Is this correct? (i don't remember selecting 1/1, cause i think it should have been 0/0). if not, help me understand please :)

Question 2: our refund is now a payment of ~900. again doesn't match the calculated tax we saved for the independent contractor job. Now my knowledge (lack of it) says that we should have paid estimated taxes when that income was made and now we have a penalty of $75 per late month. is this true? (same person as above said under 1500 didnt need to be estimated, but i think i know now its 1200).


Overarching question: how did we got from ~2,500 refund to a $900 payment when we should have only owed 1345, thereby getting 1200 in refund.... and also pocketing the 1300 we put away for taxes.

I recently moved and spent money on things for the new apartment. All cards with the exception of 2 (5 in total) have an APR of ~24%. One of the two exceptions don't have an Interest Rate as this one is a store card with a special rate of 0% for two years. The other one has a 0% APR until June 13. 

My mom wants to buy a car. She has money saved to do so and will not finance. However, she wants to put it in my name (in case she marries her boyfriend, and they get separated after marriage).  We've been looking at insurance rate for the car of her choice and we  see that the rates is high (I will be the primary user). Upon investigation, I see that my credit is heavily affecting this. I haven't told her why the rates are expensive. 

I got until May/June to work out what I have to do. Since I am paying interest for 3 cards, I was flirting with the idea of just having a loan where I only pay their interest. 

Should I go with the loan, or I should just pay it off directly to my card and skip the loans?

personalfinance,New Tax Bracket - New Situation - Am I correct?,"So with all the talk of the new tax brackets, and completing my 2017 return, I wanted to take a moment to understand my specific situation better, and I wanted to ensure I was correct in my thinking.  Also, this year, my wife has gone back to school, and gone to working part time, so her income will be half of what it was last year.  We received a refund this year of nearly $4000, and I want to have that significantly reduced.  I'd much rather live in an area where I either owe less than 1000, or receive as a refund less than 1000.  

I am a salaried employee, making 64,000, and with bonuses this year will end up around 70,000.  My wife's part time job will bring in an additional 16,000.  I contribute 6% to my 401k (4200 for the year).  

That makes our combined taxable income 81,800.  The standard deduction is then 24,000, leaving 57,800

So the first 19,050 is taxed at 12% = 2286
Which leaves 38,750 taxed at 22% = 8525

So total tax liability for the year will be 10,811.  Which means bi-weekly our combined federal tax needs to total about $416

We live in a state with no state income tax.  

While I know I am never going to get it to land on a $0 come tax time.  I am not a fan of huge refunds.  I find too often people start to plan their lives around them, and often use those funds for the wrong reason, and I don't want to fall into that trap.

personalfinance,How can I use a signed job offer to help get a student loan without a cosigner?,"I go to an expensive private school without any financial aid, and unfortunately this semester my family is unable/ unwilling to contribute anything toward paying for me to attend. Normally the rational decision would be to transfer, but I am in my last semester. Even more compelling, I have a job that starts in September, contingent on me graduating in May. So my question is, how can I use this job offer to get a student loan to finance this last semester? 


 I will need to borrow $31,500 to pay for the semester. Currently, I only have $5,000 in federal student loans, and a very small amount of revolving debt that gets paid off every month. I have excellent credit for a 21 year old, $3000 in checking, $0 worth of other assets, and I earned $15,000 last year (main things they ask on the loan application). The job offer includes a $70,000 salary plus very generous benefits and not insignificant annual bonuses. 

 So far 3 banks have told me they would require a cosigner and 1 has actually approved my loan (yay I get to graduate!) but at a very high interest rate, about 9% if I agree to the most aggressive repayment option. After being rejected from the first bank I called them and explained the job offer but they were unwilling to budge, saying they can only consider information that is currently applicable. However, I work in financial services and I know that this is absolutely bogus, as a signed job offer with a start date that is less than six months after I graduate quite obviously lowers the risk I pose to them as a borrower. Is there any way for me to talk to an actual banker that works in the credit and/or risk department to negotiate lowering the offered rate or getting other offers from different banks?

My husband and I recently purchased 2 “new” cars.  We had negative equity on one car, so we had to roll that into the new loan.  I walked into the dealership with a credit score of 743.  They then ran my credit 10 times.  Now my credit is 694 because of all the pings on my credit.  They told me I was denied by the credit unions in my area, and so they charged me 9% interest rate.

Unfortunately I also get hit by a quite large cancellation fee if I pay this loan out early (as all payments are accounted for).
* Two credit cards, unfortunately both maxed out. One is $14,500 (which I'm trying to pay down as it's a high interest card - 17.99%) and the other is $7,000 (at 13.49%, but has an fee of $59 a year). I used the lower interest card to pay down the higher interest card at first, then it quickly derailed from there, as I had some big expenses come through. I often use the lower interest credit card to pay bills, then put as much money on it as I can, then the whole cycle starts again...
* $9,500 remaining in a loan with my bank. This was originally taken out the year before to pay for moving expenses and purchase of furniture, and also in an attempt to try and consolidate my debt.
* $1,000 overdraft which I regularly tap into...

Expenses (non-loan):

* Rent - $1140 a month. I share with someone else.
* Phone and internet - $170 a month. This is combined, and is required for work.
* Health insurance - $130 a month. I have to have private health insurance - it's used quite often to cover medical bills
* Subscriptions - Netflix, Amazon, gym (works out to about $80 a month all up)
* I do sometimes eat out, have begun planning meals in an effort to reduce this

Savings: none :(

This is causing me a lot of stress and I just feel shit about it all - it *totally* does wonders for my mental health (how's this for cruel irony: I ended up drinking a lot more than I did previously), because while I'm servicing my debt (just barely... all it would take is me losing my job and I'd pretty much neck myself), I really, really don't feel like I'm getting anywhere. It's amazing how quickly things can snowball out of control in three years - three years ago I had only $4,000 in loan and CC debt and it would have been paid off completely that year, then I had to move house quickly at extremely short notice (so again, $$$) and then my expenses skyrocketed and I made some very, very poor decisions.

I came to you guys because I really, really don't know what to do next. I'm probably not going to be able to afford to pay any bills when I get paid this month thanks to my poor decisions with the cards.

personalfinance,Confused by my student loan breakdown statement. Also would like some advice on repayment of 50K+.,"Here is the breakdown from Nelnet

Loan Type DIRECT LOAN STAFFORD - SUB Interest Rate 5.750% 

Outstanding Principal Balance $3,421.81 


Unpaid Fees/Other Charges (if applicable)* $0.00 


Unpaid Interest to be Capitalized $0.00 


Interest Not Capitalized $244.40 


Estimated Interest Accrual Over Loan Term $1,423.41 


Interest Paid as of 04/06/2017 $402.56 


Total to be Repaid $5,089.62

Now can I pay off the principal balance and then the loan is done or do I have to pay the total to be repaid? As far as interest rates go they are different ranging from 4%-6.5%. Do I knock off the 6.5% loans first or am I thinking about this all wrong? For income I am just under 40K a year based on this years tax information.

I read through the rules but I apologize if I am breaking any. This is the first time I have been able to start paying back aggressively and would like to know where to begin.

Current income to get an idea of where I can start paying off of.

personalfinance,1099-misc for canceled debt?,"My girlfriend declared bankruptcy, chapter 7 late 2015. She lost her vision and became disabled and we met around the same time the bankruptcy was filed. Her debts were discharged early 2016. She had money that came in from an asbestos-related death for her father. The trustee recently filed to finalize the entire process, to the point where she is filing for her cut of the bankruptcy estate and all settled debts/valid to be paid.

Last year we did not need to file a tax return for my girlfriend. She only collected social security (not enough to be taxable) and the money from her disability insurance is non-taxable. I actually claim her as a non-relative dependant. I was quite literally filling out my tax return and she opened a piece a mail from a credit union(Navy Federal) she used and had a credit card with. It contained a 1099-misc with $1900 in 'Other income'. I've heard of a 1099-C for canceled debt, but my understanding of the debt being discharged she shouldn't even get that, let alone a 1099-misc.

Is this some sort of scam by the credit union where they get a better tax situation filing like this? I haven't tried to put all her info into the tax software yet to see if it affects her in any way but something just feels off about this. I've considered contacting her lawyer to see if this is legit or not but her friend found her a relatively pricey lawyer so want to avoid any billable hours if I can.",finance

personalfinance,I'm considering a cash out refinance to pay off credit cards and whether it's my best option,"Hello, I'm looking for recommendations and thoughts on refinance loan terms that I just received, but have not yet signed the intent to proceed. I'll give as much detail as I can and background. I'm looking for the best scenario.

Purchased my home for $150,000 in 2014. Details:
Type: Private loan
Balance $135,000
Rate: 4.75%
No PMI
30 years

This past summer, I added a 600 sqft addition to my home. It was paid for with a credit card (still at 0% interest and will be for another 8 months). The amount of the addition was about $15,000. Now, I've paid some of that down, but I won't be able to pay it all off—my wife is having a child and won't be going back to work for some time. I didn't expect to pay off the credit card, the plan was honestly to sell the home. But my family has settled in and we like the home enough to want to stay. Anyway, irrelevant, really.

So I'm in the position of wanting to pay off these credit cards.

I spoke with my current mortgage lender today and came up with the following terms for a cash out refinance:

(Assuming a current house valuation of $190,000)
Type: FHA loan
Loan amount: $165,000
Interest rate: 4.5%
Mortgage insurance = $108/month years 1-10.
Closing costs: ~$7,000
Cash returned to me from refinance: ~$20,000
Term: 30 years

When I first discussed it with the lender, I honestly couldn't recall what an FHA loan was. I've done some quick googling and see that mortgage insurance is required. So $108/month right there is going to mortgage insurance, which I'm not currently paying. I think that's adding .85% to the loan for the first ten years. That's a bummer.

So I'm a bit curious and unsure at this point if I should continue with the refinancing, or if I should explore other options, such as a personal loan or a line of credit. 

Thoughts welcome, thanks.",finance

Ripple,Question about XRP and $US -Federal Reserve,"Now I'm a huge fan of Ripple and have 0 doubts about the success of Ripple and XRP. 

I'm only talking based on my knowledge so please correct me if wrong. AFAIK most, if not all, banks hold and use $US for cross-border payments. This is true regardless of which fiat was originally used as they are all exchanged into $US first (I think).

When (when not if :p) XRP is used by banks, they are no longer required to hold $US and so these will be 'released' which would potentially decrease $US 'value'. 

If above is correct then Federal Reserve would not want this. Hence they may not want banks to adopt XRP? And do whatever in their power to stop this from happening. i.e. bribery, media coverage spreading FUD etc etc

Just to let you know I am commissioning as a reserve component (This means the army will not be my full-time job when I graduate officer school) I am doing this so I can pursue a fixed wing civilian career after I graduate from Fort Rucker... I know very few here are military so to help you better understand I will explain my situation in more depth. Fort Rucker is were flight training is. I am going to be an Aeromedical Evacuation Officer and I will probably be in training from August 2018 until sometime in the summer of 2020. I am wanting to make the most out of the money I have access too. In savings I have $5500. I have $4200 in Charles Schwab money markets, mutual funds, and cash that was transferred to me last year when I turned 21. Also, I have access to the $25000 career start loan from USAA. I have not done anything with the money from Charles Schwab yet. It should be noted that my car has 185,000 miles on it and I will probably need to purchase a used car in the next two years. I am living off my stipend from the Army + what I have in my checking account and that should float me until graduation which then I will get a job until I leave for BOLC. When I do go to BOLC in late August 2018 I will begin to make O-1 pay which is $3108/month before taxes. I should note that ESSENTIALLY my living expenses during these two years will be payed for by BAH (Basic Allowance for Housing) if I live off-post. If I live on post it is ESSENTIALLY free as well. 


Now that you have a picture of my financial situation and other relative aspects of my life I would like to ask of your opinion on a few topics. It seems smart to get the career start loan and invest it in some capacity given the low 2.99% interest rate. Would you agree and how would you do it? I am interested in investing and would like to make a second career/side money out of investing. I am not opposed to investing in real-estate, creating small businesses as long as it does not require my life to become consumed by my work. Also I am wanting to get a used truck/4runner style vehicle when my car dies on me. Do you have any recommendations or wisdom you can impart on me for buying a new (used) vehicle.

financialindependence,FIRE help - Legal cannabis grower/travel blogger,"I'd love some advice on what we should do next. Goal of course is to FIRE asap.

Quick background:
I'm white trash, seriously. Had no real concept of saving money before my wife taught me. Education wasn't a priority in my family and financial responsibility was the opposite of what my parents did/do. I was taught credit is to be used for a quick financial fix, and then to file bankruptcy on it for ""free money"". But that's no excuse, I should have done better. So, please go easy on me. 😉

Currently:
Wife and I are mid 30s. 
We are 100% debt free. 
No kids, none coming (I got snipped)
We spend about $29,000/year all in. 
We do have a decent savings $100k +.
We travel A LOT and most travel is done through CC points/miles (this is my job - recently hired - salary about $50k/year).

Before and currently own a legal, tier-3, cannabis grow/processing license in Washington state (terrible business to be in right now, we're trying to sell it). We clear under $20k/year in a good year - 3.5 years in.

We own a condo outright and rent it out for $1245/month. After HOAs and fees, we clear about $875 month.

We also own our house outright and plan to rent it if we buy another place (we'll clear about $1300 month on it).

We have less than $10,000 in retirement investments (has been super limited since we need to be very liquid for our business and investing with federally illegal money has been a very grey area. We want to be very safe, and not piss off the feds). Plus, admittedly I'm not good here.

We've used other income sources/old savings to buy our properties so we won't have issues if laws change and they come after cannabis growers and their assets - hopefully. 

Lucky, I have a legit salaried job now and want to start planning/investing for retirement. This is where I need advice.

Property has been/is our plan for retirement. We want four of five places, generating ~ $1000/month each. This alone should FIRE us since our spend is so low. Plus, if the market holds/gets better, we'll grow our wealth. Correct?

But, property is getting expensive by our standard. ~$275k for a 1,000 square foot home in an semi-ok area . Since we make $70- $80k/ year, it's a lot to us. 

We are considering buying in other areas like Phoenix or Baltimore - any advice is welcome. Just looking for good rental markets with good cap rates, bur we'd like to stay local if possible  (Portland, Or area).

So, should we run with our property plan, get a few places that'll generate enough for us to FIRE fairly quickly, or go another route? 

I know I should diversify and invest in the market/my roth/401k /ETFs and what not, but if we do that, I won't have enough to save for down payments on the properties we'll want. 

Any and all advice is welcome.",finance

# **WEEK AHEAD: Scary Friday could lead to scary Monday for markets** - *[(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/02/scary-friday-could-lead-to-scary-monday-for-markets.html)*

*****

&gt; Friday's dramatic sell-off capped the worst week in two years for stocks, and investors were looking forward to Monday with trepidation.
*****
&gt; The wild ride, which shaved 3.8 percent off the S&amp;P 500, is the first correction of more than 3 percent since just before the presidential election in 2016. Since the election, the S&amp;P 500 is up about 30 percent, and this week's selling reintroduces volatility that has been unheard of since then.
*****
&gt; ""How long has it has been since we've had a scary Friday, and a whole scary weekend until we see what Monday is like?"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group. ""The other thing that got me, leading up to this week, is that good news stopped helping stocks.""
*****
&gt; The stock market sell-off was tied to a sell-off in bonds, and bond strategists were reluctant to call a direction for interest rates in the week ahead, after the unusual volatility of the past week.
*****
&gt; ""The sell-off has been pretty violent,"" said Michael Schumacher, director of rate strategy at Wells Fargo. ""Normally I'd say if you have some 40 basis point move in the 10-year, it's better looking for long-term investors.""
*****
&gt; But that may not be clear until trading opens up again in the Asian session early Monday, and really not until the markets move past the Treasurys $66 billion in auctions of 3-, 10-year and 30-year bonds, Tuesday through Thursday.
*****
&gt; This past week, the Treasury announced higher issuance at those auctions, and that also spooked bonds, which have been anticipating a surge in new debt this year.
*****
&gt; Jerome Powell is sworn in as Fed chair Monday, after Janet Yellen leaves the post over the weekend. There are a number of Fed speakers in the coming week, and they may have comments about inflation but the markets are mostly looking forward to the Fed forecasts after its March meeting and Powell's comments at his first press briefing after that meeting.
*****
&gt; Yields, which move opposite price, had also been rising on inflation expectations and the idea that the Fed and other central banks could raise interest rates and tighten policy. But then the January employment report Friday included the best wage gains since 2009. That sent rates spiking, and the 10-year jumped to 2.85 percent, its highest level since January 2014.
*****
&gt; ""The market obviously got a little ahead of itself and all it took was the sell-off in bonds to show us that. Meanwhile, earnings are fine,"" said Bob Doll, chief U.S. equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management. ""Tell me where the 10-year yield is going to end up in this noisy period. If it stops going up, stocks will probably stop going down.""
*****
&gt; Strategists said the market is adjusting to the idea that the Fed could have to raise interest rates more than the three times it forecast for this year.
*****
&gt; Julian Emanuel, chief U.S. equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, said ifthe 10-year gets close to 3 percent that could be problematic for stocks. ""If yields stop here, this correction is likely going to be one of a combination of price and time correction ... sideways choppy, volatile for a number of weeks but not material downside. But if politics stay in the headlines and rates continue to rise, that's how you get the big move to the downside.""
*****
&gt; Washington will continue to be a focus as Congress faces a Feb. 8 budget deadline and markets watch for fallout from the House intelligence committee release of a GOP memo on the Russian investigation.

# A Big January Has Bulls Smiling

&gt; An old adage on Wall Street suggests, “So goes January, goes the year.” With stocks seeing one of the best January returns ever, it is time to take a closer look at the January barometer. The January barometer was first discussed by Yale Hirsh of the Stock Trader’s Almanac in 1972. Simply put, if the first month of the year is green, it bodes well for the rest of the year and vice versa if we see a red January.

&gt; Looking at the numbers confirms that when the S&amp;P 500 Index is green in January the rest of the year (final 11 months) is up 12.2% on average, well above the average return of 7.9% over the final 11 months of the year; but when that first month is red the final 11 months are up only 1.2% on average. According to Ryan Detrick, Senior Market Strategist, “The January barometer isn’t perfect, but it does have a pretty solid track record. Now where things really get interesting is when that first month is up more than 5% (like 2018 is on track to be), the return over the final 11 months actually gets stronger.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://lplresearch.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/the-january-barometer-has-bulls-smiling.png?w=522&amp;h=213))**

*****

&gt; Of course we don’t suggest simply investing based on what the first month does, but with the overall global economic backdrop and corporate earnings growth as strong as it appears to be, this is yet another sign that 2018 may see a continuation of the bull market.

&gt; In all the instances when the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 5% at the end of January, the full year return has never been negative (higher 12 out of 12 times); but it is worth noting that they weren’t smooth rides. The average peak-to-trough correction was 10.7%, while the smallest intra-year pullback was -4.4%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://lplresearch.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/january-momentum-can-lead-to-continued-gains.png?w=522&amp;h=436))**

&gt; As we noted in our recent Weekly Market Commentary, we are on the lookout for added volatility in 2018 as the economic cycle ages, but we would use any pullbacks to add to portfolio positions. This study is another example as to why we expect the bull to continue, but to be ready for a potentially bumpy ride.

# Why Midterm Years Can Slip Up Bull Markets

&gt; Equities were met with tremendous success during the first year of President Trump’s term, but now we’re headed into the much more historically troublesome midterm year. As Ryan Detrick, Senior Market Strategist notes, “Midterm years tend to be a banana peel for markets, as they see the largest pullbacks out of the four-year presidential cycle. However, those who hang on for the ride tend to see a significant bounce over the next year.”

&gt; Taking a closer look, since 1950, the S&amp;P 500 Index has been down 16.9% on average at its intra-year low during midterm years, though it tends to bounce back, posting an impressive 32.0% average gain over the subsequent twelve months.

&gt; Now take a look at all of the midterm years and how the S&amp;P 500 performed after the intra-year lows were made:

&gt; The action over the past year has been historic on many levels, but we have our concerns as the bull market continues to move higher. In our next Weekly Market Commentary, due out later today, we will list some of the amazing streaks which make the recent market action truly special, but we will also look at a few other potential near-term worries which could trigger some long overdue volatility.

personalfinance,Credit Karma messed up my federal return. How do I fix it?,"I thought I would try Credit Karma since it was free and my boyfriend used it last year for his taxes. I filed late last night and while I was diligent about entering in my information, Credit Karma was less diligent about how they added it to my return. There is a section where they doubled one of my numbers. I should have checked the form before I filed it, that is definitely on me, but in the past I've used Turbotax or H&amp;R block and I've never had this kind of issue. My question for you then is, how can I fix this? And, how soon can I fix this? Do I have to wait for the government to process my return first?  Can I use another tax preparation service to fix this or is my only option paper?",finance
personalfinance,Kind of an SOL situation..,"So roughly 7 years ago I had started my college education whilst working at my family's business roughly 40-60 hours a week, early morning shifts until late afternoons (for very little money). I was struggling in my classes specifically math as that never was a good subject for me and I lost my federal Pell Grant. Regardless I was forced to continue school or else I would be kicked out by my parents but I also had no way to pay for school. My parents told me to never get a loan so that left me with credit cards as there was no other option and not being well versed in anything at the time I spent roughly 4k+ retaking classes and failing miserably as I was again forced to work all morning and afternoon then classes at night. Also during this time I had been slowly having more and more trouble sleeping at night as my family had many non financial problems from the business we ran. Now to present day, I am 10k in debt from several credit cards which have my payments for school which I never finished from lack of funds, car repair bills, and yes I spent a little on myself here and there but I am still stuck at this family business with nearly no end in sight. My father recently passed away so now I am working open to close still making the same amount of money, essentially no education, and of course I've been being paid under the table so I can't apply for a loan of any sort. My family gave me the shaft and I don't know what to do. As far as jobs go there isn't much around unless I drive an hour or more to get there, and even then getting the job will be a huge issue as work here doesn't apply for something like tech support. Bankruptcy seems to be my only option but they would probably take assets from my mother whom refuses to help me even though both my mother and father stictly told me not to get a loan for school, while my younger sister had her tuition paid at a university by my parents. Any sort of advice or opinions is welcome, my whole life has been held back by the people that are supposed to support me and now I just feel I am in a neverending roundabout with no exits outside of checking out early.

Tldr: parents shafted me and told me not to get a loan for school, put myself into a large amount of credit card debt and is forced to work family business for little pay. If I quit I lose the roof over my head and vehicle.",finance
personalfinance,Does it make sense to recast my mortgage?,"We have a 4% interest rate on a Mortgage with PMI. We can pay down $45,000 to remove PMI, and lower our payment by $400 / month. 

We have no other debt. My thoughts are it'll take 9+ years to recoup that $45,000 and our PMI is less than $1000 / year. I can invest this money into something else and make it grow vs having more disposable income each month.

Am I wrong for thinking paying down my mortgage doesn't make sense?",finance

nuclear,Trump is going to have the Dept. of Energy classify nuclear as clean power (crushing Democrats' balls in the process) while opening the door to government facilities being allowed to use SMRs for power starting in the 2030s.,"These would initially be large complexes like Homey Airfield or Cornell Hospital, but could easily be applied to things like electrified railroads (made plausible if Republicans rip apart antitrust laws and let RRs sell excess power to the grid) or EV plane charging stations (see NASA's recent X-57 program). This also puts on a longer, generation-spanning path to more exotic things like nuclear powered aircraft or trucks.


 https://energy.gov/ne/articles/4-key-benefits-advanced-small-modular-reactors



&gt;The report's authors argue that federal agencies should be allowed to enter into power purchase agreements of up to 30 years for power purchased from SMRs. The report also makes policy recommendations that would essentially provide subsidies for SMRs. The report recommends authorization of the DOE Loan Program to include SMRs and recommends that nuclear power be included in the definition of ""clean power"" and, if the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Power Plan survives, a rule should be added that would encourage states to support SMRs by giving them ""credit for the zero-carbon energy.""



&gt;The report also recommends that the DOE and the Department of Defense collaborate to identify facilities that can benefit from hosting or having an SMR near the facility to achieve added energy resilience.

This has been something I’ve been dreading, but it’s much worst then I thought. I’m a full time student, and I’ve really racked up the credit card debt this year. It’s up to seven grand spread over five cards, most of which are near their credit limit. 

It seems somewhat counterproductive to me to take out a loan to pay off debt, but most of my credit cards have extremely high rates 20-25% and my thought process was that the loan would likely have a lower interest rate, and it sure would be nice to have a set payment every month. Am I crazy for considering this, or is it an okay idea?",finance
personalfinance,declined an alaska card?!,"Hi All - please be gentle with my ignorance. 
I Recently got a divorce and bought a house by myself. My Credit was above 800 when I applied for the mortgage (which was of 175,000).  My mortgage is under 30% of my take-home and is also my only debt. 

So in December I applied for an Alaska visa and was denied because of my credit. WTF? Several years ago my husband at the time (who was from another country so literally had 0 credit) was able to qualify for even the shittier version of the alaska card. 

The exact wording was ""Because we weren't able to complete the necessary identity verification we can no longer continue the review and processing of your application."" I was never contacted for any sort of identity verification and the names all listed on my credit report match (though my name is common AF). However, all the lines of credit match what they should be

At the time they pulled credit was 736. Key factors listed as adversely affecting it were:
-too few accounts currently paid as agreed

-lack of recent revolving account information 

-lack of recent bank/national revolving information

-lack of recent installment loan information

-too many inquiries in last 12 months

Got my credit report from Experian and under ""potentially negative items"" it says there is nothing. I don't have any other credit cards though I know I am listed on my mom's visa which has been in good standing for 16 years (and this is reflected as such in the report). All old accounts (previous auto loans and VS credit card back in college) reflect as closed and in good standing. All current and former lines of credit are listed as never late.

The only hard pulls (shared with others) were for the alaska card itself (bank of amer.) and my mortgage in August so I'm confused as to how that is too many?

There are no other red flags that I noticed and honestly I'm a bit miffed. I'd like to get a credit card but don't want to just apply to another company and possibly do more damage.",finance

personalfinance,Tax Advice for a Consultant,"I need some advice before going to a CPA/Tax guy.

I am a consultant that owns an S Corp. I work primarily for one company and I invoice them monthly and they send me a check, $12,000 per month. So my yearly income for consulting is $150,000  per year. 

As for taxes and stuff I do payroll for me and my wife for around $70,000 per year and pay about $30,000 per year in Federal taxes through the corporation (rounding the numbers a bit). 

Then at the end of the fiscal year I go to a tax guy and he does my 1120s. I tell him my income is $120,000 (probably not correct but I subtract some overhead from the $150,000). Then with the payroll, taxes, and some deductions I pay ~~corporate~~ taxes on about $10,000.  

I then file my personal tax returns and get a small return.

In this way my effective tax rate ($150k/$~30k) is about 20%.

My question is should I continue doing it this way or switch as I believe the new corporate tax rate is 21%? How will that effect my personal taxes?

The major point for changing is that I know I am probably declaring income lower than I actually have as the deductions I am taking are probably less than $30k and I should probably be declaring the full $150k as my income for the corporation. 

I would like to minimize possible issues with the IRS and ofcourse keep as much money as possible. I have been doing it in the above fashion for probably the last 7 years.

Any advice? Any further questions?

personalfinance,"Looking for some general advice, now that things are getting better","TLDR at bottom

I'm doing okay, better than some due to having pretty decent income for what I do. 
I have no emergency fund or savings though.

I have two income streams, work and family business income. I am a mechanic/welder and have a combined weekly gross of 1,600. 
I make 1224 bi-weekly take home, along with 529 weekly. Total of 2284 biweekly, after the new tax laws came in. My home is paid off, so all I have are taxes and insurance. 
Expenses: 
Taxes are~ 5800, and insurance is ~1400
I now share the household expenses with my girlfriend, so we pay 600 EACH per month, which should cover all bills and start to build a cushion as well. Just started that in January, she moved in at the end of the year. (I do want to have some additional savings for the first tax payment, because we may be a touch short based on the 60% first payment.

Car- 2015 Nissan bought new, 15, 500 owed, at 7 percent (ick). 366 per month
(Car is slightly underwater- I don't think I'll ever buy a new car again) 
Car insurance is $98 per month
Credit card $1,584 at 14.15% minimum payment $32. Limit $2200
Best buy credit card 249.17 at 29% limit $500
Kohl's card: 811.34 balance, 900 limit. ($16 monthly interest--- 22% ish)
I don't use them much now, just have to get the balanced down.

Dental financing: I have to pay 1000 within 30 days in order to complete an interest free offer without incurring $450 in accrued interest. I also have 930 at 28% already accruing interest. Limit $2500 

I currently have $3900 in my checking account, I just get super nervous about finances and have not been good about making payments on time due to not paying attention, and in the past sometimes being broke. I've always been a bit of a disaster in this way, and my credit Karma is currently 650, vastly improved over a few years ago, and capital one increased my credit line without adding last month. At one time I was at 690, and then fell all the way to 520 when I was having some personal and work struggles. I have a long and checkered history of late payments, but have all accounts in good standing now. 
Two paid collections are hurting me, one was paid on August of 2012, the other in January 2017, which was a credit card payment agreement over 3 years.

In starting my new career I have had to buy about $1200 in new tools, and still spend about $100 a month additionally.

2282 biweekly is $4900 a month averaged out. I've only gotten my second job about 4 months ago, so things have gotten a lot better since then, and should continue to get better from now on. I'm looking to upgrade my vehicle, but not on any particular timeline. It's a Nissan Juke, which was just discontinued, so the resale value may continue to get worse. Also, I am driving 55 miles each way to work, and have no interest in moving closer. Depreciation may be higher due to higher miles. I'm thinking of getting a used rogue, because I like the style and increased space, and should be less than 20K with less than 40K miles.

I'd love some thoughts on making good decisions on my newly higher income, with the goal of a vehicle upgrade at a better interest rate.

personalfinance,Looking for some of your takes on where I go from here with my money.,"Hi everyone.  I’m just looking for a little advice from some people that have maybe been where I am.   I feel like I’m wasting time/money and need to go in 1 of 2 directions rather than just sitting around being passive.  


My financial situation: 
-30 years old
-Single-No kids-American in the Midwest
-I earn roughly 60k a year.  White collar job.  My take home pay is $3,300 a month
-Own a home.  Valued at 170k.  I’m in year 2 of a 15 year loan with 2.65% fixed rate.  I still owe 140k on it.  Monthly payment (includes escrow) is $1,300
-Have a 401k through work that matches up to 6%.  This 401k is 6 years old but I was only making 40k a year for the first half of its life.  I’m doing just the 6% match as a Roth.  Current balance is right around 50k.  
-I have 30k sitting in my checking account that earns absolutely nothing each month.  
-No debt besides the house
-I do not budget but do come out ahead each month, but know I can do better. 

I understand that I should do my own Roth where I can contribute  $5,500 a year.  I’m convinced that no matter what I do, this should be the first step.  (Open to feedback if I’m wrong here)   Would like to know who has the lowest fees/best deal?  


Im torn to go two different ways..

1.  I want to pay off my house as quick as possible.   Then I can be more risky with my career.   I like it but it’s not fulfilling and I’m not exactly changing the world.   I only have an associates degree and I’m not even in my field.  So if I want to stay at this pay, I’m trapped.  

2.   I can tighten up the budget and start throwing a lot of my money into the market.   And then just continue with the house payments as is, since the interest rate is good.  



I came to the realization this week that I’m never going to want kids.  (Suddenly very single, so should save some money on dinner dates too)     I never had money until I started this job 6 years ago.   I know option #2 probably makes the most sense for most people.  But I don’t really know what I want to do with my life and having a paid off house and only needing money to pay property taxes, feed and clothe myself just seems to be so freeing.",finance

Or do I need to open a new Roth IRA to contribute to and have it invested in a retirement fund? Sorry, I'm not too savvy with this. 
Also, is it recommended to invest a Roth IRA into a retirement fund? for example the target date ones that Vanguard offers?",finance

personalfinance,"""Surprise! You're enrolled in group term life insurance!"" - My W2","I've started my federal taxes which led me to find out that I apparently have group term life insurance since my W2 has an entry for box 12 that has ""C - $50"". I do not remember signing any forms referring to life insurance at all, though I understand why my small company values me enough to take it out on me. 

I have a couple of questions about this.

* Was I supposed to be told about this? Was I supposed to sign something about this? Is it legal to have secretly bought life insurance on me?

* If my company bought life insurance on me, then they clearly set themselves as the beneficiary - can I change this? 

* The amount entered in box 12 is small, but is it adding to my taxable income? I'm pretty annoyed at the idea that they have slightly raised my taxes, no matter how little, without me (or my loved ones) actually getting *any* benefit from it. Especially since I wasn't even told, so somehow a unilateral decision on their part is affecting me. 

* Why is the value reported so little? On my paychecks (which I rarely look at because everything is an appropriate amount being direct deposited) shows the same value in ""other benefits"" listed, if that's useful information. I'm not being deducted anything on my paystubs for it, so I don't think that I am paying out of my salary for it.

* Added: If my company is paying for a policy on me, do I have any negotiating power with regards to my consent? As in, if you think that I'm valuable enough to insure, then pay me more in exchange for my consent since it's just CYA for the company. And how does this work with regards to rescinding consent if it's possible that they hid this in some pile of papers two years ago?

Thanks for any comments or help in understanding this.

And bonus question - why do my social security and medicare deductions fluctuate across different paystubs? My deposits vary by about $20 or so, and I pinned it down to slightly changing values in the deductions, but IDK why.

Edit: It's a startup of ~20 people, so there is no benefits department or HR. Everything that would be well-handled at a bigger company is basically held together with duct tape here. My job involves very little paperwork, so it's unlikely that I signed something without realizing it since I'm never required to sign anything at all.",finance

personalfinance,Located in CA looking to purchase a home,"Located in Southern California and looking to purchase a house in the next few years. The sooner the better, considering we’re 3 (wife and newborn) living in a 1-bedroom apartment at $1725 a month.

The background info:

Me = 110k/yr (recent but is sustainable from this date forward)

Wife = 12k/yr with the option to work more hours but right now this works best with baby (also a recent condition) 30k saved

No debts (no credit cards, car note, student loans, etc) Credit scores at or above 750

2 cars – I can take care of repairs as I was a mechanic in another life

Current cost of living (700sq ft) Rent $1725; Gas - $20; Electric -$100 

Misc. 2 cellphones - $100; Car insurance for both - $135; Healthcare $500/yr

Two options we have are:

1) Homes of interest are within an hour or less of work (traffic dependent) and cost ranges are 400-600k. I would prefer to spend just under 500k if I can help it.

2) Less desirable home location (longer commute 1hr or more, poorer schools, worse living condition based on location) range from 275k – 425k. We could stick it out for 5 years in that area and leave once our child is old enough to attend school, but this seems like a gamble and a hassle. Just a thought we were toying with.

The ideal option is 1 but I feel that we’re racing against time. Interest rates are increasing, as well as home prices. It feels as though our savings are proportional to the cost of what it’s going to take to finally move into a house. Going FHA that we refinance later to do away with PMI seems risky considering the market is high now. (Unless I have a huge misunderstanding of how these things work. Which is probably the case.)

Would it be crazy to buy a house that we don’t plan on living in for more than 5 years? Is it best to go with 20%? Or is FHA a decent option?

Should we even bother looking into buying a home considering how damn expensive they all are?

Would moving to a new 2-bedroom apartment make sense (for the baby) until the market dips (who knows when that’ll be)?

School me. About the only thing we understand or that we’ve got going right now is that we’re socking money away.

I have pulled myself out of a hole and dragged my way up to a credit score of 710, have a credit card, savings, and investments, and am looking to buy a home with my new wife - hopefully in 2018.

BUT the delinquencies are affecting my credit score negatively, and I'd like to see if there is something I can do about them.  I no longer have a relationship with the student loan company (in fact, the loans were sold twice since 2011, so I wouldn't even know who to call), so I don't think the ""hey I'm a customer in good standing, please help me out"" line would work.  Making matters worse, the way the loans were structured (multiple loans from the same two lenders), I have delinquencies for the same month/year showing up multiple times - the report lists 29 of them for the two lenders during my ""rough patch"".

Is there anything I can do here?  I would gladly pay somebody to get a better interest rate on the mortgage I hope to qualify for in a few months.  The last delinquency will not fall off until sometime in 2019.

Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,[US] Help with federal tax return for college student,"Hi, at this point I don’t care about using a throwaway. I am in Ohio so I have to take into consideration Ohio taxes as well. 

Both of my parents are dead, and I am considered an independent student. I go to community college, but I had to take out a loan for the 2016/2017 school year. (I needed enough money to live and afford to commute to school everyday) I get the full pell grant for obvious reasons, and received a scholarship for the 2017 fall semester. In total this makes my scholarships and grants about $9382 according to my Tax Return info from my school. I only made about 10,000 dollars last year from working and from what my W2’s say. 

I started plugging in my information into Turbo Tax and before I entered in my school grants, I was going to get about 700 back from my jobs alone. Is my scholarship and grant money considered income, that I get taxed from? Every penny of the money that did not get spent on tuition and books got spent on me trying to afford to live and pay for me to commute to school. Am I screwed other than getting the American Opportunity Tax Credit? 

I only briefly got into health insurance. I get help from Ohio Medicaid but made too much money from March to August monthly to qualify. (I brought home $500 every two weeks in that time frame) Am I getting money deducted because I wasn’t covered? Ohio Medicaid is annoying and a long process to even get. 

I don’t want to sound needy and feel like I deserve to get money back on my taxes. Honestly, I just want to know if I am doing them right and am claiming everything properly.

Losing my parents at 17 left me with a huge financial burden that I am trying to figure out. I don’t want to be that person who feels like they should get a lot back, but really I just need to know what I can do because I am still in school and work and still can barley keep my head a float. 

Seriously any help would be recommended to make sure I am doing everything right but maximize what I am getting back this year.

CryptoCurrency,Feb 6 2018 THIS TUESDAY! US Senate Banking Committee Meeting with Top Financial Regulators about CryptoCurrency,"The US Senate Banking Committee is meeting with the Security Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to discuss regulations. This could provide the regulatory apertures that allow larger financial institutions to invest in cryptos; or stage a framework of regulations to squash cryptos. In any event, regulations are going to arrive. 

The growing international regulatory sentiment is largely supporting the adoption of cryptos; but with regulations curtailing anonymity and supporting taxation. It would not be surprising if the US follows as well. Regardless of the US's federal body's feelings in regards to the crypto phenomena; there is money on the table, and the US wants their piece. 

Some view these regulations as a positive, as they are the controls that could decrease volatility, and signify nation state acceptance of cryptos. Others believe that these regulations are strangle holds on freedom and are blocking crypto industry innovation and growth in support of their own crypto (Venezuala). Many of the US's major trade partners such as Japan, Korea, UK, and the EU are adopting crypto regulations on anonymity and taxation. The crypto market has historically overreacted negatively to nation state regulations removing anonymity from cryptos, and applying regulatory taxes. 

But, an interesting technical pattern has emerged. Bitcoin is coincidentally at it's price before it's December 2017 price surge; November 30, 2017 bitcoin was $9,361.68, according to coinmarketcap.com. At the time of this article, coinmarketcap.com is listing bitcoin at $9,028.30. Hmmmmmmm...

Is this the true bottom? Or is it closer to 6,254.92? What about those Fibonacci thresholds? And, why can't those damn pardoned Thanksgiving turkeys stay alive? What are your thoughts? Near term, middle, and long term future of the crypto market?

I've included some you tube links about this meeting. I'm sure there is much more information out there. Please share your thoughts, and if possible links to your sources.

personalfinance,Where to put/spend windfalls and left over money,"My wife and I had a long overdue budget meeting before Christmas last year after 4ish years of frivolous spending, and put together a budget for us to suck to.  2 months in, we're doing well and are on track.  According to the plan, any left over money was to be put into savings.  I think it can be better used to pay down and payoff debt.  The budget already includes putting about 15% of our take home pay in savings.

I think print it towards debt would be a wiser choice.  We have about $8k left on a car loan at 3% interest, $14k in student loans at 7%, ~$120k mortgage at 4%, and $7.5k in credit card debt at 0% for another 10mo.  Typically I like to pay things according to highest interest first, but the credit debt has my eye because of its potential interest rate after the 10mo.  We would probably do a balance transfer on what ever is left at whatever the best offer is at the end of the 10 months.

The windfalls and left over are expected to average $0-$500 a month depending on expenses and company bonuses.",finance

I have been stressing over how to pay for my son's Spring tuition ($7200). He is a freshman in college and I am a single-parent dad who never went to college.   

Last semester (Winter 2017) I paid his tuition for the semester which was $8K. That was all the money I had saved for him for college, so I have no more money to pay for his Spring 2018 tuition.

FAFSA only gave him $5500 in Federal Loans because I make too much money at $84K/yr for him to qualify for full grants.  

My question is, what are his options to get this remaining $7200 paid? He had to take an emergency deferment on his tuition bill which is due 3/1/2018. I don't know what to do for him. I hate the idea of him getting any private loans, I'd rather he get a Federal loan, but I don't know what to do to get him any more federal loan money. I don't want to co-sign a private loan for him since my credit is not so great, nor do I want to put myself any more in debt. Any advice? He has a little less than 30 days to get this payment to the school.

personalfinance,"Questions on a ""foreign currency purchase"" fraud at Wells Fargo and protecting bank accounts","I would like to relate something that happened to me recently.  I have several questions about the procedures that the bank followed here as well as next steps I might need to take.  I’m not seeking legal advice, but want to get a better picture of the usual procedures that banks follow in cases similar to this in order to know how to respond if something similar happens in the future.

Early Wednesday morning, about 6:00 am local time, I got email alerts from my bank, Wells Fargo, that my checking account was overdrawn and they had kicked in overdraft protection (with fees) to cover a recent check.

I looked at my accounts online and discovered that on Monday there was a transaction listed for a “Foreign Currency Purchase” in an amount close to $3,000 - the amount got most, but not all, of the funds in my checking account.  There was no information there except a five digit reference number.

Immediately, I looked at the Wells Fargo site for their line for customers to report fraud (I didn’t call their general customer service line).  I was connected with a person who took my information, gave me a case number, and said that it would be resolved in 5-7 days.  I tried to ask for more information or if something else would be done and all she would say is that it would be resolved in 5-7 days.

This didn’t sit well with me.  I had my debit card compromised some time ago and Wells Fargo actually locked down my account before I even caught it.  And that was for an amount of just a couple hundred dollars.

When my local Wells Fargo branch opened at 9:00 am, I sat down with a banker and explained my situation, showing her printouts of my online account.  We discussed my conversation with the fraud line three hours earlier.

“Did she mention doing a ‘lost stolen transfer’?  Did she mention anything about locking your accounts?”

When I answered that the representative didn’t and that I couldn’t get get any more information, she seemed puzzled and concerned.

I explained to her that I needed more information on how this could have happened.  Was this transaction done using my debit card info?  My account number?  Was my other personal information (social, date of birth, etc) compromised?  Was this done using my Wells Fargo account login?  Was it some kind of mistake?

For most of the morning, I sat at the banker’s desk as she called and was put on hold on with various offices around Wells Fargo corporate - fraud, currency exchange, foreign currency, etc - and escalated my case to various managers.  Either no one could give her any information or would just give the same “five business days to complete the investigation” line I got earlier.

She seemed to be hitting a dead end, waiting on a call-back from some kind of higher-up case manager, so we took a break for lunch.

I went back to the bank and, by that time, she had done more research on her own.  She had handled these types of transactions at the local branch before.  From their end, if someone wanted to do a foreign currency purchase, the customer was given a toll-free number to call and they had the option to have the currency delivered via FedEx, and they would have to sign for it, or to the local branch where they would have to present ID for it.  She checked and there had been no such orders in their branch for the past few days.

I still needed to know what information was used when someone called the toll-free number.  Since she mentioned that there was the option of delivering to the home, I was concerned about my personal safety if someone was going to intercept the shipment.

Also, I asked if Wells Fargo stored a copy of your photo from your ID in their system as another form of verification.  (I recalled that my mother’s bank in my home town had done this for several years.)  She replied that they did not.

She spent the rest of the afternoon on the phone, mostly on hold, as I patiently waited.  By around 4:15, she was finally able to give me some answers.

First, when this kind of transaction is done, the customer calls the toll-free line and gives Wells Fargo their name, address, full social security number, and date of birth.  The customer has to provide it - they’re not prompted for any of it (such as “Is your address…?” or “Are the last four digits of your social security number …?”).  If the information doesn’t match, the transaction is stopped.

At that point, the customer has a choice of picking up the cash at the local branch with an ID or getting it delivered via FedEx to the address on the account, where they have to sign for it.  She noted that if the address on the account had recently changed, the transaction wouldn’t be processed.

She informed me that the crook choose the option of home delivery and that the fraud office was trying to track the shipment with FedEx.  The money stolen was in Euros.

She also told me that the reason that she couldn’t get answers before now was that Wells Fargo was “inundated” with complaints about bogus foreign currency purchases overnight and through the morning, that the fraud and foreign currency people “hadn’t seen anything like this before”, and that they had spent the morning getting “panicked” emails about “checking all foreign currency purchase transactions”.

The branch manager noted that the false charge for the foreign currency purchase appeared on Monday and the FedEx delivery would take two business days, so the package was probably picked up on Wednesday.  The person lurked around my apartment while I was at work and signed for the cash directly with the FedEx driver (unlikely, since they couldn’t emerge from my apartment) or waited for them to leave a “you weren’t here” slip on the door, grabbed it, and signed for it at the nearest FedEx branch, perhaps with a fake ID, if FedEx requires that.  Or, they were able to use the shipment information to get FedEx to not deliver ii to my home, but hold it for pickup at a FedEx location.

The branch manager and other employees stayed after the branch officially closed to close my checking and savings account and issued a refund in the amount of the fraud to the new accounts, setting up forwarding of outstanding charges.  We also set up email alerts for every transaction on the accounts and I set up a password for my accounts that I would have to give for any employee at a branch or via phone to access my account.

However, overnight, the fraud office deleted the credit to my account, leaving me with basically no money left.  I still had a significant rent check that was still in process (deposited by my apartment manager the day before all this happened) and no money to cover it.  The next day, I talked with the branch manager about the this and was basically told that their hands were tied - my money would not be available for five to seven business days and any fees would be covered and refunded.

I left and told her that I was disappointed with both the fact that Wells Fargo’s policies and procedures had allowed this occur in the first place and how their various corporate offices had handled this.  I told her that as soon as this was all cleared up, I would be withdrawing anything I had left there and taking my business to another local bank or credit union.

Later Friday, I talked with my apartment property management and they’re understanding about the situation since I’ve lived here several years.  Two people in the office did recall that, on Monday, someone they didn’t recognize came to the office twice and was adamant about knowing the specific time each day that FedEx made rounds through the apartment complex.  They think they have photos of the person on the office security camera system and were going to check.  They said I could give their contact info and this information to Wells Fargo’s fraud investigators, so I called and gave it to the banker I had been working with.

By the way, I’ve had the same checking and savings accounts since 1979, originally with a small bank in my home town that got bought out.  Through different mergers and acquisitions, my account wound up with Wells Fargo when they merged with Wachovia.

Currently, I’m waiting for Wells Fargo to sort all this out.

I took the precautions of checking my credit scores with all three agencies and found there had been no credit checks, inquiries, or other unusual activity.  I froze my credit scores.  I also quickly filed both my state and Federal taxes to make sure no one would try to use my personal information there.  (I chose the option for mailing me a refund check in both cases - we have secure locked mailboxes where I receive incoming mail.)

So, here are my questions to better understand where I need to go from here and how this might have happened:.

-Now that it appears I’m the victim of identity theft, are there any other precautions that I need to take outside of what I listed above?

-One thing that bugs me about this is that the crooks had a sense of how much money to withdraw from my account, leaving just enough so that it wouldn’t set off an overdraft right away.  How could someone get this information without my other banking info such as my web login credentials for the Wells Fargo site or my debit card number and PIN to check the balance by phone?  Could it be a lucky guess?  Is this a security breach within Wells Fargo where my account info and personal information on file was given or sold to crooks by someone on the inside?

-I am disturbed that a transaction like this, which is far and above any amount I’ve withdrawn before and left my account almost empty and is a type of transaction I’ve never done before, didn’t set off some kind of alarm bells at Wells Fargo or further verification.  I know that just about any unauthorized or unusual debit card use sets of either a lock on the account or an immediate verification call to the customer.  This very unusual transaction did not.  Is this normal at Wells Fargo and most banks?

-When I contacted Wells Fargo’s fraud division early on Thursday, nothing was done to secure my accounts.  They also did not provide information to me that my personal information had been compromised.  Is this normal procedure for most banks?  What is their responsibility to me here?

-Initiating a foreign currency purchase by phone like this with only account and personal information and allowing cash to leave the bank without any other kind of verification, like passwords or ID, seems like a gaping and obvious security hole.  Is this the procedure normally used for these types of transactions at most banks?  Are there other types of transactions that are done in this way and represent a risk to user accounts?

-It also seems like a security hole with the procedures used by Wells Fargo that a person could possibly redirect a package from the intended address to a FedEx office for pickup.  I couldn’t find the answer on the FedEx website, but is it possible to “lock” a delivery for a specific location and person that can’t be changed by the person receiving the shipment?  Is it normal for banks to send out large amounts of cash like this via third party carriers that could be intercepted in this way?

-Is it normal for a bank to withhold funds from a fraud like this for a period of time?  Is the way corporate at Wells Fargo handling this the usual procedure?  (I’m wondering just how much I should put aside in cash in a safe location if something like this happens again.)

-Should I file some kind of report to the local police about this since may have involved someone lurking around my apartment and perhaps with a fake ID in my name?  (I realize the Feds likely have jurisdiction over the actual theft and Wells Fargo is the victim since they have to cover the funds.)

-Has anyone heard of any scam like this before?  Is there _anything_ I could have done to prevent this or minimize the damage?",finance

CryptoCurrency,High Performance Blockchain Community Driven Q&amp;A,"Welcome! This post is an active effort by the HPB community to address any questions or concerns people may have about the HPB project. We want to share our speculative vision with the rest of the crypto community seeing how undervalued and undermarketed this coin is in relation to its tech, first mover advantage, and direct competition to EOS.

The more abstract the tech is, the bigger the mental barrier of entry it is for new investors to join in on the speculation.  It is our goal to present whatever information that is requested in the most simplest and straightforward manner as possible. Below is the first Q&amp;A. Please post your inquiries below as a comment, thanks! 

Question from a Redditor:

""I like **HPB**, but surely other software solutions to scaling will be able to pair up with the gpu power out there to power other networks, no?

I haven’t seen any platforms (**ARK**, **ETH**, **NEO**) mention a hardware bottle neck, so it seems the current power available is enough?""


Answer:

Well, software and hardware can only perform as fast as the **slower** of the two. We're so early in blockchain development that sure, transaction speed may not be the most important issue as of this moment. Later in the year and moving forward from that point however, we'll witness network throughput stress in many many orders of magnitude greater than Cryptokitties. 

Mass adoption means millions and millions (insert Trump gif here), and eventually BILLIONS of people utilizing ANYTHING blockchain related - from gambling, to value transfers, to marketplace transactions, and so forth. 

Example, Binance is struggling to keep up even with their own exchange's throughput at 40,000 TPS. Why do you think they had to restrict additional clientele from registering?

**ARK** has no ability to scale to the necessary processing power needed to address the amount of throughput thay will follow mass adoption. They're light years behind the likes of ETH, NEO, and HPB. I don't see their success in the future of our reality. Perhaps in a parallel reality they will be able to.

**ETH** is working on sharding as a scaling solution. Essentially, each node on any blockchain protocol today must store all states (account meta data, smart contract code, and storage of such code). Sharding means partitioning the number of states each node much carry, and dichotemizing nodes to only hold a particular state rather than all states, reducing individual workload. Sharding may theoretically bring ETH's current 15 TPS threshhold to 10,000 TPS.

Hongfei recently mentioned at a **NEO** conference that they aim to reach the likes of 100,000 TPS in the future. In the very same powerpoint, their partnership with HPB is mentioned several times. HPB has proven, a priori, that their protocol can reach up to 1,000,000 TPS, and perhaps even more, all thanks to their first of its kind approach to addressing the hardware bottleneck problem. They created an accelerated hardware chip to achieve such throughput processing power. NOBODY else in the blockchain space is doing this. This awards HPB with first movers advantage.

Additionally, **HPB** can also be utilized by ANY other blockchain protocols such as NEO (already mentioned), dAPP chains, IoT chains, big data chains, marketplace chains, and so forth. HPB is remarkably poised to address the imminent blockchain industry-wide problem of not being able to handle the throughput that mass adoption will bring. Even exchanges such as Binance will eventually need to reimplement themselves as decentralized HIGH throughput exchanges (40,000 TPS is nowhere near enough and their centralized design will become insecure inevitably). 

**EOS** is a software only solution to increasing their TPS. Even then, they'll only reach a potential maximum of handling 100,000 TPS. Sure, when Cryptokitties made its debut around Dec. 5th and congested the ETH network more than my two completely stuffed nostrils (I'm sick currently), all eyes were on EOS and their beautiful theoretical ability to handle 100,000 TPS. This was the first instance where we actually experienced network utilization nearly come to a screeching halt. Go ahead, look up CK's release date and then look at EOS's price action that followed. Hopefully by now you understand the utmost importance of being able to handle ALL network traffic.

In conclusion, HPB is directly addressing the inevitable pangs that we as as users of the blockchain will face. Even their name screams it, (High PERFORMANCE Blockchain). They are arguably one of the most academic teams in the Crypto space, and have recently finished evangelizing in top U.S. universities. They sought after exposure and talent from prestigious U.S. academia. Soon, they'll be traveling to South Korea (my home country :] ) continuing their evangelizism and talent seeking, in addition to getting listed on particular exchanges. 

TL;DR

HPB can reach 1,000,000 TPS; TPS scalability will be the biggest problem in all of crypto soon.

&lt;180 million m cap

First mover advantage in hardware optimization for network throughout.

ETH 15TPS, working on solution for 10,000 TPS.

NEO working on 1,000,000 TPS in the future most likely because partnership with HPB.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Is a personal loan for debt consolidation the right thing to do?,"Hello,

My wife and I are currently about 20k in credit card debt. Our interest rates range from 12% to 25% (Most of the interest rates are in the upper teens to lower 20's). My credit score is in the 630's and one of the biggest dings I have on my credit is high balances on revolving credit card debt.

3.) Emergency fund - This one hasn't been too much of a concern for me, only because I'm still living with mom and dad while working. Currently putting $75/mo into a high-yield savings account.

4.) Fun purchases in the future: I'm buying a set of bagpipes in summer 2019 for about $2500. I already have saved $1k for it. At some point this year I want to go on another road trip with friends (which are actually super cheap to do and serve as an awesome vacation.)

Since I'm terrified of that 10.5% interest rate, I've been dumping my paycheck for the past year and a half into the private loan. 

I'm fairly confident that the yearly bonus at work will be around $4k after taxes for this year. My thought is that I will use $1500 of it to put into my savings for the bagpipes, and dump the rest to *hopefully* pay off the rest of the private loan.

financialindependence,Concerns about rebalancing,"TL;DR:

 

Gross income is around 211k. Pre tax accounts = roughly about 38k. Net take home about 140k. Budget is 20k. Plan to invest 114.5k in taxable accounts + 37k retirement accounts +5.5k backdoor roth .I plan to use 3 fund portfolio. Rebalance annually when there is a correction ideally. How do I rebalance between my taxable, roth, and 401k accounts? 

 Am I doing something wrong?

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;


long version:&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;




*  How old are you?  

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;26

&amp;nbsp;

  

*  Are you employed/making income? How much?  

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Yes. Double job. 114,400 and 96,600 (base pay - no holiday,overtime, etc)

&amp;nbsp;

*  What are your objectives with this money? (buy a house? Retirement savings?)
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;


Accumulate as much wealth as possible before 50. I do not plan to retire at 50, however. I simply want to live the FIRE/moustachian lifestyle and apply it all the way till retirement age. At age 50, I will still work but I would like to travel the world and inspire the youth to be more financially responsible maybe write a book.

&amp;nbsp;



*  What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?) 
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

I need to know it's 100% safe but willing to see it all plummet -90% as long as I know that it will be higher at the end (65y/o)

&amp;nbsp;



 

*  What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors?)
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

 As of now, my risk tolerance is very high so most of my money is in FSTVX. I plan to have a 3 bond portfolio based on my research with 85% Total market, 10% total international, and 5% US bonds. Will rebalance annually as I get closer to retirement or when certain bear markets occur. (I use FSTVX because it's the 401k my employer has and it's easier to have. But if necessary, I can make a vanguard account as well. I read somewhere that vanguard accounts are more tax efficienct if you have taxable accounts?)

&amp;nbsp;



 

*  Any other assets? House paid off? Cars? Expensive girlfriend? (not really an asset) 
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

I am an only child and currently live with my parents. My parents do not mind me living there. I plan to live with my parents for the next 5-6 years or until I have million in index funds. As far as assets, I will most likely inherit my parents house, remaining retirement accounts, cars, etc. Ballpark around 1mil. I also have a girlfriend who makes similar amount as me. We are both very immaterialistic (Not sure if that's a word?) and simply enjoy the beauty of life (Sitting in the back yard, sipping wine while listening to music and enjoying the view)

&amp;nbsp;



 

*  What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs? 
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

I have an emergency fund for 3 months and will most likely not need any real money for the next 10 years.

&amp;nbsp;



 

*  Any big debts? No big debts. 
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

Only my student loan which is around 20k at 4% interest rate. I've already paid off my high interest student loan.

&amp;nbsp;



 

*  Any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.

Here is my question. My work offers me two separate 403b plans so i can contribute a total of $37,000 tax deferred (This is not two 403b from two different companies) I'm only using one company as that one company has the second/different pre tax fund - has to do with something about being federal. I will try to utilize the back door IRA next year as I started working around July 2017. Theoretically, my gross income is around 211,000. After pre tax deductions, taxable income is around 174,000. I only put around 1,000 in our FSA (I think this is like HSA?). So my effective taxaxable income prior to standard deduction is 173,000. I think my effective tax rate is 15.9% and my marginal tax rate is 32.0% with the standard deduction of 12,000. leaving me with 140,000 net income. I budget around 20,000 expenditures every year leaving me with 120,000 to invest in taxable accounts +the 37k from 401k pre taxed accounts. From what I understand, you want your bonds in the 401k and total market in roth iras/taxable accounts. How would I rebalance if most of my bonds are in 401k? Are we allowed to move it from 401k to taxable accounts or will that action be considered withdrawing from your retirement account and thus would incur a penalty.

  Am I doing something wrong? I’m not very entrepreneur savvy so I can only do index funds. I plan to buy maybe 1-3 properties to rent out and simply leverage out the loans. Is there anything else I can do?

 

Thank you

personalfinance,Is it reasonable to back off on my 401k contribution for a year or 2 to utilize the extra money elsewhere?,"Long story short... I’m a year out of college, make good money, and live in a very low cost of living part of the US. I’m currently in the process of buying a house. I have 60k in student loans. I have an extremely strong budget that I am fully committed to with a good amount of money saved up.

The way I see it is that a home comes with unexpected costs. Student loans carry high interest rates, where I’d rather pay them off in 2-3 years. With that being said, is it a mistake to lower my 401k contribution to utilize that extra money elsewhere for a year or 2 and then raise it back up? I’m in no way shape or form hurting for money, I have and make more than enough to cover everything as is, but I figure the extra ~300$/mo could go towards high interest loans and backup funds. I currently contribute my companies lowest matching percentage. But I was contributing even more, in which my company continues to match up to a certain percentage. What is your advice?

personalfinance,Leasing an EV vs purchasing and getting the tax credit.,"Really torn on how to figure out what to do. I'm looking at two main options now. A Kia Soul EV which has a total 3 year ownership of about $10k. I'm not interested in the residual as it's not a car I'd purchase long term. My main goal there was too get the cheapest EV i could find and just reassess my situation in a few years. 

The other option, a new 2017 Chevy Bolt is on a decent sale with the 2018s out at around $34k. I'm in Oregon so with federal and state taxes that brings my cost of ownership to about $24k after $10k in tax credits. I can't afford to lease the car, but just for reference their claimed 3 year residual is $24k.. the same as my purchase price after rebates. 

I'm not at ALL knowledgeable about this stuff, and i know EV resales are volatile, though the Bolt is probably the most future proof. But am i wrong in thinking that even if the started residual is off by $10k and the car is only worth $14k in 3 years, I still break even compared to the Soul, and get way more value? If the residual ends up being fairly accurate, I'm more in the range of hardly paying anything for this car?",finance

stocks,"[My Take] Rising interest rates, bonds, treasury notes, and its effect on equities","Going through the DOW, and basing it off [Finviz](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111&amp;f=idx_dji&amp;o=-marketcap) numbers, most all companies are trading between a forward P/E ratio of 20 and 25. [1 year, 5 year, and 30 year treasury notes](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yield) are now yielding 1.88%, 2.58%, and 3.08% respectively. The Federal Reserve has set the precedent to raise interest rates 0.25% every quarter, with the last hike on [December 13](http://www.businessinsider.com/federal-reserve-statement-on-interest-rates-december-2017-12), whose interest rates rose to a benchmark range of 1.25% and 1.50%.

A bond that yields 4% is equivalent to stock with a P/E ratio of 25.

A bond that yields 3% is equivalent to a stock with a P/E ratio of 33.3.

A bond that yields 2% is equivalent to a stock with a P/E ratio of 50.

Equities will ALWAYS trade below the yields of bonds or treasury notes because they are essentially risk free. If the yields are close to the forward expectations of companies, who wouldn't want the risk free alternative? Until yields equal about 3.5% though, which is equivalent to a P/E ratio of 28.5, I would not expect this bull market to end. 30 year treasury notes are getting close, but who in the world is wanting to buy a 30 year bond when we're living in this insane bull market??? Yet based on the forward P/E ratios of the DOW, and the rising expectations of interest rates, we really need to watch these treasury yields much more closely",finance

personalfinance,Tax filing question,"Hey r/personalfinance ,

I hope that someone here can help give me advice/ let me know if this sounds right, and if I'm in the wrong place can you point me to the proper subreddit? 


So, I am a high school teacher in massachusetts. I began filing my taxes through TurboTax, as I usually have in the past. Once I completed my W-2 for the high school it told me that I would be receiving a refund of $2630. However I had to submit two 1099-misc forms from some consulting work I had done throughout the year (together the consulting work came out to $6,900). Once I submitted the 1099-misc forms, I went from receiving a $2,600 refund to turbotax telling me that I would **owe** federal $510 and the state of MA $80. I feel like I am missing something here. Is it true that I would have to pay over $3000 in taxes on only $6900 income? 

Just extra info, my total income (including my teaching salary) came out to around $65,400 so I should still be in the same tax bracket as last year. 

(For reference, I received a $1700 refund last year while making an additional $3,500 consulting)

personalfinance,Is the default Great Lakes Student Loan payment system *really* the optimal way?,"I've seen a lot of discussion here about Great Lakes student loan payment plans, and how custom should only be used if you want to do a snowballing approach or something similar. It seems to me this isn't the case though. For instance:

I have 5 loans, 4 of which have ~4 percent interest rate, and one that has ~6 percent interest rate. Great Lakes default method is to pay your minimum monthly payment, then pay down all the interest across all loans, THEN apply any excess to the loan with the highest rate. 

To me it seems like I should just pay down the monthly minimum payment for each of my loans, skip paying the interest for the 4% loans, and put 100% of the excess into the 6% loan (interest, then principal). The interest on the other loans will continue to accrue, but the amount I'm paying should still be less. 

Is there something I'm missing here? Is it required to pay down the interest for your loans in a certain amount of time? I'm thinking about changing to custom, not to do some sort of 'snowballing' payment plan, but rather, to embrace the 'avalanche' type to pay the least over time by closing the highest interest-rate loans.

personalfinance,Need to Get Private Loan?,"Hello,

Brief: Graduating in May, have 27,000 outstanding balance on my tuition bill. 
 I can probably get to 15,000 in cash before I graduate but will need to take some kind of private loan out to cover the rest.  I have a job lined up after college that will allow me to quickly pay off the loan.  Where should I go?

Longer:
I'm in my final semester of college and despite everyone in my family pulling out whatever cash they could, it looks like I'm still going to end up with a bill at the end of the semester.

Here is what my current financial status looks like.

Outstanding College Bill: 27,000
Total Federal Loans:$19,795.03 (See breakdown below)

Subsidized Loan 1:
Principle:$3,500@4.290%
Accrued Interest:$0

Subsidized Loan 2:
Principle:$4,500@3.760%
Accrued Interest:$0

Subsidized Loan 3:
Principle:$5,500@4.450%
Accrued Interest:$0

Unsubsidized Loan 1: 
Principle:$2,000@4.290%
Accrued Interest:$189.44

Unsubsidized Loan 2:
Principle: $2,000@3.760%
Accrued Interest:$91.10

Unsubsidized Loan 3:
Principle:$2000@4.450%
Accrued Interest:$14.49

I believe I will be able to deduct the following from my student account before graduation: $~13,000

Cash Advance from Job:$7,000 (Cash advance is $10,000, and then taxes taken out from that).

Final Familial Contribution:~$5,000

Tax Return: (I don't really know how tax returns work, but I'm expecting money back because I was taxed at my internship as if I was working on a full-time annual salary but in reality only worked 10 weeks) ??, but going to my student account.

As a result, I believe I will have a balance of about $15,000 left on my student account.

Personal Information that may be relevant:

July 23rd, 2018 staring my full-time job.  $90,000 (before taxes) annual paid bi-weekly.

Credit score of ~750 (if relevant)

20 years old.

My parents told me they'd be able to contribute around 2,000-3,000 after I graduate to various loans, but that depends on their own financial status.  Don't want to count too heavily on this.

My Questions:

Where can I go to get a private student loan?  How do I start the process?  Do private loans with grace periods from interests exist (i.e. if I pay off in 6-months, no interest accrues, kind of like a subsidized federal loan?)  What's the lowest interest rate I should be looking for?  Do I need parental co-operation (i.e. do I need my parent's tax information like I would when completing a FASFA?).  When should I start looking for this loan?  How late is too late?  WIll I need a parent to co-sign the loan?

financialindependence,"Financial Independence Spreadsheet (link), My Situation, Advice?","This is a long post, but I figured I would post my situation and a decision I am trying to make along with a spreadsheet I made to track financial independence. See link below. You should be able to copy and paste into another Google Spreadsheet to use with your own numbers. 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yW5uegKTvfssA1Abzyuloe7GtdCZAuKY-LkcaBAvmO0/edit?usp=sharing

  

**Premise:**
  
* Age: Upper 20s
 
* Income: 90-105k engineering background
  
* Cash on hand: &gt;$50k (over $80k including cash in Roth IRA)
  
* Current assets: 1 townhome I live in and rent 2 bedrooms out to tenants. I have the option to remove PMI by paying down $40k more of the mortgage to save &gt;$5k a year  


**Question:**
Given my situation above what is the best option for using this cash? And what is the best option for using the cash that would be available if I were to go with paying down the mortgage?  


**Premise**
My goal is to reach financial Independence quickly through smart investments generally in real estate. Financial Independence for me is defined as having enough net worth to afford my current expenses plus 3% expense growth per year (including inflation) with a 3.75% withdrawal rate. Above is a link to a spreadsheet (numbers are jumbled and not my own finances) I made to track life finances and a path towards financial independence. I am somewhat obsessed with financial independence and more specifically doing so with real estate mainly because of the advantages of leverage early in life (I'm under 30). I lean towards an investment path that is not extremely time consuming at least for now even if that means slightly less returns. I like my job and I like the idea of keeping my W2 job for awhile as I get started with investments in a low maintenance way to diversify my income and gain leverage. Years from now I would like to have the option to live off of my investments, be a full time investor, or otherwise be able to take more risk in my career knowing that I have some passive income to support me. I also think a W2 job can provide valuable experience and skills that will benefit me down the road post W2. I am interested in real estate, but I ultimately want to invest with whatever has the best risk and tax adjusted returns. I would prefer investments that can get me to FI much earlier than norm, but I also plan on living past 55 so I don’t see how the money in accounts like 401Ks  is much different on a path towards financial independence. If I were to accumulate enough in a 401K to retire after age 55 I would no longer have to save for retirement and I could therefore spend or invest what I would otherwise be saving for retirement. I want to invest in whatever will have the highest risk and tax adjusted returns even if it means that it will mean I will not have access to the funds for many years. Net worth is my biggest focus.

So far I have purchased one townhome in a trendy part of my city that I am ""house hacking"" by renting out 2 of the rooms to friends. This situation has worked out very well financially and otherwise so far despite a few major repair expenses. I plan on keeping this house long term as a rental after I eventually move. I think it would have decent cash flow if I were to rent it today.

Now I am looking for my next step along the path toward financial independence. I have accumulated quite a bit of cash, which makes me uncomfortable....
  


**Seeking Advice:**
I am weighing two options for using this cash. The first is to use most of my cash to pay down my mortgage from the original 5% down to 20% to remove PMI. I did the math and because my house appraised higher than the purchase price the return on paying down my mortgage to remove PMI would be a 13% return annually. And I guess that means that despite having a low interest rate on the mortgage I am essentially paying credit card type interest rates on that portion of the mortgage due to PMI. The main reason I don’t like this option is that I am removing leverage, which I wanted while I’m young.

The other option is to invest the cash in another real estate purchase (I want leverage). I have read many RE blogs, books and other sources including looking into out of state investing and turnkey investing options like HomeUnion or RoofStock, but I've decided that the best option for my second purchase would be a local investment hopefully in an B+/A- area with either a great location walking distance from attractions and prime for low maintenance young professional tenants or in an area with great schools (right next to where I work). It would be much easier to get into the next investment by using all or most of this cash reserve, but I think I could still get a home up to $150k with cash that will be left over after paying down the mortgage on home 1. $150k does not look like it will cut it for the type of investment I am looking for….

I suppose I could invest this cash in the stock market or something else with high risk/returns (currently have just 1% net worth in crypto), but I generally feel that the nearly all markets (stocks, bonds, EM, etc.) are too high and overvalued. I am probably biased in this view because I have been in cash for so long. I just have my 401K in the market and I plan on never touching my 401K portfolio other than re-balancing and portfolio adjustments based on age.

Along my real estate investment search I looked into some programs online that can help find cash flowing homes like Mashadvisor, but I decided that I would be more comfortable doing the analysis myself. I built a dashboard map that allows me to throw in assumptions (occupancy, maintenance costs, taxes, etc.) and then see prospective returns on a map using MLS listings and Zillow rental data (I average Zillow rent estimates by zip code with Zillow rent estimates by square footage by zip code). Using my financial independence spreadsheet I have decided that it’s not worth investing unless the cash on cash return (not factoring appreciation) is over 7% and by using my dashboard I have found that it is very difficult to hit 7% COC….. And I think that I’m in a better market than most in Texas. Given that this return seems difficult to achieve right now and the market may be on the higher side maybe it is worth waiting for opportunities later?
  

**Spreadsheet Assumptions:**
I tailored this spreadsheet based on my own situation, but I think it can be manipulated easily for other situations especially for others with W2 jobs. I added the option to add up to 6 real estate investments in 6 consecutive years. Activate a particular real estate situation by adding a 1 instead of a 0 on the On/Off row. For now I assume that the appreciation for any real estate purchases would be 2%/yr. I am believer that over the long term real estate for the most part just increases with inflation (which is plenty after factoring in leverage). 3% may be a better assumption, but given that I believe the market is on the higher side I’d like to stay conservative. I threw the spreadsheet together in one afternoon so there may be some issues. I'd like to eventually tailor the spreadsheet to capture the tax difference of investing in a before tax 401k vs. an after tax Roth, but for now I am just evaluating financial independence based on net worth without factoring in taxes after FI. The values listed in the spreadsheet are not for my finances. I jumbled the numbers.

I'd appreciate any feedback on the spreadsheet too.",finance

personalfinance,The value of my Post-9/11 GI Bill (TX),"I've never been good at formatting so heads up. This semester I got a nice surprise that I had 16 days left on my GI Bill - at least one day is needed to certify the semester. This made me happy so I got curious what it was worth and how much I had saved in student loans. This is napkin math just to get an idea but it surprised me.

* 1 undergrad semester at a title 1 university $6000
* 6 undergrad semesters at a title 2 university $5000*6
* 4 graduate semesters at a title 2 university $3300*4

Thats 11 semesters of college estimated at $49,200 in tuition and fees alone, add on some change and **$50,000**. We also get a monthly housing allowance and per-semester book stipend. Housing changes depending on the area but is usually $1200-1400 per month, prorated. 

11 semesters at ~4 months each is 44 months.

* Book stipend per semester $300*11
* Housing allowance est. $1300*44

This comes out at **$60,500** for living allowance and books. Even guesstimating and rounding out the numbers, the GI Bill put saved me a total of at least **$110,000**. I'd wager that given a rough interest rate of 6-8% for unsubsiduzed student loans, it'd take me at least 10-15 years to pay off a total of ~$150,000
I've run into people that burn their GI Bill for living money at a community college or just flat out don't use it or pass it on to family members (if thats still possible). Vets, you earned your college money so take advantage of it. Anyone that knows a veteran not in college or a trade school, don't let them squander or throw this away.

personalfinance,"403b Questions - Does this account make annuities ""worth it""","I started a new part time job that offers a 403b plan. I plan on contributing as much as I can of course but I wanted some clarification regarding some information I received about this type of retirement account. 

The informational brochure includes the following tidbits:

1. If I saved more than 5,000 in a 403b Smart Account at retirement I am eligible to receive a life time annuity from the Fund at a favorable rate. 

2. Compared to the average annuity conversion interest rate currently of 3% provided by commercial institutions, the Fund currently issues annuities at the favorable conversion interest rate of 7%

Can someone explain this like I am 5? I understand annuities are products that guarantee a yearly salary for a designated amount of time. I am assuming this particular fund is advantageous because I can purchase a lifetime annuity with a smaller minimum pot ($5,000). I don't really understand the difference in interest rates part. Also, I have always heard annuities are not really that advantageous anyway. What am I missing?",finance
investing,In-depth explanation of last week's Stock/Bond sell off aimed at Newbies [Cross-post from wsb],"People at r/wsb liked my explanation and found it helpful, I figured I'd share the knowledge and whore up the karma over here. This is not a perfect explanation and I typed it all at like 2am last night so there may be minor errors.

------------

&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR:**

- The market is beholden to central banks due to years of QE 

- The Stock/Bond return correlation is important to watch

- Diversification between stocks and bonds only works when this correlation is negative.

- [If bonds selloff too quickly, the return correlation can flip positive.](https://imgur.com/bfREHoa).

- When this happens equities selloff along side bonds.

- Friday's jobs report showed higher than expected signs of inflation.

- If inflation spikes, the Fed will tighten monetary policy faster than previously expected.

- In anticipation of such a move, the market fell.

----

&amp;nbsp;

Now the entire “Goldilocks” environment that we have in the current economic climate hinges upon central banks (namely the US Federal Reserve) normalizing policy slowly and carefully. Why? [Because central banks have injected nearly $20 trillion dollars into global financial markets since 2009 and such a rising tide has lifted all boats. What happens when global QE is done and we start to see QT? We don't know because its never occurred on this scale before. Also worth mentioning is that the Fed will be the first to pull out later this year. [(You can read more about that here:](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-28/federal-reserve-ponders-how-to-do-the-big-unwind-quicktake-q-a). 

- [Or see this fun chart of it](https://imgur.com/epFmlvl)

- [Another great chart showing QE suppressing risk premia in fixed income, forcing investors into riskier assets](https://imgur.com/yXtx68Y)

But don't just take my word for it, here's an exerpt from a BofAML note:

- ""In 2017, multi-asset portfolios continued to benefit from equity/bond diversification. Low equity/bond correlation alongside record low cross-asset volatility is driving the vol of equity/bond risk parity portfolios to its lowest levels since the 1960s. Other multi-asset portfolios holding a mixture of equities and bonds have likely also seen extremely low volatility recently. However, a disorderly rise in yields that accompanies an equity market pullback (i.e., 2013 Taper Tantrum) could be a surprise for many investors who have become conditioned to the recent environment in which bonds and equities diversify one another.

- [**CHART**](https://imgur.com/6qgkzVO). 

- ""**The correlation of rate-sensitive assets to US rates is at record highs** as investors fail to care about outside risks, leaving markets increasingly dependent on US policy. Coupled with rates vol near lifetime-lows - on few expectations for policy disruption - this has helped suppress global cross-asset vol. However, **with the Fed appearing to soldier-on towards policy normalization, persistently low rates vol may be at risk. [This in turn creates risks for a market slaved to rates](https://imgur.com/wk3TnYR).""**

The Fed began tightening 2 years ago but very slowly. As long as inflation remains subdued then they can’t yank away the punch bowl too quickly. But,on Friday morning we had a jobs report that had very positive average hourly earnings gains leading to worries about a marked uptick in wage pressures. Wage pressures are one of the key areas that we have not seen inflation in years. If inflation spikes unexpectedly and the Fed is caught with its pants down behind the curve, they will be forced to tighten monetary policy at a faster pace. This is a negative for risk assets.

&amp;nbsp;

**The other piece of the puzzle is the bond market.** 

Stocks and bonds tend to move inversely to one another as the former is riskier than the later. If you're a diversified investor with both stocks and bonds, you're doing that because if one market suffers the other ought to soften the blow to your portfolio. In a general sense think of bonds as safe investments and stocks as risky. There is a lot more to it but thats the general idea. When investors are bullish on the future and ""risk-on"" is alive, you would expect to see flows out of bonds and into stocks. (Like we did immediately post-2016 election). 

So starting with [this chart from goldman](https://imgur.com/HFuPJdp), (which is almost a year old but serves to illustrate my point), you can see how stocks and bonds tend to behave relative to one another over time. 

- The top left quadrant shows how a diversified 60% equities/40% bonds portfolio has performed over the long term. This is showing us in the dark blue spikes above the 0-line that such a portfolio has performed very well, better than the long term average (which is the horizontal light blue line). 

- Next look at the bottom right quadrant, which shows us the equity/bond return correlation shaded in dark blue. Now as you can see, aside from a few short instances, the correlation between equity and bond returns has been negative since 2000. [This means that since 2000 bonds have almost always rallied when equities have sold off.](https://imgur.com/rGZ9pJ7).Thus, diversified investors have been sheltered from losses as their bond holdings were intended to do. 

&amp;nbsp;

However when that return correlation flips positive, as it has many times in history, the two asset classes may sell off together and such a diversified portfolio may not help staunch the bleeding.

Now as bond prices and yields more inversely, most people will reference the US 10-yr Treasury bond yield as a benchmark or a thermometer of sorts. Rising bond yields can be a good thing, as it means investors are selling bonds and (hopefully) moving into equities or riskier investments. BUT, there a point at which a bond market selloff moves too quickly, yields spike faster than expected, and investors interpret that as a panic signal.


---

&amp;nbsp;

So last week we saw bonds sell off dramatically, causing yields to spike above the comfort levels of many investors. This combined with the jobs report:

- WSJ: ""The Labor Department reported Friday that average hourly earnings for private-sector workers rose 2.9% in January from a year earlier, their largest year-over-year increase since June 2009, when the last recession ended.""

- And [heres](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm) the jobs report itself.

(and likely the political theater of today) spooked the market. 

Will it continue? Your guess is as good as mine but I think that ""BTFD"" will be muted next week due to the fervor of last week's volatility spike inverting the VIX curve.",finance
financialindependence,I lost control of my expenses and thus my time. First steps to being free of the corporate life and get my time back!,"I live for experiences, not things. I don’t want to drive around in a Mercedes-Benz. I don’t want a mega-mansion as my home. I want to experience life.

One of my best experiences came while visiting a friend in France.  My buddy signed with a French professional hockey team. It was the perfect opportunity to go visit him and see France in a very authentic way. It was an incredible trip.  I stayed in a very small town in Southern France that I would have never thought to visit. I got to live like a local for a week and really experience what it meant to live in a small French town. I lived in a small apartment in the heart of the town. I ate unbelievable food. I shopped at the supermarket every day for meals.  I watched a couple of great hockey games. I even hiked the French Alps. Since I’ve returned from that trip all I can think about is when I’ll get to travel again. I want to experience more countries and more cultures. 

Unfortunately, with work finding the time to travel is a challenge. With vacation and personal days, I get 3 weeks off a year. If I want to spend 10 days or so traveling that gives me 5 days left for any sick days, doctor/dentist type visits or random days off.  

This is not about getting out of a job I dislike. Most days I enjoy my job. I like the people I work with. I have great superiors within the company. There is even good growth opportunity.  The problem is the business I am in (like most now a days) is 24/7. My phone is always on and work is always in my pocket. I want more out of life than just work. I want experiences. To have experiences the first thing I need to get back is the most precious commodity. Time. 

The first step to winning back my time is by becoming financially free. Financial freedom is the purest form of freedom. Financial freedom means you do not have to work another day in your life if you don’t want to. It means you have complete control of your time. 

To become financially free, we need to erase all debt. Debt can be tricky, so winging it while trying to corral your debt and pay it down generally doesn’t work out.  It is important to come up with a game plan. 

Here are 3 simple steps to get your finances heading in the right direction. 

	-Write down all the obvious recurring payments you must make in a month. Mortgage or rent. Car Payment. Phone Bill. Internet and TV Bill. Car Insurance. Medical Insurance if you pay out of pocket. Any subscription services, Netflix, Hulu, Apple Music, Spotify Premium. Don’t leave anything out. Write down every single monthly recurring payment you make no matter how big or small. What can you eliminate? What can you live without? 

-Start keeping track of what you spend every single day. When you make a purchase write it down or put a note in your phone. I.E. – Today I bought a new cell phone case for $20. Each night before you go to bed put all your notes for the day into a spreadsheet or onto paper and track your spending for 1 month. In just one month you’ll see where you spend money that you could be saving. 

-Compare your total expenses every month with your monthly income. You need to get to a point where you spend less than you make. Control your expenses and control your life! Lose control of your expenses and lose control of your life!  

When I took a month to really examine my own finances I learned I spend way too much money on food. I’m a single guy and I really don’t like to cook. I especially do not like cleaning after I cook. The lack of cooking causes me to eat out for almost every meal. I spend roughly $450.00 in food per month. That is way too excessive. If I buy groceries every Sunday for the upcoming week and prepare meals the night before for each day I should be able to cut my food costs down to $300.00 a month. That would allow me to pay off an extra $150.00 in credit card debt per month. 

Let me give you an example of just how big of a difference applying an extra $150 a month to debt can be. First, I’ll show you an example with paying down credit card debt and then an example with paying down a mortgage. 

Credit Card Debt Example: Let’s say you have $5,000 in credit card debt. Your credit card charges you an APR (Annual Percentage Rate) of 18.9%. Your minimum payment is $200 per month. If you pay the minimum payment and only the minimum payment you will have your debt paid off in 11 years and 5 months. In that time frame of 11 years and 5 months you will have paid $8,109 to become debt free on your credit card. 

Now let’s look at an example if you added an extra $150 a month to your credit card payment. Your credit card debt would be paid off in 6 years. That is 5 years and 5 months faster than making the minimum payment. Your total amount paid to the credit card company would be $6,420 which means you would save $1,689 in interest. 

Mortgage Debt Example: If I had a $150,000 mortgage over 30 years fixed at a 4.5% interest rate I’d be looking at $273,609 to have my house paid off in 30 years. That equates to $760.03 per month. If I were to pay an extra $150 a month towards that principle balance of $150,000 I would pay $234,043. That is a savings of $39,566! That’s a lot of extra money going to my 401k, my IRA, my savings, my travel fund, kid’s college fund, you name it! Not only do I save a ton of money, but I also have my house paid off in 21 years and 6 months as opposed to 30 years. That means in 21 years and 6 months I no longer pay $760.03 + $150 extra for a grand total of $910.03 in savings per month in perpetuity. 

The one thing you’ll notice is to become debt free it takes time. Just like the phrase it takes money to make money, it takes time to make time. The key is to understand that the time we put in is a small investment compared to the time we will get back in the future.  

It is also important that you are honest with yourself. If you aren’t honest with yourself on where you waste and what you can save you will never have true numbers. Without true numbers you will never achieve financial freedom. Be honest with yourself and you can do this! Anyone can! 

The last thing I will say is do not be afraid.  It can be terrifying to open a credit card statement or look at a bank account when you know it isn’t going to look the way you want it to.  Do. Not. Be. Afraid. There are millions of people in the same position as you or worse. A lot of the people who aren’t were in the same position at some point. You can do this. You can get out of debt and get to a point where you are not afraid to look at your credit card or bank statements anymore. You can get to a point where you want to see those statements! 

Take the time to develop the habits that will make you financially free. Don’t you want control of your time? Join me on our journey to mastering our time and becoming financially free.",finance
personalfinance,Experiences with Popular Student Loan Refinancing Banks and Advice on Choosing One.,"Hey everyone - Definitely going to refinance my student loans:

- 54K Total (27K Federal, 27K Private)

The best rates came from Lendkey and Earnest while the one with the biggest name value, Sofi, has the highest rates. Just curious if anyone can share their experience with any of these banks or others that specialize in student loan refinancing.

I'm hung up if I go with the lowest rate or with the top rated bank (Sofi).  All three are highly recommended from what I've seen on the internet and all offer good perks but need some help deciding if the extra 1% or so I'd pay with Sofi is worth the service.

I've managed to keep my spending pretty low, and my savings rate ((401K+E-Fund+RothIRA)/(401k+net income) is about 46%.

personalfinance,Conflicting numbers for total interest of a loan and its future value,"I'm trying to set up a proper amortization table and see the total interest I'll be paying. Using this [amortization table generator](http://apps.wheda.com/calculators/loanamortization/), I have the ""amount of loan"" be $300,000, ""Interest Rate"" be 4%, and ""Term of Loan (in Months)"" be 360 months (compounding monthly, for 30 years, with an APR of 4%). The resulting amortization table matches exactly what I have in Excel.

However, when I sum up the interest column to figure out the total interest I'll be paying for the loan assuming I won't have any additional pre-payment (i.e. I pay only the minimum), the total interest is $215,607.14. If I use the FV function like so: `=FV(0.04/12,360,-1432.25)`, I get `$994,052.26`. If this is indeed what the future value is based on my numbers, what does **$994,052.26** mean? Shouldn't it be the sum of the principal and the total interest, which is `$300,000 + $215,607.14 = ` **$515,607.14**?

I'm just trying to confirm that the total interest of $215,607.14 is correct and also understand what future value of $994,052.26 really means and whether it's relevant for figuring out how much additional money I should contribute towards pre-payment. I basically have an amortization table set up on Excel by following this [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjqJq_gkV2U).

personalfinance,Thinking about changing the mix of my 401k with Vanguard.,"Hey everyone.  I have a fair bit of money (well for me anyways) to the tune of about 45k in a Vanguard 401k that is through my employer.  Currently I am having 10% of my pay put into the account and am working on upping the deductions to the maximum allowed by the IRS.  

The fund is a target fund for 2040 and is roughly 80% Stocks and 20% bonds, and over the last 4 years it has done quite well.  Last year alone it went up something like 22% which is tremendous.   With that said, I (and most people) feel that market is over valued and due for a significant correction.  Furthermore (I do not want to get political so please do not think I am trying to inject politics) the current political atmosphere is extremely toxic and financial markets do not like this sort of unpredictability.  With that view and it would appear that bond yields are on the rise, and the Fed will most likely raise interest rates is now (maybe March 20/21?) a good time to readjust my 401k.

I was thinking about adjusting it something like 60% bonds and 40% stocks, or maybe doing a complete flip and doing 80% bonds and 20% stocks (i am referring to funds not individual stocks or bonds).  

Thoughts?  The good? The bad? Or the ugly?  All are welcomed.  Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Can we afford this townhouse? Kind of regret allocating too much in retirement and now thinking it may be restricting savings after a 20% down payment,"Townhouse of interest:  340K$ (2 beds/ 3 baths, Extremely good location/ schools, in New Jersey)

With the 20% down payment this would leave us with 25K$ savings. From what I've been reading though the max price we should be looking at is 3x income, so 300k$. The place we are looking at is 340K$ in a extremely good location. What does /pf think? Should we wait a little more before taking on a mortgage?

Daily trading, playing the game ""right"", not taking too many risks... at the beginning of the year, I had started with a little less than 100k USD, so for the sake of this, let's just say all of it is short term capital gains.

That sounds great, considering where I started from, but let's take a moment and think about the taxes I am now responsible for.

I made over 900k short term capital gains I live in california so my state tax is ~10%. Federal tax at this level is ~38-40% So I have to pay ~48-50% of the gains in taxes. Therefore I will have to pay ~450k in taxes.

personalfinance,Go debt free or continue investing? Equity cash out on cash purchased property?,"Hello Reddit, thank you in advance for anyone that contributes to this thread, I love this community. I have contributed here before and wondering if I could get some advice. This in addition to my prior post. 

I have no loans or debt except for two mortgages, one is paid down to 32k from an original of 38k (investment property) from last year and my primary residence (where I live) is worth about 250k and is down to 33k, both are the lowest rates I can get. I since last year have cash flowed a property entirely (remodel), it is now worth between 50-70k which I have the potential of doing an equity cash out and getting 80 percent loan to value ratio.

I have land and am planning to build homes later, I am convinced that money will be the cheapest it will ever be. If I did a cash out on the property and can take 30-40k and invest and put 20% down on buying one or two homes. Borrowing at a 5% interest rate at 20 year - 5 year arm. Which would if I built these they would increase my cash flow substantially.

I need ideas on what to do with my funds, either pay off the homes quicker or should I invest into another property. I have various sources of income to float in case I lose my primary position. Any questions / clarification, please ask.

Bitcoin,"2018 - 2030: The grand battle between bitcoin, precious metals and fiat currency","edit: I like that 30% of you are downvoting this post because you think bitcoin is going to the moon right this year, we'll never have a bear market ever again and the S-curve reigns supreme. Nope, governments were never going to make it that easy. Crypto will have its day in the sun, but that day is not today. 

***

I have seen things. Don't ask me how. My dreams can be cryptic.

The destruction of fiat has already begun in earnest, but we're only in the 1st inning. The next 10 years will be characterized by the destruction of the USD, and the rise of the Chinese yuan backed by gold.

Gold and crypto are the two twin pillars that will destroy fiat. Thanks to crypto we're looking at a resurfacing of a global consciousness and desire for a non-state backed currency, harkening back to the days of a gold-backed money supply. Throughout history, empires have risen and fallen. The strongest empire's currency has always been the choice reserve currency of that era, but as an empire grows complacent and the government officials decadent, so does the temptation to debase their currency. The privilege of being the reserve currency globally gives them a sunset period of 20-40 years as the inevitable decline happens. It all began when Nixon took the USD off the gold standard.

Both China and Russia has been quietly accumulating gold over the past 10 years, restricting exports and increasing imports of gold. China is the world's largest oil importer and is in the process of switching over from paying for oil in USD to yuan, and redeemable into gold. The ramifications are massive. Increasingly the world is turning back on the US and its currency.

China is clamping down on cryptocurrency heavily as it interferes with their grand plan: they plan to shock the world in 2019 by announcing that they will go back to a partial gold-backed standard. Not fully-backed due to constraints in monetary policy advised by their Chinese economists, but sufficiently so such that the world gains confidence in the yuan and central banks globally begin selling their USD in earnest from the current 60%+ weighting, demoting it to a 30%+ weighting in favour of yuan as it dawns on them the USD might have just lost its reserve currency status. In this chaos, as we see across all regime changes, central banks begin buying gold in earnest. Other countries respond by backing their currency with gold as well. China becomes the new global superpower.

Thanks to this, the gold price will move to all-time highs and start trading above $2k in 2019. This will see the beginning of a gold rush we've never seen before. Old and institutional money begins to pour into precious metals; new and speculative money pours into cryptos. Cryptos enter into a final blow-off-top a year later not unlike the 2000 tech top in 2020. Bitcoin crashes 70% from $1m to $300K. As this happens, the whole world goes all-in into gold and yuan as the new safe havens as this is simultaneously accompanied by a major sell-off across both equities and bond markets. The rout will not stop till the mid 2020s. Gold is now trading at $7k/oz and silver at $200/oz. In fact, gold, as is most asset classes, are no longer quoted in USD but yuan. Africa begins to wield significant influence in the global political arena with South Africa leading the charge, due to their massive gold holdings and gold mines.

The year is 2025. In the depths of a recession even more severe than the one we saw in 2009, the US government reveals they have been accumulating bitcoin since 2018, and have built a sizeable position of 500,000 BTC (equivalent to $250b with BTC trading at $500k). This sparks the re-birth of a new bitcoin bull run as the other central banks announces they too, now hold some BTC. Many central banks, especially the resource-poor countries who never saw the rebirth of gold coming, begin accumulating BTC as well. Many now fear Russia and China's dominance in the gold market. Despite gold being a decentralized store of wealth, the natural geographical distribution has made many other resource-poor countries bitter, and an unspoken alliance began taking shape as central banks secretly accumulate bitcoin. Countries begin to publicly denounce gold, even as gold ownership is quickly being transferred into the blockchain. Gold prices fall after entering a blow-off top in 2027.

Bitcoin begins to climb until it reaches a ""demand equilibrium"" with gold. By 2030, bitcoin is valued at $2m+ and represents a significant percentage of the global money supply and gold has fallen to $4k/oz. By the 2030s+ the world has transitioned to a fiat system that is completely transparent. All countries' reserves in both bitcoin and gold are publicly trackable on the blockchain. While fiat continues to live on, governments in the aftermath of the early 2020s recession now have learnt fiscal prudence and bond yields actually reflect market-priced default risk depending on a country's money supply vis a vis the value of the bitcoin and gold their central bank holds.

The economy never really recovered from the recession in the 2020s. Artificial intelligence had taken over most of the economy's jobs, and the wealth inequality continued to widen as more and more wealth accrued to owners of capital. The crash in the equity markets at the turn of the decade had also wiped out a generation's savings and therefore willingness to spend - the millennial investors who had gleefully piled into FAANGs as everyone turned euphoric into the last days of the stock market bubble. Deflation began to set in as the boomers started dying in record numbers, and consumer spending ground to a halt as nobody except the elites and the crypto-rich had any money to spend. By the late 2020s governments realized that a form of universal basic income was necessary or the economy would never recover, but a redistribution of wealth was not going to be possible. Countries came together and decided that a new UBI cryptocurrency would be created, in direct proportion to the amount of bitcoin and gold each country owned. With every single individual having their own unique identity stored on the blockchain, this was easy and transparent to implement. This ultimately paved the way for a global common cryptocurrency in 2030. Gold began to lose its shine.

By the mid 2030s, we entered a golden era for the human race as the wealth inequality came back down to levels unseen in the past 500 years. Productivity reached a new high, assisted by mature technologies that first appeared in the 2010s. Significant life extension, space exploration, nanotechnology, then the uploading of the human consciousness ...

In 2040, we encountered the Singularity.

personalfinance,Trouble with credit card debt after being held in jail for seven months while on trial. A penny (I do not have) for your thoughts!,"A little backstory: While recently on vacation in NY, I was charged with a crime (that I was later found not guilty of), and was held in county jail for 211 days. My bail was set at $50,000 because I didn’t have any ties to the community, and no bail agency would issue me a bond, as I was from out of state and could not pay to live in NY while I fought my charges on trial, so planned to fly home if I bailed out, though I assured them I would have returned for court dates. So, bottom line I was stuck in jail for roughly seven months. 

Prior to going to jail, I had never missed a payment on any of my credit cards, and my credit score was just over 700. About 705. During this time, all three of my credit cards ran out of their introductory APRs, and all three went completely unpaid for 7 months. One account was closed, and the other two remain open. Upon my exoneration, I immediately took what little money I had and paid to bring the two accounts still open up to date. However, because I lost my job due to being in jail, I am about to miss my next months payments, even if I AM able to find employment quickly. 

My credit score after this fiasco was 494, and after the recent payments is at a 511. After 7 months of no payment fees and interest, all of my credit card debt combined totals about $9,500. I do not have any student loans, or debt of any kind outside of this. What I’d LIKE to do is take out a loan with a place like SoFi, to consolidate my debt and pay it off, so that I can stop paying the ridiculous interest rates I am now  stuck with. However, as my credit score is now in the toilet, I have not even applied for any such loan, as I know I am 99% sure to be turned down, and a hard pull for such a likely unhelpful scenario would just further affect my credit, without any real benefit. 

Unfortunately, I can’t think of a way out of this scenario that does not simply entail making minimum payments, essentially paying down interest, for the foreseeable future while I get back on my feet and get established in a decent paying job. And once I have a decent job again, I still live in CA and thus have a high cost of living — meaning that I likely won’t be able to take very large chunks out of the debt any time soon, and therefore will be paying high interest on these cards for quite some time while I pay them down. 

Any help/advice would be greatly appreciated. If you are somehow unable to tell from the way I write, I am no expert in finance/interest rates/etc. I’m new to Reddit, and new to this sub, so I apologize in advance if I have not provided you adequate information to help, or have violated any posting standards/rules.

Bitcoin,Startups and Bitcoins in United Arab Emirates,"United Arab Emirates
UAE appeared on the World political map in 1971 as a result of major geopolitical events, which fundamentally changed the balance of military powers in this region. It had been preceded by the United Kingdom army withdrawal from the Middle East and demonstrative navy maneuvers staged by Iranian militants near Tund Islands.

In the aftermath of those incidents official representatives of two emirates - Abu Dhabi and Dubai- reached an agreement to form political and military union, brining their administrative apparatuses under one state's umbrella. Soon after five smaller emirates - Ajman, Fujairah, Ras al-Khaimah, Sharjah and Umm al-Quwain - also signed this historic accord. In February 1972 the main legislative body of UAE 40-members Federal National Council was formed and sworn to action.

The Federal Supreme Council, which consists of seven emirs, is the most highly positioned executive organ of UAE. The federal president, which, according to the long-established tradition, must also be the emir of Abu Dhabi, is followed in the state's hierarchy by the prime minister, which, according to the same tradition, must be the Dubai's emir. Political parties are officially considered to be illegal in UAE and all medias are closely monitored by authorities. Sharia law is recognized to be an integral part of the UAE legal system.

During past several decades, in an attempt to end its economic over-reliance on oil industry, UAE government has converted the country into one of world's top tourist destinations. Today more than 10 million people visit emirates annually. UAE is widely recognized as the ground zero for luxurious and extravagant hotels, some of which present themselves real engineering marvels. Burj Khalifa and Palm Islands alone host more than 3 million tourists each year. Still, oil export constitutes almost eighty percents of UAE budgets revenues.

High-tech sector's role in emirates economy is almost negligible. At the same time, UAE high-income population coupled with modern telecommunication infrastructure provide a number of business opportunities to local founders. On the negative side, slowing economy with its continuing dependence of the oil extraction industry, added by excessive government's control over the local Internet and high administrative barriers to SME have significantly undermined growth potentials of local startup ecosystem.

The status of crypto-currencies in the United Arab Emirates is far from being resolutely set by its government. Almost immediately after the publication of the ""Regulatory Framework For Stored Values and Electronic Payment Systems"" by UAE Central Bank in January 2017, which, in its section D.7.3. ""Provisions for Virtual Currencies"", firmly and unambiguously stated that ""all virtual currencies (and any transactions thereof) are prohibited"", there was 180 degree turn made by one of the Bank's most distinguished representatives - his governor himself.

He said in interview to one of the local news agencies that ""these regulations do not cover virtual currency"" and these ""regulations do not apply to Bitcoin or other crypto-currencies"". It revealed a conflict of interests, which apparently exists inside of UAE government. We can assume that after the above mentioned report was made public some very important state official(s) privately demonstrated his (their) disapproval of this report, which then caused central bank's directors to denounce his official position on crypto.

However, judging by a reportage, which appeared in medias at the end of October 2017, UAE bank's head still keeps his negative attitude toward crypto-currencies, which he sharply criticized for the lack of supervision, claiming that ""it facilitates money laundering and terrorism financing"". The fact that this high-ranking bureaucrat has again openly expressed his anti-crypto views may have far reaching consequences. It also may signify the beginning of new stage of legislative crack-down on digital currencies in UAE.

Meanwhile, despite of the absence of legal persecution precedences, trading crypto as well as organizing ICOs remains legally risky in UAE.

personalfinance,"Whack(?) 1098 T turned my refund into a huge negative, please help?","Hi all,

I was filing my taxes with Turbo Freedom and all went well until I input my 1098 T. I went from having a chump change refund to apparently owing almost $900 in taxes. I'm trying to figure out if there's something wrong with the form I was given or if not, should I just disregard the form entirely. 

Some background:

This is only my third year filing taxes. Originally, I didn't plan on filing this year because I'm a dependent and based on my W2s, my earned income was under $6350. I had one part-time job that withheld federal taxes (but I quit that job halfway into January 2017 so again... chump change), and another part-time job that didn't withhold federal taxes. I don't think I'm required to file, but I figured it's a good habit and to be honest, I wouldn't mind getting that chump change refund. This is also the first year where I spent a full calendar year (Winter 2017, Spring 2017 and Fall 2017) at my current school. I transferred in 2016 and started Fall 2016. 

From what I've read on the sub, it looks like the financial aid office may have messed up on my 1098 T. Or not? If someone can help me figure out how to correctly interpret the numbers on the form, that'd be great.

My form looks like this:

-Box 1 is $0.00

-Box 2 is $17.00

-Box 3 is unchecked.

-Box 4 is $0.00

-Box 5 is $9363.00

-Box 6 is $0.00

-Box 7 is checked.

-Box 8 is checked.

My first instinct tells me there's something way off about Box 2, obviously, because there's no way I was only billed $17 for an entire school year, right? Like, what? I'm truly unsure how on earth that can even be considered a valid number. 

Basically, please help me figure out if this 1098 T is truly whack and if so, how I can ""fix"" it if needed? If the form isn't whack, should I even bother including it on my tax form this year? If don't include it or go ahead and change the numbers to fix it, will there repercussions later down the line since the school has to report this form to the IRS as well?

Thanks in advance!


Edit: Thank you all for your responses! From what you've all told me and the numbers I looked up later in my billing statements, my school charged my tuition in December 2016 which my Spring 2017 grants were then used to pay off. Also, general consensus is that since I'm a dependent, I shouldn't even bother inputting the 1098 T and instead pass it along to my parent who could actually claim the amount for credits.",finance

The underlying DRCT contracts enable cross-chain asset exposure (BTC, XMR, etc.) and even off-chain asset exposure (interest rates, equity rates, etc.) all while being completely decentralized.

These contracts are tokenized derivative contracts that once created, trade as an ERC20 token. We’re currently looking for exchanges who would like to partner with DDA to list contract tokens on their exchange.

Please test out the contracts and let us know what you think.  The UX is being improved daily and the code for the contracts is also open source and any feedback is much appreciated!

Some useful things I did are:

* I put $700  as a fixed deposit with a 15% interest rate.
* Brought a $350 Gold ring.
* Going to save $100 in my bank account.

Remaining I have been spending on college, however also wasting some money when I have in cash.

personalfinance,Need advice in regards to federal and state tax withholding (Military - AL),"SO my question is in regards to my spouses income and withholding's. in 2016 she only worked for about 4 months, and when we sat down in January to file we noticed both her federal and state withholding's were very odd.  As in, varying percentages and ridiculously low amounts sometimes not even breaking a dollar. Now because she only worked 4 months it didn't really have an overall impact on our return. In the end we called up her HR department and the told us they were having issues network wide and it would be resolved shortly. We went in and were able to change her federal withholding's to 0 with an additional $15 each paycheck. We live in North Carolina but only pay Alabama state taxes (military) so we kind of left that one alone and assumed it would work itself out (i know, dumb).

So that brings us to this year. i believe due to me withholding at the single but married rate and her additional 15$ saved our federal return. we got a decent amount back, but her withholding's still seem way off even with that additional amount.

State taxes, however, came back to bite us in the ass. we owe almost $500 to Alabama. we checked her pay stubs and nothing had been changed for her state withholding's. they were varying widely and often not even reaching a dollar. In response i found the Alabama form for withholding's and turned it onto HR. I'm not sure if it had time to make it on her most recent pay stub but as of right now its still unchanged. 

I apologize for the log and confusing post, i'm in a bit of a rush. i really just want to figure this out so we don't owe a huge amount to Alabama again next year. thank you in advance for any help or advice.

personalfinance,Question about the Avalanche method for paying off debt,"My wife and I just took on a car loan. We also have a few of my student loans remaining. We're trying to figure out which loans we should throw our extra money at. 

We had been using the avalanche method for my student loans - paying off the highest interest loans first. But all my student loans had similar principle balances, ranging from $3,000 to $5,500. Interest rates range from 3.1% to 4.4%. Now we have added a car loan for around $18,000 with 3.54% interest. 

My question is should we continue to put our extra money towards the $3,000 student loan with 4.4% interest, or should we put the money towards the car loan since 3.54% of $18k is a lot more than 4.4% of $3k?

Edit: I'm not asking for feedback on whether or not I should have spent $18k on a vehicle. I'm simply asking which loan makes the most sense to pay off first.",finance

[**International Capital Flow Pressures**](http://www.nber.org/papers/w24286?utm_campaign=ntw&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ntw)

**Linda S. Goldberg, Signe Krogstrup**

_This paper presents a new measure of capital flow pressures in the form of a recast Exchange Market Pressure index. The measure captures pressures that materialize in actual international capital flows as well as pressures that result in exchange rate adjustments. The formulation is theory-based, relying on balance of payments equilibrium conditions and international asset portfolio considerations. Based on the modified exchange market pressure index, the paper also proposes the Global Risk Response Index, which reflects the country-specific sensitivity of capital flow pressures to measures of global risk aversion. For a large sample of countries over time, we demonstrate time variation in the effects of global risk on exchange market pressures, the evolving importance of the global factor across types of countries, and the changing risk-on or risk-off status of currencies._

[**How Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Can Impact Market Design**](http://www.nber.org/papers/w24282?utm_campaign=ntw&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ntw)

**Paul R. Milgrom, Steven Tadelis**

_In complex environments, it is challenging to learn enough about the underlying characteristics of transactions so as to design the best institutions to efficiently generate gains from trade. In recent years, Artificial Intelligence has emerged as an important tool that allows market designers to uncover important market fundamentals, and to better predict fluctuations that can cause friction in markets. This paper offers some recent examples of how Artificial Intelligence helps market designers improve the operations of markets, and outlines directions in which it will continue to shape and influence market design._

[**Israel's Immigration Story: Winners and Losers**](http://www.nber.org/papers/w24283?utm_campaign=ntw&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ntw)

**Assaf Razin**

_The exodus of Soviet Jews to Israel in the 1990s was a unique event. The immigration wave was distinctive for its large high skilled cohort, and its quick integration into the domestic labor market. Immigration also changed the entire economic landscape: it raised productivity, underpinned by the information technological surge, and had significant impact on income inequality. The extraordinary experience of Israel, which has received three quarter million migrants from the Former Soviet Union within a short time, is also relevant for the current debate about winners and losers from immigration. This paper provides a rigorous explanation for a possible link between the immigration wave and the changed level of redistribution in Israel’s welfare state._

[**Notice failure revisited: Evidence on the use of virtual patent marking**](http://www.nber.org/papers/w24288?utm_campaign=ntw&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ntw)

**Gaétan de Rassenfosse**

_One source of uncertainty in the patent system relates to the difficulty in identifying products that are protected with a patent. This paper studies the adoption by U.S. patentees of “virtual patent marking,” namely the online provision of constructive notice to the public that an article is patented. It proposes a simple model of the decision to adopt patent marking and empirically examines factors that affect adoption. Data suggest that about 12 percent of patent holders overall provide virtual marking information (and perhaps about 25 percent of commercially active assignees). Econometric analysis suggests that the most discriminant factor of the adoption of virtual marking is the size of the patent portfolio. The likelihood of adoption increases with portfolio size, consistent with evidence that firms with a larger patent portfolio are more likely to be infringed._

[**Does E-Cigarette Advertising Encourage Adult Smokers to Quit?**](http://www.nber.org/papers/w24277?utm_campaign=ntw&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ntw)

**Dhaval M. Dave, Daniel Dench, Michael Grossman, Donald S. Kenkel, Henry Saffer**

_Only recently introduced into the U.S. market, e-cigarettes have been aggressively promoted, and use is increasing rapidly among both adults and youths. At the heart of the regulatory debate are fundamental questions regarding whether e-cigarettes will draw cigarette smokers away from a dangerous habit or lure new initiates into tobacco use. We provide some of the first causal evidence on whether e-cigarette advertising on television and in magazines (which comprise about 90% of total media spending on e-cigarettes) encourage adult smokers to quit. We find that the answer to this question is a tentative yes for TV advertising but no for magazine advertising. Our results indicate that a policy to ban TV advertising of e-cigarettes would have reduced the number of smokers who quit in the recent past by approximately 3%, resulting in roughly 105,000 fewer quitters in that period. On the other hand, if the FDA were not considering regulations and mandates that would likely eliminate many e-cigarette producers during our sample period, e-cigarette ads might have reached the number of nicotine replacement therapy TV ads during that period. That would have increased the number of smokers who quit by around 10%, resulting in an additional 350,000 quitters._

[**The Right Type of Legislator: A Theory of Taxation and Representation**](http://www.nber.org/papers/w24279?utm_campaign=ntw&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ntw)

**Andrea Mattozzi, Erik Snowberg**

_We develop a theory of taxation and the distribution of government spending in a citizen-candidate model of legislatures. Individuals are heterogeneous in two dimensions: productive ability in the private sector and negotiating ability in politics. When these are positively correlated, rich voters always prefer a rich legislator, but poor voters face a trade-off. A rich legislator will secure more pork for the district, but will also prefer lower taxation than the poor voter. Our theory organizes a number of stylized facts across countries about taxation and redistribution, parties, and class representation in legislatures. We demonstrate that spending does not necessarily increase when the number of legislators increases, as the standard common-pool intuition suggests, and that many policies aimed at increasing descriptive representation may have the opposite effect._

[**The Effects of Computers and Acquired Skills on Earnings, Employment and College Enrollment: Evidence from a Field Experiment and California UI Earnings Records**](http://www.nber.org/papers/w24276?utm_campaign=ntw&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ntw)

**Robert W. Fairlie, Peter Riley Bahr**

_This paper provides the first evidence on the earnings, employment and college enrollment effects of computers and acquired skills from a randomized controlled trial providing computers to entering college students. We matched confidential administrative data from California Employment Development Department (EDD)/Unemployment Insurance (UI) system earnings records, the California Community College system, and the National Student Clearinghouse to all study participants for seven years after the random provision of computers. The experiment does not provide evidence that computer skills have short- or medium-run effects on earnings. These null effects are found along both the extensive and intensive margins of earnings (although the estimates are not precise). We also do not find evidence of positive or negative effects on college enrollment. A non-experimental analysis of CPS data reveals large, positive and statistically significant relationships between home computers, and earnings, employment and college enrollment, raising concerns about selection bias in non-experimental studies._

[**New Evidence on Cyclical Variation in Labor Costs in the U.S.**](http://www.nber.org/papers/w24266?utm_campaign=ntw&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ntw)

**Grace Weishi Gu, Eswar Prasad**

_Employer-provided nonwage benefit expenditures now account for one-third of U.S. firms' labor costs. We show that a broad measure of real labor costs including such benefit expenditures has become countercyclical during 1982-2014, contrary to the conventional view that labor costs are procyclical. Using BLS establishment-job data, we find that even real wages, the main focus of prior literature, have become countercyclical. Benefit expenditures are less rigid than nominal wages, although both components of labor costs have become more rigid. These rigidities, along with the rising relative importance of aggregate demand shocks (including the financial crisis), help explain countercyclical labor costs._

**Abhijit Banerjee, Dean Karlan, Robert Darko Osei, Hannah Trachtman, Christopher Udry**

_A multi-faceted program comprising a grant of productive assets, training, coaching, and savings has been found to build sustainable income for those in extreme poverty. We focus on two important questions: whether a mere grant of productive assets would generate similar impacts (it does not), and whether access to a savings account and a deposit collection service would generate similar impacts (it does not)._

**Ajay K. Agrawal, Joshua S. Gans, Avi Goldfarb**

_Recent artificial intelligence advances can be seen as improvements in prediction. We examine how such predictions should be priced. We model two inputs into decisions: a prediction of the state and the payoff or utility from different actions in that state. The payoff is unknown, and can only be learned through experiencing a state. It is possible to learn that there is a dominant action across all states, in which case the prediction has little value. Therefore, if predictions cannot be credibly contracted upfront, the seller cannot extract the full value, and instead charges the same price to all buyers._

[**Targeted Price Controls on Supermarket Products**](http://www.nber.org/papers/w24275?utm_campaign=ntw&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ntw)

**Diego Aparicio, Alberto Cavallo**

_We study the impact of targeted price controls for supermarket products in Argentina from 2007 to 2015. Using web-scraping, we collected daily prices for controlled and non-controlled goods and measured the differential effects on inflation, product availability, and price dispersion. We first show that, although price controls are imposed on goods with significant CPI weight, they have a temporary effect on aggregate inflation and no downward effect on other goods. Second, contrary to common beliefs, we find that controlled goods are consistently available for sale. Third, firms compensate for price controls by introducing new product varieties at higher prices. This behavior, which increases price dispersion within narrow categories, is consistent with a standard vertical differentiation model in the presence of price controls._

[**Shift-Share Instruments and the Impact of Immigration**](http://www.nber.org/papers/w24285?utm_campaign=ntw&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ntw)

**David A. Jaeger, Joakim Ruist, Jan Stuhler**

_A large literature exploits geographic variation in the concentration of immigrants to identify their impact on a variety of outcomes. To address the endogeneity of immigrants' location choices, the most commonly-used instrument interacts national inflows by country of origin with immigrants' past geographic distribution. We present evidence that estimates based on this ""shift-share"" instrument conflate the short- and long-run responses to immigration shocks. If the spatial distribution of immigrant inflows is stable over time, the instrument is likely to be correlated with ongoing responses to previous supply shocks. Estimates based on the conventional shift-share instrument are therefore unlikely to identify the short-run causal effect. We propose a ""multiple instrumentation"" procedure that isolates the spatial variation arising from changes in the country-of-origin composition at the national level and permits us to estimate separately the short- and long-run effects. Our results are a cautionary tale for a large body of empirical work, not just on immigration, that rely on shift-share instruments for causal inference._

[**Social Transmission Bias and Investor Behavior**](http://www.nber.org/papers/w24281?utm_campaign=ntw&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ntw)

**Bing Han, David Hirshleifer, Johan Walden**

_We offer a new social approach to investment decision-making and asset prices. In our model, senders' propensity to discuss their strategies' returns, and receivers' propensity to be converted, are increasing in sender return. A distinctive implication is that the rate of conversion of investors to active investing is convex in sender return. Unconditionally, active strategies (high variance, skewness, and personal involvement) dominate the population unless the return penalty to active investing is too large. Thus, the model can explain overvaluation of `active' asset characteristics even when investors have no inherent preference over them. It also has strong predictions for how adoption of active strategies depends on features of the investor social network. In contrast with nonsocial approaches, sociability and other features of the sending and receiving processes are determinants of the popularity of active investing and the pricing of active strategies._

[**Debt Traps? Market Vendors and Moneylender Debt in India and the Philippines**](http://www.nber.org/papers/w24272?utm_campaign=ntw&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ntw)

**Dean Karlan, Sendhil Mullainathan, Benjamin N. Roth**

_A debt trap occurs when someone takes on a high-interest rate loan and is barely able to pay back the interest, and thus perpetually finds themselves in debt (often by re-financing). Studying such practices is important for understanding financial decision-making of households in dire circumstances, and also for setting appropriate consumer protection policies. We conduct a simple experiment in three sites in which we paid off high-interest moneylender debt of individuals. Most borrowers returned to debt within six weeks. One to two years after intervention, treatment individuals were borrowing at the same rate as control households._

[**The ""End of Men"" and Rise of Women in the High-Skilled Labor Market**](http://www.nber.org/papers/w24274?utm_campaign=ntw&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ntw)

**Guido Matias Cortes, Nir Jaimovich, Henry E. Siu**

_We document a new finding regarding changes in labor market outcomes for men and women in the US. Since 1980, conditional on being a college-educated man, the probability of working in a cognitive/high-wage occupation has fallen. This contrasts starkly with the experience for college-educated women: their probability of working in these occupations rose, despite a much larger increase in the supply of educated women relative to men. We consider these facts in light of a general neoclassical model of the labor market. One key channel capable of rationalizing these findings is a greater increase in the demand for female-oriented skills in cognitive/high-wage occupations relative to other occupations. Using occupation-level data, we find evidence that this relative increase in the demand for female skills is due to an increasing importance of social skills within such occupations. Evidence from both male and female wages is also indicative of an increase in the demand for social skills._

[**Quantitative Analysis of Multi-Party Tariff Negotiations**](http://www.nber.org/papers/w24273?utm_campaign=ntw&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ntw)

**Kyle Bagwell, Robert W. Staiger, Ali Yurukoglu**'

_This paper develops a model of international tariff negotiations to study the design of the institutional rules of the GATT/WTO. We embed a multi-sector model of trade between multiple countries into a model of inter-connected bilateral negotiations over tariffs. Using 1990 trade flows and tariff outcomes from the Uruguay Round of GATT/WTO negotiations, we estimate country-sector productivity levels, sector-level productivity dispersion, iceberg trade costs, and country-pair bargaining parameters. We use the estimated model to simulate an alternative institutional setting for multilateral tariff negotiations in which the most-favored-nation requirement is abandoned. We find that abandonment of the most-favored-nation requirement would result in inefficient over-liberalization of tariffs and a deterioration in world-wide welfare relative to the negotiated outcomes in the presence of the most-favored-nation requirement._",finance

CryptoCurrency,Powellcoin fork completed!,"The US Government has just successfully completed their fork from Yellencoin to Powellcoin.

Introduction video for the new Powellcoin Chairman: https://youtu.be/E9D3cUgcWdw

Powellcoin fork FAQ
-----------------------------

Q: When does the fork happen?

A: February 5, 2018

-------------------
Q: How many Powellcoins will I get?

A: You will get 1 Powellcoin for each Yellencoin that you held at the time of the fork.

-------------------

Q: Do I need to take any action to receive my Powellcoins?

A: No, the fork is completely automatic for users, thanks to the US Government's proprietary POV (""Proof of Violence"") consensus algorithm. Your balances will be automatically updated at all participating and compliant banks.

-------------------

Q: Can I keep my Yellencoin?

A: Unfortunately, no. For your convenience, your Yellencoin have been destroyed and replaced with an equal number of Powellcoin. This is for the benefit of all users, to eliminate potential inefficiencies and confusion that might arise from competition between multiple coins.

-------------------

Q: How much is a Powellcoin worth?

A: At the time of the fork, 1 Powellcoin was worth the same as 1 Yellencoin. However, the future value is unknown. The Powellcoin Board of Advisors and Trustees targets a 2% loss in value per year in order to facilitate a stable and productive economy.

-------------------

Q: What if I don't want to use Powellcoin?

A: Participation in Powellcoin is mandatory for all users, as described in our whitepaper (link: Federal Reserve Act of 1913). This requirement is enforced by our POV consensus algorithm, with special dispensation granted to the US Treasury to create and destroy Powellcoins at will.

-------------------

Q: What wallets are compatible with Powellcoin?

A: All Yellencoin-compatible wallets (compliant with the relevant IRS, FBI, and NSA data-sharing programs) continue to be compatible with Powellcoin. Note that all legacy physical Powellcoin (notes and coins) are planned to be phased out of usage within the next 3 blocks, at which time they will become illegal to possess or spend. This change is designed to improve the transparency of Powellcoin, and to facilitate improved control by the US Government.

-------------------

Q: What happened to my Yellencoin? Will the govt spend it?

A: All Yellencoin have been sent to a ""black hole address"", rendering them completely destroyed. The US Governement will conduct all future spending using Powellcoin created by the US Treasury mining facilities and collected by the IRS profit-sharing algorithm each year.

-------------------

Q: How much is premined? Is there a founders’ reward, if so how much?

A: Exact estimates of the total number of Powellcoin in existence are not available, due to the highly-leveraged nature of Powellcoin and the distribtued creation mechanism. In addition to the US Treasury's mining facilities, all participating and compliant TBTF (Too Big To Fail) banks are granted permission by the Powellcoin smart contract to create limited numbers of Powellcoins at will.

-------------------

Q: Am I too late to get on the whitelist? It looks like only whales are on there. This is unfair, you can't have a successful ICO if you neglect the community.

A: Users are encouraged to apply at their local TBTF Bank for Powellcoin loans. Keep in mind that Powellcoin loans must be paid back with interest, and are subject to immediate seizure by the US Government agents if users fail to adhere to the Terms of Service.

-------------------

Q: Is it true that powellcoin mining is used to support coal power?

A: Please direct all fossil fuel-related inquiries to our OPEC Committee, who will be happy to assist you in purchasing petroleum products with your new Powellcoins.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Any caveats to look out for avalanche payoff for private student loans?,"Not sure this is better in /r/personal finance or /r/studentloans. If this kind of post elsewhere please let me know. Thought I'd start with the subreddit I'm more familiar with.

My fiance and I are currently on an aggressive saving plan to pay off our private student loans (Navient with 8.75% interest, and Firstmark/Citizens with 7.75~12.2% variable interest rates across multiple accounts). We're currently saving up to payoff our student loans before moving onto other things (ie house, car, etc.) 
My paranoia in the back of my head began bothering me when I saw a post or two that mentioned that paying off the entire balance may have left some residual balances and charges behind, causing some nerve wracking phone calls and waiting for accounts to update. Considering we're trying to save up a considerable amount to pay off these accounts, I'd like to avoid running into a situation where we have to end up paying more than the ""Payoff Amount/Balance"" listed in our loans after spending so much time saving up.

I wanted to reach out to this sub and ask if there's a sure fire way to ensure that, if I do go with the avalanche method and submit my payment for the ""Payoff Amount/Balance"", will that be the actual amount I should be concerned with, or can private loaners screw with you with some small print stuff? I was thinking it may be safer to call them up and ask to watch over my account as I submit those payments when the time comes, but I was curious if there were any personal anecdotes out there about paying off the ""Payoff Amount"".",finance
personalfinance,Wife's employer lost her W4 to adjust withholdings for previous tax year; this year we owe.,"Hey PF. Long time lurker.

My wife and I filed jointly for tax year 2015 and 2016 after getting married in the Fall of 2015. In Jan of 2016 she submitted a W4 to her HR department changing her status from Single 1 for Fed and State to Married 0 for both. 

Long story short after doing our taxes this year (2017s) we now owe the federal government $1,600 when we normally get a refund.
I withhold 1 for Federal and 0 for State and my status is MARRIED.
After doing some digging, the now former HR person did not adjust her withholdings and she is still filed SINGLE 1 for Fed and State.

The way i see it is she was shorting herself unknowingly, and even though HR ""lost"" her W4 she should have been on top of it; But this is besides the point.

Our taxes are not simple; We are new homeowners, have student loans, 401ks, IRAs, did home improvements, etc. So listing out everything here would probably be extraneous. 

I was exploring the possibility of Filing Separately this year and having any return I get offset her Federal burden. Would that be advisable? The only problem I see with this is our interest paid on our mortgage and PMI insurance are bulked together in 1 statement, making this difficult to do.

Also,is there anything that should/could be done to bring it to my wife's companies attention? I feel like a mishandling of tax paperwork by an HR department is fairly bad, considering the company has a total of 25 employees.

I have a meeting with a CPA this weekend to go over my taxes and see if theres anything we fucked up, but I have a feeling we'll be paying out to the IRS. In that case, mourn and carry.

Unfortunately I underestimated my income for my 1095-A. As someone who waited tables half the year, along with an hourly job, I admit my mistake. I now owe $750 for that, along with $263 for federal, and $125 for state. Making it close to $1,150 I owe. This is the first year I’ve ever owed so I wasn’t prepared, again my mistake as I used most of my savings for my car, and this is my first time having a car payment. 
I now work 43 hours a week, my office job, making $12 an hour. 
My weekly check is $432.32, making my monthly take home $1,729. 
My car is my only real debt that I bought 5/2017, and I owe $15,600 which I pay $302 monthly, due 2/26
I current owe $54, due 2/18, on a credit card I use for gas. 
My car insurance is $95, due 2/15
My new health insurance is $143 due 3/1
Netflix, and Spotify, is probably around $22 dollars
My partner pays all the household bills besides our combined phone plan. I give him $200 a month for it. 
I have $700 in savings, and $450 in my checking with my check I got today. 
My biggest monthly expense is food and household items. I typically spend $400 a month on food and toiletries type items for the two of us. I’m trying to spend less on food, as we don’t eat out besides pizza once or twice a month. 
Should I spend my savings and pay it off ASAP? Wait until the April due date? I really don’t want to do a payment plan if I don’t have to. Should I pay my state now since I have that in full? How can I be saving more? I’ve been thinking about getting another job waiting tables again, but I’ve yet to find someone who will work with my current full time job. 
Any advice, nice or not would be helpful. I feel terrible for making such a mistake and putting myself here, but I want to make sure it doesn’t happen again. Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,Friend's bank won't let him pay off personal loan in full,"My friend banks with a small credit union in NC. He has a personal loan through them with a remaining balance of $982. He tried to pay it in full two weeks ago. They said they were ""upgrading their system"" (computer system) and it wouldn't let them do a full pay off - however, they could do a normal payment just fine. They said they'd call him back when the system was upgraded. No call and two weeks later, he tried to pay it off again and they say the same thing. It's a loan with a shit interest rate, so to me it sounds like the credit union is being scummy and making him pay on the interest as long as possible.

personalfinance,Should I refinance an investment property to a 15 year fixed?,"Hi all, long time lurker here, first time poster. My wife and I are in the process of purchasing a new primary residence (currently renting). We also own a rental property that I’ve owned for about 13 years. I have been debating refinancing the rental property to combine two mortgages (both on the rental) into one as a 15 year fixed. Looking for advice if this is a good idea or not or if my thinking is flawed. My other thought is, don't refinance and just pay off the secondary mortgage ($21,000) next year after we close on the new house (summer 2018). My hesitation in doing this is that it is a rental property that's been paying for itself over the last 5 years and the $21,000 I'd use to pay it off is put to better use in other investments (Is this the wrong way to think about it?). I wouldn't be withdrawing funds from any investment accounts but it would be funds I would have otherwise invested over time. My motivation is to have the home payed off in a shorter period of time. We would both be 50 by the time the rental property was payed off with a 15 year fixed.

**Background:** When I originally purchased this home back in 2005 for $190,000, I financed it using two mortgages. I refinanced the primary mortgage in 2012. The home is valued at around $240,000.

**Current Mortgages:**

**Primary:**
Principal Balance: $116,000
Interest Rate: 3.875%
Term: 30 years fixed
Origination Date: 2012 (Refinanced in 2012)
Monthly: $871 P&amp;I and Escrow ($1000/yr insurance - $2,200/yr property taxes)

**Secondary:**
Principal Balance: $21,300
Interest Rate: 7.063%
Term: 30 years fixed
Origination Date: 2005
Monthly: $191 P&amp;I only

Granted, today's rates are going to be higher than what I got in 2012 but I still have 24 years left on the primary mortgage. Cash out is an option, don't really need it but comparing it as an option since we haven't made any updates to the home in 10 years.

**What I'm quoted:**
**Option 1 with Cash Out:**
Loan: $166,000
Interest Rate: 4.375% (higher because it is an investment property)
Term: 15 years
Cash out: $17,000
Monthly: $1,259 P&amp;I

**Option 2 no Cash Out:**
Loan: $149,000
Interest Rate: 4.375% (higher because it is an investment property)
Term: 15 years
Monthly: $1,117 P&amp;I

Is the right way to justify the refinance to compare the sum of my monthly mortgage payments (P&amp;I only over the next 24 years to the sum of the P&amp;I payments for the 15 year?",finance
personalfinance,"[US] I read that I should invest, rather than pay down my mortgage, but I do not know where to begin?","Hello PF,

I just recently bought a house with my wife. We financed $240k with a 30 yr conventional loan, 20% down, 3.75% interest rate. I also sold my starter home separately, so now we have approx $125k in savings. I was planning to put a large chunk of this into the new mortgage, but have read many recommendations in other threads on here that with mortgage interest rates so low, I would be better off investing. Disclaimer: I know nothing about investing. 

Per other recommendations I've found on this forum, my wife and I have both started Roth IRA's with Vanguard and have everything in retirement date funds. I would like to make the most out of the rest of the money we have in savings, but do not know where to start. Are there any short-term options for the money other than in investment accounts that cannot (should not) be accessed until retirement?

After all bills are paid, we currently save around $2.5-3k each month. Our only debt is the mortgage. We also both work in jobs that have state pensions. Our next major step in life is starting a family, so I do not want to tie up all the money and not be able to access it. I've looked at CD's at my local credit union, but the interest rates do not seem worthwhile. Are there any other options I am not aware of?

As I was hoping, they appear to be taking a public protective approach to foster growth in this sector to help boost our economy as stated in J. Clayton's introduction:

&gt; The cryptocurrency and ICO markets, while new, have grown rapidly, gained greater prominence in the public conscience and attracted significant capital from retail investors. We have seen historical instances where such a rush into certain investments has benefitted our economy and those investors who backed the right ventures. But when our laws are not followed, the risks to all investors are high and numerous – including risks caused by or related to poor, incorrect or non-existent disclosure, volatility, manipulation, fraud and theft.
&gt; 
&gt; To be clear, I am very optimistic that developments in financial technology will help facilitate capital formation, providing promising investment opportunities for institutional and Main Street investors alike. From a financial regulatory perspective, these developments may enable us to better monitor transactions, holdings and obligations (including credit exposures) and other activities and characteristics of our markets, thereby facilitating our regulatory mission, including, importantly, investor protection. 


Reading more of their plan they're quite clear on the risks, despite wanting to offer safeguards that traditional securities offer from the Federal Government. There's a lot to parse through, but overall takeaway is not bad for us. It's possibly quite good, actually.

If we want this space to grow we need proper regulation to ensure all players are acting in a citizens' best interest (pushing tech forward, actual attempt for use cases, etc.), and that doesn't happen with outright bans or anarchistic ideals. It just minimizes the game tactics. Doesn't eliminate them, but at least offers some protections from scams.

Ripple,"Understanding Ripple, XRP, SWIFT, and the global money transfer ecosystem.","Below is my attempt to quantify the market that Ripple is going after and what it means to XRP and its value . There is a lot of large math but bear with me because all of these numbers point to where Ripple and XRP are currently and where they could be. 

The Marketplace in Numbers  

In 2017 approximately $1.425 quadrillion  was transferred globally using SWIFT. Here the math:

1.	SWIFT messages sent per day in 2017(assuming 200 business days): $35,500,000.00 (REF:A)
2.	Daily $ transferred: $7,128,804,434,230.90 (calculated by taking 2005 daily transfer value (REF:B) and assuming 3%(which is low) growth year over year) 
3.	Value of average SWIFT transfer:  $200,811.39 (SWIFT Messages/Daily $ transferred) 
4.	$ Transferred in 2017: $1,425,760,886,846,180.00

In comparison to SWIFT, Fedwire (Federal Reserve Wire Transfer service for US banks) moved  $766,961,537,000,000.00 in 2016 (REF:C) and the whole  remittance industry’s (Wester Union, MoneyGram, etc) only transferred approximately $595,694,726,962.88 (REF:D). Obviously the word “only” is relative here as that number is still quite impressive. 

When add SWIFT, Fedwire, and the remittance industry together those groups are moving over $2.1 quadrillion each year… that’s 107x USA’s national debt, at the time of writing. 

Ripple’s Game Plan (as I understand it.) 

Ripple is after that 2 quadrillion dollar market but they have only just taken a few baby steps so far. In terms of international wire transfers, Ripple wants to first get banks to adapt xCurrent which is the blockchain version of SWIFT with some major upgrades and is estimated to be about 40% of the cost of SWIFT. 

Once xCurrent is adapted then they will try and convince banks to use XRP as a source of liquidity which should save an additional 10%, making  xCurrent about 70% cheaper than SWIFT. 60-70% savings is no laughing matter considering that average SWIFT transfer costs $63(REF:E), which extends to $447,300,000,000.00 per year.  The implantation of xCurrent would save consumers and banks $268,380,000,000.00 each year without the implementation of XRP and $313,110,000,000.00 with it. 

Ripple also has two other “solutions” as they call it. xRapid which is a low-cost liquidity solution, basically what they would, hopefully, convince banks to use after the adaption of xCurrent. Currently, xRapid is being beta tested by some remittance companies (moneygram, etc), but again that is a small portion of the overall global money transfer ecosystem. 

The other solution is xVia which is for,”… corporates, payment providers and banks who want to send payments across various networks using a standard interface.” I imagine the target audience of this solution would be Amazon or Alibaba, basically large multinational corporations who are doing business in all corners of the globe and are interested in reducing their costs and improving the bottom line. I haven’t looked into how large of a market this is as it is tough to quantify the potential of global markets, specifically emerging markets.  Also, this solution is not operational yet.

Why it matters? 

1.	It shows the ambition of the ripple team. They are in the select group of crypto companies/currencies that are attempting to address a real world problem, worth quadrillions of dollars. 

2.	It’s a quadrillion dollar market that is growing and will continue to grow with the global economy. If Ripple was to capture just a quarter of this market ($2,741,647,648,216.43) and managed to implement XRP in said market. A single XRP token would have to be worth, at minimum, $27.42 ($2,741,647,648,216.43/99,992,618,103.26(REF:E)=27.42). 

This figure does not account for transaction costs (the destruction of XRPs), the potential impacts of xVia, or the growth of the global economy.  

3.	This math also shows how much farther Ripple and XRP have to go before they are real contender in the global money transfer ecosystem. 

Summary 

Ripple is after a huge marketplace. The success of Ripple will not necessarily result in an increase in value for the XRP token, especially if it is not adapted. If Ripple is successful both in convincing banks to use their software solutions and XRP a source of liquidity the value of XRP could increase 2,700-10,000% but there is no timeline for this as there are too many unknowns. Simply put Ripple are just pups nipping at the heels of giants. Only time will tell if they level the playing field or the playing field levels them.

personalfinance,Have an okay credit score. Advice about financing a car with a comfortable income and high interest rate.,"Hi PF,

My situation is that i make good money. about 80k after taxes. My car is giving out and i work in a very superficial industry. Real Estate. I definitely need a presentable car for my clients and i drive them a bit so it's important to have something nice. I don't need a lexus or a RR. Just something newer and presentable

Thankfully i can just do an optioned out Accord at 27k out the door. I only pay 650 in rent and have no other debt obligations and good savings.

I can be approved for 15% today.. It's an awful rate i know. That's with a credit union. (Repo from four years ago, lender will not negotiate to remove. Tried every route and talking to lawyers they told me to suck it up for a few years. Pull a 680 Fico even with the REPO) 

However, if i put down 10k it brought the payment from 540-380. I can definitely use 10k a little more wisely and i can pay off the car within a year no problem. Also I can in theory eat that extra 150 a month.

Should I,

A) Put no money down and eat 17% for 6 months and a high (but not really considering my take home) payment. Then refinance with no money down.


B) Put 10k down and snowball the carpayment and use the high interest as a motivator.

C) Put no money down, eat the high rate, and in 6 months, refinance with my 10k budgeted. Really don't want to bleed the 10k in anyway.

No I can't get a beater with my profession it's off the table but it'd appreciate any helpI can get in anyway. Thank you!

CryptoCurrency,Lets talk about the infamous IRS tax guidance PDF and capital gains regarding exchanging one virtual currency protocol like bitcoin for another virtual currency protocol like ethereum SPECIFICALLY.,"Lets talk about the infamous IRS tax guidance PDF and capital gains regarding exchanging one virtual currency protocol like bitcoin for another virtual currency protocol like ethereum SPECIFICALLY.

 &gt;https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-virtual-currency-guidance  See PDF link Notice 2014-21. Q&amp;A 6 and 7.

This comes up so often i am going to have to make some sort of general paste.

Lets start with the webpage and notice what it DOESNT say:

&gt;The notice provides that virtual currency is treated as property for U.S. federal tax purposes.  General tax principles that apply to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency.  Among other things, this means that:

&gt;Wages paid to employees using virtual currency are taxable to the employee, must be reported by an employer on a Form W-2, and are subject to federal income tax withholding and payroll taxes.

&gt;Payments using virtual currency made to independent contractors and other service providers are taxable and self-employment tax rules generally apply.  &gt;Normally, payers must issue Form 1099.

&gt;The character of gain or loss from the sale or exchange of virtual currency depends on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer.

&gt;A payment made using virtual currency is subject to information reporting to the same extent as any other payment made in property. 


End quote.

Please note while it says the exchange of virtual currencies is taxable and then gives examples of the exchange of virtusl currencies for things or work or fiat or OTHER PROPERTY it does NOT say the exchange of virtual currencies for other virtual currencies is taxable and it never gives an example of that case. 

They could have said that but they didnt.

The guidance  is instead spending time and examples  talking about the exchange/sale of virtual currencies for work or for retail goods or business capital goods. (my guess is they were talking about when a store lets you buy something with crypto which was a big new thing then)

Also in the PDF Examples (which i cant cut and paste) they also do not give a ""virtual currencies exchanged for virtual currency"" example. Clearly if they meant it was taxable they would have given an example because it would have been one of the largest sources of taxes. For example they never say ""if you bought bitcoin at this date and exchanged it for ethereum at this date then here is how you calulate gains."" Again the lack of that example is strange if they think you owe taxes on virtual currency to virtual currency exchanges because it would be one of the most common cases covered by the guidance. Certainly more common than being paid for work in crypto which they do give an example of.

But they didnt.

Everyone reading it into the guidance is not actually relying on what the guidance actually says.

They are assuming the guidance meant something none of the IRS lawyers actually said Thise lawyers  no doubt spent weeks writing it and proof reading it. Dont you think if those lawyers meant it to say "" virtual currency to virtual currency exchanges are taxable ""then they would have clesrly said that and given an example?

And none of this has anything to do with like kind exchanges. You dont need a like kind exchange tax exemption  if they havent made a law or given guidance saying something is taxable to begin with so the often cited 2018 like kind exchange change is irrelevant.


Now a lot of people are throwing around cpa advise here whuch i havent actually ever seen. The recent AMA cpas only said ""most people think"". That isnt an opinion. that's an admission thst they arent sure and they wont say.

So here are some questions for your cpa or any cpa 

If they say ""pratically every CPA"" says this

What about the CPA'S that dont ssy its taxable?

And why do you think ""pratically every cpa"" thinks that? Have you seen a poll? Whereis tust coming from. Have you asked one who doesnt? Why not choose the logic of the one who doesnt? Why not use the rational of one who doesnt? Some CPA'S are better than others.

Ask a cpa where is it EXPLICITLY  stated in any IRS guidance or congressional legislation that you owe capital gains if exchanging one virtual currency FOR ANOTHER VIRTUAL CURRENCY? 

Have you asked the cpa if they know that switching crypto isnt switching anything but computer protocols? 

Have you asked them if they know the little pictures of bitcoins arent of real coins and that crypto coins dont exist or arent a ledger of actual coins or anything else anywhere at all but is actual simply pure computer communications protocol like TCP/IP or html?

Most people including cpa's have no idea what particpating in blockchain protocol actually is. Its not their fault. Its complicated computer expertise snd most people have no idea. They think of the pictures of littles coins they see. Those dont actually exist.


Have you asked them why  they dont think you owe capital gains when reading one page of info in html and anothe rin javascript?

I'm not being a smartass.

Those are serious questions i would ask any cpa who tells you you owe capital gians specifically on the ""exchange of one virtual currency for another virtual currency""  when youn ever sold to cash. That specific exchange which is in actual fact simply an exchange of one computer communication protocol for another as i said.

I would actually love to hear the answer anyone gets from their cpa on those  SPECIFIC questions

NOT on general ""property"" arguments and not on extrapolation of the term exchange in the guidance.

And not of course on like kind which i am not currently talking about.


Disclaimer. I am not a cpa or tax advisor or your advisor or a lawyer. These are my personal opinions just like everyones elses)

And none of this is about a taxprotest or any such nonsense. I am always happy to pay taxes i owe.

If tomorrow the irs says ""you need to pay taxes if you exchanged virtual currency for virtual currency then you need to calculate your gain at the cash value even if you never went to cash"" then i will of course do that.  But they havent. Anywhere.

CryptoCurrency,I propose an optimistic view about the market right now! Hear me out.,"In the past, you may have been a part of a sub for a coin that has a thread, during a dip, titled: “This is good for us, the weak hands are leaving.” This is one of those threads.

So many new people have come into the crypto space in the last 6 months. We are just now finding out who the real ones are that believe in the tech, and/or the stubborn ones that just won’t sell for the life of them even if it hits 0.

With this crash, “the weak hands are leaving. Good, we can buy at a discount.”

Sure there’s still plenty of uncertainty. But think of it this way: the market gained so many people that are commited long-term to crypto—Even if some of these people sold, goodness knows they are gonna buy back in sometime.

Every day new people come into crypto. Like an interest rate, some of these people add to the HODL crowd, or the people that support the tech in general. They’re not going away.

Who knows where the bottom of this crash is, but it sure isn’t gonna go below where it’s crashed before. We have new people, new people like many of you. 

It’s good that we can “weed out” the “weak hands,” because besides the whales they’re the ones that assist in making the market so volatile—why we always fear a crash like this one. They’ll be leaving. We can worry about that again when we are enjoying the next ATH.",cryptocurrency

I believe they are taking a very blunt approach and not recognizing the nunances invovled of a digital asset. Time will tell if they are right, but the immediate effect will be chilling of all activities in the U.S. for fear of violating securities laws.

Below I went through the 10 pages, and summarized / pasted the most relevant sections. 

As a further disclaimer I'm not a securities lawyer by any means, but I think they are being very loud and clear with the message they are trying to convey. 


I welcome discussion and I hope that I'm proven wrong. 




Basic summary: SEC / CFTC consider all Cryptocurrency and ICO activities to fall under securities regulations. They will be going after ICOs and have established a specific cyber unit to address them. 

Form arguments of ""Utility tokens"" are considered invalid due to the role of exchanges / secondary markets and marketing on gains of value. 


Introduction – Basic summary of the technology and highlighting the concern of how actors have had used the appearances of regulated actors (i.e. stock market exchanges), to pass of unrelated activity, which provides high risk for investors. 
 
New technology with value, but no rules to govern. Potential for fraud crossing borders which is difficult to regulate.

 
Key excerpts and summaries
 
 
Exchanges:
 
SEC Looking more closely at exchanges as cryptos they appear to be used as securities. They are incorrectly registered as money transmitters. Not following proper KYC / AML laws. 
 
 
 
None of the current players have properly registered as a securities broker, and ETFs / other products have attempted registration but there are outstanding concerns not addressed, many have revoked their request. 
 
***
 
The SEC regulates securities transactions and certain individuals and firms who participate in our securities markets. The SEC does not have direct oversight of transactions in currencies or commodities, including currency trading platforms.
 
 
While there are cryptocurrencies that, at least as currently designed, promoted and used, do not appear to be securities, simply calling something a “currency” or a currency-based product does not mean that it is not a security. To this point I would note that many products labeled as cryptocurrencies or related assets are increasingly being promoted as investment opportunities that rely on the efforts of others, with their utility as an efficient medium for commercial exchange being a distinct secondary characteristic. As discussed in more detail below, if a cryptocurrency, or a product with its value tied to one or more cryptocurrencies, is a security, its promoters cannot make offers or sales unless they comply with the registration and other requirements under our federal securities laws.10
 
 
In this regard, the SEC is monitoring the cryptocurrency-related activities of the market participants it regulates, including brokers, dealers, investment advisers and trading platforms.
 
Brokers, dealers and other market participants that allow for payments in cryptocurrencies, allow customers to purchase cryptocurrencies (including on margin) or otherwise use cryptocurrencies
 
to facilitate securities transactions should exercise particular caution, including ensuring that their cryptocurrency activities are not undermining their anti-money laundering and know-your customer obligations.11 As I have stated previously, these market participants should treat payments and other transactions made in cryptocurrency as if cash were being handed from one party to the other.


10 It is possible to conduct an offer and sales of securities, including an ICO, without triggering the SEC’s registration requirements. For example, just as with a Regulation D exempt offering to raise capital for the manufacturing of a physical product, an ICO that is a security can be structured so that it qualifies for an applicable exemption from the registration requirements.
 
11 I am particularly concerned about market participants who extend to customers credit in U.S. dollars – a relatively table asset – to enable the purchase of cryptocurrencies, which, in recent experience, have proven to be a more volatile asset.

***
 
 
 



ICOs:
 
SEC considers vast majority of ICOs to be securities due to the fact that the efforts of management raise their value, and a majority are being traded on secondary markets rather than on their platform. 
 
Utility / form arguments of ICOs are considered invalid.
 
 

***
 
 
 
Coinciding with the substantial growth in cryptocurrencies, companies and individuals increasingly have been using so-called ICOs to raise capital for businesses and projects.Typically, these offerings involve the opportunity for individual investors to exchange currency, such as U.S. dollars or cryptocurrencies, in return for a digital asset labeled as a coin or token.
 
The size of the ICO market has grown exponentially in the last year, and it is estimated that almost $4 billion was raised through ICOs in 2017. Note that this number may understate the size of the ICO market (and the potential for loss) as many ICOs “trade up” after they are issued.
 
 
 
 
 These offerings can take different forms, and the rights and interests a coin is purported to provide the holder can vary widely. A key question all ICO market participants – promoters, sellers, lawyers, officers and directors and accountants, as well as investors – should ask: “Is the coin or token a security?” As securities law practitioners know well, the answer depends on the facts. But by and large, the structures of ICOs that I have seen involve the offer and sale of securities and directly implicate the securities registration requirements and other investor protection provisions of our federal securities laws. As noted above, the foundation of our federal securities laws is to provide investors with the procedural protections and information they need to make informed judgments about what they are investing in and the relevant risks involved. In addition, our federal securities laws provide a wide array of remedies, including criminal and civil actions brought by the DOJ and the SEC, as well as private rights of action.
 
 
The statement I issued in December that was directed to Main Street investors and market professionals provided additional insight into how practitioners should view ICOs in the context of our federal securities laws. Certain market professionals have attempted to highlight the utility or voucher-like characteristics of their proposed ICOs in an effort to claim that their proposed tokens or coins are not securities. Many of these assertions that the federal securities laws do not apply to a particular ICO appear to elevate form over substance. The rise of these form-based arguments is a disturbing trend that deprives investors of mandatory protections that clearly are required as a result of the structure of the transaction. Merely calling a token a “utility” token or structuring it to provide some utility does not prevent the token from being a security.15 Tokens and offerings that incorporate features and marketing efforts that emphasize the potential for profits based on the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others continue to contain the hallmarks of a security under U.S. law. It is especially troubling when the promoters of these offerings emphasize the secondary market trading potential of these tokens, i.e., the ability to sell them on an exchange at a profit. In short, prospective purchasers are being sold on the potential for tokens to increase in value – with the ability to lock in those increases by reselling the tokens on a secondary market – or to otherwise profit from the tokens based on the efforts of others. These are key hallmarks of a security and a securities offering.
 
I also have cautioned market participants against promoting or touting the offer and sale of coins without first determining whether the securities laws apply to those actions. Engaging in the business of selling securities generally requires a license, and experience shows that excessive touting in thinly traded and volatile markets can be an indicator of “scalping,” “pump and dump” and other manipulations and frauds. Similarly, my colleagues and I have cautioned those who operate systems and platforms that effect or facilitate transactions in these products that they may be operating unregistered exchanges or broker-dealers that are in violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 
 
 
I do want to recognize that recently social media platforms have restricted the ability of users to promote ICOs and cryptocurrencies on their platforms. I appreciate the responsible step.
 
 
 
15 See SEC v. C.M. Joiner Leasing Corp., 320 U.S. 344, 351 (1943) (“[T]he reach of the [Securities] Act does not stop with the obvious and commonplace. Novel, uncommon, or irregular devices, whatever they appear to be, are also reached if it be proved as matter of fact that they were widely offered or dealt in under terms or courses of dealing which established their character in commerce as ‘investment contracts,’ or as ‘any interest or instrument commonly known as a ‘security’.”); see also Reves v. Ernst &amp; Young, 494 U.S. 56, 61 (1990) (“Congress’ purpose in enacting the securities laws was to regulate investments, in whatever form they are made and by whatever name they are called.”).

Enforcement: 
 
 
 
Cyber unit started. Action being taken against ICOs. Further action to be taken
 
****

In September 2017, the Division of Enforcement established a new Cyber Unit focused on misconduct involving distributed ledger technology and ICOs, the spread of false information through electronic and social media, brokerage account takeovers, hacking to obtain nonpublic information and threats to trading platforms.17 The Cyber Unit works closely with our crossdivisional
Distributed Ledger Technology Working Group, which was created in November 2013. We believe this approach has enabled us to leverage our enforcement resources effectively and coordinate well within the Commission, as well as with other federal and state
regulators.
 
To date, we have brought a number of enforcement actions concerning ICOs for alleged violations of the federal securities laws. In September 2017, we brought charges against an individual for defrauding investors in a pair of ICOs purportedly backed by investments in real estate and diamonds.18 According to the SEC’s complaint, investors provided approximately $300,000 in funding and were told they could expect sizeable returns despite neither company having real operations. In December 2017, we obtained an emergency asset freeze to halt an alleged ICO fraud that purportedly raised up to $15 million from thousands of individual investors beginning in August 2017.19 According to the complaint, the scam was operated by a recidivist securities law violator and promised investors a more than 1,300 percent profit in under 29 days. As another example, after being contacted by the SEC last December, a company halted its ICO to raise capital for a blockchain-based food review service, and then settled proceedings in which we determined that the ICO was an unregistered offering and sale of securities in violation of the federal securities laws.20 Before tokens were delivered to investors, the company refunded investor proceeds after the SEC intervened. And most recently, we halted an allegedly fraudulent ICO that targeted retail investors promoting what it portrayed as the world’s first decentralized bank.21 We were able to freeze some of the allegedly ill-gotten cryptocurrency assets and obtained a receiver to try to marshal these assets back to harmed investors.
 
 
With the support of my fellow Commissioners, I have asked the SEC’s Division of Enforcement to continue to police these markets vigorously and recommend enforcement actions against those who conduct ICOs or engage in other actions relating to cryptocurrencies in violation of the federal securities laws. In doing so, the SEC and CFTC are collaborating on our approaches to policing these markets for fraud and abuse.22 We also will continue to work closely with our federal and state counterparts, including the Department of Treasury, Department of Justice and state attorneys general and securities regulators

personalfinance,"refinance auto loan to put my name on it, or get a credit card, or both?","My husband and I wanted to buy the house we are currently renting, and learned our credit is still not so great.

-Not necessary backstory here-

We already owned a house, but had to relocate because of a job.  We rented the house out because market value of house was less than what we paid for it so it would be shortsale.  Renter turned out to be a prostitute that got busted and so never paid us rent.  We couldn't keep up mortgage payments for it along with paying our own rent, and took a ton of legal fees just to get prostitute evicted, and then other squatters removed.  We ended up just forfeiting the mortgage and giving it to the bank.

-End Backstory-

So when credit was checked, it turns out I have absolutely nothing on my records except the house stuff from 5 years ago.  My husband forgot to make phone calls a couple times with his student loans to continue deferring them while getting loan forgiveness (he's a teacher), so his credit score is low.

The only current open accounts are all in good standing on my husband's credit... just the student loans, still waiting for forgiveness, and then our vehicle. 

His credit has been raising up because of the vehicle payments, and we thought I was on there too, but it turns out I'm not.  So we're wondering if the best way to get me credit is to refinance the car (since he could get it at a lower interest rate now anyway with better credit) or to just sign me up for a credit card.  Or both?

I should mention, because we looked into getting a mortgage to buy the house, we do have a hard inquiry on our credit recently also.

We budget everything, have emergency savings, etc.

Any suggestions?",finance

I'm a few years into a 30 year mortgage with an interest rate of 4%. A couple houses very near mine were bought at the same time as mine and are now being sold (and quickly) for about 30% more than they sold for less than three years ago.

I'm a total idiot with this stuff, but I'm wondering if there's something I should be doing to capitalize on the increasing property value. The only thing I know I want to do is get an appraisal to get rid of PMI, but is there anything else? I also thought of refinancing to a 15-year mortgage, but the interest rate isn't much better than my current rate. Thanks for any input!",finance

I know very little about all of this, and I don’t know what would be the best option, but my plan so far for this would to be putting all of this away initially, and then adding a percentage of my paycheck to it throughout the years. My goal is to hopefully start gaining enough to pay back student loans and credit card debt, but I would like to have this set up long term. 

I’m not looking to make a ton of money from this, but I’d like something that would allow me to watch it grow over time.

“Through the years, technological innovations have improved our markets, including through increased competition, lower barriers to entry and decreased costs for market participants. Distributed ledger and other emerging technologies have the potential to further influence and improve the capital markets and the financial services industry. Businesses, especially smaller businesses without efficient access to traditional capital markets, can be aided by financial technology in raising capital to establish and finance their operations, thereby allowing them to be more competitive both domestically and globally. And these technological innovations can provide investors with new opportunities to offer support and capital to novel concepts and ideas.
History, both in the United States and abroad, has proven time and again that these opportunities flourish best when pursued in harmony with our federal securities laws. These laws reflect our tripartite mission to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly and efficient markets and facilitate capital formation. Being faithful to each part of our mission not in isolation, but collectively, has served us well. Said simply, we should embrace the pursuit of technological advancement, as well as new and innovative techniques for capital raising, but not at the expense of the principles undermining our well-founded and proven approach to protecting investors and markets.”

personalfinance,Will paying off both my car and my student loans in the same 10-month timespan severely damage my credit score?,"Hello! 
I am a twenty-something with a young credit history. Score currently 782. The oldest account is about 6 years old, and it's one of my student loans. Currently I have 2 credit cards (the highest has a $15k limit) that I keep under 10% usage (just bills, gas, groceries, misc), a car that I refinanced in october 2016 ($1,900 remaining from original $12,800 purchase), and ~$10,000 remaining in student loans after graduating with $30k in loan debt about 3 years ago. 
Car payment is $156/month at 4.6% interest rate. I pay $300/month. Student loans have a min payment of $317/month and I pay $700. The interest rates on pretty much all of those are 6%+.

I want to kill off the car payment in full this month and then apply that $300 to my student loans, which would make it $1000/month and kill my student loans in 10 months. So closing multiple accounts in 10 months. Of course the bank wants my interest money so they told me to keep paying the car. I am aware that my credit will take a pretty big hit from closing these out, but I am uncomfortable with debt and do not like having it. 

My husband and I are planning on purchasing a home in approximately 2 years. We have roughly the same credit score (his car was bought in cash, zero student debt due to scholarships) and have a pretty decent downpayment saved up so far, but I would prefer to put even more money into our downpayment savings by not having the car or student loans.

Thoughts?? Would the big credit score ding from closing all those accounts in 10 months be greater than the benefit of not having the debt in the grand scheme of things?

I drive 92 highway miles round-trip a day to/from work. So, I’m thinking by next year I’m going to need something else.

Federal Student Loans $103.93 on $33,724, 6.125%  (Currently on Income Based Repayment plan, which is based on yearly AGI, this payment will go up come June. I’m also enrolled in PSLF, so roughly August of 2022 my federal loan balance will be wiped clean, PSLF is a non-taxable event.)

AES Private Student Loan#2 (father co-signed): $182.75, $19,656.56-7.06% Variable Rate.


I had about 25k more in private student loans but aggressively paid those off, after which I became lax with my money because I had been doing NOTHING but paying bills for 4 years, which is how I have raked up the credit card debt, in the past 3 years or so-trying to take a more balanced approach to debt payment now so I don’t fall into that trap again.

personalfinance,Physician looking for advice regarding purchasing a condo vs renting,"I'm currently a medical resident who's about to start fellowship. I apologize if my questions are dumb. While I've received excellent medical training, my education has unfortunately failed me in terms of handling personal financial issues and I'm finding myself doing a lot of self-education (Khan Academy, books, etc) to try to catch up with my non-medical friends. My financial situation is as follows:

Income: Will be making approximately $62k per year for the next few years (and am currently making around $58k) and that salary will increase by $1-2k with each passing year in fellowship. I anticipate my income to (hopefully) at least triple that in approximately 4-5 years.

Living: Will be moving to the Midwest and will likely stay in that same city for at least 4-5 years. Not fully sure if I'll stay longer than 7 years.

Loans: Have about $160k in federal loans from medical school. Also borrowed some money from my parents that I want to pay back sooner rather than later. I'm currently mainly paying off the interest monthly and am in an income-based repayment program. I'm hoping that PSLF will continue to exist for the next 7 years, but I'm assuming it won't.

Current savings: Approximately $30k in the bank. Currently in the process of investing money in mutual funds, etc.

I've been looking at condos around the $250k range in a city where there are a lot of young professionals moving and the housing market is projected to grow significantly in the coming years. I'm expecting to be in the same city for at least 4-5 years, but I'm not 100% sure if I'll be there for &gt;7 years. I anticipate starting a family in the next few years, but not within the next 3-4 years or so. If I buy, I'm interested in a condo for now due to it allowing me to be more hands-off re: maintenance, etc. Additionally, I'll be able to take out a ""doctor's loan"" to help pay.

My questions are as follows:

1. As someone who is in significant debt from medical school loans, would I be taking a big risk in buying a condo and taking out additional loans? A 7/1 adjustable-rate mortgage is what physician friends who have bought or are currently buying have recommended for me (since I'm unsure if I'll be in the same city for &gt;7 years).
2. In a major city that's experiencing a lot of influx of young professionals and seeing a lot of growth, what would happen if I decided to move in 5 years instead of staying there for the length of my mortgage? Would I face penalties for selling the condo before I fully pay off the mortgage? If I sell the condo for more than I paid for it, I'm assuming I keep the profit (eg. whatever's left over after paying off the bank mortgage). I've read that it's common to sell properties while still in mortgage, but I don't fully understand what's involved in that process.
3. I'm currently reading through the White Coat Investor book. Are there any other specific books that you guys would recommend that are physician-specific?

Thank you so much and I apologize again for these possibly dumb questions. In the medical field, there's so much delayed gratification and we don't start making any money until our mid-to-late 20s and I feel much more overwhelmed making these financial decisions since so much of my education has been focused purely on taking care of sick patients.",finance

My question is how much to throw at it monthly after this. In a perfect scenario, the loan is paid off by the end of the year. This is perfectly doable if I pay $1000 per month give or take. I budget based off two paychecks per month instead of my average monthly pay. With the $1000 loan payment I still have $450 leftover each month after any and all bills and budgeted expenses, while not touching my emergency fund.

Is this a smart choice? Or should I pay $500 per month and pay it down slower while having more money to save each month?

Thank you.",finance
personalfinance,Lawsuit Settlement $100k,"This might be a little long winded, I'm sorry in advance.

My husband and I are part of a lawsuit that is settling soon, it looks like we'll be getting around $100k (after lawyer fees, etc.).  I'm not exactly sure how to approach this, so I'm going to just break it all down and I would value anyone else's feedback.

We are opening our own business right now (in the process of looking for a space). We're hoping to open some time this summer.  My husband and I are both working and he will quit his job as soon as we open.  We're both 40, no kids.

Salary:

His (currently) $56k (we have our budget worked out so that he does not need to take a salary for the first year he's in business)

Mine: $112k  

Debts:

$20k in personal loan + credit cards (6% on personal loan, 9.99% on CC)

$16k in student loan (3.5%)

$15k car loan (5%)

$50k loan against my 401k (4%)

$60k loan  for business (have not touched this yet) (I have to double check this, my husband set up this loan, I don't know)

$25k Credit Card for business (have not touched this yet) (9%)


Equity:

$45k in savings for business 

Husbands 401k $200k

My 401k (after loan) $110K

Our house was collateral for the $60k loan.  We bought last year for $350k put 20% down ($70k) the appraisal that came back last month while we were applying for the loan was $410k.

We own a car and pickup outright (both in good condition).  

My questions:
1 - How much in taxes are we going to pay on this money?  
2 - Do I put this into savings??  Do I pay off debt??  Do I  invest it?  

I've never been in this situation, so I'd love some help here.

If you guys aren't aware, the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs are having a meeting tomorrow to discuss Cryptocurrency, ICOs, and Blockchain technology. 

I'll give you guys a little background and a TLDR summary for each of the testimonies for quick reference but please read the full testimonies to make your own opinion. 

The first testimony is made by Jay Clayton, the Chairman of the SEC commission.

* Goals of SEC is to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly and efficient markets through enforcement of federal security laws. 

* Acknowledgement of cryptocurrencies as securities (i.e. similar to stock) instead of as a ""currency"" or ""utility coin"" so it will abide to U.S. laws similar to stocks.

* Increase regulations and enforcement of federal securities laws towards ICOs to prevent fraudulent activities such as pump and dumps, illegal scalping, scams, etc.

The second testament is by Christopher Giancarlo, Chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

* The mission of CFTC is to foster open, transparent, competitive, and financially sound derivatives markets.

* First-half talks about the examples of ponzi schemes in cryptocurrency.

* Increased regulation and transparency of bitcoin futures.

* Importance of consumer education.

* Potential benefits of Blockchain, or distributed ledger technology (DLT) which include enhancing economic efficiency, mitigate centralized systemic risk, defend against fraudulent activities, improved data quality, and governance.

* How DLT can be used to save financial institutions 20 billion a year in operation costs and infrastructure. 

* How DLT can be used to cut trading settlements by a third, 16 billion a year and cut capital requirements by $120 billion.

* ""Do not harm"" approach towards DLT but more regulations towards virtual currencies.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,[Help] Loan situation,"Hi all.

So I'm kinda in a weird spot. I told myself I didn't want to take on any more loans but I just might have to now.

I'm finishing up grad school this summer and I was going to pay the last 2 classes off in cash but then I remembered I have a pretty big parent plus loan that is probably going to be harsh on me later too.

Instead of paying the grad school off in cash would it be smarter to just put that cash towards the parent plus loan I have and take out a normal loan for the rest of this gradschool. I'm assuming this interest rate would be lower than the parent plus loan.

I'm also looking into refinancing the parent plus loan with SOFI so it could potentially be a lot lower on the interest and the outrageous monthly payment they want from me.

Parent plus wants like 700 a month from me because they're basing that off my income + my parents. My income is extremely low and I can barely afford that. I told them this and they said they don't care :/

personalfinance,"I want to go back to college, but I directly own my university a lot of money. This is a huge obstacle in my life and I could use some advice.","I'll try to keep it as short as I can, but with enough detail to understand my situation. (The main question is at the very end) Here goes:

I am currently 23, and have not been in college since 2015 (officially). 

I went to Penn State for (officially) 3 semesters between 2013 and 2015. In two consecutive semesters, I enrolled and was forced to take a leave of absence (first by illness, second by inability to commute). Both semesters, since the school didn't receive my loans just yet, they simply canceled my schedule, even though I'd first requested a medical leave be documented; since it was simpler for them to cancel my schedule and it wouldn't have any effect on my loans (so we thought), that's just what we did. When I enrolled again for the Fall '15 semester, and was told roughly 4 weeks in that I had defaulted on my loans--I thought I had been continuously enrolled and had documented schedule cancellations, and nobody bothered to correct me or warn me.

I scrambled that semester to find out how I would be able to pay for that semester, lest I be kicked out of school. Fortunately (or so I had thought at the time), the university allowed me to attend and owe a debt to them for the semester. I made monthly payments to get myself out of default and back into good standing over the next 6 months. BUT FOR FALL 2015, I owed Penn State $9650. Directly.

I attended Spring 2016, did some of my best work, ran two clubs, a Student Government committee, led a student research project, attended numerous events on behalf of the university, and even won a few (non-monetary) academic awards. One week before finals, they finally asked how I would pay for the previous semester and then the current one. I thought they would do the same thing, but alas, for they did not. I didn't know what to do or what was going to happen. Ultimately, I worked myself to the bone all for naught.

What I owe in federal loans is totally separate, and I'm taking care of that just fine. But, Penn State, naturally, sent my $9650 debt to collections.

After going down every avenue I possibly could to find some way to either have that semester's debt forgiven (and thus have all academic credit expunged) or attend another school, I found that I couldn't really do either.

If I had the semester erased from my academic record, I would STILL owe Penn State that money. Apparently, there's no way around it. If I tried to go to another university, I would need my PSU transcripts, which they will not allow me to obtain because I owe them money, therefore, I cannot even apply to another university.

As much as I actually like working in a restaurant, it's not what I want to do for the rest of my life. I have a whole list of things I want to do, and not being able to earn my degree has completely stymied that progress. I don't make enough money to support myself AND put more than $25 per month aside to pay that debt off. That's not enough money, and that's TOO long a process.

I'm eligible for federal loans again, and I want to get back into school within the next year or so. Since I can neither take those Federal loans until I'm back in school, nor can I have those loans cover past semesters, I was considering getting a private loan (if I even CAN at this point) to pay back that $9650 to Penn State. Is this a good idea or a bad idea? Advice is greatly appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,"23 year old new grad, paying off student loans + never had a credit card before. Best approach to building credit?","Hello, /r/personalfinance!

I’m a 23-year-old new grad (graduated Dec. 2017) and I recently secured employment with the following pay:

Salary | Amount
:-- | :--
Weekly | $1,400
Monthly | ~$6K
Yearly | ~$72K
 
I have the potential to bring that pay up to ~91K through overtime and bonuses but that’s best-case scenario. I would be paid weekly. My employer offers a 401k profit sharing plan.

I read through the ""advice for young adults"" wiki and it's been helpful but I'm looking for any other advice specific to my situation.

In terms of expenses, really the only big thing I have to worry about are my student loans since my work is only a 10 minute drive from home. I have ~18K in federal student loans at an average interest rate of 4.2%. All of them are direct subsidized loans. According to the repayment estimator, if I go with the Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE) plan:

Monthly Payment | Total Amount Paid | Repayment Period
:-- | :-- | :--
$449 - $533 | ~$19K | 41 months

If I put in $500/month (~8% of my monthly gross income), I can finish in 38 months but I’d be willing to put in more a month so that I can pay less interest. Would it be wise to bring that up to $1000/month or maybe even $2000/month? I’m generally a frugal person. There’d probably a burst of spending to upgrade my PC but after that, the rest of the $ would go into savings/paying off student loans.

I used a debit card throughout my undergrad so I’ve never had a credit card before. What are some things I should know before getting a credit card and building credit? I’m starting with a clean slate so I want to approach this diligently.

investing,Is this the start of a rotation into real estate?,"Thesis is pretty simple:

* Stock market pullback and uncertain central back activity prompts individual investors to look for non-stock investments

*  Rising interest rates and looser regulations incentivizes increased lending to individuals.

*  Deregulation and tax reform incentivizes building by real estate developers.

*  Meanwhile, real economy is still pretty good, job market is strong, and wage growth is kicking in, giving people the means to buy.

*  Rising inflation puts additional pressures on buyers.

I wanna get rid of this thing ASAP. It was a mistake. I am in a job now where I am fully reimbursed and encouraged to utilize public transportation, which I do daily. The truck literally just sits in my driveway, a daily reminder of a giant financial mistake.

This truck is the only debt that I have (no CC debt or student loans etc.), but I do have some rather costly monthly expenses.

Rent - $1100/mo

Car Insurance - $180/mo

Phone - $50/mo

Groceries - $100/mo roughly

Since it's pretty difficult for me to throw extra money at this truck each month without putting myself in a danger zone for the rest of the month, I am living paycheck to paycheck and I hate it.

I have considered taking out a personal loan to cover the difference and selling it to CarMax. 

As far as privately selling it, I just gave up after 3 months of dealing with shitheads on Craigslist who completely wasted my time. I have decided I would rather just sell it to CarMax.

CarMax has given me an offer of $23,000, but obviously I need to make up the other $6k somehow.

I'm waiting on some loan application responses from a couple banks, but LC and Prosper have offered me loans with interest rates of 24% and 27%... Now, I'm not very financially savvy, but I'm pretty sure that is a bad idea... Right? 

Should I just ride it out and accept that I made a costly mistake? Really don't know what to do.

America never suppresses Innovation.
Innovations start and flourish in America.
==========
When they (the banks and recent crackdown on customers) fear you, they try to suppress you. But wait, innovation always wins.

Highlights from tomorrow's testimony from Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman-

1. ""These warnings are not an effort to undermine the fostering of innovation through our capital markets –**America was built on the ingenuity, vision and spirit of entrepreneurs who tackled old and new problems in new, innovative ways**. Rather, they are meant to educate Main Street investors that many promoters of ICOs and cryptocurrencies are not complying with our
securities laws and, as a result, the risks are significant.""

2. ""Through the years, technological innovations have improved our markets, including through increased competition, lower barriers to entry and decreased costs for market participants. **Distributed ledger and other emerging technologies have the potential to further influence and improve the capital markets and the financial services industry**. Businesses, especially smaller businesses without efficient access to traditional capital markets, can be aided by financial technology in raising capital to establish and finance their operations, thereby allowing them to be more competitive both domestically and globally. And these technological innovations can provide investors with new opportunities to offer support and capital to novel concepts and ideas.""

3. ""Said simply,**we should embrace the pursuit of technological advancement, as well as new and innovative techniques for capital raising**, but not at the expense of the principles undermining our well-founded and proven approach to protecting investors and
markets.""

==================================================================================
Highlights from Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman

1. ""Traditionally, there has been a need for a trusted intermediary – for example a bank or other financial institution – to serve as a gatekeeper for transactions and many economic activities. **Virtual currencies seek to replace the need for a central authority or intermediary with a decentralized, rules-based and open consensus mechanism.  An array of thoughtful business, technology, academic, and policy leaders have extrapolated some of the possible impacts that derive from such an innovation, including how market participants conduct transactions, transfer ownership, and power peer-to-peer applications and economic systems.**""

2. ""...In fact, virtual currencies may be all things to all people: **for some, potential riches, the next big thing, a technological revolution, and an exorable value proposition; for others, a fraud, a new form of temptation and allure, and a way to separate the unsuspecting from their money.**""

3. ""The CFTC and SEC, along with other federal and state regulators and criminal authorities, will continue to work together to bring transparency and integrity to these markets and, importantly, **to deter and prosecute fraud and abuse**. These markets are new, evolving and international. As such **they require us to be nimble and forward-looking**; coordinated with our state, federal and
international colleagues; and engaged with important stakeholders, including Congress.""

4. ""**We are entering a new digital era in world financial markets. As we saw with the development of the Internet, we cannot put the technology genie back in the bottle. Virtual currencies mark a paradigm shift in how we think about payments, traditional financial processes, and engaging in economic activity. Ignoring these developments will not make them go away, nor is it a responsible regulatory response. The evolution of these assets, their volatility, and the interest they attract from a rising global millennial population demand serious examination.**""

5. ""**With the proper balance of sound policy, regulatory oversight and private sector innovation, new technologies will allow American markets to evolve in responsible ways and continue to grow our economy and increase prosperity. This hearing is an important part of finding that balance.**""

If an investor that has enough money is looking to simply assure a decent livelihood, without timing their market it seems that bonds provide that stability. Simply buy a 20y bond with a 2-3% interest rate.

##What are the risks of such investment?

From my naive understanding of bonds, the only two main risk that I see are:

1. You are missing on other opportunities with higher ROI that you have access with your money
2. The government is unable to pay those bonds.

What are other risks associated with buying bonds that I might be overlooking?

People don't understand money! How the hell are you going to make an investment using a credit card. Now even if you make money, you owe the credit card company.

personalfinance,Tax Help,"Hi personal finance, 

I am new to the world of investing and had a few small questions that I would really appreciate help with! I'm thinking about doing my own taxes this year and even if not, I'd still like to at least understand my return. Sorry in advance for the amount of questions and for how amateur they are. Some are just more confirmation than anything. I made about $95,000 in 2017 if it matters for the questions.

1. I contributed to a Roth 403b fund and have not withdrawn any money. Because it's a Roth, I'm not reporting my contributions. My gains are reported as ""Dividends/Capital Gains"" on my year end form. Do I report this and if so, is it as dividends or capital gains?

2. Same question with an MESP account, do I report the earnings and if so, as what? Again, no withdrawals.

3. I invested a small amount at the end of the year into crypto and a few stocks in Robinhood. I had a pretty decent-sized loss in crypto unfortunately and not much change in the stocks but haven't made any other transactions. If I sell these sometime this year, this is reported as short-term capital losses on my 2018 return, correct? Do I need to report any of this on my 2017 return?

5. I have an Acorns account I use as a short-term savings account using the round-ups. I made $1 in dividends and now have a loss of $8 on the account after this dip today. I plan on cashing this out sometime this year so this would be reported respectively as dividends and capital loss on my 2018 form correct?

6. My W2 has the following boxes: ""federal income tax withheld"", ""social security tax withheld"", ""medicare tax withheld"" and a ""state income tax"" box. TurboTax asks ""what were your 2017 federal witholdings"" which I enter the information in the first box. It then asks ""Any 2017 state withholdings?"". Is this equivalent to what is reported in the ""state income tax"" box? I'm sorry if this is a dumb question but I don't know why the phrasing is different. 

7. Last question.. I live with my girlfriend in a home she owns. We have a child together. She makes about $50,000 a year. Because I make almost twice a much, I end up paying for more than half of everything (cars, cell phones, insurance, daycare, food/groceries, cable/internet, etc) and give her money when needed to pay the mortgage and a couple other bills. Our mortgage is paid from her checking account and the statement is of course in her name. Am I still able to claim head of household and able to claim our child as a dependent?

Thank you for any help! If your advice is to just suck it up and have someone file my taxes, I appreciate that advice as well but again, I'd like to understand all of this myself. Thank you so much!",finance
personalfinance,Considering a Chapter 13,"Hi!

I’m embarrassed, but we are considering a Chapter 13. 

We take home $6,914 per month. 

We have a house and one car which we make payments on ($458/mo at 7.99 for 80 months). The other is owned outright. Our mortgage is $2,451 with everything included (3.25 interest, 30 year, tax, insurance, HOA). We assumed the mortgage from the previous owner with the current amount remaining $371K (roughly). He had the home for about five years. We recently moved to this home and furnished it with credit cards and spent more than we should have. However, we intend to stay in this home for 20 years. In any case, the payments were killing us, so we did a debt consolidation with the furniture cards and some older credit cards to the tune of about 32K. The monthly on that is $713 (15% for 60 months). Utilities are roughly $268-$310 per month depending on how well the solar panels do and how cold it is out (gas heat). Our cable (just subscriptions like Hulu and Netflix), cell phone, and internet is $250 per month. Car insurance is $110. Groceries are like $700 per month and daycare is $800. Plus we need fuel for commuting and that’s like $70 a week. Then we have $659 in college loan payments per month. I have roughly $20K in college debt (interest rates are 5.25 on those) where she still has about $38K (not sure on her interest rate). 

We have no money left over each month or we are negative. We have $458 in our savings account. I put my college loans in temporary forbearance, and I can get my job to repay them come October. That would free up $400 a month. My wife is considering refinancing hers. We thought the consolidation loan would help, but it’s not. It just makes paying easier. They did say we could refinance after six months of payments, though. 

We are considering a Chapter 13 just so we aren’t in the negative each month and that we can have some money in case something happens. Is there anything else we could do? Bad finances reflect poorly on our jobs, so we gotta keep them straight. 

I’ve thought about simply not paying my college loans and letting the jerb take over in October. Getting a second jerb is out of the question as I am already gone all day. The thing is, we were really planning on doing some home equity loan stuff to improve our house come five years from now when the consolidation loan is done. Plus, I will need a newer car (or a serious rebuild) in about five years. Would a Chapter 13 totally ruin us? We both have credit scores in the 700s. 

Happy to answer any other questions. Would love to hear some advice. Yes, I know we were irresponsible. 

Thank you!

Edit: I updated interest rates where applicable (and quickly as I’m about to go to bed). I forgot to mention we have six animals, and the cats eat like $60 in food every 1.25 months, and one dog requires $40-$70 in medicine every 1-3 months (depending on how much I can score it for).

economy,People are talking about a recession more now. Here are some potential triggers.,"Recessions don't happen for no reason, it's a domino effect of one bad thing triggering another. I'm not an economist, but here are my wild speculations of the ""dominoes"" that could fall during the next recession.


**Finance and macroeconomic trends**

    The Federal Reserve is stuck between a rock and a hard place
*If the fed keeps rates low...*
If they keep rates low, inflation will happen under current economic conditions. This would hurt anyone with bonds or cash.  It would also limit choices the fed could take to mitigate a recession.

*If the fed raises rates...*
If interest rates are raised, businesses will have to cope with a more expensive money supply for the first time in a decade. Banks would reduce lending causing businesses that depend on short-terms loans could go bankrupt… like retail which is already in bad shape.

    Full employment

When full employment is reached, the rate at which the market can grow is hindered because the labor pool is not large enough to achieve optimum growth. Labor becomes more expensive, particularly hurting companies with lots of employees or thin margins. 

    Dwindling savings among consumers

Overbought markets and dwindling savings indicate the end of an expansion and consumer inability to cope with a downturn.

    Immigration uncertainty 

While unlikely, a sudden exodus of millions of people would have a great effect on macroeconomic trends. It could cause a supply shock in the housing market with millions of new homes (rented or not) on the market. Housing prices could drop causing some of the problems we saw during the 2008 financial crisis. Since we're already at full unemployment, the labor shortage would worsen causing necessary jobs to go unfilled.

    Trade wars

The United States is highly dependent on global trade. If large-scale tariffs are imposed or long-standing trade deals break down with no replacement, it would undoubtedly cause massive imbalances in the economy and a sudden GDP contraction. If the US starts imposing tariffs, other countries will too. It could also be triggered by Chinese sanctions if the US launches a preemptive strike against North Korea for whatever reason.

    Government debt is a growing problem

 The gross national debt in the United States is now over 100% of the GDP. In the event of a recession, this limits non-painful options the government can take to mitigate the crisis. Defaulting on the debt or inflating the currency would cause massive capital flight out of the country and the dollar would lose its status as a global reserve currency. Government debt crises cause decade-long depressions, not a simple recession (Greece 2009-current, Japan 1991-2007, Venezuela 2012-current). This typically is not the cause of a downturn, but something that is triggered by a downturn.


**Technology**

    Smaller tech companies not worrying about profit

 A large percentage of tech companies aren't profitable, they're in business to get bought out. Even large companies like Twitter and Snapchat have never been profitable and have been hemorrhaging cash since inception. If the expectation of getting bought out diminishes, it might be harder for these companies to get funding. Since these companies employ lots of high-paid employees, it could easily affect the economy as a whole.

    The profitable tech giants are sitting on piles of money they don't know what to do with

It's too much to reinvest in their own business so they're sitting on it. If this money is mismanaged it could cause serious problems for the overall economy.

    Global backlash against American tech giants

The tech giants have been facing global criticism from governments over privacy, social engineering, and politics. Governments clamping down would could cause a huge loss in market share among some of the most profitable American companies.

    Cryptocurrency is an obvious bubble

 It's unclear how much this will affect the overall economy since it's fairly new and not well integrated with the rest of the economy.

    Investment in automation increases when wages go up

 If automation tech is adopted too quickly, jobs created by the new technology can not keep pace will the jobs the automation is replacing. This has not really happened before on a large scale but is still a concern among some people.

**Fraud**

    Long-term economic expansions allow long-term fraud to go undetected

 Fraud has a tendency to piggy-back on economic success because there's enough money to keep the fraud alive. When markets tighten, the fraud is revealed because there's not enough energy to sustain it.

personalfinance,60k a yr job with 11k in CC debt would like to save for a house.,"Hello all, I’m new to this sub reddit. Please excuse any typos or grammatical errors. I currently make 60k a year. I’m 26 and living with parents. I help with a few bills and any necessities my parents need me to purchase such as groceries, soap, and etc. I really want 2018 to be the year I free myself from credit card debt and start saving more money. I’ve stopped using my credit cards all together for about 2 months now but the interest is killing me. Below i have listed all my bills and expenses I currently have. I would really love some guidance. I dream of being able to get a house by the time or before I’m 30. Where do I go from here? 

Car payment $370
I owe $14,000, total was $20,500, I opened the loan about a year and half ago at 5% interest on the auto loan. 

Insurance $125

Electricity bill avg $200

Cell phone bill $115

Internet bill $78

Gasoline $160

Eating out $320

Misc $120 - things like a video game or a pair of jeans kind of thing. 

Netflix $12

Spotify $10

Credit cards:
Credit card number 1 I owe $4,500 with an interest rate of 25% :( minimum payment $178

Credit card number 2 I owe $3,217 with an interest of 18% minimum payment $76

Credit card number 3 I owe $,2925 with an interest rate of 15%, minimum payment $70

Please note the minimum payments on my cards vary by a few dollars. 

I have about 1,200 saved right now. Where should I go from here. Which card should I tackle first? 

As far as saving, should I tackle my debt head on first or is there a mixture of how I can save and pay down debt. I make about $770 after taxes. 

I forgot to mention above I have a 401k with $13,000 in my account. 5% of my salary goes towards my 401k. Should I pause this? Or let it be? 

Thank you all for any guidance you provide me.

personalfinance,"(CAN) To buy a large home and take along room mates as renters for a couple years, or wait and buy smaller later on.","I'm 29 and considering buying my first home by myself. I can comfortably spend up to $160k as a down deposit and am looking at homes between $450k and $500k. Homes about that price in my area average a yearly tax rate of about $2800 to $3000 annually. I'm expecting an interest rate between 3% and 4%. I'd be pulling $23k out of my RRSP for the deposit, which because it's a first time buy I'd have, I believe, 15 years to repay interest free and without it being taxed. I could even potentially sell some stocks to bump that deposit about $25k higher still but I'd rather leave them alone.

I currently rent with my brother and two of our friends and am looking at four bedroom homes to take them along as renters. This would give me $1500 per month to put toward mortgage payments. My intent is to pay the monthly payment myself and use their contribution as extra monthly and at the end of the year. I doubt I can keep them as renters for more than two or three years though and their needs, such as transit access and parking space have an effect on what I can buy. I might have a friend or two I could invite to rent after that, or perhaps by that time I'll have a significant other, but I don't really feel I should bank on that. I really don't feel like living with strangers either, so it feels safer to plan for paying for the whole thing myself after two or three years.

I currently work out of town and make a base salary of $120k although the past two years I've made $155k and $144k by working overtime (about 100k after taxes). I am however looking at getting a new job closer to home, probably in about a year or two. That will drop what I can make significantly, probably to in the area of $80k (60k after taxes), so I'm planning to be able to afford a place on that salary instead of my current one.

I have no debt and don't expect to have any. My monthly expenses are $500 rent and about $300 for utilities, cell phone, gas, and internet.

I'm out of town half of the time for work and I travel quite a bit, so I don't actually spend much time at home. I also worry about long commute times if my future job is far from where I'd buy, or if I'd have much job security. My expenses are so low that I feel like buying would actually make less financial sense since I can invest my money elsewhere.

I'm feeling very overwhelmed. Being a pathological miser is useful in saving but it makes spending very painful. I've been in a panic for days just thinking about making an offer on a place.

Is buying sensible? Or should I just keep renting with friends until living situations change? Should I be buying such a large place if I'm hardly home and it could be empty in a few years?",finance
btc,Charlie Lee is nothing short of a Bitconnect style of scammer,"The first clue one needs to get is the hatred and the trolling. Charlie Lee is a bad troll, his trolling is silly or weak, but he is more dangerous than regular ones: he pretends to be a ""nice guy"". While regular trolls want to make you pissed, he uses his persona for personal gains while trying to shift focus out of him through hating over bitcoin cash.

First start here: https://medium.com/@bitfinexed/coinbase-insider-trading-litecoin-edition-be64ead3facc

There are some pretty disturbing ""coincidences"" there.

(I'd love if someone more patient could make a compilation of the things this scammer have been saying)

Charlie not only started ltc opportunistically copying BTC and gluing together some pieces of code (that he managed to make worse than the originals with his unique talent - such as asic resistance),  but he also have being absolutely flippant in everything he says about bitcoin.

He surfed the wave of being ""silver to bitcoin's gold"" since 2011. Suddenly, after managing to get listed in coinbase, he left it right after to ""work on ltc"" (all that time ltc had really near zero development). What was his work? To implement segwit, that was the only concrete thing he did, and I highly doubt he was responsible for most of the code except just cloning BTC repo.

So he started to surf the wave of ""being a test bed for these awesome technologies"", all of a sudden these ""awesome technologies"" apparently were not that awesome anymore, so he dumped all of his ltc. 

Lets draw a timeline here:


2011 -- LTC is born from a major copy&amp;paste event: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=47417.0 (notice that he edited the OP up to june 2014 to make it look better - hover over the date)

Up to 2017 nothing really happens, except mining. LTC is silver to BTC's gold, and LTC will succeed iff BTC succeeds. That's the narrative.

April, 2017, charlie lee leaves coinbase after he manages to list LTC there. LTC was DEAD and suddenly spikes violently in price right *before* listing is confirmed.

Until august, charlie lee only shills about LTC, segwit, LN and blockstream related things, posting infantile animes and cartoons. Goes to a TV show and says that LTC is like a token, for fun, embarrass himself. LTC community gets pissed and he replies to them saying that it is not his responsibility to pump their holdings. (thread must be there still, I read it myself but can't bother to find it now)

Funnily enough, after 1st of august, he starts to slander BCH, call it a scam, getting pretty vocal and tweeting more shit than anyone can possibly tolerate and says that ""he is done tweeting"", and deletes several of his tweets. But comes back days after this bluff. A guy who doesn't stick to anything he says, never.

(I start to study BCH, I used to follow charlie lee on twitter, I've found that overly strange and too exagerated)

Suddenly his tweets are talking down BTC and shilling LTC alone, contradicting what he said to his followers in reddit, that he wouldn't shill LTC - remember: for over 5 years all he did was cheer-leading BTC and say ""hey I'm the same but I'm the silver version"". He continues to badmouth BCH without nothing to back it up. Even luke-jr gets pissed with him and calls his shitcoin out, saying that he would rather use BCH.

Posts pictures of him with ""HODL"" shirts and etc. There is scant content to be found besides memes and other crap like that. Clear shilling. 

December 2017, charlie lee dumps ALL his LTC he accumulated over 6 years of mining at the top of the hype. Not a part, but all, without further notice. I mean, there is nothing wrong in trading, but if you are a public figure and founder of the project, you gotta observe at least some responsibilities from a moral stand point.

He then poses as a ""nice guy"", saying it was because of ""conflict of interests"" (supposedly the interest of getting rich after the pump and the interest of keeping hold of a future-less shitcoin.)

He also says he was so good that he donated part to LTC foundation, he is such a boy-scout! It turns out that he ""donated"" money to himself, since he controls the foundation, and DIRECTLY to his pals over there (confirmed by one of them). This much is of course for money launder (not defending taxes, but just stating the obvious.)

That's kinda a super summary.

So you think that bitconnect is a scam because it promised high returns and then people sold on their supporters their bitconnect tokens. Also because of that carlos mattos ridiculous videos.

Fair enough, but charlie lee also conned people into buying LTC. His tweets are maybe not so obviously ridiculous like carlos mattos, but they are *pure shill*. His tweets display him with HODL messages, moon memes and other shill stuff. He then sells without telling anyone and  invents some gullible crap to divert attention, also using BCH FUD to divert attention. Who bought LTC? Charlie Lee followers in tweeter, his own community, and his reddit subscribers. The listing of it in coinbase and other places, where he had obvious influence, was the pump he needed to eventually get rid of his coins. I know 8 months seem like a long time in crypto, but for a waiting of 6 years, it is really a very short time.

This smells like a scam, and looks like a scam. Good scammers, like charlie, always present themselves as ""good guys"" and use some sort of empathy technique. Mattos uses Scientology like videos, charlie uses cartoons and other ""cute"" thing, and he doesn't present himself as a way to make money, but he did present litecoin as a ""buy and hold"" coin that he dumped on his followers.

Now, finally, after all of this, he publicly channel scammers to [roger ver's and bitcoin's twitter](https://twitter.com/satoshilite/status/960363285206810624), which is borderline criminal if you ask me and should have his twitter account suspended.",cryptocurrency
CryptoMarkets,Benevolent Bots? or Malevolent Machines?,"It's been a few weeks since i've traded on Binance.  I’ve been out perusing shit-coins on shit exchanges as of late. But yesterday I decided to do a little day-trading since my beloved XRB was stuck on Binance anyway. It only took 14 hours for them to put my XRB into my wallet.  Anyways, while trading my NANO there late last night, it didn’t seem right. I watched that chart for six hours and the buys and sells were odd looking, looked like bots trading with each other. EVERYTHING was very stiff and mechanical. Transactions of the same exact same size being sent back and forth, purposeful processing(if you’ve ever watched a bot that farms game currencies or something like Mybot for clash of clans, if feels like the same).  I’ve seen it before on Binance, but never noticed this extent. Or maybe it was the low human-controlled volume that allowed for these little oddities to stand out more than before.  
 Sometimes ,when trying to day-trade,  I’ll sell on a rise then  pop over to another coin to see if it’s on a dip and just do a quick trade while waiting for it my main coin to dip.   So while trading, NANO went through the roof for no real reason except two bots selling each other volume to create a moon and panic induce buyers.  I had seen them do that couple times that night. I had XRB, so I dumped it on those asshole bots and I left to check on NEO. But NEO had just Mooned too.  So then I check ETH…..Jupiter.  I checked a few other coins and they had rocketed into space the same exact moment and they all fell right back now and kept moving along. Then I start looking at the charts and they had all been doing this all night. Their charts were identical. Like fingerprint identical. And I know one month charts always look pretty similar with crypto and stocks. And Yeah, I know “CUZ EVRY THINGS JUST FOLLOWS BITCOrN!”  Fiat Value wise, yes because it ties to the dollar and if bitcoin rises so does the value of a sat, but alts should have independent value, or lack thereof and should lose or gain sats  due goodness or shittiness.
Below are just  a couple of the USDT/pair charts from when EVERY single coin on binance decided to knock a hole through the ceiling this afternoon. They all mooned in the same millisecond this afternoon when BTC was supposedly ‘Fixed’. (take note of that little bump right before the pump on all the coins. And look at where the highest/lowest prices of the frame, dumps, the overbuys and oversells etc.) These are the 5 minute charts, they give you an idea of the similarities. If you want real crazy similarities, open the binance app and do the 1 minute charts.  Note the time of those random bot-powered mini-pumps and then go look for that time on the other charts, you’ll find them. It's easier to see the mini-pumps before everything went up, when there were long breaks and low volume. They start the same second on every other USDT pair as well as a couple BTC/alt Pairings too, every single time.

This is a NANO/ETH and NANO/BTC  5-minute candle

What the hell does it all mean? Why are these pictures friggin’ damn near Xerox.
Here is how I see it. I can think of Three options………
 A.) We are all connected on a deeper level than we can understand. Like fungus.  And that dumbass decision of yours to buy ATH on some brand new erc20 knitting token wasn’t your fault at all, but some other dumbass just did it too while buying up all that ‘New Hotness’ sweatshiop* token.  We are all one.

B.) We literally are following bitcoin and whatever is happening with BTC in your exchange is being fed to the bots in some select  ALTs. The bots are just here to keeps us in check, and keep us on the road. So when you decide you can single handedly start a pump on trx to 20 cents for killr gainz and lambos, the bot just fills your orders and brings you back to earth and hands your coins off to someone else less flashy, minus a little commission, of course. 

C.) We have zero control. The map in front of you isn’t a map at all. It’s a roller coaster and either you’re the guy finding the wallet in your seat or you’re the poor schmuck who lost it. The bots are either lovely little buggers helping us along the way so we don’t make any mistakes. Especially any ‘mistakes’ that could threaten hierarchy of the market (while still taking on a small commission, of course) OR  worse- A select few are in complete control of the entire market.  I always wondered how just printing tether could influence the market to the extreme. I always imagined some assholes with accounts at each exchange getting handed 20 million tether just to push BTC at opportune times. But it always seemed stupid and inefficient. Then while I was watching those bots sell back and forth to each other, it kinda clicked. The bots were making it look like more people were active, setting and removing buy/sell orders and to  occasionally drive up the price when it wants users to full-on FOMO panic buy and then get dumped on.  With Two accounts, one bot easily sells coins back and forth very efficiently. It can capitalize on human errors especially considering that the bot knows what comes next.  Now, a bot with two accounts, a few million Tether and a lighting fast ability to realize humans split-second accounting errors, that sounds efficient and potentially very effective.
Wow, this got long. Sorry about that. No FUD intentional. I just unTethered this afternoon, a little bit early in fact, I think we should use every advantage we have at our disposal while it’s here.  We are battling against bots for shit’s sake! Remember Battle Bots?  Show was awesome.   Anyways.  Any thoughts? Degrading comments?  Maybe a fourth option ? A fifth?!  

*I typo’d sweatshiop. What a badass name for a decentralized exchange “The sweatshiop”. You can have it. Just give me credit and one percent of future earnings, like that Macdonalds brother’s deal.

Also sorry Mods if this isn't a great forum for this sort of thing, but there isn't a r/rando_crypto_ramblings .  I was just drinking a couple beers and had to put my random thoughts into something semi-cohesive. Feel free to delete.

ethereum,"Someone please make a delivery DApp, it could easily be the real world Cryptokittie catalyst we need.","So hear me out on this, for my technical experience with Ethereum and its smart contract aren't nearly as proficient as I'd like it to be, but I feel with our current tech it should be attainable. Let us assume you want a delivery of a good, but fuck delivery drivers, lets get a Delivery THRIVER^TM

**First off**

Let's all be honest with ourselves, the real reason we get delivery (of anything! Food, toilet paper, plain brown boxes totally not filled with sex toys) is because we don't want to risk running into someone we know and having to actually socialize; and running off that idea we can agree that if we had the option to choose a delivery service that didn't require use to awkwardly run for a pair of boxers to open the door for the pizza that arrived 10 minutes too early *^^Don't^judge^me^I'm^naked*, we would choose that service. 
  
*""Oh but PokyHickory, what does having a DApp have to do with people knocking at my door.""*
 
Sit the **FUCK** down and get your mind blown, I got three words for ya.

* Smart
* Lockboxes

Delivery guy comes to conveniently located drop box (or hot box for food?), puts package into one of [these bad boys fitted with smart locks](https://www.johnplanck.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LONDON_WESGATE-APARTMENTS_067-2-1024x685.jpeg), interacts with the Delivery Thriver DApp which locks the package in tight, as well as sends a claiming token to the purchaser's ETH address. You get a notification of your package arriving, and can comfortably go grab your package at *any*time(As agreed upon in the contract). It's a convenient, relocating mailbox for any goods at any time, so long as it fits in one of those mailboxes of various shapes and sizes. 

**~~""Oh, but what problem is this really solving other than your social anxiety.""~~**

I'm feeling personally attacked but ok, as with all things in smart contracts we're adding security for EVERYONE! What if after 2 hours the food still hasn't been picked up? Well, the smart contract can send out a secondary token to a Delivery Thriver for collection, and upon collection can validate the food was never taken, the driver still gets paid for a job well done, the potential customer can get a partial refund, and the restaurant gets paid for its operating costs as deemed in the contract signed by the customer, effectively cleaning up a useless slot for another delivery to enter. Chuck in the fact you can easily send packages out of warehouses with non-fungible ERC721 tokens attached to record the metadata of the entire trip, from variations of temperature and g-forces for sensitive products, or for showing that the customer was full of shit when they said the package never really reached their front door but the FedEx guy swears he put it on the right doorstep. It's a contract that allows everyone to win, and ensure fair compensation and peace of mind to all parties. 

Thoughts/Criticisms/People that can code this instead of me cause I work 65 hours a week as a delivery boy for pizza, please discuss below!

TL;DR

1.Driver gets delivery (Food, mail, discreet package, etc)

2.Delivers to [Smart Lock containers](https://www.johnplanck.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/LONDON_WESGATE-APARTMENTS_067-2-1024x685.jpeg) which can only be locked/unlocked via smart contract

personalfinance,F-1 Tax Resident Alien IRA?,"Hi r/personalfinance,

I’m asking on behalf of a close friend of mine who’s got a peculiar question. He’s in the US with an F-1 visa as an undergraduate student at a very respected institution. He’s been here continuously for 6+ years, which means he’s a resident alien as far as taxes are concerned.

He recently began a research job on campus last year, and has earned around $8k in 2017 per his W-2. I was under the impression he had to file for taxes, but the school didn’t withhold federal income tax because they estimated (correctly) his calendar year income to be below $10k, which means he doesnt’t have to file? As a matter of fact, I guess he would be paying taxes as opposed to getting a return, so it would make sense for him to skip filing, right?

In addition, he plans on staying here long-term, so he’s now interested in opening an IRA (not 401k). From my understanding, he can contribute up to $5.5k, but he would have to file his taxes and therefore pay federal income tax should he open an IRA - is this right?

So here are the questions:

1. Is it legal for him to skip filing?
2. Is he eligible to open an IRA at a brokerage? Traditional or Roth? How much could he contribute?
3. If he is eligible, would he then have to file his taxes?

Thanks folks - I thought I knew my tax laws until he asked me. This one is a thinker (for me). Any help is appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,"Wells Fargo lost my check, Help?!","Okay here we go...

I had an account with Wells Fargo that had a special terms no interest for the first 18 months. The interest ($2,200) was supposed to hit January 22nd so I went to my local bank, Schools First FCU and got a personal loan to pay it off. This was December 19th, a full month before. One of the stipulations of the personal loan was that they had to send the check themselves, so I know that they did not give it to me to send or take to Wells Fargo myself. They sent out the check.

Here’s where it gets tricky. This weekend I just checked my Wells Fargo statement expecting to see that my account was completely paid off. Instead I see that the account was hit with that crazy interest. Wells Fargo never received a check to pay it off.

I went to School's First and they were extremely helpful in getting a stop to that original check wherever it is, and getting me a new one for the original amount. They also wrote me a letter to Wells Fargo explaining that I had come in a whole month early to get a personal loan to pay this off, and that had the check been reviewed it would have been before the interest rate hit. I know they are separate institutions of course, but I figured it’d do at least something to give more credibility than just my word. 

I called Wells Fargo, explained my situation fully and of course said that there is nothing that they can do now after the fact. After explaining that I cannot afford to pay this other than the original amount, the ""supervisor"" did tell me that the system was allowing him to offer me a 25% reduction of the interest if I paid it within the next 24 hours. He made clear that the offer was only good until tomorrow. However that still leaves me with over $1,500 in interest.

So, people of reddit...what do you suggest I do? I'm in a weird position where I don't feel like this is my fault, but at the same time I can't blame either bank and don't really have much of a leg to stand on. Any advice is very welcome.",finance

The u.s government doesn't care if you buy crypto. he specifically states in his written testimony for the Senate tomorrow/today. that the primary cause of concern is the selling of SECURITIES in the form of Icos.

what are securities? 

the promise to make profits when you invest in the ico. they've been cracking down to protect everyday ""investors"" from handing their money to ponzi schemes, bullshit companies, and scammers.

The rest of it they look at like commodities.

that's not the death bell of bitcoin you hear. t hats just the usual government protections that stop us from bankrupting ourselves on foreign scams and false promises.

My total credit card debt is around 19000. Although i have never missed a payment, now its getting hard to pay it off. I dont know what to do. what would be my best route? all the interest rates are around 23%. my credit score according to credit karma is 560.  my income working part time is around 600 a month. I guess my options are is try to get a loan somewhere (suggestions would be awesome). talk to a deb consolidating company (i dont really know much about them and how they will affect my credit), should i go talk to a credit union? I do own 4 houses. although they are my parents, and for immigration status, they have put the houses under my name so its not like i could file for bankruptcy or anything like that. I do not benefit in any way from those houses. what do you guys recommend? I could ask my father for a loan to pay off the credit cards so that my credit rating will get a boost and then i could take out a loan to repay my father.  it will be embarrassing going to my father for help with this because i have been irresponsible.

investing,I was around for the Great Financial Collapse. Market Conditions were Eerily Similiar. Read On.,"I hear the same arguments why this time its different.  But in 2009 It was the same arguments deployed to say it was different than the dot com collapse.  Here is what is eerily similar:

0.  This time it's different narrative.
1.  Economy was on all cylinders. | Historical Low Unemployment in 2009.
2.  Market Euphoria.
3.  Low household Savings Rate.
4.  Fed starts new cycle of Rate Hikes.
5.  Everyone is on one side of a trade (Long Equities)
6.  Contagion Risk (Short Volatility Trade and ETF chaining). | Back then it was CDO.
7.  Flattening - Inverted 2y/10y Yield Curve.
8.  At the End of a Debt Cycle.
9.  Margin Buys at Record Highs. 
10.  A contempt for holding cash.
12.  Lots of leverage being used.

What was conspicious about trading in the GFC was how markets would open green, then go dramatically red by 10:30 am as ETFs rebalanced and algos traded.  Also, the high daily variance in prices from algos and HFT.  An equity would rebound 5% then drop 10%.

Later, I learned that there would be a pop then massive drop because algos would close out their hedged short positions right before massive dumping.  I got caught on the wrong side of the trade because I thought it was finally bottom.

I'm sure others out there traded during the GFC.  It was wild.  The Fed finally stepped in.  They  sanctioned a trading desk whose mandate was solely to buy the fucking dip.  I wonder if that desk is still around, now that QE has ended and volatility had been abnormally low for years.",finance

I have money from RSUs coming in May/June - value should be $12k-$15k based on stock prices for my company. I'd like to use this money to turn my credit around (Currently at 670-685), pay off debt, reduce monthly payments on cars by paying off principal and then refinancing.

*Can be skipped, more of a backstory for more info*

When I was younger, I was dumb and allowed my student loan to go 2 years delinquent. I've brought it back to on-time after going through the right channels and been making payments on time for the past 3 years. As this was the only thing on my credit this brought my on-time payment percentage extremely low and I've been working for the past 3+ years to bring that back up and I'm now at 87% from a 43%. I've never had a credit card (always in the mindset of ""If I can pay cash, why do I need credit? Should look better for me!""). I'm hoping by the end of this year that I'll be in the 90%+.

We are planning in 9 months to begin looking for a house. I've been pre-approved for a $140k mortgage by myself on my current income and expenses. I'd like to get myself in the $190k range by reducing my debt and also reducing monthly expenses.


**Income breakdown:**

* Myself: $2400/month

* SO: $2200/month



**Debt:**

* My Car: $598/month - $25,600 Owed (17.1% Interest)

* Her Car: $488/month - ~$16,000 Owed (22% Interest)

* My Student Loans: $53/month - $4800 Owed



**Expenses:**

* Rent: ~$1420 (Fluctuates due to allocated water usage/community water usage)

* Electric: $124 (Does not change monthly - flat rate)

* Internet/TV: $130

* Phone: $133

* Insurance: $469 (Includes $25 Renters Insurance)

* Gas: $400 (Baseball practice, lessons, other kid things)

* Groceries: $400 (2 Kids)

* Credit Card: $150 (Always paid off)

* Other Expenses: $150


Here's how I was thinking of utilizing the money:

* $1,000 - Get my SO a Secured Credit Card or 2 $500 Limit Secured Credit Cards

* $10,000 - Go towards paying principal on one of the cars to reduce the payments (I was going to refinance mine to $511/month and reduce the interest from 17.1 to 6.9 but decided to hold off until I've figured this out) - **Best option is my car to be paid off as my SO is still on her ex's car note so she shows as having another car payment under her.** Once she's removed from the other car, we'll refinance her car to reduce the payment and interest rate.

* Left Over - Student Loan/Savings

CryptoCurrency,CFTC Chairman Gaincarlo just made the most bullish statements in front of the Congress,"A gist of what he said: 

1. His kids were not interested in stocks but are hooked onto cryptocurrencies, and the government has to respect that, and develop a positive outlook.  

2. While scams and fraudsters must be cracked down, the general market must be allowed to develop. A working group of SEC, FINCEN, CFTC and other group members are working on identifying scams in this space.

3. When asked if Crypto has any ""intrinsic value""? - There is an intrinsic value and relation of the value of bitcoin and the cost of mining it. 

4. Price of Bitcoin is just one publicly traded company like McDonalds. In comparison, global money supply is 7.6T. And since Bitcoin has been compared to digital gold, value of all gold in the world is 8T.


5. HOLY SHT.. He just mentioned ""HODL"". Hahaha - According to him its ""Hold on for dear life"".

""We owe it to this new generation, to respect their interest in this new technology with a thoughtful regulatory approach.""

In August I financed a car at 11.99% interest rate for 48 months. $12,500 was the cost of the car and I put down $8k. My credit at the time was 610. I financed because my credit score was poor with no significant improvement despite efforts I'd made (secured CC, paying down collections/debt etc...) and learned that an auto loan would help. I've paid my auto loan on time consistently and still haven't seen any improvement to my score, in fact it dropped 10 points. Additionally, my interest rate is higher than I'd like but I understand due to my credit score it's what I could get. Is it a good idea for me to refinance? I'm afraid through refinancing I MIGHT get a lower interest rate but my credit score will drop again. I originally wanted 36 months but was told 48 would be better because I could over pay monthly and refinance somewhere down the line. 

Any help would be appreciated.

I currently make 50k a year. I just recently cut out other bills and changed health insurance which has allowed me to save more money.

I have $5 in my savings account which isn't good. I have about $31,000 in student loan debts. This is the first time I'm trying to save and budget correctly.

I would like to save some money for an emergency fund or maybe a down payment on a house. I also want to get rid of some of this student loan debt. I calculated the loans with the higher interest would be $5,101.41. Those are the highest at 6.8% the rest are under 4%.

I planned on putting $1,000 for a month for a year towards savings and $425 a month towards the student loan to pay off that $5,101.41 with the higher interest rate.

Is this a good plan? Should I be dividing this up differently and not thinking about purchasing a house with the remaining student loan debt? Or should I be putting more in the savings account?

I was under the impression that both agencies were well-educated, but understaffed. They both want to introduce protections for customers and investors and go after scam artists, but don't want to impose any restrictions or regulations that would be bad for crypto as a whole (both from a security perspective, and a technological innovation perspective).

- Mentioned that the techonology has positives to transform the financial landscape, transfer risk

- Volatility, 1000% rise, 60% fall, compared to DOW Jones
- touched on scam artists/hackers, undereducated market participants
- mentioned there are regulatory gaps, potentials for abuse
- neither SEC/CFTC has authority to police all aspects
- mentioned some analogies to the dotcom bubble
- may be used to fund illicit activity
- says they need to do more to get ahead of the curve
- ""don't forget your day jobs to pursue and punish misconduct"", mentioned the 3 big banks being punished recently
- crypto brings us to a new age, but don't overlook the princilpes of going after the bad guys and being tough

  2. put things in perspective - as of this morning, Bitcoin 113 bn market cap. less than the market cap of McDonald's. sometimes compared to gold; value of gold dwarfs Bitcoin at 8 trillion market cap
  3. educate consumers - podcasts, webinars, visits to libraries, outreach to seniors
  4. regulation - 
  5. legal authority - ""The CFTC does not regulate the dozens of cryptocurrencies""; through their authority, they have enforcement over spot coin markets; analyze manipulation
  6. tough enforcement - they have already launched civil actions, more will follow

- I've been very straight about money and value that can be added


**Sen. Shelby**

- Federal reserve is the biggest bank regulator we have
- how are you going to put together a task force to deal with crypto currencies before this gets out of control


**Clayton**

- treasury secretary has brought us together to talk about this
- ""the funny thing is, they only work for their purported purpose if they're integrated with the financial service""


**Giancarlo**

- we are going to be coordinating responses; needs to be clear as to what we're doing


**Sen. Shelby**

- do you need additional legislation


**Clayton**

- we may be back to ask for that


**Sen. Shelby**

- virtual; go to a virtual doctor, virtual currency, etc
- ""i started out with pencil and paper in school""
- Lack intrinsic value, lack liquidity
- gained money going up, lost money going down
- don't know where the floor is 


**Giancarlo**

- relation between Bitcoin value and the cost of mining
- charts plotting the correlation
- the floor isn't zero, because there is some cost


**Clayton**

- ""think there is something to the value of the crypto exchange""
- ""I'm not seeing the benefits manifesting themselves in the market yet""
- ""I'm interested in protecting the main street investors; they should see that""
- in the securities world, there are rules that dictate how much you have to tell someone about what they're investing in


**Sen. Shelby**

- we will give you every tool you need to do your job and to hire every person you need to execute that


**Sen Reed**

- (essentially) do you have any cryptologists?


**Clayton**

- emerging area; could always use more horsepower


**Giancarlo**

- hired the industry's first ""chief innovation officer""
- started Lab CFTC
- formed virtual currency task force
  - brought 3 cases against bitcoin fraudsters
- used bypass authority for additional resources (13% over budget)


**Sen Reed**

- Bitcoin isn't the only one; there are seemingly new ones every day
  1. are you tracking them all?
  2. is someone looking at the long-term systemic effects
- eerily similar to late-90s derivatives


**Giancarlo**

- Bitcoin is one of many; important to know that many are fraudulent
- ""MyBigCoin"" which became known as ""MyBigCon"" - Ponzi scheme; we went after them
- relatively small market, but we have to watch it


**Clayton**

- we have had to watch it because they're integrated with the markets we do oversee
- on systemic - agrees with Giancarlo
- if people are getting ripped off, that is an issue


**Sen Reed**

- forced arbitration


**Rounds**

- ""I used a pen and pencil as well""
- fascinating to see how things are moving
- we keep coming back to dollars and cents
- new type of exchange; bartering
- could avoid determination of the value of the dollar and cents
- how do you tax? how do you recognize income?
- seems that have to be filled, but basics that a lot of us don't understand
- how do you respond to ICOs?


**Clayton**

- definition of a security is broad
- ""when you're offering me something and i give you money and the purpose of me giving you money is to profit from your actions going forward""


**Rounds**

- is Bitcoin a commodity or a security or is it both?


**Giancarlo**

- has characteristics of both
- is a ""medium of exchange, store of value, or a means of account""
- we hear a lot of people holding - ""HODL - hold on for dear life""
- 30 year old niece bought some years ago, is holding on
- in this regard, it's a commodity
- we are looking for fraud and manipulation so that people like his niece are protected


**Ms. Warren**

- Jan 26th Bloomberg ""SEC weighs a big gift [...] blocking class action lawsuits""
- wants to get a straight yes/no - ""do you support this enormous change in SEC policy""


**Clayton**

- bottom line - ""I can't dictate whether or not this issue comes to us, but I'm not anxious to see a change in this area""


**Ms. Warren**

- change can't happen without your approval


**Clayton**

- I'm only 1 of 5 votes


**Ms. Warren**

- I'd guess there will be at lest 2 votes against it


**Clayton**

- It would take a long time


**Ms. Warren**

- I'll let you get away with that
- SEC's mission is to protect; not throw under bus
- advisers that put fees, kickbacks for recommending product ahead of interest of clients
- I want to know that you will not weaken the protections for retirement savers


**Clayton**

- that's what I'm trying to do - the relation between a broker and their client is regulated by no less than 5 people (the SEC)


**Ms. Warren**

- want to make sure you're not jeopardizing investors


**Clayton**

- insufficient standard, lack of clarity, ""the standard is only as good as the remedy available""
- what dollars do you actually collect when someone does you harm?


**Ms. Warren**

- if you want to strengthen it, i'm with you


**Perdue**

- regulatory arbitrage

**Clayton**

- shareholders do
- regulatory arbitrage, hard to trace
- South Korea, China
- was a largely unregulated space
- each country is now taking regulatory measures

**Perdue**

- what do we need to do to combat this?


**Giancarlo**

- regulatory arbitrage, price arbitrage
- ""Kimchi arbitrage""
- different regional and international market

**Giancarlo**

- seniors seem to be the prey of choice - not just for Bitcoin
- we seek to prosecute these predators


**Donnelly**

- article from Kentucky ""Bitcoin is my potential pension""
- what would you do to protect them?


**Giancarlo**

- troubling, which is why we're putting out so much material
- ""if it sounds too good to be true, it is""
- ""if you're giving them money, you'd better be prepared to lose it""


**Clayton**

- disruptive technologies, but you shouldn't bank on it
- pumping all of your money into a disruptive technology has a very high probability of not working out

- when was the last time you bought a fund?


**Giancarlo**

- a year or two ago, index funds


**Sen Kennedy**

- did you read the fine print?


**Giancarlo**

- not cover to cover


**Sen Kennedy**

- so what's the point of all this over-disclosure if nobody's reading it?
- why do we want to do the same for Bitcoin?


**Giancarlo**

- adequacy of full disclosure


**Sen Kennedy**

- ""I don't think the disclosure we have right now works""
- good for lawyers / financial advisers, but right now, we over-disclose
- how far should we go to protect people from themselves?
- how far do you think we ought to go here? should we just go after the shysters and fully disclose?


**Clayton**

- what is the right way to deal with this new technology?
- we want to deal with ICOs; don't want to go too far
- our securities laws work pretty well, but disclosure can be improved


**Sen Kennedy**

- we have to have disclosure that works, and helps the helpless people


**Warner**

- if we see the same continued growth, we may see the market cap at 20 trillion dollars by 2020
- we may see the same transformation take place
- we are going to have to wrap our hands around this
- not sure what the right answer is, but this could systemically rise to an FSOC-level event


**Clayton**

- if this does keep going, is this a systemic issue?
- want to go back to separating these two things
- should regulate ICOs like securities


**Giancarlo**

- false disclosure is fraud, period
- so much more to be done


**Warner**

- Ethereum - creating ""file sharing or extra computer time""
- are these in your realm?


**Clayton**

- if it's an ICO that promises to deliver server time, it's a security


**Warner**

- worried that we need a much more coordinated effort
- could be as transformational as wireless technology


**Giancarlo**

- it is important; we are all working to understand our authorities
- bitcoin futures are different; fully transparent and regulated, compared to Bitcoin that's opaque and unregulated


**Clayton**

- ICOs should be taken under our regime


**Cotton**

- Putting aside Bitcoin and other distributed ledger, what do you think the value is?


**Giancarlo**

- Without Bitcoin, there would be nothing. everything grew out of it.
- applications range from financial services and banking, to charity dollars are spent, refugee, access to banking for those who don't have it
- 66 million tons of soybeans were traded using Bitcoin
- allow regulators to do really close market surveillance with precision
- challenges, but the potential is significant


**Clayton**

- agree the potential is significant
- hope people pursue it vigorously


**Cotton**

- DOW Jones fell 4.6%; dollar seen 2% inflation or less; Bitcoin seems to be very volatile in comparison


**Giancarlo**

- we have seen volatility but in our world, we're used to it
- emergence of futures to provide those who are exposed to it


**Clayton**

- don't really know what's driving the volatility
- not related to foreign currencies
- must be something different
- lot of volatility compared to what they're supposed to be a substitute for


**Cotton**

- (essentially) so how does that bode to its claim?


**Clayton**

- it would not be a very effective means of exchange
- with the volatility and delays, there's a significant risk


**Cotton**

- (quick shout out to) rogue nations, hackers, etc


**Menendez**

- under what circumstances do the SEC and CFTC have a role in regulating this?


**Giancarlo**

- fraud and manipulation - will not hesitate to take authority


**Menendez**

- what about manipulating to avoid U.S. sanctions?


**Giancarlo**

- I'll have to look into that


**Menendez**

- are there gaps that could create vulnerabilities?


**Giancarlo**

- part of a virtual currency task force; includes the fed and FINCEN
- meeting with FINCEN this week to get some discussion of cooperation started


**Menendez**

- seen increase in ICOs; investors using digital tokens
- grew from $96mil in 2016 to $4bil in 2017
- celebrity promotion - Floyd Mayweather, Kardashian, et al
- investors may not understand true risk when they see a product promoted by celebrities


**Clayton**

- we put out an alert that if you promote a security, you are taking on securities law liability


**Menendez**

- can you walk us through why the SEC is not comfortable with approving ETFs with crypto currencies?


**Clayton**

- we've made it clear that there are some issues - price discovery, custody, volatility
- don't want to approve an ETF product with a cryptocurrency underlier without working out these issues


**Moran**

- don't ETFs mitigate those concerns? are crypto currencies different?
- MGT act - modernizing government technologies
- create a fund for federal agencies to rid themselves of legacy technology
- allows access to dollars; move to cloud
- i would be delighted that there isn't a SEC/CFTC hack in the papers soon; advise strengthening cyber security


**Ms. Masto**

- Kodak and Burger King investments
- companies are using block chain as an opportunity to pump up stock prices
- Long Island Ice Tea - Long Blockchain


**Clayton**

- nobody should think it's okay to chain your name to something that contains block chain when you have no idea what you're doing
- any time there's something new that can raise the value of their stock without the underlying goods being there, it's not good


**Giancarlo**

- ICOs misrepresenting their affiliation where there are wild claims
- ""Our big task is bringing in enforcement cases and letting people see that""


**Ms. Masto**

- 3bn Bitcoin have been hacked, $500bn hack weeks ago, MtGox
- what can buyers do to get their money back?


**Clayton**

- when you engage in investing online with an offshore entity, the chances that we can do anything to get your money back are very low


**Giancarlo**

- for the underlying spot markets, we don't have the authority to enforce safeguards and protections; this is a problem


**Ms. Masto**

- ""It's the old axiom ""buyer beware"".""


**Sen Shelby**

- (in regards to the stock market) ""Is this perhaps more than ordinary correction?""


**Clayton**

- I asked my staff and the federal government the same question
- nothing to indicate any of our systems didn't indicate properly
- largest volume since 2016
- Neither single stock nor circuit breakers triggered
- Nothing that came out of this are concerning


**Sen Shelby**

- Is it profit taking? Is it a spook?
- Interest rates? Fed has info we don't have?
- Economy high, unemployment low?
- Combination? Can we really say?


**Clayton**

- I can't really say. Lots of opinions.
- Our job is to look at the systemic risks.
- I've not seen anything.


**Giancarlo**

- ""Markets up? More people bought than sold. Market down? More people sold than bought.""
- Markets are very complex. Fundamentals are sound. Doesn't appear to be any significant breeches.


**Ms. Warren**

- Some ICOs are legitimate, some are just Ponzi schemes
- ""It's now so bad that Facebook recently banned all ads for virtual currencies""
- How do we make ICOs safer?
- Companies raised more than $4bil
- How many companies registered with SEC?


**Clayton**

- Not one.


**Ms. Warren**

- Can you say just a word as to why that's so?


**Clayton**

- the gatekeepers haven't done their job. we've made it clear what the law is.
- there are thousands of private placements. we want them to raise capital. but we want them to do it right.
- folks somehow got comfortable that this was new and it's okay.


**Ms. Warren**

- so it's a violation of the law?


**Clayton**

- yes.

personalfinance,Start a traditional or Roth IRA when close to the maximum income limits for IRA tax deductions?,"Hi PF!  
I am trying to figure out whether my husband and I should start another IRA, and whether it should be a traditional or Roth given that we are very close (maybe over this year) to the 118,00 income limit above which we will not get a tax deduction.  

Relevant info:
*Last year our AGI was 114,000 (with 1,000 of IRA deduction we would have to add back to get our MAGI, right?).  

*This year, our income in box 1 of our W2s so far adds up to 117, 930.  We might have some other little interest income forms that come in that push us over the limit.  I am getting confused about how to calculate our Magi from here, so I feel like I can't tell if we will get to take the tax deduction for IRA or not (is there a way to know in advance and then drop a ton before April 15 into an IRA if we are barely under?)

*We already have one IRA apiece, to which we contribute 50/month, for a total of 1200/year.

*We both contribute the maximum for matching retirement contributions with our employer plans.

*We have no debt except for our mortgage (210,000 left at 4%), a healthy emergency fund, and a couple of bank CDs at 10,000 each stashed away at low interest rates (silly, but I like having a nice stash that is getting some interest but is FDIC insured).  

*I am 43, husband 50.  We are somewhat behind in retirement savings from some lean years in the early aughts, esp. when I was in grad school for 7 years and had no money being put away for retirement.

*My husband may need to actually retire at 67; provided I stay healthy-ish, I can probably work in my field as long as I am able (many people in my career work into their 70s).

So, Roth, traditional, or just make an investment account?  
Thanks!",finance

Money in the digital age: what role for central banks?
Lecture by Agustín Carstens
General Manager, Bank for International Settlements
House of Finance, Goethe University
Frankfurt, 6 February 2018

Introduction
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for that kind introduction, Jens. I am very happy to be here at this prestigious university and to be part of this impressive lecture series sponsored by Sustainable Architecture for Finance in Europe (SAFE), the Center for Financial Studies (CFS) and the Deutsche Bundesbank. I would also like to thank Professor Brigitte Haar for being such a generous host today. It is an honour to discuss money at an event organised by the Bundesbank, which has been a beacon of stability since its foundation some 60 years ago.
As Jens can attest, being a central banker is a fascinating job. In fact, it is a privilege. During the last decade it has been anything but quiet in the central banking world. We have been confronted with extraordinary circumstances that have required extraordinary policy responses. In such an environment, it has been of the utmost importance to share experiences and lessons learnt among central banks, creating a body of knowledge that will be there for the future.
One of the reasons that central bank Governors from all over the world gather in Basel every two months is precisely to discuss issues at the front and centre of the policy debate. Following the Great Financial Crisis, many hours have been spent discussing the design and implications of, for example, unconventional monetary policies such as quantitative easing and negative interest rates.
Lately, we have seen a bit of a shift, to issues at the very heart of central banking. This shift is driven by developments at the cutting edge of technology. While it has been bubbling under the surface for years, the meteoric rise of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has led us to revisit some fundamental questions that touch on the origin and raison d’être for central banks:
• What is money?
• What constitutes good money, and where do cryptocurrencies fit in?
• And, finally, what role should central banks play?
The thrust of my lecture will be that, at the end of the day, money is an indispensable social convention backed by an accountable institution within the State that enjoys public trust. Many things have served as money, but experience suggests that something widely accepted, reliably provided and stable in its command over goods and services works best. Experience has also shown that to be credible, money requires institutional backup, which is best provided by a central bank. While central banks’ actions and services will evolve with technological developments, the rise of cryptocurrencies only highlights the important role central banks have played, and continue to play, as stewards of public trust. Private digital tokens posing as currencies, such as bitcoin and other crypto-assets that have mushroomed of late, must not endanger this trust in the fundamental value and nature of money.


What is money?
“What is money?” is obviously a key question for any central banker, and one on which economists have spent much ink. The answer depends on how deep and philosophical one wants to be. Being at a university, especially one named after Goethe, I think I can err on the side of being philosophical.
Conventional wisdom tells you that “money is what money does”.1 That is, money is a unit of account, a means of payment and a store of value. But telling you what something does does not really tell you what it is. And it certainly does not tell you why we need or have money, how it comes about and what the preconditions are for it to exist.
In terms of the “need” for money, you may learn that money is a way to get around the general lack of double coincidence of wants. That is, it is rare that I have what you want and you have what I want at the same time. As barter is definitely not an efficient way of organising an economy, money is demanded as a tool to facilitate exchange.
What about the other side of the coin, so to speak? How does money come about? Again, conventional wisdom may tell you that central banks provide money, ie cash (coins and notes), and commercial banks supply deposits. But this answer is often not fully satisfactory, as it does not tell why and how banks should be the one to “create” money.
If you venture into more substantive analyses on monetary economics, things get more complex. One theory, which proposes that “money is memory”, amounts to arguing that a “superledger” can facilitate exchange just like money. This argument says a ledger is a way of keeping track of not only who has what but also who owes, and is owed, what. I will come back to this later.
Moving beyond this line of thought, other scholarly and historical analyses provide answers that are more philosophical. These often amount to “money is a convention” – one party accepts it as payment in the expectation that others will also do so.2 Money is an IOU, but a special one because everyone in the economy trusts that it will be accepted by others in exchange for goods and services. One might say money is a “we all owe you”.
Many things have served as money in this way. Figure 1 gives some examples: Yap stones, gold coins, cigarettes in war times, $100,000 bills, wissel (Wechsel), ie bills of exchange or bearer notes, such as those issued by the Bank of Amsterdam in the first half of the 17th century. It includes an example from my own country, Aztec hoe (or axe) money, a form of (unstamped) money made of copper used in central Mexico and parts of Central America.
1 See J Hicks, Critical essays in monetary theory, 1979.
2 See D Lewis, Convention: a philosophical study, 1969.


Common to most of these examples is that the nominal value of the items that have served at one time as money is unrelated to their intrinsic value. Indeed, as we know very well in the case of fiat money, the intrinsic value of most of its representations is zero.
History shows that money as a convention needs to have a basis of trust, supported by some form of institutional arrangement.3 As Curzio Giannini puts it: “The evolution of monetary institutions appears to be above all the fruit of a continuous dialogue between economic and political spheres, with each taking turns to create monetary innovations … and to safeguard the common interest against abuse stemming from partisan interests.”4
Money can come in different institutional forms and colours. How to organise them? The paper by Bech and Garratt in last September’s BIS Quarterly Review presented the money flower as a way of organising monies in today’s environment.5 It acknowledges that money can take on rather different forms and be supplied in various ways.
The money flower
Allow me to explain, noting that we do not sell seeds to this money flower!
3 Fiat means “by law“. So, in principle, it should be said that money exists by convention or by law. But if trust in money does not prevail, the legal mandate that conveys value to money becomes meaningless.
4 C Giannini, The age of central banks, 2011.
5 M Bech and R Garratt, “Central bank cryptocurrencies”, BIS Quarterly Review, September 2017, pp 55–70.


The money flower highlights four key properties on the supply side of money: the issuer, the form, the degree of accessibility and the transfer mechanism.
• The issuer can be either the central bank or “other”. “Other” includes nobody, that is, a particular type of money that is not the liability of anyone.
• In terms of the form it takes, money is either electronic or physical.
• Accessibility refers to how widely the type of money is available. It can either be wide or limited.
• Transfer mechanism can either be a central intermediary or peer-to-peer, meaning transactions occur directly between the payer and the payee without the need for a central intermediary.
Let us look at where some common types of money fit into the flower, starting with cash (or bank notes) as we know it today. Cash is issued by the central bank, is not electronic, is available to everyone and is peer-to-peer. I do not need a trusted third party such as Jens to help me pay each of you 10 euros.
Let us try another one: bank deposits. They are not the liability of the central bank, mostly electronic, and in most countries available to most people, but clearly not peer-to-peer. Transferring resources from a bank deposit requires the involvement of at least your own bank, perhaps the central bank and the recipient’s bank. Think here not only of commercial bank deposits but also bills, eg non-interest bearing (bearer) certificates, issued privately, as in the case of the Bank of Amsterdam mentioned earlier.
Local or regional currencies are the ones that can be spent in a particular geographical location at participating organisations. They tend to be physical. The túmin, for example, was a local currency circulating (illegally) for some time around 2010 exclusively in the Mexican municipality of Espinal.
What does digitalisation mean for the flower? Digitalisation is nothing new: financial services and most forms of money have been largely digital for many years. Much of the ongoing transformation is just adding a mobile version for many services, which means that the device becomes a virtual extension of the institution. As such, there is not a new model. The money flower then also easily accommodates these forms.


That is also the case for the digital, account-based forms of money that central banks traditionally have made available to commercial banks and, in some instances, to certain other financial or public institutions (ie bank reserves).
It would also be the case if the central bank were to issue digital money to the wider public for general purposes. Each central bank will have to make its own decision on whether issuing digital money is desirable, after considering factors such as the structure of the financial system and underlying preferences for privacy. The central bank community is actively analysing this issue.
A potentially important and leapfrogging digital-related development, however, is distributed ledger technology (DLT), the basis for Bitcoin. Many think DLT could transform financial service provision, maybe first wholesale, then possibly retail. For example, it could enhance settlement efficiency involving securities and derivatives transactions. A few central banks have conducted experiments in this area, for example the Bank of Canada, the Bundesbank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Bank of England.6 Yet doubts remain regarding the maturity of DLT and the size of associated efficiency gains relative to existing technologies. Moreover, their robustness, including to cyber-risk, is still to be fully understood and ascertained. Still, there are potential benefits, and I expect that central banks will remain engaged on this topic.7
For now, DLT is largely used to “create” bitcoin and other digital currencies. Such cryptocurrencies can be placed easily in the money flower. Nobody issues them, they are not physical and they are peer-to-peer. But beyond that, how should one think about them?
What constitutes good money?
Just because we are able to find a place for bitcoin in our money flower does not mean we should consider it as “good” money. As I mentioned before, trust is the fundamental tenet that underpins credible currencies, and this trust has to be earned and supported. There are many lessons from history and institutional economics on the earning of trust that we can use as we move further into digitalisation.8
Over the ages, many forms of private money have come and gone. It is fair to say that the same has happened with various experiments with public money (that is, money issued by a public entity that is not the central bank). While some lasted longer than others, most have invariably given way to some form of central bank money. The main reason for their disappearance is that the “incentives to cheat” are simply too high. Let me give three historical examples: one in Germany, another in the United States and the last one in Mexico.
In Germany, the Thirty Years War (1618–48), involving small German states of the Holy Roman Empire and neighbouring regional powers, was associated with one of the most severe economic crises ever recorded, with rampant hyperinflation – just as happened three centuries later during the Weimar Republic – and the breakdown of trade and economic activity. The crisis became known as the Kipper- und Wipperzeit (the clipping and culling times), after the practice of clipping coins (shaving metal from their circumference) and sorting good coins from bad. This morning, we are launching a BIS Working Paper, by Professor Isabel Schnabel and BIS Economic Adviser Hyun Song Shin, which further details and explains this experience, as background to my speech.
6 See Bech and Garratt, op cit.
7 See Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures, Distributed ledger technology in payment, clearing and settlement: an analytical framework, February 2017.
8 See D North, Institutions, institutional change and economic performance, 1990.


While episodes of currency debasement have occurred throughout history, this one stands out for two reasons. First is the severity of the crisis and its rapid regional spread. Debasement proceeded at such a pace that public authorities quickly lost control of the downward spiral. Second is how the debasement was brought under control. This occurred through standardisation of wholesale payments by public deposit banks, for example the Bank of Hamburg and the Bank of Amsterdam. These were in many ways examples of the precursors of modern central banks. As the working paper argues, monetary order could be brought to an otherwise chaotic situation by providing reliable payment means through precursors to central bank money, which at the end means the use of a credible institutional arrangement.
In the period in the United States known as the Free Banking Era, from 1837 to 1863, many banks sprang up that issued currency with no oversight of any kind by the federal government.10 These so-called free bank notes did not work very well as a medium of exchange. Given that there were so many banks of varying reputations issuing notes, they sold at different prices in different places, making transactions quite complicated. And as supervision was largely absent, banks had limited restraint in issuing notes and did not back them up sufficiently with specie (gold or silver), thereby debasing their values. This era of “wildcat banking” ended up being a long and costly period of banking instability in the history of the US, with banking panics and major disruptions to economic activity. It was, after some further hiccups, followed by the establishment of the Federal Reserve System in 1913.
Let me present a final example, from Mexican monetary history. A little known fact is that Mexico had the first series of hyperinflations at the beginning of the 20th century. My country had a revolution from 1910 to 1921, in which no central government existed in an effective way, with many factions fighting and disputing different territories. A winning faction would arrive in a territory, print its own money and make void previously issued cash. So different bills issued by different factions coexisted, leading to chaos and hyperinflation. To give you an idea of the disorder, in 2015 four trunks full of bills were returned to Mexico after having been appropriated by the US Navy in 1914, when the US occupied the port city of Veracruz. In the trunks, the Bank of Mexico discovered dozens of types of bills that the central bank had not even known existed.11 At the end of the conflict, a new constitution was drafted, having as a central article one which gave the Bank of Mexico the appropriate institutional framework, designating it the exclusive issuer of currency in the country. Once this was in place, hyperinflation ceased, illustrating the importance of controlling fiscal dominance (which tends to be the result of the abuse of publicly issued money).
Based on these experiences, most observers, and I suspect all of you here, would agree that laissez-faire is not a good approach in banking or in the issuance of money. Indeed, the paradigm of strict bank regulation and supervision and central banks overseeing the financial and monetary system that has emerged over the last century or so has proven to be the most effective way to avoid the instability and high economic costs associated with the proliferation of private and public monies.

The unhappy experience with private forms of money raises deep questions about whether the proliferation of cryptocurrencies is desirable or sustainable. Even if the supply of one type of cryptocurrency is limited, the mushrooming of so many of them means that the total supply of all forms of cryptocurrency is unlimited. Added to this is the practice of “forking”, where an offshoot of an existing cryptocurrency can be conjured up from thin air. Given the experience with currency debasement that has peppered history, the proliferation of such private monies should give everyone pause for thought. I will return to this shortly.
We have learned over the centuries that money as a social institution requires a solution to the problem of a lack of trust.12 The central banks that often emerged in the wake of the private and public money collapses may not have looked like the ones we have today, but they all had some institutional backing. The forms of this backing for their issuance of money have differed over time and by country.13 Commodity money has often been the start. History shows that gold and other precious metals stored in the vault with governance (and physical) safeguards can provide some assurance.
Commodity money is not the only or necessarily sufficient mechanism. Often it also required a city-, state- or nation-provided charter, as with the emergence of giro banks in many European countries. Later, the willingness of central banks to convert money for gold at a fixed price (the gold standard) was the mechanism. Currency boards, where local money is issued one-to-one with changes in foreign currency holdings, can also work to provide credibility.
The tried, trusted and resilient modern way to provide confidence in public money is the independent central bank. This means legal safeguards and agreed goals, ie clear monetary policy objectives, operational, instrument and administrative independence, together with democratic accountability to ensure broad-based political support and legitimacy. While not fully immune from the temptation to cheat, central banks as an institution are hard to beat in terms of safeguarding society’s economic and political interest in a stable currency.
Where do cryptocurrencies fit in?
One could argue that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies’ attractiveness lies in an intelligent application of DLT. DLT provides a method to broadcast transactions publicly and pseudonymously in a way that achieves in principle ledger immutability.14 Who would have thought that having people guessing solutions to what was described to me by a techie as the mathematical equivalent of mega-sudokus would be a way to generate consensus among strangers around the world through a proof of work? Does it thus provide a novel solution to the problem of how to generate trust among people who do not know each other?
If DLT provides the potential for a superledger, could bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies then substitute for some forms of money?15 We do not have the full answers, but at this time the answer, also in the light of historical experiences, is probably a sound no, for many reasons. In fact, we are seeing the type of cracks and cheating that brought down other private currencies starting to appear in the House of Bitcoin. As an institution, Bitcoin has some obvious flaws.
12 See M King, “The institutions of monetary policy”, speech at the American Economic Association Annual Meeting, San Diego, 4 January 2004.
13 See Giannini, op cit.
14 See Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures, op cit.
15 See N Kocherlakota, “Money is memory”, Journal of Economic Theory, vol 81, pp 232–51, 1998. In fact, he shows in a very stark setting that having a costless means to record the memory of all economic actors, both present and past, can do as much as money, and sometimes more. Conversely, money effectively functions as memory by providing an observable record of past transactions – that is, agents can tell whether a potential trader is running a current deficit or surplus with society by looking at the money balances that trader is carrying. The finding, however, is theoretical and not robust to slight changes in assumptions, including the risk of loss of data.


Debasement. As I mentioned, we may be seeing the modern-day equivalent of clipping and culling. In Bitcoin, these take the form of forks, a type of spin-off in which developers clone Bitcoin’s software, release it with a new name and a new coin, after possibly adding a few new features or tinkering with the algorithms’ parameters. Often, the objective is to capitalise on the public’s familiarity with Bitcoin to make some serious money, at least virtually. Last year alone, 19 Bitcoin forks came out, including Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Diamond. Forks can fork again, and many more could happen. After all, it just takes a bunch of smart programmers and a catchy name. As in the past, these modern-day clippings dilute the value of existing ones, to the extent such cryptocurrencies have any economic value at all.
Trust. As the saying goes, trust takes years to build, seconds to break and forever to repair. Historical experiences suggest that these “assets” are probably not sustainable as money. Cryptocurrencies are not the liability of any individual or institution, or backed by any authority. Governance weaknesses, such as the concentration of their ownership, could make them even less trustworthy. Indeed, to use them often means resorting to an intermediary (for example, the bitcoin exchanges) to which one has to trust one’s money. More generally, they piggyback on the same institutional infrastructure that serves the overall financial system and on the trust that it provides. This reflects their challenge to establish their own trust in the face of cyber-attacks, loss of customers’ funds, limits on transferring funds and inadequate market integrity.
Inefficiency. Novel technology is not the same as better technology or better economics. That is clearly the case with Bitcoin: while perhaps intended as an alternative payment system with no government involvement, it has become a combination of a bubble, a Ponzi scheme and an environmental disaster. The volatility of bitcoin renders it a poor means of payment and a crazy way to store value. Very few people use it for payments or as a unit of account. In fact, at a major cryptocurrency conference the registration fee could not be paid with bitcoins because it was too costly and slow: only conventional money was accepted.
To the extent they are used, bitcoins and their cousins seem more attractive to those who want to make transactions in the black or illegal economy, rather than everyday transactions. In a way, this should not be surprising, since individuals who massively evade taxes or launder money are the ones who are willing to live with cryptocurrencies’ extreme price volatility. In practice, central bank experiments show that DLT-based systems are very expensive to run and slower and much less efficient to operate than conventional payment and settlement systems. The electricity used in the process of mining bitcoins is staggering, estimated to be equal to the amount Singapore uses every day in electricity,16 making them socially wasteful and environmentally bad.
Therefore, the current fascination with these cryptocurrencies seems to have more to do with a speculative mania than any use as a form of electronic payment, except for illegal activities. Accordingly, authorities are edging closer and closer to clamping down to contain the risks related to cryptocurrencies.
There is a strong case for policy intervention. As now noted by many securities markets and regulatory and supervisory agencies, these assets can raise concerns related to consumer and investor protection. Appropriate authorities have a duty to educate and protect investors and consumers, and need to be prepared to act.
Moreover, there are concerns related to tax evasion, money laundering and criminal finance. Authorities should welcome innovation. But they have a duty to make sure technological advances are not used to legitimise profits from illegal activities.

What role for the central bank?
Central banks, acting by themselves and/or in coordination with other financial authorities like bank regulators and supervisors, ministries of finance, tax agencies and financial intelligence units, may also need to act, given their roles in providing money services and safeguarding money’s real value.
Working with commercial banks, authorities have a part to play in policing the digital frontier. Commercial banks are on the front line since they are the ones settling trades, providing real liquidity, keeping exchanges going and interacting with customers. It is alarming that some banks have advertised “bitcoin ATMs” where you can buy and sell bitcoins. Authorities need to ensure commercial banks do not facilitate unscrupulous behaviours.
Central banks need to safeguard payment systems. To date, Bitcoin is not functional as a means of payment, but it relies on the oxygen provided by the connection to standard means of payments and trading apps that link users to conventional bank accounts. If the only “business case” is use for illicit or illegal transactions, central banks cannot allow such tokens to rely on much of the same institutional infrastructure that serves the overall financial system and freeload on the trust that it provides.
Authorities should apply the principle that the Basel Process has adhered to for years: to provide a level playing field to all participants in financial markets (banks and non-banks alike), while at the same time fostering innovative, secure and competitive markets. In this context, this means, among other things, ensuring that the same high standards that money transfer and payment service providers have to meet are also met by Bitcoin-type exchanges. It also means ensuring that legitimate banking and payment services are only offered to those exchanges and products that meet these high standards.
Financial authorities may also have a case to intervene to ensure financial stability. To date, many judge that, given cryptocurrencies’ small size and limited interconnectedness, concerns about them do not rise to a systemic level. But if authorities do not act pre-emptively, cryptocurrencies could become more interconnected with the main financial system and become a threat to financial stability.
Most importantly, the meteoric rise of cryptocurrencies should not make us forget the important role central banks play as stewards of public trust. Private digital tokens masquerading as currencies must not subvert this trust. As history has shown, there simply is no substitute.
Still, central banks are embracing new technologies as appropriate. Many new developments can help. For example, fintech and “techfin” – which refers to established technology platforms venturing into financial services. These are changing financial service provision in many countries, most clearly in payments, and especially in some emerging market economies (for example, China and Kenya). While they introduce the possibility of non-bank financial institutions introducing money-type instruments, which raises a familiar set of regulatory questions, they do present scope for many gains.
Conclusion
In conclusion, while cryptocurrencies may pretend to be currencies, they fail the basic textbook definitions. Most would agree that they do not function as a unit of account. Their volatile valuations make them unsafe to rely on as a common means of payment and a stable store of value.
They also defy lessons from theory and experiences. Most importantly, given their many fragilities, cryptocurrencies are unlikely to satisfy the requirement of trust to make them sustainable forms of money.
While new technologies have the potential to improve our lives, this is not invariably the case. Thus, central banks must be prepared to intervene if needed. After all, cryptocurrencies piggyback on the institutional infrastructure that serves the wider financial system, gaining a semblance of legitimacy from their links to it. This clearly falls under central banks’ area of responsibility. The buck stops here. But the buck also starts here. Credible money will continue to arise from central bank decisions, taken in the light of day and in the public interest.
In particular, central banks and financial authorities should pay special attention to two aspects. First, to the ties linking cryptocurrencies to real currencies, to ensure that the relationship is not parasitic. And second, to the level playing field principle. This means “same risk, same regulation”. And no exceptions allowed.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Pay off more principal on my house or invest?,"I just came into $39,000, $25,000 of which is taxable (Washington State).


I purchased my house back in March of 2017 at $220,000 with $20,000 down and an interest rate of around %3.625. Have no issues paying my current mortgage payment at all and am always on time.


My question is, would it make more sense financially to use that money to pay off more principal on my house? Or take it to a financial advisor (my dad has one he recommended who handles his retirement account. My dad takes out $2000 a month for expenses, but the account has actually grown in size despite this over the last year and a half).


I think another thing worth noting is that this is my ""starter house"" and I only plan on living here until 2022-2026 (depending on the market, which in this area has been extremely strong for sellers).


Another thing to note is my mortgage is an FHA, meaning I am stuck paying PMI for a set amount of time, not up to a certain percentage paid off.

It says something that is slightly confusing me. ""The compensation changes outlined below will be effective January 1, 2018.""

and: ""Inventive change will be pro-rated based on the effective date of the increase.""

What does that mean? Does that mean they are going to cut me a check or add in to my next paycheck the difference owed to me for the past month or so? Or that my pay going forward will be slightly higher to make up for me not having that raise since Jan 1st?

financialindependence,"A question I've been pondering for a while is now relevant: should SWR be based on your net worth ""high water mark"" or your net worth on the day you FIRE?","As someone who is semi-FIRE (freelancing part-time before fully pulling the trigger on employment income), I've had the hypothetical question: if you assume, as I do, that a 3.5% initial safe withdrawal rate will support a ~60 year retirement, but you start withdrawing *after* a market downturn such that your net worth is lower than some previous point, is it still valid to use the ""high water mark"" of your net worth as the basis for the initial safe withdrawal rate?

Since the SWR (as most of us think of it) is simply a probabilistic assumption based on historical trends, it seems that the ""high water mark"" approach is appropriate. After all, why should I have a lower SWR if I FIREd today vs two weeks ago? My point is, the SWR, especially if you've gone conservative with 3.5% or even 3.25% based on elevated CAPE10 ratios, is building in downturns far worse than the current one, so it seems reasonable to me that you can use your highest point as the basis for your SWR even if you retire at some future point.

This, of course, assumes that you've stayed in the market, and your net worth is down because of the market itself, not because you withdrew and stuffed your money under a mattress or bought a speed boat.

personalfinance,1099-R Help,"In 2017, I rolled over my Roth 401k and Traditional 401k into a Roth IRA and Traditional IRA respectively. For the traditional, they sent the funds directly to Vanguard. For the Roth, they said they were unable to transfer the funds directly to Vanguard, so they would have to send me a check for the amount and I could forward it to Vanguard.

As soon as the check arrived in the mail, I forwarded it to Vanguard. Vanguard added it to my account and labeled it as a rollover contribution. I thought everything was great.

I got my 1099-R documents for the two rollovers today. The traditional seems to have been fine. The Roth document makes it look like I took an unqualified distribution of all of the money and kept it. This means they withheld federal taxes on the capital gains and there is a taxable amount in box 2a. box 7 (the distribution code) is B1. I would think this should be H?

I called the company and they said their document is done correctly and I have to talk to a financial agent to help me on my side.

This also presents the problem that I did not roll over the entire amount of my Roth 401k. They took some money for federal withholding that did not get rolled over. I'm assuming I'm now forced to take a distribution in that amount and pay taxes / penalties on it?

*Consolidated debt: $225,000 @ 5.5% on REPAYE. Current monthly payments are $130 with REPAYE, expect this to stay low over the next 3 years and then will increase once my salary picks up. This is eligible for Public service loan forgiveness (PSLF). If I make 10 years of qualifying payments, remaining debt will be forgiven (realistically ~90-100k will be forgiven is my guess, hard to calculate)    
* No-interest loan of $6500.     
* Private School loan of $30,000. This is still in SUBSIDIZED grace period, interest and payment starts in 11/18, and Quarterly payments of $1000 @6% starts in 11/18.     


Total Debt: ~$260,000    
Accounts/Cash. 
*Marcus savings acct of $250,000 @1.5%  
*Other Cash/savings: $150,000  
*Roth IRA 50k (mostly equity)  
*401k 22k (non-matching, some low cost broad mutual funds)  
  

My confusion stems at the low debt servicing of my monstrous student debt and potential for loan forgiveness. If my effective payments are so small, then why pay off the debt for as long as I can keep the monthly payments low (because the effective interest rate is so low with REPAYE). In this context, I feel like I can do more with my cash than simply pay off debt now.  
  
If my thought process is marginally right, what to do with the cash is the next question. Would like to buy a home and not rent but in a very HCOL area and just not reasonable at this time. If not real estate, what are my options? I would really appreciate any guidance on to how best approach this debt in a way that takes advantage of the low debt servicing. I don't like having my cash do nothing. 
  
Thank you

For those not aware, REPAYE caps my monthly payments at 10% discretionary income and subsidizes some of the monthly interest not covered by the monthly payment (I think up to 50%). So effectively the interest rate is lower than 5.5%, depending on what my income is the year prior.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Crypto’s Operational Dilemma,"Although decentralization and controlled distributed verification are the meat and bones of crypto currencies; main stream adoption is stalling due to an operational gap within the crypto currency companies. The popular business model is to develop, and let the adopters figure it out. You might say that a wallet address, and a few accounts on the bigger exchanges is all that businesses need. But, there are too many transactional steps to take to convert a non Bitcoin, or Etherium cryptocoin into fiat currency, plus there’s the volatility. To name a few exceptions; the LiteCoin Foundation and Ripple have taken steps to create their own market. They understand that people and businesses must be able to use this stuff, the businesses must be able to understand it on their own terms.
From a business perspective, there’s an operational deficiency in training, technical knowledge, and internal processes involved in converting a cryptocoin into fiat individually and at scalable levels. A small online business might have a team of 5 to 6 people running the business on a laptop, a contracted web developer, and running their numbers on an MS Excel spreadsheet. All their sales payments are handled through the credit card company, and their accountant may be good at accounting but knows nothing about cryptos. This gets worse for medium sized companies, and even more so for large size companies. The dollar amounts are greater, and the transactional throughput is substantially higher.
Also, why would a business want to hold onto a paid sale in a volatile asset of value, before converting it into crypto? It’s in their best interest to capture the current fiat market value of the cryptocoin and put in it their coffers. These markets can move 20% to 50% in a matter of a few hours. When selling goods or services, I’m going with the saying, “A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.” I’d rather have my cash, then lose 20% of it due to volatility. This isn’t just a technology issue, it’s a business model issue on both sides. There’s a right way to do this.
A notable example of a company successfully introducing a market disrupting technology is Tesla. Big auto was fat and happy shilling out gas guzzling vehicles, with controlled releases of slightly improved gas mileage year over year. Tesla’s all electric vehicles flew in the face of big auto’s decades long release plan. Big auto was not happy. But, there’s a right way to do this. So, Elon Musk had a plan, and put it into action. First, he released all Tesla’s intellectual property rights of his electric vehicles to the public. This eased big auto’s lobbying efforts to create barriers of entry through state and federal regulations. He also created the infrastructure to allow people to recharge their vehicles away from home. He knew that widespread adoption relied on the ability to recharge your vehicle away from home and on the road. He also created the battery technology that enables the energy infrastructure to store that power at affordable rates and within an affordable size of physical space. This means that it is up to the cryptocurrency community to create the infrastructure.
The blockchain technology is free for all to see, that’s a good thing. But, cryptocoin’s highway infrastructure is defined by converting cryptocoins into fiat, creating business acceptable routes of payment, avoid market volatility, and making it easy for any sized business to get their money. I’m not saying that crypto companies aren’t doing anything, it’s just the way it is. I believe that they understand this; these are some very smart people; and there are solutions on the table. Bitcoin Atom aims to solve the conversion issue, by processing atomic transactions that turn one coin into another. Ripple teams up with larger institutions by providing technical consultation and solutions. LitePay is a direct line of service to businesses that connects sales to bank accounts. So maybe all is not lost. A handful of teams are ahead of the pack; but what are the other 800+ coins up to?",cryptocurrency

I have $2500 on a Capital One card with a 21% interest rate, that's the last CC debt I have, and that card is down from $3300, so I've really reigned in my poor habits

My question is, does anyone know any good ways of transferring that debt to something with a friendlier APR? I've applied to 2 banks and 4 different CCs, all declined. Don't lecture about how bad a hard inquiry is on my score, trust me I know.

personalfinance,Credit New Credit Cards,"So my wife recently had her credit card expire and we chose to get a new card. We did not close the account that her card was on, just transferred the balance to a new card.

Anyways like I said I got approved but then I decided to look at cards from Navy Federal. So I applied through Navy Federal and got approved and took that offer as I got approved for a 6.99% APR with a 25k limit and so I activated it. The USAA I got approved for was an 8.15% APR with an 8,500k limit which I have not activated yet. I am really only interested in keeping the Navy Federal Card but I am worried that cancelling the  USAA card will adversely affect my credit since I just opened that line of credit, albeit mistakenly. So my questions are 1. If I close the USAA card will it adversely affect my credit score? 2. Should I just keep both cards open and if so, will it adversely affect my score if I never utilize the USAA card? 3. How reliable are credit scores listed on credit karma, my wife is just shy of an 800 on credit karma and I am around 740 so I may just be over thinking all of this. I am planning on starting to use my credit card to pretty much pay most of our monthly expenses and then paying the balance in full before the due date each month, as I want to get above an 800 credit score.",finance
personalfinance,"Destroyed my Credit 3 Years Ago, Is it time for a loan?","3 Years ago I had a shit or get off the pot moment. Buy the business and bring it back from the depths of hell, potentially ruining my life if I failed, or go to a competitor and work for someone else for the rest of my life. I chose the former and I've been essentially carrying the business kicking &amp; screaming into record breaking numbers each &amp; every quarter for 3 years now.

With that said, this took insane work. It also took about 11 Credit Cards and 35k out 40k in total credit to get up and running. In this time, I have not been able to do anything except pay minimum payments and continue along. All my hard inquiries are gone except one in the many FICOs I have throughout all these cards. I have one collection that was paid off from my college days about 6-7 years ago that still shows up. When all is said and done, my credit score was destroyed up until these past few months.

Ive only just begun to clean up my credit utilization. It's what is holding me back from having a good score. My FICO is generally 660 range. The utilization is at 70% with 28k out of 40k used up. I can pretty much knock out 1% of this debt out a week and each week that 1% will grow as the debt shrinks. So by the end of this year I will have destroyed it all completely on my own.

The problem is all the 0% APRs are gone. So Im paying 27.99% on my highest card (taken out when I was desperately opening up cards to keep the lights on) all the way down to 9.99% (my first ever CC that I never missed a payment on since I was 18). Most of my cards are 19.99% and up. I know this interest is insane.

Do I apply for a loan through a credit union? LendingTree is offering me loans at like 27% APR which I immediately laughed at. I could use my business to loan me the money but Id rather not. I could also use an online lender but their APRs are ridiculous. LendingClub offered me a loan for 10k at 16% APR but a mixup caused my application not to go through so I have to wait 30 days. I dont even know if they wouldve approved me.

Anyway, I can wait the year, or apply for loans now. The thing is, I know waiting is the biggest factor in fixing credit. And I can do that. But putting all this debt together into one loan with even a slightly lower total interest rate sounds way too appealing for me to not go for. I also need my credit score to be as pristine as possible for the end of the year because I plan on taking out a massive business loan to take my business to the next level.

Soo CreditUnion? How is UNIFY? A rep there told me they consider anyone with a FICO about 550. They said I should be in the 12% APR Range. But will I get approved? I dont want to waste hard inquiries because again, if I really wanted to I could just wait this out. If UNIFY is likely to approve me, or any other Union or Creditor then Id love to do it. But that damn hard inquiry would really bug me if I got denied.",finance

personalfinance,"Moving to Michigan, got $50k in my pocket and a $120k per year job. What is a responsible home price to target for?","I will be relocating with my family (wife and 2 small kiddies) from the East Coast to Southeast Michigan in the coming months due to work. I have rented my whole adult life but would like to seize this as an opportunity to buy a home and take advantage of the low interest rates before they increase more. 

I'm the breadwinner of the family and my wife looks after the kids, keeping us from having to pay for child support. But, my income will be the means by which we get ourselves into a house. Thankfully, I've got a job I'm very satisfied with and don't anticipate leaving the company. And the company is paying to move us, so that's an expense I won't incur. 

In 2017, before tax, I made $110k and in 2018 I expect I'll make $120k pretax. As the years progress, my earnings should continue to climb at about $10k per year as long as I'm in good standing with my employer. 

Our cash savings total between $50-60k. This amount includes our emergency fund, $10k pulled from an IRA, and cash in savings accounts. I'm inclined to keep around $20k as an emergency fund/savings for post-closing expenses on the house. That would leave us with $30-40k available for loan downpayment. I won't be able to save up enough between now and summer to get anywhere close to 20% to avoid the PMI on the houses we're interested in.  

Scouting Zillow, Realtor.com and Trulia, and also having made a trip last month to SE Michigan to tour the neighborhoods, we're considering houses that fall between the $300k and $500k range, leaning toward the higher end for QOL purposes. Beyond $500k would put us into the territory of having to get a ""Jumbo Loan"" and that's a beast I don't want to touch! 

I spoke with a mortgage broker to get the pre-qual letter and after running some initial numbers they informed me my Credit Score is 800+. (yay!) But, before they issue me the pre-qual letter, they want to know what my target home cost amount is to put on the letter.  

Given I'll be making $120k+ per year, with at least $50k in cash on hand today, what is a responsible number to give the Broker? Should I go ahead and shoot for the moon ($500k) or hold my cards close ($300K)?",finance

personalfinance,Capital Gains vs Income on Stock?,"Let's say you get paid in stock on a particular year (100 shares @ $10). If you cash out as soon as you get paid, I assume you get taxed (assume 33% tax rate on income) as if you got paid $1000 in cash. So $333 tax, $667 keep in pocket.

Let's say you believe that the stock is a good investment and want to hold on to it.

Let's say 5 years later, it is worth $1500. Tax rate remains the same (33%). If you sell all your stock, do you get taxed for the 
 full $1500? (So $500 to govt, $1000 to you?). Or do you get taxed at income tax rate (33%) for the initial $1000 and capital gains (15%, you're holding the stock for more than 1 year) rate on the additional $500? (So govt gets ($333 + $75 = $408) and you get ($667 + $425 = $1092)).

If it's the former, would it make sense to cash out the full $1000 right away, defer your tax payment of $333 for 5 years (what's the interest rate that govt charges on that?), invest the full $1000 right back into the stock, and net the same $1092 as the latter method.

CryptoCurrency,Crypto Markets = Next 5 Years,"IMHO we’ve hit bottom and/or are damn near same. There were a few major mistakes I made when I entered the crypto market. Although I focused on ALTs, I failed to realize: (1) crypto markets do not move in tandem to stock markets; (2) BTC’s major effect on ALTs due to its pairing to same; and (3) the insane amount of speculators, gamblers, day traders, and investors that had no idea of what they were investing in when it came to cryptos. 

As a traditional stock market investor, I wrongly assumed that even though BTC had an insane 2017 run that since the stock market had 2-3 years of growth left due to tax cuts, repatriation of offshore profits/funds, real wage increases, &amp; further budgetary fiscal stimulus (e.g. infrastructure spending) that cryptos would most likely follow this same trajectory. These past weeks have demonstrated crypto markets operate entirely independent from stock markets. 

IMHO this crypto crash has come to and/or is near its end. BTC tested going below $6,000 a few times but seemed to have found strong support &amp; fought back from same. We have a lot of factors working in our favor that I think will lead to growth in the next 5 years that may well lead cryptos to outperform the stock market percentage-wise based on current positions. 

First &amp; foremost, the bad news is essentially over (other than Tether/Bitfinex’s possible collapse and/or possibly future crypto hacks/thefts). We’ve hit so many hiccups in a short span that caused this crash including, but not limited to; (1) South Korean crypto ban rumors/FUD/panic being misreported by mainstream media; (2) India crypto ban rumors/FUD/panic being misreported by mainstream media; (3) collapse of Bitconnect crypto/exchange; (4) fraudulent ICOs (e.g. Prodeum); (5) banks banning crypto purchases through credit/debit cards due to their fraud models not taking into account the high risk of complete loss from same; (6) trusted veteran Wall Street investors spreading FUD/panic about crypto (e.g. Warren Buffet, James Dimon, etc); (7) China banning crypto mining &amp; domestic/foreign crypto trading; (8) crypto investors being spooked by new tax, identity, and reporting/compliance requirements being mandated by government actors (e.g. South Korea, USA, etc.); &amp; (9) speculation that Tether is a sham that will collapse both USDT/Bitfinex and quite possibly the entire market. Basically, everything that could have possibly gone wrong did so in a short span; however, IMHO the market for real cryptos is looking attractive &amp; set to rise. There is not much news that is likely to happen now that can negatively impact crypto markets as a whole other than the collapse of Tether/Bitfinex, which IMHO will be muted due to the fact: (1) the Tether/Bitfinex scare has already been priced into the market to an extent due to the fact any investor with a brain knows the risks posed by parking $ into Tether/Bitfinex; and (2) some market players taking matters into their own hands to restore confidence such as UpBit guaranteeing to back the USDTs on its exchange in case Tether does not have adequate dollar reserves. 

Second, at these prices many BTC/crypto miners are below the break even point. They can't offload cryptos they mined into the markets like they typically did in the past at higher price levels as same would cause them to operate at a loss &amp; slowly go under. Even crypto prices remaining stable at this range will force many crypto miners out of business. This is a clear supply/demand benefit that will help to alleviate further downward pressure. 

Third, IMHO it’s clear that cryptos have had their crash/correction that I envisioned happening alongside the stock market in 2-3 years; however, the stock market &amp; many stocks have not had such a correction/crash &amp; remain at ATHs. Now the mainstream media (“MSM”) will focus their attention on the “stock market bubble” and spread more FUD/panic regarding same instead of cryptos. Do not underestimate how much the MSM hates Trump, so with Trump touting the stock market the MSM will def switch their “if it bleeds it leads” FUD/panic headlines over to the stock market bubble.

Fourth, while smart investment &amp; institutional money will short the stock market at these ATHs, some of that $ (even if minimal) will flow into cryptos as an investment/hedge against stock losses. It is extremely rare to half a half trillion dollar asset class that no one owns/controls that only has approximately 0.1% correlation to global financial/stock markets (which sadly now all typically move in tandem with the increased globalization/integration of the world economy). After this crash, cryptos seem more appealing for tangible gains in the short, medium, &amp; long term. There’s a reason Lord Baron Rothschild said that “the time to buy is when there is blood in the streets.” It’s clear the crypto markets have been bloodied &amp; represent an investment opportunity. Even if only a couple percent of the $$ in the global stock markets flows into true crypto investments (and not SHAM-COINS/SHIT-COINS) as a hedge against the stock market and/or as a true investment then that will increase the total crypto market cap to new ATHs of approximately $3 trillion. 

Fifth, crypto is now being embraced (if not cautiously) by many of the world’s economic powers. Yes, China, South Korea, &amp; India have currency reserve issues and need to stop the outflow of funds &amp; money laundering from their nations; however, Japan, the US, and the EU/UK seem to be cautiously embracing and taking a “do no harm” approach to cryptos. It’s clear Japan, the US, &amp; the EU/UK envision the crypto market/funding model becoming a NASDAQ 2.0. Japan has gone all in on crypto as it feels enormous regret/shame that it was left behind during the online/tech innovation boom of the 90s. Japan sees crypto as the future &amp; won't make the same mistake twice. As we have seen from today’s US Senate hearing, the US sees real value/benefits in cryptos and will cautiously embrace/regulate same to ensure organic growth &amp; protect investors. The US taking a “do no harm” approach to crypto markets is a big win (as the US could have effectively killed the crypto markets if it took an opposite stance). Moreover, the UK/EU has taken a similar approach to the US (as the UK/EU have no choice but to continually compete against NYC &amp; Hong Kong to remain in the financial capitals/hubs of the world). IMHO Russia will never institute a wholesale ban on cryptos as Russia needs this tech to move funds due to US financial sanctions on Russia’s high net worth citizens, government officials, and to challenge the petrodollar. Furthermore, while China &amp; South Korea have issues with money laundering, need cash reserves, &amp; need to minimize cash outflows form the country, both China and South Korea will have no choice but to deal with the reality of the turning crypto tide. China will most likely institute heavy crypto regulations &amp; embrace centralized cryptos, non-privacy cryptos, business enterprise focused cryptos, and/or cryptos that do not aim to replace fiat currency in a decentralized manner that its government cannot control.  

Sixth, it’s clear inflation and a stalling of the US economy is a real threat in the not too distant future (2-3 years). IMHO the US will experience stagflation within the next 3-7 years. This will also make cryptos more appealing. The FED is caught in a Catch-22 when it comes to the US economy &amp; inflation. The FED raised the benchmark interest rate multiple times last year &amp; plans multiple increases to same this year. Nevertheless, the FED has already noticed an uptick in inflation that will only be compounded with the tax cuts &amp; real wages increase. Moreover, the FED is planning to clear its balance sheet from its Great Recession quantitative easing bond purchases at the same time the US Government is running an insane deficit that will need to be funded through bond sales. With both the US Government &amp; FED pushing bond sales, the interest rates on same will have no choice but to increase to attract buyers. Moreover, wages are finally seeing the first real increase in decades from these tax cuts &amp; that will only compound the inflation issues that are starting to ferment. Now if the US and global economy stalls, the US government &amp; FED do not have many options left to combat same. Lending rates are still at relative historic lows, the federal deficit is insane, and the stomach to increase the deficit though fiscal stimulus may not be there. That leaves the very real likelihood that inflation may well creep up &amp; creep up fast while the stock market &amp; economy slowly retreats making cryptos an attractive alternative investment to some. 

Seventh, the decoupling of BTC from ALTs and the introduction of true fiats pairs and additional liquidity into major crypto exchanges will do wonders in eliminating the ability of BTC to dictate the course of the entire crypto market in the future. There is no reason cryptos with their own blockchain (e.g. NEO, ETH, LTC, etc.) and/or built on a blockchain other than BTC should live or die based on BTC’s fortunes. This is on the horizon. Many exchanges have expressed a willingness to decouple ALTs from BTC, which would do wonders in allowing individual cryptos to sink or swim on their own merits. I don’t think this will tank BTC, but only allow for ALTs to operate independently of BTC’s fortunes. 

Lastly, this crypto collapse was a great motivator to help reduce speculation, gambling, &amp; illegal activities in the crypto markets. So many weak hands sold in a panic &amp; most likely took a loss. Now those weak hands may have significant regrets due to this mini-recovery. If these weak hands do re-enter the crypto markets, they will have a stronger tolerance for the volatility &amp; won’t be so easily induced into a fire sale. Moreover, day traders &amp;  gamblers that got burnt by the crypto swings/volatility will think twice about their strategy of risky short term gains/plays versus sound long term investing. Furthermore, with the ever expanding Bank ban of debit/credit card usage to buy crypto, it will further reduce the number of small time speculators, gamblers, &amp; day traders that do not have real liquid funds/savings to invest but are solely in the crypto markets to gamble, speculate, and day trade in hopes of making a quick $. These developments will force crypto investors to truly research &amp; understand their picks and not just blindly back any crypto with a white paper &amp; website. This will allow SHITCOINS/SHAMCOINS to die while $ flows into the handful of true promising cryptos. Moreover, with more government regulations/controls legitimizing crypto as a sound investment and eliminating massive crypto fraud/manipulation, institutional and investor $ will have more confidence to enter and/or re-enter the crypto markets. 

In conclusion, I believe crypto markets are now in a position where investment into same is attractive and growth can happen organically with less speculation (although we still have to deal with the Tether/Bitfinex issue). “I wish you good fortune in the (crypto) wars to come.”",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,This doesn't seem right: I can avoid paying taxes *and* my student loans by socking away money in tax-advantaged accounts?,"So I was musing to myself about my impending post-graduate life and budget today when a realization struck me, and it just seems too insane to be true, so I'm wondering if there's some big piece I'm missing somewhere. Here's the deal: I've got a federal job lined up after graduation where I'll be able to sign up for a high deductible health plan, making me eligible to contribute to an HSA (max $6900/yr). As a federal employee I'll also be eligible to contribute to the Thrift Savings Plan up to $18,500/yr, with a 5% agency match. And, of course, I'm eligible to contribute the $5,500 to an IRA. That's a total of $30,900 of tax-deferred contributions, which translates to a $30,900 reduction to my adjusted gross income. ~~Combine that with the standard $24,000 standard deduction for a married couple filing jointly for a total wages reduction of $54,900.~~ All of that is pretty straightforward and logical; the government a) wants to equalize the tax code for people who aren't able to take advantage of various tax write offs and b) wants to encourage people to save for retirement. That's their prerogative, fine, whatever, I'm happy to take advantage.

Here's where things get weird. As a federal employee, I'll also be eligible to take advantage of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program (assuming Congress doesn't get rid of it in the next 11 years). Now, student loans usually amortize over ten years, so in order to take advantage of the program, you have to enter into some sort of income-driven repayment plan like Pay As You Earn (PAYE). The thing is, these plans are also calculated based on your adjusted gross income. This means that you can get a double whammy by contributing to IRAs/401(k)s/HSAs/etc to not only reduce your tax bill *but also your student loan payments.* If you're in the lower- to mid-middle class sweet spot you can probably even swing a fairly frugal life where you pay nothing on your taxes or student loans while simultaneously building a healthy retirement nest egg. This seems like a big unintended consequence of the way the student loans are structured vis-a-vis the federal tax code. Is there something I'm missing? I feel like I can't be the first to have figured it out, and if I wasn't it seems like this would be some pretty standard PF advice, and I don't think I've ever seen it on here. The only other conclusion I can come to is that I'm just missing something that negates the student loan savings. Any thoughts?

Edit: It seems I was considering the standard deduction wrong and misrepresenting my AGI. Even so, I don't think the main takeaway is all that different regarding retirement contributions and their effects on both taxes and student loans.",finance
personalfinance,"Lost $12,000 gambling in a week. Distressed, to put it lightly.","Money values are in USD.

28 year old male. Gross income per year of 80k to 90k. Independent contractor.

The past 7 days have been the worst of my financial life.

Before this past week, I was only an occasional gambler. I'd buy 5 to 10 dollars in scratch off tickets every couple of months at convenience stores. Last week I discovered online casinos. I wish I never had. I started off with a mere 100 dollar deposit. Lost it. Then another 100. Lost it. Distressed about losing 200 dollars, I was determined to get it back. I threw down $500 on a deposit. I managed to hit a high on the roulette wheel of over $6,000. I thought the game was broken. How was I doing so well? Naturally, I lost all of that. I didn't think I could lose. I was wrong.

$2,000+ in the hole later, and I am DESPERATELY chasing my losses, trying to get my money back by depositing more money into my casino accounts. This is no longer about fun or ""striking it big,"" but about getting my money back. This has had DISASTROUS consequences. I have now maxed out a credit card of $6,000, in addition to thousands lost in my checking account.

$10,000 to $12,000 later, and here I am, wondering what the hell happened.

I have not told anybody about this. The shame and guilt is too great. I cannot believe I was so stupid.

My financial situation:

I have just $400 in my bank account. It was $2,400 this morning. It would have been $0 if the casinos didn't have weekly deposit limits.

I have 2 checks for contract work coming in soon with a combined total of $12,200. This is enough money to last me 3 months, but here's the problem: All of this was meant for taxes for 2017. I didn't set any aside. I already owe the IRS $10k and am on an installment agreement with them.

I have ~$24,000 in credit card debt, and $2,300 in available credit. Looking at 90% utilization. It was $18,000 before my gambling disaster. My father suggested paying $1,000/month on the highest interest card. This would eliminate all of my credit card debt in less than 30 months.

Here's my plan:

1. Plead with the IRS to let them add my 2017 tax debt to the previous installment agreement so I don't become homeless. This will bring the total I owe them to $20,000. I'll be paying off my car soon, so that will free up $380/month. The cost and interest rate for the IRS is comparable to a car, so I'll just pretend I'm leasing a car.

2. Save money wherever possible. No more eating out. Halve my monthly food budget by buying groceries. Use the extra money to pay down debts.

3. Hustle my ass off to get more work and increase my income (I'm a freelance designer).

4. Join gambling addition online communities for accountability and keep a gambling addiction hotline on speed-dial.

5. Never fucking gamble again.

Thoughts on my plan? Words of encouragement? Criticism? This all feels like a bad dream that I'm just waiting to wake up from. The only thing that comforts me is that I only lost 12k before I wised up. Some people have lost way more to gambling.",finance

investing,Does it make sense to invest when you're paying a home loan?,"Hey guys, I was wondering I'm not in this situation though I'd like to see you're thoughts on this. 

Lets say I'm paying my loan but got some extra money would you buy stocks or just cut more from the loan?

And if you where going to buy your first home would you pull everything out of the stock market to buy or leave them there (or percentage)

Considering the loan has a 3% interest. Personally I think I would pull everything out as long as I'm at a profit. 

But another side of me is like an index has an average of 8% per year while a loan only has 3% wouldn't arbitraging these be a better idea?

Though my 'good boy' personality would always choose to pay the house first before getting into more stocks what are your thoughts on this?

personalfinance,"Current state, not sure what my next move should be..","So, just a little background. 

I’m 22. 

I have 15 credit cards. I have $14k in CC debt, most in no interest.

$21k auto loan, been paying over that amount every month. Original loan was $37k and bought the car back in 2015. Normal payment due is around $550 a month, I was paying anywhere’s from $550 to $670.
3.25% interest rate on the car loan. 

No rent.  

Make around $1100-$1300 every 2 weeks, depending on OT. 

I have about $6.1k in the bank right now, another $6k in a safety deposit for emergencies. 

I get paid this Friday where I clocked almost 120 hours, get paid $19/hr normally. Plus they’re putting more since I just got a raise (to make up for my hours already)

So I’m hoping to have around $7.7k? Possibly $8k. 

Liquidated my investment accounts before the small correction we just had. 

Do I pull the money from my SD and pay down most of my stuff? Or pay down most of my cards and leave one with a balance that’s getting charged at no interest? 

Breakdown of debt: 

Discover ~$9k (no interest for 12 months) 
Barclay ~$3k (I think 21% apr?)
BestBuy ~$650 (no interest) 
NewEgg ~$200 (no interest) 
Chase ~$800 (no interest 12 months) 
Amex ~$250 (will be paid off) 

I use an app called Prism that tracks all my balances, total available credit if I paid my cards down would be around $50k. I have a utilization of around 20%?

personalfinance,Trying to make the best financial decision for my second degree but am a bit concerned that I am too biased by my personal anxiety/guilt to see clearly.,"Warning: This got long.

I was accepted to an accelerated second degree in nursing. I graduated from my first bachelor's with no student loans or debt (thanks to my amazingly generous parents and grandparents) and have been living across the country and working a high-stress corporate job related to my first degree. I do not like my field at all and I live in one of the most expensive cities in the country, so while I make enough to live off of, I have not managed to save any significant chunks of money. I have about $4,000 in savings from two years of work. My credit score is very good (FICO says 790, CreditKarma says 760) and I have no debt, just limited savings, but I have various family willing to help me out (explained below). I think I am in a relatively good place to do a second degree, but I have a few concerns and feel guilty about the support I've been offered. 

I am getting married in August, my SO is a software engineer. We are financially comfortable and he offered to support me through school. Unfortunately, since he's finishing his master's degree through his current job, he will not be able to move with me until early 2019 when he's done. My program starts this May 2018.

The tuition for my program will be around $50,000 over 15 months (approx. $12,000 x 4 semesters). It is one state away from my parents so I will have to find a place to live on my own. I decided to look for a place with roommates to save money until my SO moves to me, so I am estimating rent will be around $800 with utilities and everything included. That seems to be the going rate for rooms in the city I am moving to. 

My parents offered to cover my tuition and expenses, but I really don't feel comfortable taking so much of their money. They are well-off thanks to inheritance, financial intelligence and their own successful careers, but I do not want to be a burden on them, especially because my dad is planning on retiring next year. Also, I am a grown, almost-married woman in her mid-20s, it was my choice to leave my career and start over. They shouldn't be on the hook for this.

That being said, they want to cover my expenses with inheritance from my grandpa that he wanted my parents to give to me at their own discretion. I think that is fair, so I will accept that. However, I still feel guilty about it. Is that a waste? They originally wanted to gift it to me and my husband as a down payment for a house when we were ready to settle down. I talked to them about this and they came up with a few suggestions for options, and I have some of my own:

* **Option 1:** They cover my $50k tuition which they really want to and insist they do. I take out a loan (ideally federal since I haven't take any out so far, I think I am eligible) to cover living expenses until husband arrives and has a stable job. At that point, I will only have 5 months left in my program, so I think we can get by until I find a job. Luckily, nursing jobs are plenty in my region and pay very well. My mom is also a nurse manager and well-known at her hospital so I have some connections in my home area if really needed.

* **Option 2:** Let my parents cover everything, which they also offered to do. Feel sick to my stomach about my parent's financial well-being and wasting my grandpa's inheritance for the next 15 months. Ideally, I would take *at least* the living expenses part as a loan and pay them back fully for that part once I start working. 

* **Option 3:** Defer my program until my husband can come with me and cover everything. I don't like this option because even though he is fine supporting me, I don't want to take his hard-earned money away either, and that's another year at a draining, low-paying corporate job and another year in a city with incredibly high rent and living expenses. It often feels like we are throwing money down the toilet to live here.

Does my first option seem rational to an outsider? Is this guilt warranted or should I just shut up and take the money? I know I sound like a tool, but I have been losing sleep and very anxious over the idea that my parents lose out on a high quality of life with lots of traveling and other things they enjoy all because I decided to get a second degree. 

Thanks!

**TL,DR:** My parents want to cover my second degree $50k + living expenses for 10 months until my husband can join me and take over the living expenses part. They are very well-off and have no financial concerns whatsoever, but I feel very guilty about taking it and worry about their quality of life in retirement. I am also a grown woman and it was my choice to go back. I would like to know if it is reckless to take out loans to cover part of it instead of just accepting their help.",finance

personalfinance,Move part of E-fund to Roth IRA savings?,"I'm contemplating moving part of my emergency fund into a Roth IRA savings account with a bank. 

I currently contribute all of my retirement savings pre-tax. I'm on track with the public service loan forgiveness, with about 7 years left. Contributing everything pre tax reduces my monthly payment on the IBR plan. I'm on track to max my 401k this year. I also have the opportunity to contribute to a 457 plan, which I haven't maxed yet, but I'm working on. I also max my HSA.

I have my emergency fund in my checking account. My dad brings a lot of business to my current bank, so they gave my siblings and I high interest checking accounts. My current interest rate is 1.5%.

I'm eyeing this Roth IRA from Ally. https://www.ally.com/bank/ira/online-savings-account/ It has a 1.35% interest rate. That's lower than my current rate, but higher after taxes. Here's the pros and cons I see from both:

Pros

- Higher after tax rate

- I would have a higher Roth basis after I finish my PSLF loans in 7 years. So I could roll it into an actual retirement account, if I chose to.

Cons 

- More accounts to manage

- Subject to the savings account withdrawal rules

- IRS filing requirements if I ever withdraw

personalfinance,Inter family mortgage,"My parents have great saving skills. Unfortunately, they fear all types of investing and even fear loans.

I am thinking this is because I got a raise in mid October. I went from 71k - 90k. So because I started the year with a 90k salary vs 71k, I am in a higher bracket and I would have actually been getting less, but this new tax law kept me in the same bracket that I was at the end of last year, so I’m getting pretty much the same on my check.

personalfinance,Is filing married/separate worth foregoing Roth IRA contributions in my case?,"Straight to the numbers. I’m married. First tax season as a married couple. 

My base salary is $96,500 and I owe around $7000 in federal student loans. I’m on the 10 year plan but will pay back much sooner - not concerned about these. 

Wife makes $47,000 and owes $117,000 in fed student loans. She is currently in PSLF route and has been for 2 years, but has potential to jump to private sector for a large raise (not sure exact numbers but probably at least a 30K bump). 

We planned to file separate because her minimum payments under the PSLF route are around $200 per month. On top of that we pay about $700 per month 100% towards the lowest balance loan.

If we file joint, her minimum payments jump to $900 and I assume (correct me if I’m wrong) that we would have no ability to direct those payments. She has 7 individual loans all varying between 4K-23K. 

She doesn’t know for sure if she will stay in the PSLF route for 10 years or if she will jump private sector. That’s why I want to be able to pay down her loans. 

Right now I’m maxing out my Roth IRA, but I understand if I file separate I lose the ability to contribute. 

So my question is this, is the ability to direct all my excess payments to the specific loans of my choosing (snowball method) worth foregoing the benefits of Roth contributions?  

Side note: filing separate our net tax liability is $300, and filing joint we would get a refund of $1000. In the context of my other questions, this difference is negligible IMO. Again, may be wrong about this.",finance

I’m about to get a phone from work which will become my primary and my personal cell phone will barely be used from now on. So I kind of want to pay it off ASAP so that I can pause/cancel my plan with my provider depending on how much I use it. If I don’t pay it off now and I still pause my service, I’ll be paying a monthly payment for a phone which isn’t even active. That said, there is no interest the cell phone payment, so perhaps it’s a smarter idea to put the entire tax return on the credit card? Let me know what you think. 

**Income:** Roughly $1400 every two weeks. Can be closer to $1800-$2000 depending on how much OT I get, and this will vary every single month. 

**Bills/debt:**

* Bank of America credit card: $100 minimum payment ($4,347.68 owed) (15.49% interest)

* Car payment: $121.76 (5.28% interest, $7,783.66 owed) every two weeks (Used to be $243.51 once a month, but I changed it to make my first paycheck of the month stretch a bit further -- seems like it’s paying off slightly less principal though so I don’t know if it’s worth it in the long run?)

* Phone bill: $66.75 (will be $25 once I pay off the phone, and may be $5 for device protection only if I pause the service once I get my work phone) (Owe $620 for the phone itself)

* Student loan 1 (Peaks): $102.20 (11.5% interest) ($3,590.09 owed)
 
* Student loan 2 (Peaks): $36.29 (11.5% interest) ($1,274.94 owed)

* Student loan 3 (Navient):  $60.93 ($32,273.40 owed) (Actually built up of 8 individual loans with interest rates varying between 4.25%, 5.75%, and 6.55%) (setup on income based repayment currently)

**Other expenses:**

* ~$120 gas per month (I drive a lot for work)

* I spend at least $300 in food per month or more (I am not responsible)

* I have a serious problem with impulse buying whatever video game my friends are playing at the time. I wind up spending at least $100 a month on games in some way, sometimes a lot more…  (I am not responsible). To some degree, I think spending money on games each month is going to be unavoidable. I don't go out often so this is almost the entirety of what I spend on myself for fun. But I'd like to give myself an entertainment budget per month and challenge myself not to exceed it. I don't know what that budget should be given my new income and debt situation. 

* I am not good about keeping track of what I spend on my cat. I believe I spend at least $50 a month on him for food by itself (wet food). I don’t keep track of money spent on cat litter. 

* $120 per month for other health expenses (I have a condition)

That’s about it for now. My situation isn’t *too extreme*. It’s manageable for sure. But I don’t know how best to handle my money and I’d love any help you all could provide so that I can get my situation straightened out. 

Thanks!

The problem is that the loan has a variable interest rate because they don't let foreigners take out an equity loan with a fixed interest rate, and, with the US dollar steadily getting weaker, I've been having to send more in USD each month.

personalfinance,"Real Estate Appraisal Higher than Expected, Looking for Advice","I'm in the process of securing a loan on an investment property that I purchased through an LLC in Chicago, IL. I paid cash for the property, so there's no outstanding mortgage.

Initially, I intended to use the capital to finance a major renovation to the unit. The lender I am working with caps the LTV at 80%. Prior to the appraisal, I began to have concerns that the property would not appraise for more than $75k (I was seeking $60k for the loan) and I decided I would scale back the renovation and only make cosmetic improvements. Today I learned that the property appraised at $115k, meaning I can take out more money than I initially planned.

Would it be totally reckless for me to take out a larger loan amount and use that money as a down payment for a multi-family building? Chicago's real estate market is surprisingly affordable and I have confidence in future rental growth, but I don't want to over leverage myself. I own a own home (outstanding mortgage), actively investing in mutual funds, and have okay savings, but I am not rich by any stretch. I have no other debt outside my primary residence's mortgage and whatever money I take out against the investment property.

The lender has offered a 20 year amortization schedule, with the interest rate starting at 4.8% for the first five years and increasing to the prevailing Wall St Journal Prime Interest Rate plus 1/2%. The rate would further increase every 3 after year 5 to match the Wall St. Journal Prime Interest Rate plus 1/2%. Even though I've accepted the 20 year amortization schedule, the goal is to repay the loan in 15 years (~$500 per month). I'm expecting the unit to rent for ~$1k per month.",finance

I am living very comfortably with a good amount of money leftover from each paycheck from my full-time job and expect to be at this job for the next few years.

I am making regular contributions to my 401k through my employer and plan on opening up an IRA and maxing it out with my inheritance.

My big questions are this: I want to get a car this year and already have it priced out, but I don't know if I should pay it off completely or if I should pay off a large sum of it and get a loan for the rest. I don't really like the idea of having any debt so it is kind of scary to me to have to get a loan...

My second question: What should I do with the leftover? I'm definitely planning on traveling, but I want to do it with my boyfriend and I don't want to make him broke going on an expensive vacation, so it'll probably be something we do several months from now. (I also don't want to spend all of the remainder on a vacation!) I am considering opening a money market account, but I don't know if there might be a better option with a higher interest rate. I would say I am a medium to low risk investor and don't feel super comfortable investing into stocks.

personalfinance,Tax question when filing as clergy - confusion on W2,"Hi All,

Tax question here. Filing as clergy/minister and some things are confusing me. Outlined Scenario below:

Scenario: Working 2 different job positions with 1 single employer, providing a single W2. First job is worked Months January – End of July. Second position begins August-EOY. First job position is taxed as normal W4 employee – federal tax, SS tax, and Medicare tax withheld from earnings. Let’s say for example that $10K was earned for job 1. 

Second job title is considered “clergy” and so there is self-employment tax. “Housing allowance” can also be claimed such that the housing allowance portion is not subject to federal tax. Ex: if Base Salary is $30,000 USD, Claim $10K as housing allowance. This ends up being reported in box 14 of W2. $10K is not taxed at federal tax rate, but $20K is. Meanwhile, for the second job, no social security tax or Medicare tax is deducted from paychecks. I believe that self-employment tax is what pays for this. This is calculated using schedule SE using the formula: (Box 1 from W2 + Housing allowance) x .9235 x .153 = Self-employment tax) Using numbers from above, box 1 will read $10K from job 1 and $20K from job 2 = $30K. Since everything is on a single W2, SE tax would be calculated as $40K x .9235 x .153 = $5652. However in my opinion the SE tax should only apply to job 2 position, which would only be $30K x .9235 x .153 = $4238. 

My question is, how to differentiate the income from job 1 vs job 2? The income from job 1 should not be subject to SE tax because it was already taxed SS and Medicare. However, because both incomes from the two different positions are both included in box 1 of W2, I feel that SE tax calculation is coming out too high. I am also thinking that maybe the IRS doesn’t care about that, and SE is calculated on the whole total from both positions. But if that is the case, shouldn’t the SS and medicare tax already paid reduce the self-employment tax owed? How do you reflect this on 1040?

Thanks for the help!",finance
personalfinance,Perkins Loan Collections,"So I've been stupid and ignoring my Perkins loan. Well yesterday I received a call and a letter in my mail that it has been passed onto collections. I know that I can't pay the amount that they're requesting and I had read in other threads that working with them can get it reduced (which I might be able to pay).

The biggest question that I have at the moment is related to when the loan moved to collections. My last payment was July 17'. It moved to collections after about 7 months. I had read online somewhere that for federal loans they couldn't default on them until after 270 days [link](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/glossary#Default). Does anyone know if this applies to the Perkins loan? Is there anything I can do with this to get it brought back to the original creditor and not in the hands of the collection agency?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks!


***EDIT***

Hmmmm just found [this](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/default), so I may be screwed with the 270 days thing:

If your loan continues to be delinquent, the loan may go into default. The point when a loan is considered to be in default varies depending on the type of loan you received.

For a loan made under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program or the Federal Family Education Loan Program, you’re considered to be in default if you don’t make your scheduled student loan payments for a period of at least 270 days (about nine months).

For a loan made under the Federal Perkins Loan Program, the holder of the loan may declare the loan to be in default if you don’t make any scheduled payment by the due date. Find out where to go for information about your Perkins Loan.",finance

personalfinance,Question about student loans and REPAYE,"My wife is a physician starting her new job this Fall and will be making about $140k a year. I will be in medical school for the next four years. Overall, we owe approximately $400k in student loans, which will grow to about $700k by the time I graduate.

We are currently on the REPAYE plan, which subsidizes all unpaid interest for the first three years and then 50% of unpaid interest after that. REPAYE loan minimum payments are limited to 10% of our joint income.

My wife's income is not high enough for our monthly payments to exceed the monthly interest on our student loans, and we would basically have to spend every post-tax dollar on student loan repayment to even touch the principle. So right now, we are paying exclusively the minimum payment.

The issue is that we do have some left over income at the end of every month which we want to spend on loan repayment. But since it would just be paying the rest of the interest that the minimum payment doesn't cover, we are hesitant - especially since the federal government is subsidizing that unpaid interest anyways and we would never get close to touching the principle. It's basically like us just throwing money out that the federal government would have picked up the tab on anyways.

We have a mortgage right now which is about 4%, which is lower than our student loans which are 6%. So we are thinking of just spending the extra left over income and putting it into our mortgage, which interest-wise doesn't make sense since the student loans are higher interest, but does make sense when considering the extra payment would cover interest on the student loan that the government is paying anyways.

Just wanted to hear your thoughts and get confirmation that this thought process makes sense or doesn't make sense. Thanks.",finance
personalfinance,Buy now or wait one more year?,"I'm 32 and my fiance is 35. Last year's W2's showed we made a combined ~72k after taxes. We've been renting the same house for the last 5 years, and in October last year, the agency that owns the home sold it to another and our rent is going up from $1140 to $1375. We figure it's time to start looking at a buying our first home. We will be married in November. My credit score is 745 and hers is 680. I have a car loan with $11k left, a couple of credit cards totaling $2500 and she has a couple cards at about $1000. Over Christmas I was given a gift of $4k from my parents as back payment for all the times I've helped them out over the years. That money went into savings, which totals $5600 right now. I'm getting an $800 return in taxes and she is getting about $5600(2 kids), making our saving grow to $11,200.  
Our big dilemma is what to do. Do we use that money to pay off the truck and ride out our lease for the next year(already signed starts in March but can break at any time without penalty other than surrendering deposits) and save for the next year? Do we push forward on buying a house now? Our saving practices and luck(injuries/job changes/random unwanted expense) don't  have me convinced we could save  up another $10k in a year without the truck payment being gone. Housing has gone up 4-6% in our area last year and interest rates are going to go up.    
We were told if we pay off all the cards it will hurt us when/if we go to an underwriter within the next couple of months due to the credit scores would be taking a hit. We are ok on waiting another year, but is it worth it? How much will prices and interest rates change by this time 2019?

To help protect you from scams, phishing attempts, hacks, manipulation and social engineering, we thought to take a moment to prepare this guide to better educate you as our valued member on what to watch out for online and how to best secure your account, funds, coins and tokens.

How to Ensure You are Secure

▪ If you have not already done so, please seriously consider enabling Google Two-factor Authentication on both your email and QuadrigaCX account as it provides the highest level of security. Since your email account is a gateway to resetting passwords, hackers usually target this first to gain access to all important accounts tied to your email. However, if you have Google 2FA installed on your mobile device and enabled on your email and QuadrigaCX accounts, it's almost impossible for a hacker to gain entry without both your login credentials and the 2FA code which is displayed on your mobile device. You can enable Google 2FA from within your QuadrigaCX Profile Settings: **(redacted)**

▪ It's best to always navigate to **(redacted)** by typing it in your address bar or clicking a bookmark of the URL that you have previously saved. Typing directly or using a bookmark will help give you peace-of-mind that you are always on the official QuadrigaCX site and not a spoofed version created by a hacker in an attempt to compromise your Client ID, Password, Transaction PIN and Withdrawal Confirmation Code

▪ If you receive an email from what looks to be ""QuadrigaCX"" as the sender's name, please take a moment to ensure the email domain address is actually ours which ends in @quadrigacx.com where there are no typos in the name ""quadrigacx"" and that the extension is "".com"". We do not use "".org"", "".net"", etc. and will never ask to update your account by completing an online form to avoid your account from being frozen. If you receive one of these phishing emails, it means your email address was found online or it was part of a list bought from another site's data breach where you used the same email.

▪ There are legitimate referral/affiliate marketers advertising QuadrigaCX online but please be cautious when clicking on paid search ads as scammers have been known to run campaigns with similar but false QuadrigaCX domain URLs that lead to a spoof site in an attempt to compromise your Client ID, Password, Transaction PIN and Withdrawal Confirmation Code to withdraw your funds. Always review the domain URL in the address bar to ensure you are on **(redacted)** where there are no typos in the name ""quadrigacx"" and that the extension is "".com"". We do not use "".org"", "".net"", etc. and will never use a hyphen in our domain address; which is typically used by scammers to make it look like a subdomain or another section of our site

▪ We will never ask for your Transaction PIN or email you a Withdrawal Confirmation Code upon login, the system will only ask you to enter this information if you are funding or withdrawing from your account. If you are prompted to enter Transaction PIN and Withdrawal Confirmation Code upon login, you are likely on a spoof site where a hacker is stealing your credentials to gain access to your account

▪ Always use an unique password for your QuadrigaCX account. Do not use the same password you have on any other online account. If one of the site's that you have an account with is hacked and your data, including your password, gets compromised, then the hackers will attempt to use that same password to login to other accounts where they can steal funds from

▪ Be cautious and weary of browser extension you install intentionally, or even unintentionally by clicking on foreign links, as there are rogue extensions that can alter the content of a page by changing the wallet address displayed to an address controlled by a scammer. The best solution is to only install extensions you completely trust, remove any you are unfamiliar with, or browse with Google Chrome’s Incognito mode where all extensions are disabled by default. Common rogue extensions are ad blockers and weather alerts

▪ Enable Activity Notifications on your account to receive an email from us every time there is a Successful Login, Failed Login or Withdrawal Request. Contained within Activity Notification emails you will see details about the activity including IP Address, Device, Browser, Operating System, Date/Time of the event and a ""Freeze Your Account Immediately"" link which gives you the opportunity to freeze the account, including withdrawals, and request an investigation. You can enable notifications here: **(redacted)**

▪ We will never call you and ask for sensitive login or withdrawal information like passwords or transactions PINs over the phone, nor will we ask you to click on a link to give us remote access to your computer

▪ Do not mark/report any emails from us as spam because if you do you will not be able to receive any of these important emails, activity notifications or responses from our Support Centre ticketing system

We trust this guide has helped enlighten you and most importantly, help you keep your hard earned funds out of the hands of criminals. Please do yourself a favour by enabling Google 2FA on both your email and QuadrigaCX accounts and be mindful of all the aforementioned tips to stay secure.

personalfinance,"When an employer does not withhold enough federal/state/local taxes, who is liable?","I seem to have found myself in a bit of a pickle this tax season. I live in PA if that helps. Now down to the nitty gritty:

- I worked two jobs in 2017 and made ~$27.3k
- At my previous job I made a total of ~$11.8k and they only withheld 6% of my gross pay for taxes. 
- At my current job I made ~$15.5k and all the taxes there are on the up and up. 
- At previous job they also slipped a decimal when taking out local taxes so instead of taking out the expected flat 1% rate, they took out only .1%.
- My state taxes are a little screwed up with my previous job, but I broke even with that ($1 refund) so I'm not as concerned. 

So at this point I'm doing my taxes and it shows that my entire almost 1k federal refund went to paying the taxes that were missed, and I still owe $200 in federal taxes on top of that. There is also the issue of the slipped decimal in my local taxes. Now I've tried to contact my old employer, but have not heard back from them yet. When they do get back to me, who is responsible for the taxes owed? Am I still responsible for this money or does my previous employer have to pay it? Do I have any hope of getting a refund or should I just expect the $200 owed to be covered? With my local taxes being screwed up, the amount owed will be ~$100 as well. What should I expect with this? 

I have been struggling financially this year and really banking on my refund to cover some unexpected medical/dental costs (I know this is dumb), and I don't know how I'm going to just randomly come up with an extra $300 out of thin air when I live paycheck to paycheck already.

So I just checked my wife's credit report and she's literally paid everything either off or on time ever since she's had credit, like she's real anal about it. 

She has student loan though. And although she's never been late, she was wondering if she could lower the monthly payment amount. 

So long story short, she found this company (that we currently forgot the name of) that will reportedly refinance her loan and give her a lower payment (I think that's how they explained it). Anyways, for as long as she was paying these new people I think $49 a month, FedLoan kept calling her cause they were reporting her 30+ days late, 60+ days late and so on until 180+ date late. So they threatened her about turning her over and she decided to call these new people and they finally fessed up that only $9 of the $49 was going towards her FedLoan so she was accumulating delinquency (because she was under paying)for 180+ days late multiple times. I can only guess how much this ruined her near perfect credit. 

So I'm asking the community if there is anything that yall know about that we could do in fixing her credit to get those delinquencies removed? Or reporting these people or something?

personalfinance,Need help deciding what to do with $11k USD.,"Hi everyone!

A little background: I'm a mid-thirties Male. I have $11k left over from a inheritance after my mother passed away. I've been holding onto it in an account earning .75% interest as a 'rainy day' fund. My SO and I have been doing really well living within our means and that doesn't seem to be changing any time soon. I'm a chef, well employed, and have been for the last 15 years. My vehicle is paid off, rent is paid on time, credit score sits in the high 790's, no debt other than student loans.

I've already decided I'm going to do something with this money and narrowed it down to 3 choices:

1 - I want to open my own restaurant someday soon, and while $11K isn't much, it will help quite a bit.  Are there some means of investment for the short term (~5 years) with the best return? and what  kind of return could I see out of it? EDIT: I've been in the industry for 15 years, have worked as every position a restaurant has to offer and have opened multiple restaurants for other people. I just want to stop working for other people, eventually.

2 - Invest in a Roth or some other retirement plan. I don't have anything except $4K sitting in a 401k from a previous job. If I get a job in the future that offers 401k, I'll transfer that over there, but right now, I have nothing planned for when I get older. 

3 - Pay off some student loans. A 4 year degree and a Culinary School education were expensive. I can take out pretty much all of the my private loans from culinary school with this sum. It sits at nearly a 8.5% interest rate, and wiping that out might be my best bet. I'll still be saddled with another $17k in student loans, but those have much lower interest rates (~3-4%).


I'm pretty clueless when it comes to this stuff, so any help is appreciated.",finance

The new lender told me about a portfolio ARM that his company is offering. It's a 20 year mortgage 1% down at a 2.75% interest rate for 5 years then has a 2% annual cap with a lifeline cap of 7.75%. The second offer helps build up to 22k more in equity when compared to an FHA after 5 years before the variable rate hits. Does this sound like a good idea?

personalfinance,"After filing my taxes I discovered I was marked for offset, I filed for consolidation is there any way I can get my return.","UPDATE 2/8/2018: I stayed up all last night and found out the most direct number to call was through a site called ""My eddebt"" and that my loan was ultimately handled by them. After an automated service I was connected to a very nice woman who explained that currently there is no way to avoid the offset and rather only to get it back, and that if I was homeless that wouldn't be applicable. However if I have a current eviction notice within 30 days of them taking my tax return they will release the amount for that eviction to me. While its a small victory it at least gives me hope that should I not be able to find sufficient funding in the meantime, I can guarantee me and my family a little more time. Also through consolidation the offset will be removed within 60 days and again while this does me no good now I am urging anybody who even thinks that they may have debt or something they're unaware of to login to ""MyFSA"" and see if there is anything in default. 

 I am a 21 year old (f) Cancer Patient who has a disability. My student loan bills for one of my loans were being sent to the wrong address and I never realized that I was missing them. I had wrongly assumed that I was still in the grace period so I never bothered to wonder why I wasn't getting bills.  I found this out earlier this week and this evening sent in the e-app to consolidate my loans with an IBR through FedLoan. The total amount that is due is 20,000 and I am unsure how much was in default but I'm assuming the worst. My tax return was filed on Feb 2nd. 

 Needless to say I don't make very much money, I am responsible completely for my disabled father and my little sister and I am expecting a return of about 3,700 which would cover our rent and expenses and allow me to continue cancer treatment. 

Is there anybody I can speak to or anything I can do from here to prevent my return being taken. I know that its down to my mistake and distractions that this has happened but If I have to come up with money or anything I will do it, if I don't get this refund me and my family are going to be on the streets by the end of March and I am terrified. 

The IBR repayment showed me as paying 0 dollars a month for 10 years. I'm not sure what other information may be relevant but this is certainly a financial hardship.

From everything I can find online it says I should've received notice that they were going to flag my account for offset and give me 65 days to contest but I again never recieved this, and I don't know this is by fault of my own or not updating an address properly. 

 When I contacted the number which allows you to find out if your taxes will be offset, I was told I had 1 debt, that it *may* be offset and I'm assuming in this context that *may* is as good as will. 

In my taxes I filed as Head of Household, and I did include my disability and I was eligible for the student credit as I am enrolled in community college. 

What can I do please help. Thanks for your time reading I am sorry for formatting or scattered thoughts I am just honestly in an incredible panic.",finance

I'm asking specifically about your emergency fund - the cash that will never be invested.

I'm sort of FI....not by choice. I'm dealing with some medical/disability issues. I'd like to return to work, but I don't know if it will be possible. I'm planning my finances around the worst case scenario that I never work again just in case. I received a windfall (lawsuit settlement) a few years ago and now have a net worth of $2.6MM.

60%+ of it is still in cash, so I haven't really had to worry too much about short-term cash issues. I've just been moving money into my checking account from one of my higher yielding cash vehicles when necessary.

In the future, I expect to be more heavily invested. But, I don't know how much of my net worth I should set aside and not invest at all.

Everything I've heard about emergency funds is catered toward people that are working, so I keep reading the same 3-9 months of expenses. I'm guessing that window is designed to give people wiggle room so that they can find a new job and get a new steady stream of earned income. But I'm already not working...I'm already living in the ""emergency"" time.


I'm spending $30k right now a year which includes all my expenses from rent, insurance, food, etc.. But I expect this number to go up in the future. I'm living too frugally and really need to try and enjoy life more. 

I also would like to buy a house in the next few years. The only thing stopping me currently is that I move around too much. I've never bought a house before, but I was thinking of allocating $500k to this. With interest rates rising, a mortgage might not be that attractive by the time I'm ready to buy.",finance

CryptoCurrency,PSA: What to know about Crypto purchases on Debit / Credit / Bank,"__PSA: I AM PRESENTING YOU WITH THE LATEST INFORMATION ON HOW BANKS ARE TREATING CRYPTOCURRENCY PURCHASES THROUGH ALL METHODS (CREDIT, DEBIT, BANK). PLEASE READ THIS, I AM SICK OF READING MISINFORMED POSTS FROM FINANCIALLY ILLITERATE PEOPLE SUCH AS THOSE THAT BELIEVE CREDIT CARD PURCHASE BANS ARE WRONG AND EVIL__


__FIRST, I HAVE BREAKING (GOOD) NEWS !__

__Coinbase Direct Bank Purchases:__  Some users have been reporting that Coinbase has introduced an option to purchase Cryptos via your linked and verified bank account INSTANTLY--THAT'S RIGHT--INSTANTLY! Bank buys are a far lower fee so this is great for us anyways. 

Yay.

__Debit:__  As of a week ago, Chase has been confirmed to charge a NON-ATM CASH FEE on Debit Card buys!  The fee is $10 or 5%, whichever is higher!

THIS IS A REASON TO CALL YOUR BANK AND COMPLAIN! DEBIT CARDS SHOULD NOT BE CHARGED AN ADDITIONAL FEE--IT IS OUR MONEY, IT IS NOT LENDED, WE SHOULD BE FREE TO SPEND AS WE WISH!!!

IF YOU CALL CHASE AND LET THEM KNOW YOU ARE PISSED OFF FOR NOT BEING NOTIFIED ABOUT SUCH A CHARGE, THEY WILL REFUND YOU THE FEE.

__Credit:__  As we all know by now, or should know, Credit Card purchases of Cryptocurrencies are now considered a CASH ADVANCE.  

Why?  Crypto markets are volatile, this is a massive risk for someone that is lending you money to spend (Chase, Citi, BofA). Why would they allow you to purchase Cryptos on credit if the market is so risky--think of all the people that may have defaulted on their credit in the past few days.  THIS IS FAIR IT MAKES SENSE, LENDERS MUST BE OFFERED A RISK PREMIUM! Think about it, would you lend your little brother $10,000 to buy cryptos at zero or low interest rates? NO.  You may ask, why not charge us Purchase interest rates on Credit Card Crypto buys?  Same reason, purchase interest is deemed too low of a Risk Premium for banks to take on, so they charge you CASH ADVANCE. (i.e. 12% purchase vs 23% cash advance)

CryptoCurrency,Crypto Adoption Survey Netherlands,"A survey agency in the Netherlands questioned some 44000 households about their Crypto holdings. (link to dutch site, use a translator if you cant read it. 
http://www.tns-nipo.com/nieuws/persberichten/aantal-nederlandse-beleggers-cryptovaluta-geexplod )

**Results show**

* Increase from 135k to 580k people that invested in crypto between August 2017 and Jan 2018 (A 400% increase, but on a adult (15+)population of some 14 million, so from about about 1% to 4%).

* Invested amount is defensive, with only 25% investing more than 1000EUR. That is higher than what it was in august, when just 15% invested more than 1000EUR.

* Estimated is that the total invested in Cryptos of all savings by all households is ~0.1%. 

* Overall the profits are dissapointing, where roughly 25% report green numbers. That is down from 49% reporting green numbers in August 2017. This is likely the result of the December boom/bust cycle.

* Demographics show that they are a-typical investors; Young, mostly higher educated people. Older generations (38-51y) hold barely any crypto's compared to younger ones.

**My personal take on this**

This is a survey in a single 1st world country that has a history/profile of being cheap and conservative in finance. It is therefor not possible to extrapolate anything direcly for the world at large. However, the numbers give us some indications.

- The amount of people currenty investing in Cryptos is small (&lt;4%). This is a small part of the population and leaves a lot of room for increasing interest. Many people may still be sitting on the fence, especially after the December/january cycle. 

- The percentage of household savings is 0.1%. That is extremely low. An increase to 1% alone would result in 10x money inflow. Interest rates are extremely low, stock markets are uncertain. Even mainstream media is running articles about another crash/resession/depression even. This may keep people from putting money towards stocks, and instead into crypto (speculation on my part, may just as well buy gold or keep the cash in hand).

- Young people have shown to be early adopters in the technology age. Email, social media, chat apps etc. And where they create an ecosystem, the older generations follow. As the older generations hold more money, and may seek to secure or diversify their traditional stock investments, this may be put towards crypto's.

Are we the early adopters? 

Yes, I believe so.

Was the December 2017 peak the crypto bubble bursting?

I don't believe so, and the numbers from the survey show that there is a whole lot more potential interest. 2018 may very well be the year of the 'real' crypto bubble.




**Edit:** 

I did some additional calcs to work out how much is actually invested by these households.

- The total saving balances of all households in the Netherlands was ~340 Billion at the beginning of 2017. 
- Figures on total worth of stocks etc is harder to pin down, but some figures gave a total of 1.4 million persons investing, and at most 6% of the household worth in such investments. To actually make some sense I have made some generous assumptions.
- The majority of the household worth is locked up in the house value, which is assuming at the average house price of ~225k EUR.
- 6% of that value would be around 13500 EUR in stock per person, what would total to 1.4M x 13500 = 18.9 Billion invested.

Summing those yields 340B + 18.9B = 358.9B total private worth.
0.1% of that is 358.9 Million.

Now some analyst (sorry, can't find the link) came up with a figure that it only took 6 Billion in fiat to generate a Crypto market cap of 500 Billion or so (this has to do with how the valuation works).

If a small country (by population) with an adoption rate of 4% pumps 358.9 Million into crypto (~6% of the 6 Billion), what will happen if larger countries start gaining adoption and investing more of their total worth?
800 Billion market cap may seem low by that time...",cryptocurrency

financialindependence,A cautionary tale on active investing,"Hi all,
Just wanted to share my story to illustrate how important it is to stay the course.

I used to be a volatility trader.  That is, up until 2 days ago.

For those of you who are unacquainted with the short vol trade, it's essentially a bet that the S&amp;P 500, the heart of the US economy, will stay calm or regain equilibrium after a shakeup.  It's amazingly profitable due to the natural mean reversion property of the VIX, and tailwinds from the way several of the volatility ETPs are structured.  Sounds solid, yes?  I thought so too.

100% of the time in the past, after a volatility event, products like XIV and SVXY would suffer a large drawdown, and then after some resolution is reached with the original catalyst (or enough time has passed, volatility gets crushed).  VIX futures begin to fall soon after to catch up with spot, and within mere weeks, XIV/SVXY recovers to its original price and then some!  So, buying on these dips and holding until a recovery became a rudimentary strategy that piqued many others' interests, and spawned a plethora of well-backtested indicators, algorithms, systems, a subreddit, really an entire community.  For many of us, including myself, our systems *were* the hedge.

The last week or two, volatility had been steadily rising in response to multiple recent events, and so I averaged down exactly as how my strategy would have me do, buying large chunks of XIV at what seemed to be support points.  By the time XIV was down to 122, I had run out of cash.  I was all in - not that it mattered, of course it would recover well beyond where it started - after all, it has done this *every single time* since the introduction of VIX futures 15 years ago.  To be fair, there were some warning signs such as an objectively terrible futures curve shape and the volatility of volatility products themselves.  I had overridden those signals in my system to chase the dip, against my better judgment!

All that changed Monday afternoon, right after 4 PM.  The price went from 99 to 20, all in a matter of 15 minutes after the closing bell, where no stop loss could have helped.  The indicative value of XIV was reported as being 4.22, an absurdly low number we all thought was a mistake at the time.  Turns out there was no mistake.  Both Feb and March VIX futures spiked up an unprecedented 110%, which never even happened during the Great Recession.  This basically destroyed short vol products in one fell swoop.  My final losses were 97%.

After I calmed down enough to think straight, I did some back-of-the-napkin math.  If I had simply taken the chunk of money earmarked for active trading, dumped it into VTSAX, and forgotten it existed, I'd be up $25k right now.  Instead, I'm down $56k.  More than an entire year's worth of working hard and frugally saving, obliterated.  8% erased from my FI/RE progress.

So, there you go.  As far as traders go, I'm probably a fair bit more sophisticated than your average mom-n-pop trend chaser.  I had deep knowledge of the products I was trading.  I've done my due diligence on the risks, created a risk model, quantified them, used that to create a system... but in the end, none of it helped.

I still don't know where I'm going after this.  Short vol is still a solid trade but it became immensely more risky in my eyes now since as the tail risk exposure feels much more real.  I expect the volatility complex itself to stay more volatile until the trade gets less crowded, and the market as a whole becomes healthier (consider that 74% of growth in the past 9 years came from corporate stock buybacks, purchased with money raised from debt offerings, only made possible by the absurdly low interest rates).

What should most people take away from this story?

**The stock market will shit on your face when you try to get smart with it.  Buy VTSAX and forget anything else exists.**

For myself, I don't know if I can go back after being redpilled.  I'm considering a core position of 80% /ES and 20% /ZN futures, rebalancing on a regular basis, and substitute with UPRO/TMF in places where I can't do futures.  I think my volatility trading system still has value, but I would use it with MUCH smaller allocations and hedged with far OTM VIX calls.

Thanks for listening.



**EDIT:**

Thanks for all the comments and feedback everybody.  I am a bit thrown off kilter by how unsupportive the majority of comments are... I'm just trying to show people what could happen if you get too cocky and greedy with a high-risk-high-reward trade, and that it's definitely not for everybody.  I just lost a ton, I realize I made mistakes, can you get off my case now?  If everybody who posts a cautionary tale gets insulted and downvoted they might as well not bother posting at all.

- Many are saying the strategy was fundamentally stupid to start with, but I feel like they literally don't understand the mechanics behind the trade and how to hedge risk.  I guess you think Citadel/Two Sigma/Jane Street/etc. are all stupid too? Look up who the top holders of XIV were.  I keep using that word 'hedge' over and over again, but, that was really the only thing needed to turn what was a total blowout into a minor setback.

- Another misconception people keep saying is that the prospectus plainly states the long-term EV of all volatility products is 0; keep in mind I do not hold these things long term.  I knew this, but XIV/SVXY aren't as much of a hot potato as you might expect due to the way it works and some properties of its underlying holdings, e.g. the lag between a spike in spot vix and a respective rise in the corresponding futures.  A key to this is because of greed I ignored the warning signs.

- Stop losses don't work overnight.  The reason for not getting out before EOD is because you'd otherwise be missing out on the majority of the movement which kinda defeats the purpose.

- Risk management is key, obviously.  My allocation was well justified; following the Kelly criterion would have me all-in, even when overstating the probability of a total loss.  The amount I lost hurt for sure, but it was the tractor, not the farm.",finance

MachineLearning,[D] Dynamic routing by feedback activation maximization,"I'm wondering if there has been any work done on CNNs with each filter pooler trying to match a (scalar) value fed back from the most immediate downstream neuron, where this feedback value is ultimately anchored to some cost function on the top layer. I'm imagining a simple architecture where the goal is to derive the type of ""inverse graphics"" transformation that Hinton speaks of. The top layer feedback values could even be some affine transformation of the input data.

The trickling down of activation values would be performed in iterations and in a diffusion process induce a kind of dynamic routing with neighboring filters forced to agree upon a constellation of transformations.

One thing that this article is missing is [This Chart](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_i47TEqZoAbw/TOW3YEXmVBI/AAAAAAAAAug/INVqbbrXLko/s1600/Treasury+Interest+Rate+History.jpg) Showing the bond yields over the last century. Remember this article was written in 1977 when bonds would get you 7 or 8% yield! This really made stocks less interesting. Contrast that to before, when the interest rates were quite low (2-4%) and everyone piled on into stocks (we don't need dividends! Just reinvest with those beautiful 12% corporate returns). 

Compare that cycle to now where interest rates are historically low and stocks are very attractive. However, the stock market seems to be wary of inflation and subsequent rising interest rates",finance

personalfinance,How to determine what to withhold on W4?,"Hello,

After crunching the numbers using two tax softwares, we owe a few thousand dollars to the Feds, while getting some back to the state, but will still ultimately have to pay about $4,000. 

This is largely due to under withholding on our W4s after changing jobs in 2017. Midyear I took on a new job that jumped my income about $25,000 and my wife took on one that jumped her income about $8,000. Both softwares said we owe about $8,000 to the Federal government and somehow getting about $4,000 back from the State.

My question is, how do we go and figure out what to withhold for 2018 so we can avoid this in the future? In 2017 we both had marked down ""1"" on our W4s and have since switched it to ""0"" after this discovery. But I honestly don't fully understand how it works. I just don't want to get slammed again next year.  Any advice is appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,Should I roll my TSP over into my personal Roth IRA?,"I recently spent about a year working at a federal government agency, during which time I maximized my contribution to the employer-sponsored retirement plan, the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). I had previously opened a Roth IRA and was making contributions there too. After a year I left the government job and started working at a private sector consulting firm, where I continued maxing out my contribution to my Roth IRA (my new job doesn't allow employees to contribute to a 401(k) until they've been working for 6 months). Obviously, my contributions to the TSP plan ceased when I changed jobs last summer.

I got the form 1099 for my TSP account, which reminded me to check the balance, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that there's $5,600 sitting in there (more than I would've guessed, the employer match really was quite good). Now I'm trying to figure out what to do with that money - should I leave it in the TSP or roll it over into my existing Roth IRA? For context, I'm 25 years old and going back to grad school for public policy this fall, so I would say it's about even odds that I end up working for the federal government again at some point (and thus able to resume contributing to the TSP) but that's not guaranteed. Any thoughts or recommendations on what I should do in this scenario would be appreciated, thanks!",finance

My current payment on a 2016 Subaru WRX is $325/mo, and my insurance is ~$140. I live in New York.

I am looking into buying a much cheaper, reliable care in the realm of $8,000. Because this is a lease, I'm upside down around $2,000.

Would it be worth it to absorb this kind of blow to lower my monthly payments + insurance and actually build equity? Or is it smarter to just ride out the last 12 months, take it as a lesson learned and buy something cheaper when my lease is up?

personalfinance,Mortgage keeps going up because of escrow shortages - what gives?,"Currently paying off a 30-year fixed interest mortgage for my $140k house.  The initial monthly payment was ~$980, which included principle, interest, and PMI (since we put very little down to start with).  A few years ago they raised the monthly to $1,020, telling us that our escrow account had a shortage.  Today we got another notification that it was going up to $1,046, again because of an escrow shortage.  They also mentioned that I can pay the escrow shortage up-front, and our payment would remain the same.

I think I understand the concept of the escrow account, but what I don't understand is - Why don't they just figure out the correct payments up front and give us a stable payment?  To my knowledge everything is fixed up front in our mortgage, so this isn't like a changing interest rate or anything.  Wouldn't it have been a simple matter to do some basic division up front and know to-the-penny what my payments should have been all along?  Or is there something varying over time (that I'm just not aware of) that makes predicting the escrow calculations difficult?

I know there has been some significant changes to the tax system. As of last year, I have recently started maxing out my Roth IRA, and I'm maxing out my 403b as well. 

The first couple paychecks of the year I had enrolled myself in the Roth option for my 403b - but I figured it was best to be tax diversified - AND, I thought that if I switched to the tax-deferred 403b option (Traditional TSP - I work for the feds) - I might end up with a little more cash in my paycheck. So, I switched my Roth TSP back to the traditional TSP.... just in time for the big, tax-law related changes to my paycheck.

Does this mean if I had kept my TSP as the Roth option, would my take home pay have been reduced even further?

Is there any way to change my number of allowances to increase my take-home pay? We're talking over 400 dollars less in my paycheck per month.

Ripple,SWIFT G-10 Central Banks and Ripple,"After watching Brad Garlinghouse's Yahoo interview yesterday, he mentioned that Ripple is working with the Central Bank of England and another central bank yet to be announced. Brad also talked about how they are heavily working with numerous banks in Japan not only for domestic settlement, but also cross-border settlement.

When he started talking about SWIFT being dominated by Citibank and HSBC, it really hammered home to me why big banks are not too keen to replace SWIFT since they are profiting from it.

But then I really stumbled onto something that is the point of this post. SWIFT has an oversight committee made up of the G-10 Central Banks. Below is the structure as found on the SWIFT website:


&gt;As lead overseer, the NBB conducts the oversight of SWIFT together with the G-10 central banks: Bank of Canada, Deutsche Bundesbank, European Central Bank, Banque de France, Banca d’Italia, Bank of Japan, De Nederlandsche Bank, Sveriges Riksbank, Swiss National Bank, Bank of England and the Federal Reserve System (USA), represented by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

&gt;In the SWIFT Oversight Forum, these central banks are joined by other central banks from major economies: Reserve Bank of Australia, People’s Bank of China, Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Reserve Bank of India, Bank of Korea, Bank of Russia, Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, Monetary Authority of Singapore, South African Reserve Bank and the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey. The SWIFT Oversight Forum provides a forum for the G-10 central banks to share information on SWIFT oversight activities with a wider group of central banks.""


So out of the 11 central banks, Ripple has confirmed a relationship with the Bank of England. Can we assume that we may see a partnership with the Bank of Japan? If so, that is 2 of 11 central banks on the Ripple Bandwagon. EDIT: From another post it looks like the US Federal Reserve took a look into the Ripple tech back in 2016. Obviously not a partnership, but at least Ripple is on their radar.

As far as the associate banks there are a few hints already:

* China has reportedly been impressed with the tech and have visited Ripple HQ
* Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority is planning to implement a pilot project to issue a virtual/digital currency that will only be traded among banks. Also the world’s largest Islamic bank, the Saudi Arabian Al Rajhi Bank, successfully completed a Ripple blockchain trial, where it successfully transferred money between Saudi Arabia and Jordan bank branches.
* Ripple has attended talks with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) for its technology to be part of the central bank’s blockchain experiment in cross-border payments",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Crypto's need for Debt Management,"2017 was the year that Cryptocurrency entered the mainstream consciousness. Not Bitcoin, which had been on the peripherals for years, but *Cryptocurrency*. This awareness has fueled the true beginnings of the Decentralized Economy.

A less accurate, but more apt name in my opinion, is the alt-economy. This is for the particular distinction of not just being another *market* - as Dow is to the Nasdaq - but truly a second economy. A legitimate alternative that shrugs off localization, brokerages, and the majority of burdensome regulation. An economy with the potential to be free of tampering and censorship, and immutable by nature. But there is one one big obstacle in the way:

TL:DR

* Crypto has begun to develop an alternative way for individuals to invest in companies 

* More is needed to secure it's future.

* Of the number of methods to spur adoption the best undertaking is decentralized, Blockchain enabled, peer-to-peer loans.

* Having individuals invest directly in one another would be a genuine alternative (I would say an improvement) to the current debt industry.

* Even though the challenges to this are vast, there are projects that are actively seeking to accomplish this.

* When this happens, it will legitimize the alt-economy and spur adoption.  

*Full thoughts below.

**Debt**

The fastest way to learn about cryptocurrency is by taking a look at the modern western economies, their bountifulness, and how they got that way. And when you compare what Crypto has to offer the glaring difference is that debt is not part of the blockchain. I mean- in a way I'm sure it is with the insanity of taking out loans to bet on the blockchain being a real thing, but it's not a part of the ecosystem, and it needs to be. 

**Why the Blockchain must manage debt**

Debt is a bad thing when you're stuck in it. And there are certain infamous actors who maliciously loan debt to collect only interest - meaning that they hope you're never able to pay it off. And while debtor's prison is effectively a thing of the past, it is possible to accidentally slip into a prison of debt.

However, part of the reason for the general prosperity of the traditional economy is debt. This is because devices such as mortgages, equity, and loans are about getting money of a dead zones and participating in the economy - thus expanding it. So properly managed debt is part of a booming economy. 

While certain Cryptocurrencies are nifty, and many of us dream of paying for dinner with Ethereum by flashing the QR code on our phone, these are cheap novelties. And while near-instant, low-cost, international transactions certainly have utility, something more is needed to attract the majority of participants yet to come. This catalyst is credit on the Blockchain.

**Decentralized, Blockchain-Enabled, Peer-to-Peer Lending**

The premise of available credit, supplied by a collective rather than an institution, with a Blockchain where there would be a middleman, is not new. There are active projects working to accomplish this. I'll refrain from pointing to any specific efforts, lest I be accused of shilling, but a little bit of research will turn up some interesting intentions to achieve Blockchain enabled loans. If a team is able to accomplish all the functions in a decentralized manner, it would be completely revolutionary. We can speculate for days on the myriad of challenges to discover and maintain a primarily decentralized loan network, but it's the effects of such a thing that would spur adoption in a way nothing else could. 

We've all been denied loans by the banks. In fact the general rule of thumb is that banks will shower you with offers to ""help"" until you actually need the money. If the aforementioned Crypto-Credit was able to provide an alternative to those who were unable to secure loans from the bank, or offer them a lower interest rate. 

Those who doubt the validity of Crypto and Blockchain often point out the lack of practical application after 10 years of development compare to other innovations such as the Internet (actually, mainly compared to the Internet). While innovation has been lightly paced, there are breakthroughs on the horizon, and to me this is the most exciting possibility.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"In Defense of the 30 Year Mortgage (Because Children, and Other Financial Calamities)","I’m about five years into a 30 year mortgage, three years into a daughter and one year into a son. A recent budget refresh led me to to revisit old choices. The fact that I took out a 30-year rather than 15-year mortgage five years ago was hugely important for reasons I didn’t fully anticipate at the time.

I’ll get into it more, but the tl;dr is young couples should value flexibility as much as long-horizon economizing when making big-ticket commitments.

Let it be said: the 15-year mortgage is arguably the better financial choice, if you are a money-bot. You may get a slightly lower interest rate. You obviously pay much less interest over the life of the loan. I’m not here to argue with any of that, because it is all true.

And yet.

The monthly P&amp;I payment on a 15-year mortgage is 50-60% higher than that on a 30-year mortgage (assuming an interest rate in the neighborhood of 4%). For a $200k mortgage, that’s a difference of about $500/month. And for many people, that 15-year window coincides with peak childbearing years.

In the last three years I have been on maternity leave twice, for a total of 22 unpaid weeks (thanks, America!). My husband suffered an injury at work that left him on workman’s comp for several months. Did you know that workman’s comp only pays 2/3 of your wages? I do now!

And dear god, daycare. I live in a relatively low COL part of the country, but I’m still spending nearly $2k/month so my children can go to the daycare with the big playground, good food, and nice teachers rather than the $1.2k/month daycare where they watch tv and bite each other.

But this is a happy story of budgeting gone right. Although our emergency fund is almost depleted, it got us through three work interruptions. I recently decreased my workload to a 30-hour week, because that is a choice that makes sense for our priorities right now. It would not have been possible, however, to weather the last three years and enjoy this work/life balance with quality daycare, had I signed that 15-year mortgage.  Our budget works, but just barely. That ~$500/month commitment would have forced me to either work more hours or sacrifice daycare quality. It’s a choice I’m very glad not to make.

Before kids, I paid extra towards principle, such that my 30-year mortgage is now more like a 28-year mortgage. I intend to do the same once daycare is over and I can comfortably work more hours. It’s an option, but it’s voluntary, and can be dialed up or down in concert with life’s other demands.

As a late-20s DINK, I could have built a totally rational case for the 15-year mortgage. Mid-30s me is very glad I didn’t.

YMMV, obviously. However I see an awful lot of advice here that seems more enamoured with spreadsheet satisfaction than the vagarities of life. Some of y’all may appreciate the lived counterpoint.

...

UPDATE/EDIT: Thanks for all the comments y’all! I do want to emphasize this post’s flair is BUDGETING and not INVESTING. There is a good argument that it’s a better investment to pay the minimum on a 30-year mortgage and invest the difference in index funds or other market investments, as compared to a 15 year mortgage. I changed “Let it be said: the 15-year mortgage is almost always the better financial choice, if you are a money-bot” to “Let it be said: the 15-year mortgage is arguably the better financial choice, if you are a money-bot” to soften that up.

But this post isn’t interested in the optimal investment for your marginal dollar. It’s about not over-committing your budget to illiquid assets, regardless of how attractive they are on paper, because shit can happen and you may need the leeway.

I get the impression this sub is read by many younger people who discount the possibility that personal circumstances can change rapidly in unexpected ways, and hoped my personal anecdotes could illustrate how that can play out.

First off, yes, I know I will need to find a cheaper place to live. I'm actually researching places now, and hoping to have something by the time my lease is up. I would leave now if I could, but I don't have the money to break my lease right now, and no money to put towards a Uhaul. Housing is kind of a struggle for me right now - due to personal/familial reasons, I cannot move back in with my parents, and I live in an area where anything under $900 is basically setting yourself up to live in a crime-ridden shitehole. The idea of getting a roommate that's a complete stranger frankly terrifies me, but at this point, I guess I have to accept the risk of getting my stuff stolen/trashed if I'm going to pay off any of this.

I also have two cats. Which means pet deposits are going to be ridiculous. I'm not giving my cats up. I'm honestly not sure I'd still be here if I didn't have them.

Because I know the question will come up, this debt happened as a result of taking out student loans because I couldn't afford the full cost of college, and then thinking I'd be able to start paying on them when I got a job. Stupidly, I did not expect to spend the first three years out of college struggling to find work despite having two degrees. 

The non-school part of the debt happened because I have a spending problem. Related to depression/ADHD/probably other stuff. Yes, I'm getting help. The worst part is seeing a thing I want and being physically unable to talk myself out of getting the thing because the want manifests as extreme discomfort and panic. Kinda like being in a room with a giant spider and being unable to get away from it. That sort of panic. If any of you have any particular disdain towards crazy people, please just downvote and move on.

So, here's what I've cobbled together so far, with my shitty understanding of math and numbers and poor perception of time.

* Flipping as a part-time job to bring more money in. I'd been looking for months to find a flexible weekend job, but pretty much all of them around here want you to have full-time availability, which I can't do because I work tech support and am on call every other weekend. Some days I'm not on call, but am asked to help with something if someone else can't. Flipping is good for me because I can devote as much time to it as I need to, and just bring my laptop with me when I go out sourcing, using my phone as a hotspot if someone calls in for help. But then I'm screwed if stuff doesn't sell fast enough, which is what's been happening a lot.

* mTurk. Mind-numbing, but good for a few bucks when I can actually stand to sit and do it.

* Cutting down on expenses. I've cancelled Youtube Red, I'm on my sister's family plan for Spotify, I don't buy video games anymore, and I don't go out often, if at all. Sleeping = no money spent. I want to cancel my $15 Adobe subscription, but they're going to charge me $30 to do that. Which I don't have right now.

* Coupons and a Harris Teeter VIC card. I was doing Aldi's for awhile. Love the prices, but the one in my area is extremely hit or miss when it comes to vegetables and meats. 

* Donating plasma. Because a weird part of me kind of likes being stuck with a needle. Unfortunately, the one in my area has a 3-5 hour wait time no matter what time of the day you go (not an exaggeration), so I haven't been going often because I'd rather spend my time sourcing for stuff to sell or doing stuff on mTurk rather than standing in a line for most of the day to get $25 bucks. Maybe that's a stupid mentality to have.

* Selling stuff around the house. Kinda related to flipping, but I've been just kind of listing stuff around my apartment I don't use or need.

Essentially, right now, it feels like I'm not even able to do *anything* about this debt. I'm not making enough extra to devote to bills because stuff just isn't selling quickly enough to make the deadlines. Every place I call or read up on for more reliable income wants M-F full time availability for a 20 hour part time job. Just this week, an overdraft charge for $5 (for a programming tool sub that I actively use for work) has put me about $70 in the red because my bank tacked on overdraft charges for every payment attempt for that $5, so now I'm not able to actually buy food this weekend unless I wait six hours to donate plasma. Which is fine, nothing better to do. I'm having to pick and choose which bills to pay every month because the student loans are cleaning me out.

I honestly don't know what else to do. It feels like I'm not even making a dent. My plan was to try and go for the lowest credit card bill first, but even that isn't working. I don't qualify for a single penny of personal loan because my debt to income ratio is so high. I've seriously considered going out and...trying to find someone who'll be willing to pay for sex or something, but I'm not anywhere near attractive enough to be worth selling my body. 

I'm well aware that the student loans are probably going to be here to stay because there's no way in hell I'm going to be able to make a dent in *those*, but...I'd like to get rid of the personal debt if I can. Stuff is just getting more expensive, I keep having to miss payments and owe more money. Maybe I'm being dramatic, probably going to get downvoted.

personalfinance,Could you theoretically save a bit on interest by paying student loans on a daily basis?,"I see that the simple daily interest rate calculation is `principal * (interest rate/# of periods per year) * (number of days since last payment)`. So if I pay daily, that keeps the number of days since last payment as low as possible and reduces the daily interest rate, right?

This seems it doesn't save too much on interest, but I'm just curious about it. I'm looking at my student loans right now and there's only an option to auto-pay on a monthly basis, so if one were to want to save as much as possible, I guess he would login daily and manually pay a little? Would 1 cent enough? I have Nelnet loans so it gets a little more complicated since it's like a collection of loans (I have like 8 different ""mini-loans."" I guess you would need to pay 1 cent for each of these loans?

Lastly, I made an Excel spreadsheet that assumes monthly payments (exactly like [this](https://www.creditkarma.com/calculators/amortization)). So I guess that's not entirely accurate as it doesn't take into account the fact that simple interest is calculated daily and also doesn't factor in the number of days since last payment, right? I don't see a simple way to tweak it, seeing an amortization table of each day is overkill.

Thank you.


P.S. Does this simply daily interest rate apply to most loans that use simply interest? I want to know if I can use it for most other loans (the obvious exception is mortgages which calculate interest on a monthly basis as opposed to daily)",finance

Bitcoin,Value of Bitcoin,"I've been thinking recently about how supply and demand determines value and how it applies to bitcoin and crypto in general. This idea sounds logical with traditional markets and honestly I can't think of anything more sound than that (although admittedly I'm no econ major).  That being the case I would like to throw a few thoughts out to the community to hear your feedback because I believe it can be a lot more complicated than that for Crypto in the current market environment. 

Thought 1

If there are currently only 17,000,000 bitcoin in existence and there are ~7,000,000,000 people alive today, then only ~.2 % can own a full bitcoin.

Thought 2

The bitcoin landscape has (like any other financial system) has a high concentration of coins owned by a small percentage of bitcoiners (Winlklevoss twins, Satoshi, government auction recipients, etc). Not that this in itself is either a good or bad thing necessarily, but it is something to keep in mind.

Thought 3

There are currently federally regulated futures products (CBOE, CME, and soon to be NASDAQ) covering non federally regulated trading markets in bitcoin which opens up the opportunity for some serious good ol boy market manipulation IMO. 

Thought 4

Over the last few years I have personally witnessed market outages at some of the largest bitcoin exchanges during record highs in the price of bitcoin.  This IMO couldn't of been planned better if they wanted to artificially restrict the appreciation of the price of bitcoin. 

Thought 5

All of the current largest of exchanges are centralized and I know that at least Coinbase has an API for bots to algorithmicly trade in high speed back and forth limit orders which is creating the current fiat value on these exchanges. 

Thought 6

There is a major learning curve for not only bitcoin and crypto in general, but also for why crypto is better than fiat. Additionally there are learning curves in how to securely store your digital assets. 

Final thoughts:

If everything above is correct, then I believe in order for bitcoin to be allowed to appreciate at its natural rate we need to take custody of our coins as soon as their purchased on the exchanges. This would limit any possible manipulation with respect to your own coins while allowing you access to any Forks that come along. 

Any feedback from the community is always appreciated.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Looking for loan provider recommendations/advice,"Been lurking in the sub awhile and gathered some great information. But I could use some guidance. 

Here's my situation. I have three credit lines I am paying off. Interest rates are about 15, 24, 27 percent. I did the call and ask for a lower rate trick, worked on that first but not the others. 

Anyway, I'm rather close. About $4500 over those combined. Lowest interest has the highest balance. 

My concern is the high one. It's about 1700, but it's a car repair line. The grace period ends next month and at that point the interest will pile on. 

My second highest interest is only $600 left. Been really diligent paying that one  down. In the meantime would you recommend a balance transfer to the lowest interest rate one?

So: I've been testing the loans waters. A couple rejections and an offer that was about as high as my higher credit card (looking at you, OneMain Financial). 

I thought I was in a good position.  Always make my payments early, always pay well over, sometimes double the minimum. Credit just went up to 710 recently, I make 1500 a month after taxes/benefits. I live with my fiancé who carries all the rent. 

Biggest expense is my car note, about 325/mo. Again, pay early, usually a bit extra. 

I have asked for $5K (also getting married and could use a buffer).

personalfinance,Underwater on auto loan. Options?,"(Posting this for a friend)

My friend is underwater on her auto loan. To keep things simple, let's say she owes $10k on an auto loan for a vehicle currently worth $5k. She wants to get a new car sometime soon but feels stuck with this loan situation and doesn't want to roll it into a new car purchase since that just kicks the can down the road rather than addressing the issue.

I've already done some searching on this subreddit and in general and I've found 3 basic options:

- Continue paying off loan as is and as aggressively as possible.
- Refinance loan for a better rate to reduce overall payment amount.
- Declare bankruptcy.

She's currently doing the first method and declaring bankruptcy doesn't seem like a good choice for her (she's employed and has a house with a mortgage). So that leaves the refinancing option (which I've seen suggested for this type of situation on this subreddit).

I understand that refinancing would still leave her underwater on the loan, but at least it would improve the situation by reducing the overall cost.

The problem is she's tried to get a new auto loan and has been rejected because banks don't want to offer a loan for more than the car is worth.

How can she refinance her loan? Her current interest rate is nearly 7%.

Does she have to tell banks what her car is worth? I'm guessing that it would be fraud for her to lie about it.

Does she have any options or is she just stuck with her current loan as is?

investing,"With all the speculation regarding the stock market dropping as a result of rising interest rates, I would like to attempt to back that theory up with some content.","So you all are probably shitting your pants right about now. On Friday February 2, the S&amp;P dropped by 1%. On Monday February 5, the S&amp;P dropped 3% and the S&amp;P futures continued dropping another 100 points in the after hours. Today, we experienced another 100-point drop in the S&amp;P nearing 4%.

**What the hell is going on??**

I have a theory. And it's only a theory. So take this with a grain of salt.

But before I introduce my theory, I'd like to introduce you all to the [Fed Model](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/112703.asp).

**The Fed Model**

The Fed Model (which has nothing to do with the Fed btw, it was called the ""Fed"" model by Prudential Analyst, Edward Yardeni) basically says this:

-If the S&amp;P earnings yield is greater than the 10-year treasury yield, then the market is undervalued. Therefore the rational investor should invest in the market.

-If the S&amp;P earnings yield is less than the 10-year treasury yield, then the market is overvalued. Therefore the rational investor should invest in treasury bonds.

Makes intuitive sense right? Invest wherever there's a higher rate of return. Nothing too difficult there.

So let's compare the S&amp;P Earnings Yield to Treasury Yields.

*Btw, what is the Earnings Yield? The Earnings Yield is the inverse of the P/E ratio. So the E/P ratio if you want to call it that (Please don't call it that)*

**S&amp;P Earnings Yield vs 10-Year Treasury Yield**

Using data from [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/data/MULTPL/SP500_EARNINGS_YIELD_MONTH-S-P-500-Earnings-Yield-by-Month), we can see the S&amp;P earnings yield has been steadily declining. From 3.99% at the beginning of the year to 3.8% at the beginning of February.

https://imgur.com/qcwYt3z

The Treasury yields, on the other hand, have been slowly creeping up this year. [Historical data](http://www.macrotrends.net/2016/10-year-treasury-bond-rate-yield-chart) for our 10-year Treasury yields show that yields have increased from around 2.41% in the beginning of the year to nearly 3% now.

https://imgur.com/Ar4YiNa

You can see the gap between the yields have narrowed from 1.58% down to 0.80% now, nearly half the distance it was at before. The average difference between the S&amp;P Earnings Yield and the 10-Year Treasury Yield from January 1979 to December 2008 was 0.70%. As this gap reverts towards its mean in such an aggressive manner, this might explain a shift from equities to safer instruments such as treasuries or cash.

However, there are some drawbacks to using the Fed Model:

The Fed model compares the 10-Year Treasury Yield, which anatomically has expected inflation priced into itself to the S&amp;P Earnings Yield, which doesn’t. The S&amp;P Earnings Yield is a real rate that does not include any effects of inflation. So we are metaphorically comparing apples to oranges.

It also ignores any earnings growth potential available to shareholders beyond anything after next year. Since earnings yield is just the inverse of the P/E ratio and the P/E ratio used in this model only projects forward one year.

As with all models, these are not 100% accurate. Right before the financial crisis, the S&amp;P Earnings Yield was projecting 6-7% while 10-Year Treasury yields were forecasting 2-3%. Of course the yield curve was also inverted during this time so short-term rates were much higher than long-term rates, but that’s a different story.

In spite of these two weaknesses, the Fed model can still provide some useful insight. It does suggest an inverse relationship between equities and bonds and if money is going out of equities, it may very well be rotated into bonds assuming they’re providing a higher yield. And even then, the more risk-averse investors have to ask themselves: ""Am I really being compensated for staying in equities even if there's only a marginal advantage in yields?""",finance

Obviously, I want to strike a balance of not overpaying and getting a huge refund once a year but instead perhaps paying less per paycheck and getting a smaller refund. 

I'm single, HOH, with 1 dependant under 13 receiving child care. I used a calculator from Turbo Tax and it determined that 7 allowances on my W4 would amount to more money per check and still a decent refund at the end of the year, likely from tax credits. 

However I'm not sure if 7 allowances on my W4 is *too much*. I definitely don't want to have a huge tax bill. However on my latest paycheck I paid $0 federal tax. Despite this, based on the TurboTax calculator I would still have a decent refund. 

I'm not sure if this is right or if I should amend my W4 to 5 allowances which would put me back to a more normal range of federal tax, but still better than ""0"" which was simply taking a good chunk of taxes and leaving me with a large refund at the end of the year.",finance

Machines have been slowly taking over jobs for years, but it seems like this trend is about to reach escape velocity. Just this week it was reported that an autonomous Semi completed a coast to coast trip across America. Uber is slowly rolling out driverless cars. Etc... Stuff like this is a game changer for our economy. 

2. The widening wealth gap - Just like automation, this trend seems to be increasing at an alarming rate. I can't imagine it is good for an economy to have so few individuals earning such a high percentage of the economic output and controlling such a large portion of the nation's wealth. 

3. The Debt and Deficit - Another item trending in the wrong direction. When Obama took office the annual deficit was around $1 trillion, by the time he left office that figure had been reduced to around $600 billion. This figure is projected to start increasing again, most likely hitting the $1 trillion/year mark soon. We are now above $20 trillion on total federal debt. The interest payments on all this debt is going to start becoming a much larger piece of the federal expense pie. This is not good when we have major structural issues like Social Security, Medicare, Medicade, and a crumbling infrastructure. 

What makes these three issues most concerning is that there doesn't seem to be anyone in Washington with the courage to address any of them. Current priorities in Congress appear to be cutting taxes, spending more on the military, and helping a small group of young people who are not even US citizens. All three could be worthy pursuits depending on your perspective, but are these really the most dire issues facing the country? When was the last time a politician proposed ideas to balance the budget, address the wealth gap, or deal with automation?  These are topics that only get discussed in dark corners of the internet. Maybe this lack of seriousness is why the markets are taking a breather?

http://www.sprucepointcap.com/realty-income-corp/

&gt; Deceptive Same Store Property Reporting: Forensic accounting work indicates that the true underlying economic performance of Realty Income's properties, as measured by Same Store Rents (SSR) are declining. The Company disclosed its SSR growth rate of 1.2% in 2016. Spruce Point's industry normalized definition of same store property performance suggests that that SSR declined by 0.8% in that period – an astounding 2.0% overstatement.

&gt; Tenant Quality Deteriorating as Retail Landscape Changes: A deep dive into the tenant quality of Realty Income reveals the corporation's outsized 20% risk exposure to drug stores, grocery stores and movie theaters -- three retail subsectors facing disintermediation.

&gt; Interest Rate Tightening Cycle Major Headwind: Consensus expectations is that the 10 year treasury will surpass 3.0% by 1Q'19. Realty Income's historical stock performance exhibits negative correlation with interest rates.

&gt; Dividend Sustainability Decreasing: Spruce Point's proprietary measure taking into account the average remaining lease term, run-rate FFO, and dividend suggests that Realty Income's dividend sustainability is at its lowest level in more than a decade. This should be a source of concern for dividend yield seeking investors

&gt;Precedent for Significant Revaluation of Share Price: There are ample case studies to show 40%-50% share price declines when investors revalue a REITs declining performance. For example, Wall Street has meaningfully penalized a few REITS (DDR, Brixmor, Kimco) that own retail properties where the same store growth profile swung from positive to negative growth.

Spruce Point Capital also criticized the executive management team of consisting of entirely ex-investment bankers, and the ethics board being lackluster.

personalfinance,Not getting my taxes due to my moms food stamps,"So I'm looking for some insight before giving up and just filing my taxes and NOT getting a refund. 

To be brief, I've lived on my own outside my moms house for the last 9 years. During 2013-2015 my mother claimed that I lived with her and told the federal government I did too in an effort to receive more funds for SNAP benefits (food stamps). In 2015, they realized my mom wasn't being truthful about the income in the home and as such, the Feds wanted the the additional funds she received back (she wasn't truthful with how much my step father was making). She never paid this money and now that's where I need insight. 

So last year, I filed my taxes but only received a letter from the government stating that my refund had been garnished due to this money not being paid. They took every bit of my federal (the more $$$ refund I was getting) refund. I called the number on the phone only to be given this option:
-prove that I didn't live with her during those years or take her to court

Taking my mom to course isn't exactly the option I'm looking for here due to the costs associated. She has no money anyways. So the realistic option was to prove I didn't live with her. I attempted to scramble any documents with an address showing where I lived and such but wasn't able to find much aside from magazines and a pay stub for just one month of one of the years. Furthermore the lady on the phone said it wasn't a likely pursuit and they wouldn't likely approve it unless it was a federal document. 

So here we are again, tax time 2018. I called the Feds and asked what the remaining balance was. I let my mom file first so they could take her refund in hopes it would pay the balance and they wouldn't take mine. However her refund isn't enough and they will take every penny of my federal refund this year when I file. 

It sucks and I'm pretty frustrated. I'm buying a house and could really use my refund to help with various costs associated with it. I've called the government and asked if there's any way I can meet with someone or any way to be removed from the balance. They assured me no, and that the federal government wants their money. 

Any insight is greatly appreciated. I figured it's not likely there's anything I can do but thought it was worth a shot to see what some ""tax pros"" might have to say. 

Thanks in advance.",finance
Bitcoin,"How We Got 200+ People Into Bitcoin. How It Saved Lives, And How It Only Took One Question!","Hello guys, long time lurker. Decided to finally make an account and engage. I'm some guy from Toronto in my mid 20s. I could buy a lambo ""because moon"" or because HODL, but whats more important (and why I have no plans on selling my holdings) is that I have seen Cryptos save lives. Lots of them. Here is my story.

In the past I had over 1,000 customers come to one of my websites per day. An e-commerce website for gaming related goods. When one of the clients asked me if I accepted Bitcoin, I gave no thought and continued with my day. I had better things to do at the time.

When the second person asked if we accepted Bitcoin on live chat, I considered this might not be a scam of some sort. I had come across another mention of Bitcoin in a conversation before that shift ended. I looked up this ""Bitcoin"" clients kept talking about. I came across plenty of Google hits that gave me enough material to understand something about Bitcoin. It could mean a competitive edge over my competitors. I decided to test it on a low scale with our business model. At the time, I was a new player in this market but was roughly 80% up the ladder to the top spot. There were roughly 30 competitors and I was 3 months in. Bitcoin ended up making a bit difference.


Two years into our (me and my brothers) business we were now sending out over $10,000 USD broken up into 100s of payments every single day in BITCOIN. Bitcoin now made up over 80% of the payments we sent out. We were #1 in the niche industry, with 2x the traffic/sales of the #2 spot. We had dug deeper into cryptos. At the time friends were discussing ETH and some mentions of XRP were whispered.


In the second year of business I began to notice a few Spanish individuals who were selling moderate sized amounts of digital goods every few days. This made a difference when we were near empty a few times in the same day. They caught my attention. They always wanted Bitcoin as a form of payment. They began to visit my site daily. I needed more Bitcoin to buy this supply so I could meet the increasing demand we were fortunate enough to be experiencing. Once we had a way of taking our sales money and converting it into Bitcoin at a reasonable fee (and speed) we were able to take things up a notch. It was time to get Spanish friendly live support. We created Spanish Shortkeys. Turned our live chat to auto text translate, and got a Spanish bilingual representative, just incase. We let the Spanish individuals know that we were able to offer Bitcoin more regularly now.

Bitcoin allowed us to scale up our business in a big way. Ohh, and those Spanish guys? They were Venezuelans. Today, saying 1,000 Venezuelans are fed on a daily basis by just this very small niche within the gaming space would be a lowball number. I am humbled to be able to say that Cryptocurrency made families whom I have done business with able to avoid feeling like starvation could be tomorrow. The system they relied on collapsed. Crypto was their life line. And this is only one story.

When you buy something, just ask something like ""Do you accept Bitcoin?"". Feel free to substitute Bitcoin with another coin. You’ll probably hear ‘no’ 99% of the time. But they might look into it. The 3 guys who asked if I offered Bitcoin ended up influencing thousands of Venezuelans day to day lives.",cryptocurrency
investing,U.S. Government Shutdown Begins as Congress Lets Funding Lapse...the hits just keep on coming,"&gt; but the lapse may last only a few hours as the House and Senate plan votes early Friday morning.

&gt; There still are risks because of opposition in the House from conservative Republicans and some Democrats to the two-year budget agreement, which will allow an additional $300 billion in spending for the next two years. The bill also would fund the government on a short-term basis until March 23, and would suspend the federal debt limit until March 2019.

&gt; But if there were fears that a U.S. government shutdown, however brief, could contribute to volatility in the market, they weren’t enough to persuade GOP Senator Rand Paul or a sizable number of House Republicans and Democrats to say they would vote for a plan to keep the government open. 

&gt; The Senate had to wait until after 1 a.m. Friday to take a procedural vote allowing the legislation to proceed because Paul denied the unanimous consent needed to act sooner. The Senate was moving toward passing the bill soon after, and the House plans to vote sometime between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m., if not earlier.


&gt; It’s filled with long-stalled or long-sought priorities for both sides. Republican defense hawks get more funds for the military, while Democrats get extra money for domestic priorities like combating opioid addiction, the National Institutes of Health budget and community health centers. The agreement also repeals a piece of Obamacare -- a Medicare cost-cutting board aimed at ensuring the program’s long-term solvency. And it would provide $90 billion in disaster assistance for California, Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

&gt; The bill authorizes the sale of 100 million barrels from the Strategic Oil Reserve to pay for some of the new spending, and raises customs and airport security fees in the next decade. It also renews a number of expired tax breaks for calendar 2017 including for cellulosic biofuel, while extending a nuclear power tax credit that was scheduled to expire so that it is available after 2020.

Forget the 4% Rule: Rethinking Common Retirement Beliefs
Three retirement-savings rules come into question as stocks and bonds get more expensive and retirements last longer
By Anne Tergesen, Feb. 9, 2018 5:30 a.m. ET

When saving for retirement, calculate your “number”—the amount you’ll need without running a big risk of depleting your savings. When in retirement, spend no more than 4% of your initial balance, adjusted annually for inflation. And when investing in retirement, start out with a relatively high percentage in riskier assets like stocks and increase your exposure to safer bonds as you age.

These are some long-held rules that most retirement scholars and financial advisers espouse.

But with both stocks and bonds expensive by historic measures, and people having longer retirements, researchers are rethinking these rules to better manage the risk of a market decline.

“Retiring now is pretty dangerous,” says David Blanchett, head of retirement research at Morningstar Inc. “No one knows what will happen in the future, but among those who make forecasts, there is an expectation for lower returns.”

Here, ways in which three retirement-savings tenets are changing:

The 4% rule

Conventional wisdom says you can withdraw 4% from your savings in the first year of retirement and give yourself an annual raise over the next 30 years to keep pace with inflation without a significant risk of going broke.

For someone with a $1 million portfolio, the formula produces an initial income of $40,000 and—assuming inflation of 2.5%—an increase to $41,000 in year two.

But in recent years, the rule’s safety has been questioned. While 4% would have worked over every 30-year retirement from 1926 on for an investor with 60% in large-company stocks and 40% in intermediate-term U.S. bonds, it failed in almost half of the simulations researchers recently ran using forecasts of future, rather than past, returns.

As a result, “3% is the new safe withdrawal rate,” says Wade Pfau, a professor at the American College of Financial Services in Bryn Mawr, Pa., who ran the numbers with Mr. Blanchett and Michael Finke, also of the American College.

What should you do if you want—or need—to spend more than 3%?

Consider a dynamic approach, Mr. Blanchett says. Many dynamic strategies set their initial withdrawal rate for a 30-year retirement at about 5%. But they require users to cut spending in a year in which their portfolio loses value.

One simple example calls for forgoing inflation adjustments following any year in which your investments sustain losses. The downside: Inflation-adjusted income is likely to decline over time.

A second method, dubbed “the guardrail approach,” provides more latitude to raise spending.

Say you retire with $1 million in a portfolio with 60% in U.S. and foreign stocks and 40% in bonds and withdraw 5%, or $50,000, in year one. At year-end, you must recalculate your withdrawal amount as a percentage of your new balance. Assuming your portfolio declines 20% to $800,000, your $50,000 withdrawal—plus an annual adjustment for inflation—now represents more than 6% of your new $800,000 balance.

Any time your withdrawal rate rises above 6%, the rule imposes a 10% pay cut for the next year, says Jonathan Guyton, a financial adviser and co-creator of this strategy. As a result, after adjusting the $50,000 initial withdrawal—to $51,000, assuming 2% inflation—the method imposes a 10% pay cut, of $5,100, to produce a $45,900 withdrawal in year two.

The good news: You can take a 10% raise following years in which your withdrawal rate falls below 4%.

In years in which your withdrawal rate is between 4% and 6%, simply adjust your most recent withdrawal—$50,000 in this example—to keep up with inflation. (But don’t take the inflation adjustment following any year in which your investments lose money.)

Finding your ‘number’

This rule calls for amassing a specific dollar amount, such as 10 times your current salary, before retiring.

But that can be dangerous, Mr. Blanchett says.

Why? During a bull market, your balance may rise enough to tempt you to save less or retire early—setting you up for trouble if the markets reverse course.

A better approach, Mr. Pfau says, is to avoid looking at your balance and focus instead on saving a consistent amount annually.

Mr. Pfau recommends that someone with 30 years until retirement and a portfolio with 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds save about 16.6% of their annual income a year. A person who plans to work for 40 years should save at least 8.8% a year, he added.

Those savings rates would have been high enough to replace half of pre-retirement income over the past 150 years, even amid poor stock-market returns. (When combined with Social Security, the average replacement rate rises to about 80%.)

Sticking to a glidepath

According to the conventional wisdom, people just entering retirement should have a significant portion of their savings—say, 40% to 60%—in stocks to help their nest egg grow. As they age, most should gradually reduce their stock exposure to protect against market declines.

But a recent study by Mr. Pfau and Michael Kitces, director of wealth management at Pinnacle Advisory Group Inc. in Columbia, Md., finds that those who take the opposite approach—by reducing stock exposure in the initial years of retirement and then gradually raising it over time—are likely to make their money last longer.

According to the research, those who start retirement by reducing their stock holdings to 20% to 30% of their portfolio and end up with 50% to 70% in stocks can withdraw 4% of their balance per year and give themselves annual raises to compensate for inflation over 30 years, even in the worst market scenarios. (The authors based these simulations on historical market returns rather than accounting for the lower interest rates facing today’s retirees.)

In contrast, those who keep 60% in stocks throughout retirement or who taper to a 30% stock allocation from 60% are likely to run out of money after 28 years in the 5% of worst-case scenarios, says Mr. Pfau.

Of course, if stocks fare well in the early part of retirement, those who use the conventional approach will come out ahead. But the new approach provides better downside protection in the years right after retirement, when retirees are most vulnerable to financial losses. If a bear market occurs then, a portfolio can quickly be depleted by market losses and withdrawals.

Bitcoin,Lending in a Sound Money based economy,"I have been thinking for a while now how an economy would function under a sound money standard and one of the matters that troubled me was lending. I initially thought that access to loaned capital would be very difficult, due to the reasons described bellow, but it turns out that this is only one side of the coin. 

My conclusion is the following: If the economy is expected to grow in the upcoming years, lending becomes more difficult. On the contrary if depression is expected, lending becomes easier. 

Why is that: If the economy grows, the same amount of money corresponds to a greater amount of real wealth, so the value of one currency unit increases and the prices fall. This makes it more difficult for businesses to accumulate the amount of capital needed to repay their loans. Only the best businesses would be able to do it. So, the lenders have greater incentive not to borrow because this currency induced risk is high and because their capital is appreciated in value anyway. If on the contrary the economy shrinks, the value of the currency decreases and prices increase, making it easier for a business to accumulate the loaned capital. The lenders have greater incentive to make loans since the currency induced risk is lower and because their capital is depreciated in value anyway. 

This leads to the following outcome: Easier access to money during depression periods, harder access during growth. The former tends to promote growth, the later tends to impede growth. Overall these mechanics tend to keep the economic environment less volatile, decreasing the absolute values of maximums and minimums. 

Easy access to capital during depression periods tends to increase economic activity to bring the economy back in track, so I assume that this is a positive characteristic. Difficult access to capital during growth periods tends to impede further growth. This can be a controversial characteristic and is the one that I’m mostly concerned about. It might not be negative in the long term though because it can prevent unsustainable or bubble-like growths, usually followed by sharp falls and depression periods. 

In a fiat money based economy the difficulty of capital access is controlled by the central banks with their interest rate policy and their ability to create new money. They have the responsibility to act or react, in order to achieve the desired outcome. There are no embedded mechanics in this case. An external actor has to act. In a sound money based economy, where no new money is created at will, the difficulty of capital access depends mainly on the currency’s value and the mechanics that adjust the difficulty are embedded in the system.

Any thoughts, remarks, suggestions or insights would be much appreciated.",cryptocurrency

I have enough in savings, ROTH contributions, and excess from my relocation bonus to cover the full expense, but I'd rather not deplete those accounts and want to take out a loan for it.

My question is, would this be able to qualify as a student loan with banks? The interest rates for student loans are much much lower than regular personal loans.

2. Stick the additional income into your 401K/IRA. An additional $100 per month in your 401K can turn into $100K+ by the time you retire.

3. Pad your savings account. If you're debt free and happy with your retirement progress, make sure you have an emergency fund and enough liquid assets on hand in case of a layoff or medical issue.

None of this is to say you shouldn't go make an additional purchase here or there. Part of the reason for the tax cuts is to spur the economy with additional spending. But, it doesn't mean you have to go on a spending spree just because you have a little extra every month.",finance

personalfinance,Lost on what to do with $100k inheritance,So far I have paid off high interest rate loans and have a 6 month security fund set up at Ally. Left with about $100k to invest and not sure what to do. Do i put it all in etfs or mutual funds or first fund an IRA?,finance
personalfinance,How much trouble am I in with these student loans?,"So I’ve been pretty much ignoring the situation while always paying on time in my IBR plan, but I finally finished my phd and have a higher paying job and am mulling over my options and coming up with a plan. Basically, I took out a bunch of student loans for a prestigious undergrad + masters, and then promptly moved abroad to do my phd. Since I’m earning under 100k, my AGI for IBR purposes was 0 (no taxable US income).

During my phd I wasn’t really earning enough to really tackle the loans, so I tossed some money that way and mostly didn’t think about them besides totally dreading looking at them. But now I’m taking home around 5800 usd per month (net) and these last months have been paying 2000-3000usd a month and they have gone from 113k to 107k. Gah it pains me to think about how much money this is. Interest rate at 6.8%

I don’t know if it’s really sustainable to pay at this level- I have only 1k as an emergency fund (but live with an unmarried partner with a salary double mine who would lend me money no questions asked in case of an emergency) and live in one of the highest COL countries in the world. I also don’t want to totally stop trips home, etc. I know this isn’t the most responsible idea in the world, but I’d also like to get married and start a family in the next couple years (I’m 32). I would say right now I can comfortably put 2k a month towards my loans and uncomfortably put 3k a month towards them.

I have a three year contract at this job (with 2k raises each year) and then fingers crossed will be eligible for a promotion that will mean doubling my salary to around 170k in usd. So I do have good earning potential at least. Complicating this is the fact that I am currently considering staying in this country for the foreseeable future.

So my questions are threefold: 1) are there any options I’m missing for Americans with student loans living abroad 2) should I throw all the money I can towards these loans or also save for my other financial and life goals (family) and 3) is there any way I can refinance these interest rates from abroad?!?",finance

personalfinance,Student Loan Refinancing with Citizens - is the loyalty discount worth it?,"I'm looking to refinance $45,000 in federal Navient loans (6.55%), and was quoted 3.60% (fixed) from Citizens Bank. However, if I have a qualifying account with them, that goes down to 3.35% via their ""loyalty discount"".

I've had a checking account and credit card with Bank of America for quite some time, but since getting married, I'm using a different (joint) checking and credit card for nearly all expenses. So I'm considering closing the BoA CC, and opening a Citizens CC to qualify for the 3.35%.

Will all this activity cause a big hit to my credit score? Or impact the Citizens rate after closing one CC and opening another? Going from 3.60% to 3.35% would only save me $200 lifetime interest, since I pay somewhat aggressively already ($1300/month). So I'm not sure if the headache -- or potential credit implications -- would be worth it.

Long story short, I still owed about $6k on my old car when it died. I was in need of a vehicle pretty fast and ended up taking out another load for a new car that was a bit out of my price range.

investing,Your daily reminder on volatility &amp; corrections. Stay disciplined.,"The S&amp;P (referring to SPY for simplicity), is now down 11.5% from peak. Thus, we are formally in a correction.

The average monthly decline of a bear market is around -2% to -3%, with declines escalating at the end due to negative compounding.

Monday’s drop was the 10th of -3.5% or worse during this bull market alone. Thursday made the 11th.

Ask yourself - is the idea that interest rates are conceivably going to continue rise the dagger of the economy? How is cheap credit &gt; modest credit going to murder financial markets?

What about the idea that inflation rises in tow? Doesn't that result from too many dollars chasing too few goods? With production relatively constant and wage growth still expressly modest, where do the ""too many dollars"" come from?

Again, not saying rising rates aren't a direct negative to investment due to cheap borrowing, but let's get over the fact that something that was forecasted and waited on for years will not be the end of this bull market.

My 98’ Tacoma got stolen over Christmas and I’m now in this weird pickle where I have enough to buy (~$10,000 cash) a used car with higher mileage (&gt;160k miles), or finance something newer at a pretty low interest rate (2.8%).

personalfinance,Confusing situation regarding charge off / 1099-C form,"So I had a Home Depot credit card back by Citibank from 2012 that went into collections and eventually charged off in 2014.  All said and done, after interest charges and penalties, the amount showing on my credit report is $1422.27.  I'm in the process of repairing my credit and am finally ready to deal with this particular debt.  I've reached out to Citibank directly and have been told it is past the statute of limitations.  They are unwilling to settle on it and have given me a mailing address if I'd like to send a full payment to clear it.  I would be willing to do that, however I don't feel comfortable simply sending a check to a random mailing address that was given to me via phone conversation, and requested a letter or piece of correspondence in writing that indicated the full balance and a full payment would update my credit reports once it was paid in full as well.  I'd also like a copy of written correspondence for my own records.  They have refused to send me anything via mail.

I've also already filed my taxes for 2017.  Shortly after filing and receiving my federal refund (still waiting on my state money), I received a 1099-C form forgiving the principle balance of the debt in the amount of $881 and some change.  I again called Citibank and they informed me that although they are ""forgiving"" the debt, they will NOT be updating my credit reports to a zero balance.  This is completely contradictory.  I don't understand how you can forgive a debt, ask me to pay taxes on it as income, and then show the balance in full as if I still owe it.  This also means I will have to file an amended return, which I am furious about.  I had no knowledge that this was coming.

Little background: I live in New Zealand where we have Summer over November-February, which coincides with the end of the University year. This Summer just past I managed to score a nice little government temp job and save up ~$5000 NZD, most of which I’m looking to put in a term deposit. 

I don’t know who my flatmates will be or what their financial situations are like, but I have been known to be a bit too generous with my money for the sake of ease. Obviously - the last thing I want is for my savings to go down the drain in the form of groceries for the flat which I’ve chipped in too much for. 

I’m eager to set up a flat bank account with which to use for certain groceries and requirements for the flat, so that any money spent is equally split between all of us, but I’ve very little experience in the world of finances and I’d like to plan this out as well as possible to ensure that we’re all safe.

Slightly different flavour here, which I hope will be insightful to those who take the time to read. Tonight I'm going to talk about my learnings in this market so far; my biggest mistakes; how you can avoid making them yourself; and the strategy I intend to follow from now on. It’s a long old read, but it contains months worth of knowledge, which could only be gained from first-hand experience. So pour yourself a drink, settle in, and let me take you through a brief history of my first two months in crypto.

&amp;nbsp;

###**TL;DR:** Been in crypto 2 months, after years trading forex. Learnt a lot, and passing on the knowledge. Hope it helps some of you to become better investors.

&amp;nbsp;

##CHAPTER 1: New market; new opportunity

&amp;nbsp;

I came into crypto with a real excitement. Finally a market that resonates with me. The ability to buy into something I believe in - something that could change the world for the better - and to make money along the way. I was excited that I could apply my trading background, something that not many in the market possess, to my advantage. I was excited at the prospect of being on the curve of early adoption, in a market that had demonstrably meteoric potential. But I was patient. I knew that I would be risking a substantial amount of money in this space, and potentially other peoples’ too, so I had to approach it sensibly. I was going to invest (hold long-term) the vast majority and day trade just a small portion. I spent many weeks researching before considering pulling the trigger even once. I didn’t come into this without a plan. But looking back on it now, it really was only scratching the surface on what a serious investment strategy should be.

&amp;nbsp;

##CHAPTER 2: Early Strategy

&amp;nbsp;

In brief, my plan was to research a load of coins that I’d heard have good potential – solid projects which make unique &amp; warranted use of blockchain technology; are disruptive to their industry; are developed by a competent &amp; active team; and are backed by a loyal community. I shortlisted maybe 40 coins through articles, videos and general conversation, and I added them to my watchlist. Admittedly I became a bit lax in completing the deep level of research I told myself I’d do for each – scrutinizing the whitepaper became skimming the whitepaper, which then became watching a video analysis, which then became “oh that sounds interesting I’ll keep an eye on it”. But this was just a watchlist. And still an educated one.

&amp;nbsp;

I knew that I wanted to wait for an inevitable dip in Bitcoin’s value to enter the market, but it just wasn’t coming. $6k, $8k, $10k… the bullish momentum couldn’t be tamed. Was I missing out? Was Bitcoin going to continue its parabolic move while I sit here waiting for a dip that could never come?

&amp;nbsp;

###LEARNING 1: There are an unlimited number of opportunities

&amp;nbsp;

At this stage I was ready to get involved, and I’d scouted a few alt coins that had good technical entry points approaching. Do I need to keep waiting for a good Bitcoin price even when there’s a good alt price? In short, if you’re confident enough about a trade, it doesn’t really matter what price you pay to get the BTC (or other major alt coin) needed to trade it, as long as you believe that your trade will outweigh any potential drop in Bitcoin’s value. If your trade goes up 100% and BTC’s value drops 50%, at that point you’re break even. Plus if you keep holding and BTC returns back to its previous value, now you’re in 100% profit. For me this meant that even after buying some Bitcoin at its ATH (all-time high) and having it correct over 40%, I was still in profit, because this particular trade was up over 100%. More on this later.

&amp;nbsp;

So I bought some Bitcoin! Not all at once – generally a decent strategy is called dollar-cost averaging. In essence, buying a little bit every week at whatever the price at the time is, so that your entry price averages out over time. A better strategy is to only buy if it’s at a good price, or when you need it for a trade setup – not just arbitrarily every week even if the price is high. But I digress, I had some Bitcoin now and I wanted to diversify. Time to buy some alts.

&amp;nbsp;

###LEARNING 2: Every trade is a decision to have the coin you’re buying instead of the coin you’re using to buy it

&amp;nbsp;

If an alt coin is gaining value against Bitcoin, it’s better to be holding that alt coin than Bitcoin. And if it’s losing value against Bitcoin, you’d be better off keeping it as BTC. Simple, but easy to forget when you load up Coinmarketcap and see all of the price changes in USD. You’ve gone up by 4% today – great! But BTC went up 10%, so you’d have been better off holding BTC. Buying a coin is an active decision that you make to hold the coin you’re buying instead of the coin you’re selling for it, for the period of time until you close that position. So if I buy 1000 XEM using BTC, that XEM/BTC trade is me saying “I think that XEM will increase in value at a greater rate than BTC will”. If both of them increase in value but BTC does it faster, that was a sub-optimal decision.

&amp;nbsp;

###LEARNING 3: Satoshis are your friend. Accumulate as many of them as possible

&amp;nbsp;

So how does one measure profit on a trade? It’s intuitive to think of it in fiat terms – how many £££ did I make? Something tangible. But really everything should be measured in the smallest unit of Bitcoin (1 satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC). It’s easier to migrate to this way of thinking if you think of your total investment as the total amount of BTC (or the other major alt coin) that you were able to buy with it. Say I invested £1000 in crypto, and with that I managed to buy 0.1 BTC – that’s my total investment. If I want to diversify and put 10% of that into each of my favourite alt coins, I’d buy 0.01 BTC worth of each of them. Let’s say Litecoin was one of them and I got 1 LTC for my 0.01 BTC. Litecoin’s rocket then fuelled up and started on its journey to the moon, and I decide to bank my profit. I now trade it back for 0.015 BTC. From 0.01 BTC to 0.015 BTC is a profit of 0.005 BTC, or 500,000 satoshis! 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;“But why not just measure it in £££ - that’s far less complicated?!”

&amp;nbsp;

Well here’s the kicker. Let’s say Bitcoin’s value plummeted over the course of that trade. I’ve got more BTC, but because the value of each one decreased, I may still have lost money. So does that mean that trade was a bad decision? Not at all. That trade was a decision between BTC and LTC, and you made the right call. LTC held its value better than BTC did, so you would have lost more if you didn’t take the trade. Profit measured in satoshis allows you to strip away the financial layer and answer the most important question – “was it a good decision to make that trade?” A gain in satoshis is always a win. A gain in £££ is not.

&amp;nbsp;

Taking that same scenario in which I’ve got an equal amount of my 10 favourite alt coins. Let’s say 9 out of 10 of them stay at exactly the same value, but the other one shoots to the moon on a lambo all the way to 100%. Woohoo! Shame that was only 1/10 of my portfolio - overall it’s worth 10% more now – but if I’d have invested all my money in that one coin I’d be up 100% overall. Now I’m certainly not advocating putting all your eggs in one basket. Rather, in reference to my previous learning, this helped me realised another very important point.

&amp;nbsp;

###LEARNING 4: Understanding opportunity cost is a must

&amp;nbsp;

Any trade I make is not only a decision between the two coins I’m trading; it’s also a decision to buy that coin instead of any of the other coins I might be interested in. I have 0.1 BTC to spend and 10 alts I want to spend it on – should I just divide it equally? Not necessarily. If you’re super confident about a couple of them, but not so much on the others, spreading it equally doesn’t sound like such a good plan after all does it? Take your time analysing each trade / investment and rank them in order of confidence. In order of potential (risk:reward if you’re a trader). Invest more in the ones you’re more confident in. It’s a really basic point, but one that’s so often forgotten when there are so many exciting prospects out there. Holding a particular coin doesn’t just cost the price that you paid for it, it costs the opportunity to buy something else instead. One of the first things I learnt in trading was to cut your losers short and let your winners run. Why should crypto be any different? Even when you’re in a trade, every moment is an active decision to keep holding it instead of trading it for something else. Don’t blindly HODL hoping for a bad decision to improve, when there are better decisions you can take to re-coup that loss. Equally, don’t sell for a loss just because the value goes down. Re-analyse. Has anything changed? If every reason you had to buy it in the first place still applies, HODL. If something’s changed, including your confidence in it compared to other cryptos, consider switching it for a better opportunity.

&amp;nbsp;

So I learnt all of this in my first month – December 2017. Did I make optimal decisions all the time? Absolutely not, but with cryptos riding to all-time highs, my investors were very happy, as was I. It’s not often that you can get a 100% return on investment in just one month in a market. But it’s easy to profit in a bull market.

&amp;nbsp;

##CHAPTER 3: It’s not all sunshine and lambos

&amp;nbsp;

It was around the end of December in which things started to get a bit too parabolic, and I was naturally suspicious of how long this could last. But you find yourself, inexperienced in a new market, eager to see how far you can ride the wave. The fear of missing out on further exponential gains becomes as much of a psychological challenge as taking a loss. In short, you get greedy. Highs that I had once been ecstatic with, a few days later became lows. I told my investors not to expect anything like this in future months. In my monthly summary I said “we are in perhaps the most bullish market the world has ever seen”, and I estimated that we had “a maximum of 1-2 more weeks to ride this momentum”. Prophetic, no? Well it’s easy to make predictions that come true – even a broken clock is right twice a day. What’s difficult is having enough conviction to take your own advice.

&amp;nbsp;

###LEARNING 5: Make your rules and stick to them, no matter what

&amp;nbsp;

This is without a doubt the biggest thing I’ve learnt over the months. If one day you set yourself a target of £X profit – a level you’d be really happy to achieve, be that on a trade or overall – take it. Cash out as soon as you reach it and buy yourself something nice. Make it tangible. It’s easy for the world of online trading to feel gamified, but remember what you’re staking – this is real money. But it’s easier said than done. If you rise suddenly to that target I can tell you your first thought will be “whoa look at it go, I’m gonna see how much further it can get before I cash in”, rather than “mission accomplished, time to get out”. Humans are greedy. We want to take shortcuts – to our dreams, to wealth – but this isn’t a get rich quick scheme. If someone told you they could get you 10%/month gain on your savings (that triples your money every year) you’d probably bite their hand off. So why in crypto would you not be chuffed with 50%, or 20%, or 10%? Don’t move the goalposts. Decide in advance when to take profit and take it.

&amp;nbsp;

First off, it’s always a good idea to take out your initial investment at a level after which you’d be psychologically happy if the market goes down or up. For example, if I took out my initial investment (say £1000) when it went up 50% to £1500, and then the market went lunar and doubled the next month, I’d personally feel a bit annoyed at myself for not leaving more money in. That £1000 would’ve been £3000 had I kept it invested…shit. However if I took out my initial investment when it went up 200% - I’d now have £2000 left of my £3000 investment, and if it doubled the next month, I’d be happy with the stake I had remaining, not regretting my decision. That level can only be decided by you, based on your attitude towards risk. Obviously the higher that value is before you cash out your profits, the greater the risk you’re taking since it may never reach that level. Taking out your investment as soon as you’re happy to is a good move because from then on in you’re riding on pure profits. If the market were to crash to zero, you’d still be break even, so it’s much easier to detach yourself from the emotions involved (and we all know how emotional this market is). And if you’re a technical trader, rejoice at the fact that this market is hugely technical, and you can very often predict good levels to get out at – often doubled with buying back in cheaper. I highly recommend for **everyone** to spend some time learning to analyse charts - even at a basic level. It works. And for heaven's sake if you're day trading don't do what I did and ""neglect"" to apply basic trading principles like setting a stop loss and sizing each position at maximum ~1% risk. You can call it investing; you can call it speculative buying; but at the end of the day that's just gambling. Don't be lazy. Don't be wreckless. Apply what you've learnt in other markets - crypto is no different.

&amp;nbsp;

And for context, no I did not take my own advice. The correction shocked me. Not the fact that it happened, but the fact that it happened so hard and fast. At first I thought it was a healthy dip, and that the uptrend would resume soon enough – no reason to sell. But then the bears took over, and we were in a full on downwards movement. News emerged from South East Asia which caused a great deal of negative sentiment, and Bitcoin’s value tumbled (even when some of the speculation was later deemed invalid), and with that I realised how inherently linked to Bitcoin that all other cryptocurrencies are. You may dislike Bitcoin - the slow transactions; the high fees – but you can’t argue how critically important it is to this market. 

&amp;nbsp;

###LEARNING 6: 40+% market corrections are normal in crypto, but they still hurt

&amp;nbsp;

I neglected to mention earlier, but I have a background in trading forex. I understand market patterns, cyclicity and technical analysis such as Elliott Wave Theory and Fibonacci ratios. It is foolish to think that charts will continue indefinitely in a given direction – there will always be corrections and reversals. All through the correction we’ve started this year with, I have remained very optimistic. Nothing at all has changed to make any of the leading crypto projects less credible or via as future industry disruptors. This is why it’s important to do your own research on coins you invest in – so that you’re psychologically happy holding them long term through price corrections. But I’ll be honest, when Bitcoin broke down through several technical support levels a few days ago, I became apprehensive. Not even close to panic, or tempted to sell. After all I am investing long term, and I still see this as a requisite correction in a much larger up-trend. Or at least the upside potential of that outcome is comfortably worth the risk for me – it’s the opportunity of a lifetime. But even as an experienced trader, doubts can set in. All of the profits I had gained in month 1 were gone, and I have now slightly dipped into loss. As I say, I’m not selling, and my analysis is still very bullish. But HODLing is not always the best strategy.

&amp;nbsp;

###LEARNING 7: When things are looking bearish, consider the trade to fiat

&amp;nbsp;

With the benefit of hindsight, and now having dedicated substantially more time to learning Elliot Wave Theory and studying crypto charts, there were a number of points at which you could have predicted a big ol’ correction was on the cards, before it fully developed. A quick ‘n dirty rule of thumb, for those of you who don’t know how to read charts, is: “Don’t buy into a parabolic market or at an all-time high – it’ll likely correct soon”. But I’d also like to add an addendum to what is a common mantra in the crypto community: “Buy the dip” – this is for day trading. If you’re intending to hold a coin long term, zoom right out and look at the entire coin’s price history. Wait for a macro scale correction, not a micro scale dip. A lot of people got excited the other day at Bitcoin rising 10% - I saw tonnes of calls saying “the correction is over” or “Bitcoin to the moon” – but when you zoom out, we’re still in a downtrend with room to go lower, and substantial resistance to get through before we can rise to new highs. Play the long game and look for long-term signals. And if you are in that subset of people who can predict an imminent correction, or indeed if you’re halfway through a correction with a good chance of it continuing, the best decision may well be to get out of the market until it’s over. Trade your positions back to fiat, and wait for clear recovery to the upside. It’s much more difficult to trade profitably in a down-trend. Most of us could have doubled our BTC holdings just by getting out of crypto before the correction and buying back in cheaper now. So make sure you have an exit plan. Know the steps that you’d need to take to get your money off exchanges / wallets and back into your bank account. Getting out of crypto doesn’t have to be a permanent move. There’s no harm in waiting things out until you’re confident again. After all, refer back to Learning 1 – there are always more opportunities.  

&amp;nbsp;

##CHAPTER 4: Moving forwards

&amp;nbsp;

At last, filled with learnings and plenty of inactive time spent refining my strategy, I’ve gone back to my technical analysis roots and really analysed why I’m in my positions.

&amp;nbsp;

###LEARNING 8: Never stop analysing. You will make mistakes. Learn from them.

&amp;nbsp;

Does my portfolio need to be this diverse? Are my invested amounts proportional to my confidence in them? Probably not, so I’ve taken this opportunity to start shifting around. Don’t be precious about losses – losing is a natural part of trading – you only need one 10:1 winning trade to offset ten losing ones. So take some losses and make some mistakes. I’m sure glad I did, because it’s made me a much more confident and competent investor today.

&amp;nbsp;

And since everyone always looks around for opinions on the market, I will leave you with one bit of bullish technical insight on our King, Bitcoin. Basic Elliot Wave Theory says that markets move in ebbs and flows – 5 waves in the direction of the trend, followed by 3 waves of correction. And these waves are fractal in nature, meaning that a full 5-wave pattern forms a single larger wave within a higher degree pattern. All that being said, **IF** Bitcoin’s run up to its ATH in December constitutes a completed 5-wave pattern, we could consider that history as Wave 1 of a larger up-trend. Using Fibonacci extension ratios that appear in all markets (including crypto, very prominently, even with BTC), we can project the likely extensions of the Wave 3 that would come after we’re done correcting here. Based on analysis run by eSignal, a popular trading platform, the length of Wave 3 will likely reach either 1.62, 2.62 or 4.25 times the length of Wave 1. That means our Wave 3 high would take the price of a single Bitcoin to roughly $32,000, $64,000 or $98,000.

&amp;nbsp;

**[You can view these Elliot Wave Projections (in GBP) here](https://imgur.com/TF5q6T7)**

&amp;nbsp;

Technical analysis is very subjective, this is merely one possible outcome. But ask yourself, if you had the chance to invest in something with global reach that could make a 5x or even 10x return on your investment, what would you risk for that opportunity?

# **WEEK AHEAD: Stocks and bonds can both go down in volatile trading following wildest week in two years** - *[(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/09/stocks-and-bonds-can-both-go-down-in-volatile-trading-following-wildest-week-in-two-years.html)*

*****

&gt; Friday's dramatic sell-off capped the worst week in two years for stocks, and investors were looking forward to Monday with trepidation.
*****
&gt; The wild ride, which shaved 3.8 percent off the S&amp;P 500, is the first correction of more than 3 percent since just before the presidential election in 2016. Since the election, the S&amp;P 500 is up about 30 percent, and this week's selling reintroduces volatility that has been unheard of since then.
*****
&gt; Stocks come off a punishingly volatile week ready for more selling as the market continues to search for a floor and stock investors keep an eye on rising interest rates.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down 5.2 percent to 2,619, its worst week of trading since January 2016. The Dow, also off 5.2 percent, and the S&amp;P both saw their first 10 percent correction since early 2016.
*****
&gt; Culprits behind the selling were an ugly shakeout in funds that bet against market volatility and the building pressure of higher interest rates on stocks.
*****
&gt; Treasury yields for the 10-year note and 30-year bond were slightly higher on the week, but the 2-year was lower at 2.05 percent. Rising yields pressured stocks, but when stocks sold off, investors turned to the Treasury market as a safe haven. That in turn sent rates back down, since yields move opposite price. The 10-year was at 2.85 percent Friday, below its 2.88 percent high for the week.
*****
&gt; Despite extremely wide swings and days with 1,000-point Dow losses, stock strategists are mostly looking for the market to bottom soon and expect stocks will ultimately adjust to rising interest rates. But that process could be rocky, with many bond strategists now seeing the 10-year yield at 3 percent or above, much sooner than expected.
*****
&gt; Bank of America Merrill Lynch chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett, who has long been looking for a correction, said he expects that a good buying level would be at about 2,500 on the S&amp;P 500 and 3 percent on the 10-year yield.
*****
&gt; ""My gut here is 2,500 and 3 percent on the 10-year. They are big, big levels. You expect the market to find a reason to buy at that particular moment,"" he said.
*****
&gt; The markets in the week ahead will focus on their own action, particularly the tensions between stocks and bonds, but there are a few key data points that could impact trading. The CPI, consumer price index, is released Wednesday and it is an important inflation reading that investors are watching for any surprise pickup in inflation. That is released Wednesday morning, as are January retail sales.
*****
&gt; ""The next big event we know that's on the calendar is CPI, and that could impact the Fed. The next big date for the bond market after that, assuming stocks calm down, which is a shaky assumption, is the 28th, when [Fed chair Jerome] Powell testifies,"" said Michael Schumacher, director of rate strategy at Wells Fargo.
*****
&gt; Powell started as Fed chair this past week, and markets have been anxious to hear his views on market volatility. Powell testifies before Congress Feb. 28, and the Fed is expected to raise rates at its next meeting in March. But market pros are watching the volatility, and there's a view the Fed holds off on that hike if the turbulence persists.
*****
&gt; Bond yields have been rising as global central banks, including the Fed, step back from easy policies and raise rates. Treasury yields have also been rising as investors eye the steep increase in U.S. Treasury issuance, expected to rise to $1.25 trillion this year. Another big catalyst for the market is the improvement in global growth and the potential for inflation to rise as a result.
*****
&gt; Now the stock and bond markets are so closely correlated, the action in one feeds off the other. Stocks will be a big factor for bonds in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Gluskin Sheff and Associates' David Rosenberg said, in a note Friday, that the fact both stocks and bonds are selling off at the same time is unusual, and it is similar to time periods with significant market turmoil. He noted that the 10-year yield was rising as the S&amp;P fell sharply Thursday, down more than 10 percent from its January record high.
*****
&gt; ""I cannot tell you how rare a market condition this is — that yields are rising into this risk pullback,"" he wrote in a note to clients Friday. Rosenberg cited how bonds rallied during the financial crisis in 2008 when the market fell and during other big corrections. Other times were 1987 and 1994.
*****
&gt; As for currency markets, the U.S. dollar had a powerful week, with the dollar index rising 1.3 percent, its best week since October. As the dollar rose, oil fell, with West Texas Intermediate losing 9.9 percent for the week to just above $59.20 per barrel, its worst week in two years.
*****
&gt; Hartnett expects a rising dollar and other de-risking moves will be necessary before the shakeout in stocks ends.
*****
&gt; ""Maybe we need to see the dollar move up, and that's the thing that causes investors to do things they least like to do: sell winners — tech, high yield, emerging markets. In these corrections, you sell hubris and buy humiliation. One measure of humiliation is everything goes through the wringer. Nothing is left unscathed,"" he said. ""The dollar rally would be the ultimate risk off. That's part and parcel of the story.""
*****
&gt; Earnings in the week ahead include consumer companies, such as Pepsi on Tuesday and Coca-Cola and Campbell Soup on Friday. Some energy names also report, such as Diamond Offshore on Monday and Occidental Petroleum on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; JP Morgan strategists, in a late Friday note, said they believe that commodity trading advisors and risk parity hedge funds were at the core of the correction, but they believe that most of the unwind by those investors is over.
*****
&gt; ""This, combined with the low equity exposures of Discretionary Macro and Equity Long/Short hedge funds, leaves retail investors as the main residual risk for equity markets going forward,"" they wrote in a note.
*****
&gt; Unlike in other corrections, many strategists said they did not see a fundamental reason behind the selling, and the market became hostage to big round technical numbers that seemed to drive trading. After breaking the 50- and 100-day moving averages, the S&amp;P 500 bounced off the closely watched 200-day moving average Friday, at 2,538, and rebounded to close 1.5 percent higher.
*****
&gt; ""There's a little bit of ... technical activity around what is happening with volatility and how hedge funds have to readjust their strategies, given where volatility is,"" said Patrick Palfrey, equities strategist with Credit Suisse. ""Going forward, we're not really seeing a point where the economic cycle is coming to an end and with the earnings backdrop as strong as it is, volatility should come back in over the next couple of weeks, as people start to look more closely at those underlying factors.""
*****
&gt; Hartnett said there were plenty of warnings the correction was coming.
*****
&gt; ""Certainly, the first tremors were the very rate-sensitive areas of the equity markets — utilities, the REITs, the homebuilders which ... reminded people of the famous phrase 'fear of missing out.' Whether it was FOMO, or BTD, 'buy the dip,' or TNA, 'there is no alternative,' all these acronyms come back in vogue, and that's always going to be a dangerous moment,"" said Hartnett.

# STOCK TRADER'S ALMANAC: S&amp;P 500 Resets Correction Clock with 10.2% Decline

&gt; In just 13 calendar days, from its January 26 closing high through yesterday’s close, S&amp;P 500 declined 10.2%—an official correction. Should yesterday’s closing low hold, it will be the quickest correction by S&amp;P 500 going back to 1949. The second quickest correction was 18 calendar days in autumn 1955 when S&amp;P 500 shed 10.6%.

&gt; Using a 20% peak to trough decline to define a bear market, the current bull market is 3259 calendar days old today, nearly twice as long as average since 1949. The current bull is also the second longest, surpassed by only the great bull market that closed out the last millennium. The current correction is the fourth of the current bull market which is comparable to the numbers recorded by previous bull markets of similar duration.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://78.media.tumblr.com/d5e84b6916e409fe6d7cd858028098cd/tumblr_inline_p3w8yza9Hw1spdppr_1280.jpg))**

&gt; The path to recovery from this correction could be slow, but it is only February 9 and over ten and a half moths remain in 2018. Plenty of time remains for the market to finish the year with a gain. The positive implications of past big Januarys and a positive January Trifecta could still be realized.

&gt; Lastly, the S&amp;P 500 does not have a good record when it comes to forecasting the next recession. Since June 15, 1948 there have been 11 S&amp;P 500 bear markets and 24 corrections including the current one. Since the future is unknown, we will exclude the current correction meaning there have been 34 declines in excess of 10%. However, the National Bureau of Economic Research has only identified 11 recessions over the same time period. This works out to approximately 1 recession out of 3 S&amp;P 500 declines in excess of 10%.

# S&amp;P 500 Corrections

&gt; After nearly two years without one, the S&amp;P 500 officially entered correction territory yesterday, falling 10.2% from its 1/26/18 all-time closing high. The current correction represents the 96th decline of 10%+ from a closing high that followed a gain of at least 10%. The chart below shows the magnitude of every prior correction for the S&amp;P 500 since 1928. Not including the current period, the median decline for the S&amp;P 500 in the 95 prior corrections was a decline of 16.4% over the course of 64 days. Keep in mind, though, that these are median levels. There have been a number of corrections (13) that saw declines of less than 11%, while several saw deeper declines of more than 20%. In terms of length, prior corrections have also been all over the map. Some have lasted as little as three days, while others have stretched on for well over a year.

&gt; Unfortunately, there is no hard and fast rule when it comes to corrections, and that’s what can make them so terrifying when you go through one. You never know when it will end. Throughout history, market corrections have ‘typically’ occurred a little more than once per year. As mentioned above, there have been 96 corrections since 1928, but if you look at their distribution over time, a good deal of them were clustered around the Great Depression. If we look just at the post-WWII period, there have been 55 corrections in the span of 73 years, reducing their frequency to once about every 16-17 months. In any event, the market was still overdue for a correction heading into the current one, but maybe not by as much as it seemed on the surface.

# How Much Are Individual Stocks Down From Their 52-Week Highs?

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is currently down about 8.5% from its 52-week high less than two weeks ago, but the average stock in the S&amp;P 500 is now down 14.3% from its respective 52-week high. That may seem like a pretty wide discrepancy, but it’s actually pretty common for the individual stock reading to be much lower than the index itself due to the fact that not all stocks hit 52-week highs at the same time as the index. In fact, you rarely even see a third of stocks hit an all-time high on the same day.

&gt; While the ‘average’ stock is down 14.3%, the vast majority of stocks are down less than the average – 328 to be exact. Of those 328 names, 170 are still down less than 10% from their respective highs. So who is currently the biggest loser in the S&amp;P 500? That title belongs to Range Resources (RRC). At a current price of $13.16, RRC is down over 60% from its 52-week high. Behind RRC, there are three other stocks down over 50%. They are Chesapeake (CHK), General Electric (GE), and Envision Healthcare (EVHC). The demise of GE has certainly been a major fall from grace. While the stock didn’t perform well under the leadership of Jeff Immelt, it hasn’t been any better since he left. In fact, since Immelt officially retired on October 2nd, 2017, GE shares are down more than 40%!

&gt; On the upside, shares of Scripps Networks (SNI) have been holding up better than any S&amp;P 500 stock as they are down less than 2% from their 52-week highs.

It seems like they're taking out ~$110 less than normal for me. It's nice to be able to keep extra money from each check, but I'm worried some other error may have occurred. I don't want to end up owing thousands of dollars next year when I file my 2018 taxes. (Btw, nothing has changed with my exemptions or insurance or anything else.)

Is anyone else noticing this?

devops,CAPABILITY_IAM and automation,"I've hit a conundrum that I am not quite sure how to solve.

I have been automating most of my company's infrastructure on AWS, from provisioning hardware to software deployment. What this means is that my developers can create hardware by writing and committing code.

I've also been encouraging them to start using EC2 roles instead of passing a single giant user in to multiple applications with an IAM keypair.

Unfortunately this means that my automation role can create IAM roles. This means that an enterprising engineer could create themselves an EC2 instance with admin permissions, connect to it, create themselves an STS admin, and invisibly pwn my AWS account for the rest of time. The only paper trail would be that they briefly created an EC2 role that could create federated users.

How do I prevent this? The tradeoff of not allowing automation to create IAM roles is huge. Suddenly my developers are helpless and I'm back to creating resources for them by hand.",technology

personalfinance,How often do ARM rates go down?,"I was at my credit union a couple years ago looking for a mortgage lender. They only did 30-yr loans as ARMs.

I don't like the idea of an ARM because the rate can increase upwards of 6% over the course of the loan. So a 3.5% loan can hit almost 10%! That's insane.

""Not to worry,"" claimed the credit union lender. He showed me a sheet that had interest rates over the last ten years. There was a dip in rates in 2008. ""Yeah, no shit,"" I thought to myself. That was  when the market crashed. That seemed like an outlier ten-year period to show me.

Historically, how often HAVE rates gone down?

I have no co-signer. my mom could give me her old car before she buys her new one rather than trading it in for more value, and her old car has a guaranteed few thousand in repairs coming up soon, and I barely have a few thousand as it is plus I'd need to pay for insurance for it.

personalfinance,Best use of a tax refund?,"Hi everyone,

I received my federal tax refund of $2000 today, still waiting on state of about $300.  I have 2 credit cards, one almost maxed out at $3000 and another at $2500, both are accruing interest.  I have next to no savings and get paid biweekly around $1200.  One of my 2 monthly checks goes entirely to rent.  What would be the best way to effectively use my tax refund?  Should all of it go to my debt, should it go in my savings, should I keep it in my checking?  Or is there another option I'm not thinking of?

gaming,My vent about Csgo,"Rant/Vent here:

TLDR; posting this to express to myself feelings that I have found recently about this game that I love, the frustration, anger and excitement that I used to have no longer drives me to be better at the game.

It all started back in the rank reset, I found myself carrying games with 40 or even sometimes 50 kills and we would still lose. Thus achieving a much lower rank, fast forward 20 games and im back at 1 rank lower than what I used to be. This is when I start playing against players that are about the skill level I am.

However, the higher the ranks go the more precise your shots should be, and more often than not i am finding that the hit reg somehow got worse. I would go back to watch my vods and compare them to the replays in game and find that there are many shots that should have hit but didn't. Game after game I find that the more I play the more frustrated I get now, after playing for so long I grew fed up with the way in regular MM was going. I didn't feel like dealing with hackers on f2p 3rd party sites and after playing on Esea for over a year I dropped paying for a service in a game that didn't bring me joy of playing.

Every time I would start the game it was a toss up between waller on the enemy team or teammates that did not know that another bomb site exists. As time goes by other games start interesting me more than the game I used to strive to be a professional in.

The amount of money that this game has made over the years certainly warrants a hit reg overhaul again to the point where there are no questions asked if you hit the shot or not. There are updates here and there but imho its not enough for me to find any interest in it anymore.

It makes my heart break to see myself lose interest in the game I love so much. Don't get me wrong I still love the game but lately it is more of a hassle to motivate myself to play the game.

My motto was to play and have fun and be the best at it, and for the longest of times that was true.",technology
btc,We gave away food here in Venezuela thanks to r/btc donations! Thank you,"Hi all

I want to update you guys on what happened today. I was contacted this week by a couple users(I'm not gonna named them since I don't if they would like that) that wanted to support and sponsor meals here in Venezuela. I think you guys already know what's the situation here is like. 


My family used to do meals a few months ago to give away at the church we go to, so this wasn't our first rodeo.

We stopped making food a few months ago because my grandma got sick and died a few months ago, and then my grandpa got sick around November and died a few weeks ago. So we didn't had the time or the money. There have been talks on our church to keep doing them again but most people cant help, they barely have for themselves or don't even have enough.


One thing we learned was that most people don't have enough food, including us. But there are some who are in critical condition that needs it the most. 
Something we learned was that as the weeks go by the word spread and new people started coming looking for food, so we had to make smaller portions to give something to everyone or make a soup since it can feed more for less.

Chatting a bit with the users, we agreed that I'll had to hold a paper with the date and my username on it so that it proves I didn't picked the images from the internet.


So I thought in buying the newspaper and write next to the date. The date is of yesterday since I bought yesterday when we got everything else. We are Adventist and we try not to buy stuff on the Saturdays as much as possible.


The user told me to make a meal to give to the people that needs it the most. The other option would have been to buy packages of flour,rice,sugar,etc and give them away, it helps them the longest but it's much more expensive. 


The thing is, the meal would have to be once a week, since we would be using the church as a hotspot because we don't have a good kitchen to prepare them or a car to move the food around.

So we finally settled on the soup. And I was already planning with my parents what church members could help us to set everything up so this Saturday we give the soup to the people that needs it the most. We started contacting people to see if they were willing to help. BUT WAIT. I forgot that this weekend was the Carnaval, so many people were going to visit their families, or take a vacation, or go camping(our church does a camping every Carnaval here). So the people I had in mind couldn't help us this weekend.  So we were thinking whatimgonnadoo(bitconnect dude), but I couldn't let them down and I was afraid the users would think I was scamming him or something. 


My mom wanted to make a potato salad but serving would have been cumbersome and more expensive since we would have to buy plastic plates and spoons, and after some calculations we wouldn't have enough for it. So we finally settled to make arepas and stuffed them with scrambled eggs and vegetables, we could use our tinfoil to cover them so the delivery will be easier.


And we had to use our kitchen at the end, so we started cooking everything earlier, I woke up at 6 am and my mother already chopped all the vegs so I couldn't took a pic of them raw, and on top of that my brother woke up feeling very sick. Anyway we were still able to do everything, a little later than we thought but we did it. [Here are the pictures.](https://imgur.com/a/FzYLK) Sorry that I didn't took more pictures, I forgot about it at first, and then took others without using the newspaper/tag, sorry that some came out blurry.

I want to be the most transparent I can be, so here are the prices of the things I bought :


BF= Bolivar Fuerte (the currency here)

6 eggs= 250.000 BF

40 arepas = 160.000 BF(we got them just in time since the lady selling was just gonna increase the price to 5.000 ea, but my mom was able to convince her to sell us these at 4.000)

Onions, tomatoes, garlics, sweet peppers, sweet chiles = 651.500 BF

Tinfoil= ??? I have no idea how much it is right now, we used one we had saved from last year, its probably very expensive now.

We also used things like salt, cooking oil, etc. But we used from what we  had already.

The cab and the newspaper were the most difficult things even though it was 20.000 and 7.000 respectively, they had to be purchased by cash. And cash is insanely difficult to find right now. Banks barely give you 10.000 if you're lucky after waiting for hours, and if you buy cash from the black market you have to pay a 100-150% fee. So if you want 100.000, you have to pay 200.000-250.000.

I imagine its hard to trust people online, so it means a lot to me.

BTW I'm not part of @BitcoinCashVE, so far I've not seen proof they are actually doing what they say. Who knows, I hope they have. So to avoid any possible confusion I created a new Twitter account @EatBCH were I'm going to keep you guys posted on what we're  doing.

personalfinance,"Needing new car, but student loan debt. Most responsible way to spend tax refund?","My boyfriend suggested I ask Reddit for advice on my current financial situation. I’m hesitant because of the criticism I may receive due to the amount of debt I've accrued, but I can’t afford a financial advisor, so I suppose this is the second best option.

My car is a 2007 Saturn Ion that keeps breaking. It has roughly 140,000 miles. I just put $1,200 into new struts/rotors, and now it’s leaking fuel which is an estimated $885 repair. Several more things are wrong with it, but I can’t keep pouring money into it and I need a reliable vehicle to drive to work.

Meanwhile, I have an insane amount of student loan debt. Here is the breakdown:

DEBT

Total Federal Student Loans: $63,204 + $48,809 (the $48,809 is in my father’s name, but I am repaying this)

Total Private Student Loans: $20,000 (with varying interest rates between 5-12.25%)

Minimum monthly payment total of all loans: $870

EXPENSES

Student Loans (minimum monthly payments): $870

Car Payment: $0

House Payment: $0 (currently living with parents)

SALARY

$38,000

[Monthly 401a Required Contribution: $144.88 and Monthly Union Dues: $40]
Monthly Take Home After Taxes and Deductions: $2,131.90

ACCOUNT BALANCES

Checking:  $1,000

Savings: $2,400

401k Vested Balance: $4,679.13 (from previous employer – no longer contributing to that account at the moment)
Anticipated Tax Refund: $2,000

My boyfriend suggests I find a $1,000 - $3,000 car in order to avoid going further into debt. I’m worried that a car at that price will end up needing expensive repairs within a few months time. He says that if that’s the case, I would just find another $1,000 - $3,000 car. That idea just scares me. I’m wanting to purchase a reliable, Certified Pre-Owned vehicle such as a 2015-2016 Chevy Cruze or Hyundai Elantra in the $10-11,000 range that would be roughly $150-180/month (60 month term with 3.79% interest rate). But I’m not sure if I should use my tax refund to pay off (or down) a loan with the highest interest rate, or add it to a down payment on a vehicle for a lower monthly payment. Or, I could take my boyfriend’s advice and find a cheapo 2002 Toyota for $2,000.

Any advice, comments, or suggestions would be highly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,Credit Score or Cashflow,"I’m in a spot where I’d like to pay off one of two debts, but don’t know which one first. Hopefully you can help.

Debt:
65k in federal student loans (consolidated) interest is 3.4%-6% $500 per month

Car 17.5k 4.79% interest $355 per month

Past due amount to college 14.5k- no payment as it’s in collections (general revenue corp)

Income:
70k+ before taxes/deductions 
Commission potential of 80k

I have 50k in the bank plus 7k in stocks I can easily sell. 

I’m in the process of moving to a new state so keeping some money in the bank, 6-9 months of living expenses helps me sleep better at night so I’d like to pay off either the car loan so I have that extra cash flow or the account in collections so I have a better credit score (currently 620-650) and can get an apartment i want in the new state.

I tried to settle the other day with collections and they wouldn’t do it, even tried to pay just the principal. They also said they would not remove it from my credit report, only mark it as paid. The school will not talk to me and keeps pointing me in the direction of the collections company.

terms of this will end in 14 months and I am currently paying $244.70/mo

Credit Card: $5121.57 interest rate of 10% APR (used this to pay for summer classes since FAFSA doesn't cover)

Student Loan: Subsidized $3400

I work 24 hours a week and have been saving 30% of my net income for about $400/month. I have built an emergency fund in the amount of $2000 in my checking account and would like to begin to move towards saving/paying off debt since I live at home.

I will be receiving some scholarship money and want to put the entirety of it towards debt (roughly about $3750).

What would be the smartest way to use my money? I know it is typically smarter to pay off the loan with higher interest first which would be my credit card but would it be smart to pay off the car loan and be able to put my monthly payments towards my credit card?

In theory, I am thinking if I choose to leave my internship once I begin my senior capstone project, it may be beneficial to not have my monthly car loan payment of $244/mo.
If I choose to pay off the car first, it would be easier to maintain the lower minimum payments on a credit card versus the monthly car payment, although paying off the car would mean I would allow more interest to accrue on the credit card balance.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

I am a federal employee so I get the 5% match. Last couple years, I have been able to contribute the maximum allowed for the traditional TSP. This year I will max my contribution this year as well. I live in NJ and planning to retire in TX. So I though contributing to the traditional TSP would make more sense.

I am also in the National Guard. Recently, they have introduced the Blended Retirement System - they would match up to 5% if I contribute 5%. 
While the drill pay is not much, I am thinking of contributing 5% in Roth TSP, and get the 5% match from them (free money!). The reason that I'm putting money in Roth TSP from my military pay is because I will max my traditional TSP from my civilian job. I can't contribute more than 18,500 (2 different employers), can I?

I also have a Fidelity Roth IRA account, which I already contributed 5,500 for 2018 on Jan 1. 

-----------------------

Summary of what I (will) contribute in 2018:

Federal Job

- Traditional TSP - 18,500

- Roth TSP - none

Military Job

- Traditional TSP - none

- Roth TSP - 5% 

Fidelity

Roth IRA - 5,500

-----------------------

Questions:

1. Does the amount that I contribute toward Roth TSP from the military, counts toward my 5,500 that I already contributed in my Fidelity Roth IRA ?

2. Since both my employers utilize the TSP, am I going to have 2 separate TSP account or just they're going to join the two together? I have asked Finance and nobody has any idea about it.

3. If they are separate accounts, can I keep my current contribution for the traditional TSP from civilian job, and contribute more $$ to the traditional TSP from my Guard pay? I'm getting deployed soon, not going to spend much so I can certainly save a lot more.

I really don't know if I'm doing it right. Can you guys help point me to the right direction?",finance

As a student I have not held more than a part-time job before and don't know much about finance. I have been reading and searching for people in similar situations, but the situations seemed a bit different. 

Income: $3,000 after taxes in the bank every month. 

Expenses: $1,200 rent/month + ~$300/month utilities (water, electric, waste, sewer) + ~$1000/month for other expenses (groceries, eating out, fuel, etc.)

Loans: I have ~$43k in federal unsubsidized loans @ 5.59% from medical school (some of the other threads I read usually had a lot more). I am doing the basic 10 year level repayment plan @ $500 per month; I chose this option because I'd have to pay the least interest compared to other options. I also don't know if the PSLF was right for me as I did not have a large sum to repay. 

Due to moving expenses and new furniture from starting residency in July and an unexpected expense or two, I have not saved any money since starting and am pretty much going paycheck to paycheck. I have no other debt and have ~$10k in emergency funds. I pay my credit cards off each month. As a resident, our university does not do 401k matching or anything like that; so I thought a Roth IRA might be a good option.

Ripple,"Understanding taxes on gains: If you hold Ripple for less than a year and sell it, you potentially lose a large portion of your investment to Capital Gains Tax.","I'm not extremely savvy and haven't started investing until recently. After looking into Capital Gains Tax, It looks like if you hold assets(Crypto/Any form of stock) for less than a year then you pay A LOT more in taxes as you do if you hold the assets for more than a year. 
 
For example,
I invest $100 in XRP on January 1st, I sell it for $1000 in 3 months. Including state/federal taxes in my area I would pay $170. If I hold for a year and still sell at $1000, I would only pay $36 in taxes. 
**If you hold for less than a year**, being in a higher tax bracket is kind of a big deal. If you're just over $50k/yr, you pay 25% while someone making $45k/yr pays 10%
  

This is because (at $35,000/yr income), I would pay 15% in capital gains Federal tax if I held for less than a year. But by holding longer, the federal side is wiped clean and I would only pay the state tax on it.   
  

 
For anyone like me who is coming in with little knowledge: it's important to understand that if there is a large spike in value after you buy, you need to do some math and make sure it's worth the extra fees that you'll be paying.  
 
As I said, I'm very new to this.  
  
 As a question to those of you with real knowledge: 
Am I accurate in what I've said? Did I miss any major points? What else should young investors like myself have a good understanding about? What's the difference between marginal and effective, and how does that affect the amount of tax that must be paid?",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,My experience with coinbase (Not good),"Hi,

So a few months ago (Around October) I finally decided to have a look at btc and invest a little and see what happened. After only investing a small sum (For me) and making a little profit before the big climb to £15k I decided to invest a larger sum. I made a little bit more and decided to call it quits already.

I went about verifying my account on coinbase depositing a small amount of EUR to verify my bank. Unfortunately I deposited under the amount needed (Never detailed the required amount) and so had to do it again and therefore was charged double the transfer fee (Pain in the ass more than anything).

After about 1 week after the deposit entered my account I attempted to withdraw my balance presuming my bank was verified. It was not. I got into contact with coinbase who replied quickly asking me to ensure my bank was eligible to be verified which I did and informed me my case was handed over to a specialist. This is where things went down hill. 

I replied back to the email stating my account was all good and everything was fine to be verified. A week late. Nothing. I emailed again over a week later stating my account was still unverifed and had had no contact from this so-called specialist. 10 days after my reply they finally got back to me. They told me it can take a few days from when I first tried to verify my bank. It had already taken around 14... the email said to reply if it hadn't been resolved so that's what I did, again stating my account was still not verified.

11 days later I got a reply saying again the same old stuff... another link to check my account was eligible. Another message to ignore this email if it was resolved. Another promise to get back to me ASAP if not...

Luckily my account has now been verified... after a whole month...

I cannot stress this enough. As good as some of the recommendations for coinbase are, their service team seems completely incompetent. lying about specialists. Never giving a clear answer to your request. Stating the same links and lines from the previous email. Bullshit. Avoid them.

TL:DR Coinbase's customer response team gave me the run around for a whole month before verifying my bank account so I could finally withdraw my funds...

personalfinance,Unable to open checking account - what do banks look for?,"I tried to open a checking account recently (in the US) and got denied. I'm not sure exactly why, but here's what happened:

Historically, the only bank account I have ever had is a student checking account, which pays no interest and has no real benefits - though I suppose at least it has no fees either. So I want to open a checking account that will earn me something back.

In the pursuit of high interest rates, I did something which possibly has messed up my banking history and/or credit history (is banking history a thing?).

So, about 6 months ago, I found out that a bank near me had a high-yield checking account (if you jump through some hoops of having X debit transactions, etc.). However, you could only open it if you lived in state A, and I was about to move from state A to state B a month from when I heard about the account. I had the stupid idea that I could open the account under my current address in state A, and then just change the account address later when I moved to state B, and just use the bank's rather good online banking capabilities from there.

The problem was that I was required to receive - in the mail - some documents, and had to send them back by some deadline. The mail didn't end up arriving before I moved away, so by the time the forwarded documents arrived at my new address in state B, the bank closed my account and mailed me a check in the amount of the deposit (which I got two months later...).

So. Fast-forward to now. I have tried to open checking accounts recently with two different banks (one about a month after the first denied me). One was one of the big institutions, and the other was an online bank. Both denied me, and told me that I could request a free credit ~~score~~ report from Equifax in 60 days. So I suppose a credit ~~score~~ report is somehow involved - and I have no credit, so I doubt that was in my favor. (I just applied for and was approved for a secured credit card today, because I really ought to fix this...) It seems like Equifax's website is making it impossible to check that right now, so I don't know what that looks like at the moment.

But did the previous failed checking account count against me?

Did the account closing mess up my financial history? Am I going to be unable to open any bank accounts now/how long will it be until I can open a bank account?

Also, what are all the factors that banks consider when opening a checking account, and how much do they count for? And will I also be unable to open a savings account?",finance

personalfinance,"Have any home owners maintained records of the actual financial cost of owning a home, and paying a mortgage over 30 years, that we can compare versus renting for a lifetime?.","Of course there are many variables, the price and value of the house dependant on location, the amount of deposit, the changes in interest rates, but I think we can work from an average with the figures. My favourite topic of discussion is the mathematics around finance, such as vehicle leasing vs purchasing vs second hand etc, i love this reddit section!. As per title, is there anyone who can inform potential future home owners with figures on actual total expenditures pre and post mortgage, and how your financial standing is as you move towards retirement, and any potential profit margin, which is obviously for your retirement scheme. We can then use this data versus a lifetime rental expenditure, and estimate extra savings a renter could save by not taking a mortgage. Lets set some median standards to work from. 10% deposit is placed on mortgage, at 5% interest over a 30 year loan, buying an existing home or building from new, all information is welcomed for data correlation. Please include all your costings, compulsory insurances, council rates, repairs, renovations, everything it costs during the paying off of the mortgage, and then sale price. Of course the sale price is all money in the retirement savings account, from that perspective its good, so i will break total profit down to weeks taken over mortgage, factor in the expenses, and see if i can  match this with my rental cost plus what i can put directly into savings. Others can work from this too. Thanks!.",finance

personalfinance,Balloon Mortgage Fun,"Hello All:

I am looking for some advice on this “Balloon Mortgage” situation my parents got themselves into. Long story short, my parents took on a balloon mortgage with a Amortization Principal Balance: $351,427.62 with 2% Interest rate. The Balloon has 17 years left, leaving them with $210,874.55 due on 4/1/35.


The neighborhood my parents currently live in has houses much smaller and lower quality that are selling for over 700-800k, which leaves me in an odd situation. Being that this house would be given to me upon my parents departure from earth, It makes me want to start setting aside cash monthly to clear this balance in 17 years from now. I have a salary of 83k at age 25, with decent career growth opportunities, so setting aside $500+ into an investment account a month wouldn’t put a dent in my life. I just see the possible value of this house in 17 years and the ROI could be 4-5 times what I contribute (no guarantee obviously). 


Maybe someone else has dealt with this situation?? I just want some advice on this before I do anything stupid. Am I completely missing something about this situation?",finance

CryptoMarkets,Conspiracy (random paranoid thoughts),"Put on your tin foil hats for a second just for fun.

The NSA created Bitcoin under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, for the purposes of creating a cashless society.  Ever wonder why no one knows who he is, and why he's anonymous?

The barrier to a cashless society was, and still is, anonymous transactions.  People love credit cards and debit cards, but they want to keep cash to have some level of privacy.  The fact that every transaction is recorded on a debit card means that you have no privacy with your purchases.  Blockchain solves this problem.  (It's not just the people who want private transactions, the CIA does too, for matters only the really aware will understand).

Sounds crazy, I know, but follow me.

Say the Fed wants to lead us into a cashless society, and they just introduced a coin themselves.  The people would have found reasons to resist it.  Any little criticism would have come into play.  We might have rejected it.  Instead, if they allow people to make money with crypto first, the people will have favorable feelings towards crypto (especially since they've spent time defending it and arguing for it among their peers).  Now when they roll out their own, the people (already psychologically in favor of crypto) will be more likely to accept it (especially if they had gotten rich from it).

Now, the government doesn't really want us able to make anonymous transactions, they love to track us and our every move.  Enter the mark of the beast.  A chip which you must have in order to buy and sell.  A chip that contains your personal balance, and prevents anyone else from spending your money.

Sounds crazy, I know.

Right now, people losing their crypto to hacks, accidents, thefts, are a real problem.  If we were all rich, but lost our crypto because of a programming error or major hack, we might be in favor of this chip, to prevent future loss.  A way to verify how much a person has, to prevent any type of a loss from hackers, would be accepted by most people at this point.

Also, the stock markets falling and a subsequent dollar collapse could really move the masses towards crypto.  The market dropped 666 points on the 33rd day of the year.  Again, only the really aware will understand the significance of this ""coincidence"", but if this crash is being orchestrated, there are only 2 options.  Intentional worldwide economic collapse, or a move towards crypto.  

Trump has made comments about an upcoming ""storm"".  Wonder what he's referring to...

gaming,"Retiring from Overwatch, looking for a new FPS game to play similar to Overwatch.","I can't take Overwatch anymore. It is absolutely disgusting and hard to play with other members. Here are some reasons why I just hate this game now.

**Community**

The community is very toxic. When you are trying your best in a game and lose, usually they would blame it on someone and it would usually mean an off-meta hero such as Hanzo for example. Even if you are doing quite well in the game and try your best to carry the team, they will blame it on you in the end even though you are the only guy on fire and have all the gold medals to yourself. 

Not only do they blame people for their own fault, they just throw for fun. When people throw in a game, usually it is a loss. When you beg and beg a player not to throw over stupid reasons such as taking their character or a player not doing their best, they throw and it would usually end in a loss. Overwatch is a team game and when one random guy doesn't feel like cooperating, its game over.

With hero balances, the community comes into play and complain about it. Most nerfs and buffs, in my opinion, came from community complaints and Blizzard is just left clueless in the end on how to fix it. No one is giving out a clear message to Blizzard on how to deal with these balances. In the end, Blizzard ends up nerfing them too hard or buffing them too hard. Roadhog is a great example before his 33% reduction because everyone who complained about Roadhog **COULDN'T DODGE THE HOOK AND ENDED UP GETTING KILLED.** This pissed off players and of course instead of learning how to dodge a hook, they complain about it and nerf him to death. Roadhog still had a ton of counters before his nerf.

Also, the most stupid thing about the community is the reports. This is probably my third time getting reported for no absolute reason and getting silenced for 24-days this time. It hasn't even been a week or two yet from getting out from my previous silence and in a flash, I'm silenced. The reporting system is a joke and players can just spam reports on an account on a person they hate. I'm being honest to God, I never try to be toxic. Surely, not every person is perfect and will act toxic from time to time, but, I'm not always toxic. If I'm getting reported for saying silly jokes like, ""Oh no, we got a female playing DPS"" in a joking manner and getting silenced while other players get extremely toxic and say, ""I hope you fucking die and uninstall this game since you are absolute shit"" and get away with it then I'm done. I even report players that go full beyond toxic and they don't get any punishments in the end. I can tell because of their new report system which tells the player if their report was successful in punishing a player which has never happened, yet.

**Gameplay**

Gameplay is absolute trash. Blizzard has no clue on how to nerf or buff a hero. I don't think Roadhog deserved a nerf when it came to that 33% damage reduction because people don't know how to dodge. **DODGE THE HOOK.** Why are you complaining to Blizzard that Roadhog's Hook Ability is overpowered? Learn how to dodge it. Also, before his 33% damage reduction, his 4 clips slow shotgun weapon was fine with his take a breather which makes him stand still and take no damage reduction. Most people that play Roadhog are FUCKED when they miss the hook and can't aim at characters before the patch. You can ABUSE the hog when he is solo picking people since he is ALONE and you can KILL HIM easily since he is fat. He can also charge up your ultimates pretty easily. Also, remember, when he takes a breather while he couldn't move, it would have been easy to kill him. There are counters to the Hog still such as Zarya or Ana which can fuck him up even better.

Heroes that didn't deserve a buff are like Junkrat. Junkrat requires no skill at all and he gets buffed way more for no god-damn reason. Blizzard complains about 1 shot abilities so they nerf Roadhog. Blizzard has no complaints about 2 shot abilities though since those are fair. They don't even seem like 2 shot abilities. It takes 2 shots in a second to kill someone which is absolutely unfair. (Cough, Junkrat left-click, shift, right-click, cough) Junkrat didn't need extra mines to kill people and Junkrat doesn't need a Rip-Tire buff to make it go faster than fucking sonic. People would say that you can DODGE or even SHOOT at the tire, but, most people can't shoot at the fucking tire so it usually kills at least a player and you can't outrun that bitch so you are either dead either way. Also, what sucks is that he doesn't even look at you or aim for anyone and he still gets kills. ITS THAT RIDICULOUS. What I hate the most about Junkrat is that characters like Phara or Soldier can splash damage themselves and characters like Phara or Tracer who can kill themselves with their ults can happen BUT NOT JUNKRAT. He takes no skill and when he requires no skill, he doesn't get punished for it. Also, his charge is highly fast to get so he gets his riptire very easily.

Clearly, in my opinion, Blizzard favors the unskill &gt; skill players. Anything that doesn't require skill gets buffed way more (Cough, Sym, Cough, Junkrat, Cough) Those are some heroes in my opinion that get buffed and really didn't need one. Also, like I said, they don't know how to buff or nerf a hero. It is just absolutely ridiculous.

**TLDR**

Community is toxic. Gameplay sucks.

**Conclusion**

So I'm trying to find another FPS game which is fun and addictive to play that has a RANKED system and has at least a decent community. I can't do Overwatch anymore and it is just killing me every time I try to play with other players. Any suggestions?",technology

personalfinance,Laid off after nearly ten years with my company. I have questions about Unemployment Insurance.,"Hi, /r/personalfinance,

I got laid off last Tuesday.  I was staffed at this company (that I don't want to name here) for almost ten years, so thank god I walked with a package.  Severance payments -as I understand it- will pay me out through September, on a bi-weekly basis, same amount/frequency as I've been making for the past decade.  I should say, for transparency, I'm in NYC.

My question is: I was told to file for unemployment, but when exactly can I do this?  NY Labor Law says if I get a severance, which I am getting, then I can't receive benefits simultaneously.  That's all well and good -- I don't want to double dip and take more than I need.  But it seems like from what I've read online it's better to apply sooner rather than later, no? 

All I've done at this point is register an online account on the NY Labor site.  I haven't ""applied"" for anything or filed a claim of any kind.  Should I apply now or wait until September? How exactly does one apply -- is it simply by ""filing a claim""? 

Speaking with someone who works in the UI office would clear things up I'm sure, but when I call their hotline, the automated thing blocks me from speaking with a person, and just loops menu options. 

Any help/clarity/guidance would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,Have 15K to invest; should I use DCA or just drop it in?,"I got a new job plus got a small windfall and am putting my financial house in order.  I'm recently out of debt and have an emergency fund.  Beyond that I'm just started getting into saving/investing beyond the ""employer defaults"" I've used in the past.  I'm still educating myself on all this, but figure it'd probably be best to start sooner with good defaults then sit around for ages.  

I'm planning on putting ~15K into an investment account over the next month which is currently sitting in a savings account (just funded the first 1K at Vanguard).  About 10K of that is going to IRAs for 2017 and 2018 and the default plan for the rest is to stick it in an investment account made of up ETFs.  I also plan to add another 15K or so in monthly savings throughout the year; more budgeting to come so I will likely improve on that.  I don't have a defined strategy for the IRAs/investments right now, but expect I'll be starting with some of the default 2-3 Vanguard ETF portfolios.  Retirement is like 30 years away and the remainder I would guess I'll be able to hold for 5 years at least.  

So my question:  normally I would be inclined to immediately just buy the portfolio outright.  That said, I don't really follow the markets closely, but uncertainty seems to be up and the general feeling seems to be that with rising interest rates and the like, we may get a correction soon.  

So is buying outright the best strategy?  Should I be thinking about some kind of DCA strategy where I stick everything into safer investments and transferring 10% out monthly into the higher-risk/higher-reward funds? 

Or is this just an example of overthinking and by definition ""the price is always right"" for stocks?",finance

personalfinance,Questions on federal student loans after repayment begins.,"Hi /r/personalfinance 

I'm wondering a few things about my student loans, as I'm trying to plan how to finish paying them off ($27k left! woo!)

* Is there any difference in subsidized vs unsubsidized loans, after the grace period ends?
* When choosing which loans to target first, should you **always** pick highest interest first, or is there any value in closing lower rate loans if the principal is significantly lower?
* I have a 50% up to 7% 401K matching at work so I'm vested at 7%. Is there an easy way to estimate whether it would be more effective to put that money into my student loans, or is that very unlikely? My 401K is all in index funds with &lt;1% fees.

personalfinance,(Tx) Are business checking and CCs necessary for a very small business?,"I'm a small time freelancer looking to expand my business. I am registered with my state, and pay both federal and state taxes. I bring in between $3k - $6k a year. My profit is around $2k - $4k a year.

It's been suggested to me to get a business account and credit card through my credit union. Mainly because I plan on getting into selling physical items, which would require more expenses and potentially could earn me more.

stocks,One thing I don't get about corporate tax cuts...,"Although many companies have been exhalting the benefits of lowered corporate tax cuts and thus is the reason behind bullish guidance and a sharp jump in stock prices seen thus far. How can we explain that some growth stocks that have seen the biggest gains either produce a small profit or no profit currently and thus benefit very little from the tax cuts. In fact I would think these companies may be less favored due to the prospect of rising interest rates since they have a considerable amount of debt on their balance sheets.

Some may say that once these companies start earning huge profits that they'll eventually benefit from tax cuts but by that time if Trump doesn't work out we could have a socialist in the White House with democrats controlling both houses and we could see a reversal of the cuts.

btc,The Perfect Bitcoin Auction Storm: the $830MM in BTC Seized from Infraud and the $1.7 Billion in BTC Seized in Bulgaria,"Last week Sergey Medvedev was arrested in Bangkok. This was part of a coordinated international raid that netted the arrest of 13 people across the globe associated with darkweb site ""Infraud"" as reported widely in the press:

https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/feb/9/sergey-medvedev-russian-cybercrime-suspect-arreste/

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-russia-cybercrime-dark-web-market-suspect-sergey-medvedev-thailand/

Apparently, Medvedev was the administrator of the escrow service that Infraud ran to prevent members from ripping each other off in their transactions that seem to have been centered largely on stolen credit card information and devices to steal such info. (See https://krebsonsecurity.com/2018/02/u-s-arrests-13-charges-36-in-infraud-cybercrime-forum-bust/).   

Since transactions were (of course) conducted using bitcoin, Thai police are reporting that they have seized 100k BTC from Medvedev (worth $830MM USD at the moment). How Thai police could have gotten his private keys is a matter that has been debated on Reddit since the arrest.  While one commenter humorously suggested that skillfully applied 50 baht pliers could circumvent any digital security measures, it is obvious that many nefarious forms of ""advanced interrogation"" could have produced the private keys.  

What isn't clear, is what will happen to those nearly $1 Billion USD in BTC. Will the Thai police keep them? Will the US Government end up with them? Will they split them? Most importantly, will they be sold off?

The US Marshal's Service obviously has a track record of selling off BTC with the most notable example being the Silk Road Auction in 2014 after the arrest of Ross Ulbricht where Tim Draper and others bought huge chunks of the seizure at auction.  

Obviously, an $830 million USD BTC auction would make a lot of headlines and could have a significant impact on BTC markets regardless of what the eventual auction winners planned to do with the coins. But, a lingering question remains: What if Medvedev coins weren't the only ones seized?

The Thai police announced the BTC they seized. But, the coordinated international dragnet also involved law enforcement in the U.S., Britain, Australia, France, Italy, Kosovo, and Serbia.  Chances are good that there was additional BTC seized from the other 12 individuals. Luckily, the Department of Justice's Grand Jury Indictment of those people might give us a clue how much the DOJ thought those individuals MIGHT have.

Here is the grand jury indictment of 36 people that led to that arrest. (https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1032021/download) As the US gov't is eager to seize any and all ill-gotten gain in such arrests, the document contains a bullet list of how much money the government would like to seize from each of the indicted defendants. The forfeiture list starts on page 46.   

In the case of Medvedev, and certain other ringleaders and others, the list just shows ""To be calculated"".  This makes sense since Medvedev was apparently running Infraud's escrow service and the Feds didn't know how much Infraud BTC would be under Medvedev's control. But, for 21 of the other defendants, the indictment does list actual dollar amount. My quick back of the napkin addition is showing that these amounts add up to something like $566,047,662.74.  Obviously, it's possible the arrested individuals didn't have these amounts, these amounts were not longer in BTC, the other 12 individuals actually arrested were not the ones on the list that correspond to the higher dollar amounts, or the arresting authorities were unable to recover these amounts. But, these are the amounts the DOJ would have been very happy to seize from these individuals.   

But, in any case, it wouldn't be at all surprising if at least another $200 Million in BTC was seized from the other 12 arrested individuals. So, if we add this amount to Medvedev's $830 million, we could easily be talking about $1 Billion USD in BTC.  

On top of this $1 Billion in Infraud BTC, we also have yet to account for the 213,519 BTC seized by Bulgarian authorities last May. (See https://www.coindesk.com/bulgarian-government-sitting-3-billion-bitcoin/) Apparently, Bulgaria has been refusing to comment on what has or will happen to those coins. But, what we do know is that those coins would be worth something like $1.7 Billion USD today.   

So, between these two raids, we would have $2.7 Billion in seized BTC. Here's the nightmare scenario: some combination of the US/Thailand/Others in the Infraud Law Enforcement Coalition decide to auction off the Infraud coins, then Bulgaria doesn't want to get beat to the punch and they decide to auction off their seized coins.   

All of the sudden, we are staring down the barrel of a $2.7 billion USD BTC auction season.    Some will call it far-fetched and impossible. But, the timing is perfect. 

The BTC market has basically just been steadily falling since the peak.The Bulgarian authorities seized their coins in May and watched the price skyrocket until December. Why sell since the market was just rising and rising.  Now, they have seen the BTC market fall and fall for two months. Last week, the Bulgarians get the news that the US and the other arresting countries may suddenly have their own treasure trove of $1 billion USD in seized BTC. Now there may be two or more players in the mega cap bulk BTC sales game...plus prices are falling. The Bulgarians may just decide to unleash those coins. We already know that the US Marshals are more than happy to auction off huge amounts of coins at a whim. We also know that the press would LOVE to report on billion dollar bitcoin auctions, and that the resulting headlines could very likely affect the behavior of casual investors and newbs:  “They’re going to sell a BILLION dollars of them….yeah, hard pass on buying for now.” That could be the case even if it turns out that Bulgaria has already stealthily and slowly sold off their coins. 

The only remaining question is, whatever the chance may be of any of this occurring, what would the impact be on the market if some version of this DOES HAPPEN involving any substantial portion of the Infraud and/or Bulgarian coins?

tl;dr
We could have a hell of a bulk BTC auction season coming up!",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Pay off student loans first or manage payments alongside investments?,"Hi everyone, hoping for some advice.

I recently graduated with my MBA and have a very stable job situation. I make just under 6 figures before bonuses and actively contribute to a 401k, HSA, R-IRA, and an individual brokerage. I recently refinanced my student loans (~$95k in total) at a fixed 5% interest rate. 

My question is focused primarily on my brokerage account as I plan on continuing at the same contribution rate for my tax advantages accounts. Over the last 4 years I've average a ~15% return in my brokerage account which is primarily index funds and bonds. My monthly payment on my loans is around $800 and I can comfortably pay off my loans in ~15 years. However, if I take my current brokerage contribution and add it to my loan payment then I can pay it off in 8-10 years. Does it make sense to do this even though my average rate of return on the investment account is greater than the interest rate on my debt by ~10%? Am I leaving money on the table?

personalfinance,Planning for the future - better to save and buy a home with cash or plan for 20% down and mortgage?,"I've read a lot of previous posts on this topic, but couldn't seem to find a definitive answer that would work for my situation.

I'm currently planning to buy a condo in 2-3 years, for around $250K. Because I'm not planning to buy right now, I know that leaves certain things like inflation on the price of the condo and mortgage interest rates a little up in the air. As it stands now, I could afford 20% down easily and would qualify for a good interest rate (high credit score/no bad history). I also would be a first time homebuyer, so would have some benefits there. However, I'm confident that in about 3 years time, I'd be able to save the full cost of the condo and pay in cash if I wanted to. From what I've gathered, the benefits there are not paying mortgage interest, having a piece of mind that I own the home/no debt (which is huge for me), and potential for better negotiation on the selling price of the condo since I'm paying in cash. Drawback is no tax credit and potential first time homeowner benefits lost. 

I am confident that I want to stay in the location I'm planning to buy in long-term and would not have any plans to move or purchase a bigger place in the future. And because it is a condo, even if I pay in cash, I will still have monthly HOA fees in addition to taxes, insurance, etc. As it stands, the funds I'd use for this purchase are in a 1% interest savings account, and that is likely where I'd keep the rest of the accumulated funds to pay in cash. I have no debt and would not touch any retirement funds/investments to make this purchase. Any advice on which path to take in my situation? I'll admit I would personally prefer to pay cash, but I want to know if there's anything huge I'm overlooking that would advantage a mortgage.",finance

On the other hand, I have dug myself into quite a hole and feel like there is no way out. At least I don't know how to begin to dig myself out of it.

A little backstory about me. I am 35 years old and have a 5 month old daughter at home. She means everything in the world to me and is the main reason I am looking to get my life and finances in order. I have a history of partying and spending extremely frivolously but have since stopped after hearing my girlfriend was pregnant with our daughter.

I have a fairly decent paying job (60k+) but can't seem to build up a savings and stop living paycheck to paycheck. I currently have about 30k in debt and don't seem to be making much of a dent throughout the years. I currently only have 20k in retirement, and horrible credit (580). Pathetic I know.........

What is the best way to approach this and start turning my finances around so I can stop living paycheck to paycheck and finally build a savings account, contribute to my 401k, rebuild credit, and start building financial freedom for myself and daughter. I don't want her to suffer for the mistakes I've made throughout my life and just want to do right by her.

I appreciate any and all help or advice that is given. As this is Reddit I'm sure the trashing and shit talking will come along with it so that is welcome as well. If somebody reads this and is serious about guiding me, please feel free to ask anything you feel is needed to help understand my situation. I will be very open and honest and answer all questions truthfully.

personalfinance,"Saving for a down payment, or not?","I just left the extremely lucrative, but not consistent, world of self employment for a consistent paycheck at a regular 9-5 job. I did this for the sole purpose of the peace of mind I would personally need to sign the dotted line on a mortgage.

I live in an area where USDA loans are allowed, and kind of always just assumed that that would be the way I would go. Who wouldn't want a low interest, no PMI, no down payment loan? Well, it turns out they have income restrictions, and I do not qualify.

The way interests rates have been going, I'm looking to get a 15 year loan and put 20% down. It will take me 10 months of saving to get there. My questions is, is it worth it to wait for 10 months to get into a home, or should I jump now (prices are fairly low in my area during winter)?

A little bit more detail: I'm looking to get a home with a maximum loan of $250k. My current rent is $600/mo, utilities included. My current savings is around $25k. I would be saving $3500 a month for ten months to get to $60k, leaving me with $10k in the bank after putting down $50k.

I'm worried that in 10 months prices and interest rates will have raised enough that a $250k home now would be a $300k home, or more, then. If I get a loan now, and interest rates drop, I can always refinance to a lower rate, but if rates rise and I wait, I can't refinance to the current rates.

My math skills aren't adding up enough for me to figure out how much longer it would take for me to pay down to 80% and skip out on the monthly PMI payments if I were to buy now (putting $5 to $10k down on a $250k loan).

personalfinance,Paying off credit card debt with savings,"Over the last few years I accumulated quite a bit of credit card debt. In January 2017 I hit my peak at about 10K in credit debt. I made a conscious decision then to be more responsible, avoid using my card for unnecessary purchases and put more money into monthly payments. It was a rocky year, I sometimes had to swipe for things I couldn't afford like car repairs or health, but overall I stuck with my goal and paid down about 5K of the original 10K. I'm not thrilled with the results though as I still have quite a while longer to go. I am also worried as it looks like I will have more monthly expenses this year (insurance and rent increases as well as student loan payments kicking in). If I am being reasonable with myself, I estimate based on my expected budget that I will only be able to pay about $300 or so a month unless I  get a decent raise (working on that). With that payment estimate and my credit card interest rate, I am looking at 20+ months left and paying nearly 1K in interest (assuming I don't end up using my card for ""emergencies"" again). 

Now I recently came into a ""small"" sum of money, about 10K. This is sitting in a savings account with the intent to save it for a down payment on a home. This is effectively my only savings. Aside from this 10K, I save monthly for my annual/bi-annual bills. (Things like car insurance, vehicle registration, etc.) I put money aside each month so when those bills come up I am ready. So I consider that savings to be untouchable as it would put me in a bad position if I spent it now. And then I have a 401K that I contribute to with employer matching, but I don't consider that spendable saving either. 

So my question really is, does it make sense to pay down the ~5K credit debt now by pulling from my 10K savings? I fear that cutting into this chunk will really hurt my ability to gather a down payment for a home any time soon. I feel that buying a home could help with my long term finances since rent in my area is incredibly high. From one view, paying down the debt with my savings is like getting a 0% loan. I can keep that estimated extra 1K in interest I would be paying to the credit card company. I also feel a weird sense of pride in the progress I made in my debt so far. Paying the rest off with my savings almost feels like cheating, and I worry that it won't help me to learn the value of saving and paying down debt.

Has anyone else been in this position and like to share their experience with the choice they made? What choice did you make? Was it the right one? Etc.

Thanks. 



Edit:

Based on everyone's advice and other information I have been reading here I decided to go ahead and pay off my credit card. It feels great! Now I just need to make sure I implement a solid budge to avoid spending the money I have freed up by not needing to make monthly credit payments. Thanks everyone!",finance

Rental rates in my city are about $1500 for the same size as the condo. Which means we can rent for the same amount we are paying for the mortgage. 

My dilemma is that the student loans have a higher interest rate than the property value is increasing plus the $326 in principal payment per month. Is it a good idea to sell the condo, pay off the high interest student loans, and rent. The benefit is that student loan payments will go down, leaving us more money to save up for another down payment, and reduce our total debts by a sizable chunk.",finance
personalfinance,Should I push to eliminate PMI?,"I am 30 years old and we have lived in the house for almost 3 years and are scheduled to eliminate PMI (190/mo) in May of 2023.  The interest rate is under 4%.  We have more than enough income and are ~maxing our 401k and investing a bit on the side but we have a lot of additional income that we plan to start allocating.

One option would be to put $750 (or more or less) a month to principal until the mortgage hits 22% which would be March 2021 at that rate.  Is that worth doing?  Would we be better off just investing that money?  We are interested in buying a second vacation property which right now looks like it would be $50k in about 5 years.  We also have a kid due very soon but that 750 I mentioned is after we have budgeted more than enough for care and a 529.

stocks,Did we just witness the largest cash grab in history?,"I remember thinking back in Dec when I heard that retail money was pushing things up in certain stocks we might be headed for trouble.  Then my broker went down off and on for 2 weeks right at the end of the year, and maybe the first week of 2018.  I assumed it was something to do with Meltdown/Spectre, but they put out a notice saying they had 3x more trading volume than they anticipated at their highest estimates.  That's when I knew we would crash, and soon.  About Jan 11 I started shorting things like mad but I was way too early, and had some really poor picks.  I made out OK, but I really should have had the month of my life.

Once the bonds hit 2.80ish Santelli was all over it calling this crash (IIRC close to a week before toppled).  He was spot on with that call, and every rally we've had since pushes the TNX back up to 2.84ish and equities completely collapse in the afternoon.

This cycle just seems so fishy to me - a metric ton of retail money comes in during the start of the year, bonds get skittish and we drop.  Fundamentals are all the same across the board, and the fed is not that big of a question in my mind.  3 or 4 doesn't matter as much as the news claims, what always matters is how do the big boys make their money.  I just couldn't believe in my mind that that we wouldn't get routed with all that money on the table in Jan.  I don't really know the mechanics of how it works, but it could be just as simple as a few big players realizing the opportunity to push up the bond yield was on the table.

Anybody have any thoughts on this?  Do I smoke too much weed?  I think if this line of thinking is right we're going to see several more attempts at crushing the retailers who are still holding.  I traded through both 2000 and 2008, and one thing that always surprises me is how long this shit can last, however cycles are accelerating exponentially it seems, so maybe next week we'll hit new highs again.",finance

datascience,"All signs say the new model is better, but the old model outperforms after awhile...","Let's say I have a project in which I'm identifying the riskiest volcanoes in the world, according to the likelihood they erupt and the potential impact of the eruption. I have a bunch of information about these volcanoes, including the rates at which similar volcanoes have erupted.

Now, the baseline risk assessment is calculated using two components: a likelihood factor and an impact factor. The likelihood factor says how likely a given volcano is to erupt. The impact factor quantifies how widespread the eruption could potentially be. Both factors were computed using ""business rules"" --- no machine learning or advanced statistics were involved.

My client wants me to better identify risk, incorporating other factors, too. So after turning over seemingly every stone and developing an analytic dataset whose features ""wow"" the client, I went about building a machine learning model. This model, by many measures, outperforms the traditional risk assessment in terms of its ability to identify the riskiest volcanoes. The model outputs a probability, I add that probability to the impact ""axis,"" and we get a new, continuous risk score.

Rank-ordering the top 100 volcanoes by both the new and old risk assessment, it turns out that 50% of the top 100 riskiest volcanoes, according to the new model, actually erupt. Only 10% erupt for the top 100 riskiest old-model volcanoes.

Where things get interesting, though, is in the middle, i.e. as the number of volcanoes to ""review"" increases. My client wants to basically ""bump up"" in terms of risk the currently-identified-as-lower-risk volcanoes. While the new model is often correct when saying ""this volcano is really risky -- I mean it,"" it still deems quite a few volcanoes as ""low risk."" These volcanoes erupt and shit really hits the fan -- this is really the opposite of what the client wants.

So, basically, the new risk model is really great through about the top 100 volcanoes, but then the old model catches up about halfway through the 300 volcanoes in our population, and actually outpaces the new model pretty significantly towards the end...

Anyone have any thoughts/ideas about what could be the issue, here? I've run statistical tests six ways from Sunday on both the new and old (deconstructed and fed into an ML model) assessments. Everything seems to favor the new one, while in practice the old one seems to perform better over the long haul.

Another question I have is: how would you best ""bucketize"" the volcanoes, combining the likelihood and impact axes (two separate vectors)? One thought I had was to look at the historical proportions associated with each bucket (say, High and Low risk), and just maintain that proportion for the new risk assessment.

Note: in testing the two models side-by-side, I performed a typical train-test split and only calculated results/outcomes based off the test dataset.

Edit: after a long weekend of work and today entirely devoted towards fixing this issue, I've actually removed the ""impact"" portion of the model (the impact ""axis""). The probabilities by themselves perform much better than probabilities + impact variable, so I'm going to leave it at that for awhile.

personalfinance,Extra 1099 causes domino of tax and other problems,"Apologies if this is the wrong sub. If it is, please tell me a better one.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

**tl;dr** Company sent out an accidental but incorrect second 1099 and the IRS, state tax agency, and the SSA are all after me for ""money owed"" on income that never existed.

I am nearing 60. 10 years ago I qualified for SSDI and three years ago started working a very p/t job as a 1099 contractor, with the income under the SSDI SGA limit. The company I contract with is very small, under 20 people.

At the end of my first year, the company's accounting firm sent out two copies of my 1099-MISC.  Both are identical except for the ""Account Number"" field. 

The catch is that I didn't know until early last year when the IRS demanded taxes on the second income.  I asked my company to email me a copy of my 1099-MISC form, and I got the two. 

The company promptly sent updated/amended 1099-MISC forms to the IRS, with one form voided.  I contacted the IRS and they had me send them copies of the duplicate forms as well as the one marked VOID.

In the year since I've sent them this information three times. The accounting firm sent the a letter saying that this was their fault, not mine.  My case is still considered ""unresolved.""

This fell out further. My state income tax division sent me a letter saying that I didn't pay taxes for that year. I sent them a copy of my cancelled check and they said it was no longer an issue. My bank just notified me that the state has applied for a garnishment of my bank account for the amount of taxes on the (non-existant) second income, plus, of course, interest and fees.

Then the SSA got wind of this, and despite my sending them all the documentation I could find, and the accounting firm sending them a letter as well, the SSA determined that in that year they had ""overpaid"" me because I went over the SGA (with the non-existent second income).  

I promptly filed an appeal and the local office asked for more documentation, which I immediately sent.  

They are now demanding the year's worth of payments or they will cut off my SSDI payments for the rest of this year (2018), to make it up. When I contacted the local SSA office, they said they have no record of my appeal, despite them asking for further documentation.

In short, between the IRS, the state, and the SSA, I have agencies demanding around $20k from me, all from income that I have never seen. Without the SSDI my income will drop to about $13k for the year. 

At this point I have no idea where to turn or what to do.  The people on the IRS 800# are so very friendly and helpful, but they can only tell me what information they have - I know they don't make the decisions.  (On the other hand, the people on the SSA 800# are... probably being fed ground glass or something. [Apologies to anyone who works for the SSA.])

Any thoughts or advice, or telling me where I should have made this post, is much appreciated. Thank you again for reading.",finance

First some background:

I will be graduating in December of this year as an engineer and I have a job offer waiting at my place of internship. Although I wasn't given a formal offer yet in writing, my boss has said that I can join full time anytime I want, just to let him know. It is at a very big firm, and I have two degrees - Economics/Finance and Civil Engineering. I don't know what they will offer me in salary, but I am hoping to get between $65,000 - $70,000 (hopefully that is fair for living in New York City).

I have about $133,483 in debt by my excel sheet calculations and cross checking online. All of these are federal loans with a mix of subsidized and unsubsidized loans. The reason I have this large debt is because I went to medical school for 2 years but had to drop out - my father passed away and I fell into depression. I could have continued and finished but my mother also fell into depression and with my sister going out of state for college, I decided to drop out and come home to start working and taking care of things.

Here is the information of my loans

Subsidized Loans:

1. $4,4923 (4.5%)

2. $4,947 (5.6%)

3. $3,059 (6.8%)

4. $4,001 (6.0%)

5. $8,838 (5.0%)

6. $5,500 (4.29%)

7. $570 (3.76%)

Unsubsidized Loans:

1. $10,250 (6.21%) - $2,242.59 interest accrued

2. $25,425 (7.21%)  - $6,458.58 interest accrued

3. $12,000 (5.41%) - $2,653.59 interest accrued

4. $21,499 (6.8%)  - $6,128.11 interest accrued

5. $7,000 (4.29%) - $661.84 interest accrued

6. $6,930 (3.76%) - $318.92 interest accrued

7. $7,570 (4.45%) - $77.02 interest accrued



Savings from working part-time at firm: $16,000

Paid off one unsubsidized loan in the amount of $8,500 (7.9%).

personalfinance,Should I buy a house in NJ?,"28 single, no kids, no debt.

Over $100k in a money market account. Contributing heavily to my 401k.

Own my car outright and it is newer (so hopefully no unexpected repairs around the corner).

Make $100k a year, I think it works out to be $74,112 after taxes.

Property tax will be between 2 &amp; 3 percent.

A lender said I could spend $500k on a house.

Assume the house is $500k, I put $100k down, property tax is 2% and the interest rate is 4%. My monthly payment should be right around $2,810. These figures are for a 30 year fixed mortgage.

My monthly gross income would be $100,000 / 12 = $8,333.33

So 2,810 / 8,333.33 * 100 = 33.72% which is under 36%.

I feel like I can't actually afford a house this expensive...

I've heard the conservative estimate of no more than 1/4 of your monthly take home pay for your monthly payment. That means I couldn't spend more than $1,544. If I were to follow this I should really be looking at houses that cost $300k or less.

Another rule would be no more than 1/3rd of your after tax income. This means my monthly payment should be around $2,058. If I saved more  for my down payment let's say 130k and the house costs 400k my monthly payment would sit around $2,000.

I won't be raising a family any time soon. I could have a few roommates for a few years and I wouldn't mind much. Right now I have no planned roommates so I can't rely on having them pay for anything.

Another rule I heard is no more than twice your gross income, for me this would be $200k which means barely getting a condo in the areas i'm looking.",finance

personalfinance,A View Inside the Timeline and Economics of the Simultaneous Sale and Purchase of Real Estate,"After nearly six years in our current home, my wife and I decided early in 2017 to sell and buy a bigger place.  I went online looking for PF posts from people who had shared their experience of buying and selling simultaneously, or other blogs or resource discussing the process and economics of doing both transactions at once, and I couldn’t find much.  Since I track my spending closely, as well as my calendar, I realized I could pull something together to help others in the future.  Below, I’ll lay out the basics of what we were doing, some items that were unique to our situation, and then a blow-by-blow of the process, every penny spent, and the net impact on our finances every step of the way.  

Your process will be different from mine.  Your numbers will be different, too.  This isn’t meant to be a definitive, end-all-be-all guide, but rather a view into what we experienced and what it took for us to get through this.  Hopefully it is helpful to anyone heading into a simultaneous sale and purchase and looking to find out what to expect along the way.

&amp;nbsp;

**A Primer on the Purchase and Sale Process**

Because I’ve seen some confusion in the past, here, in very broad strokes, are the steps involved in selling and buying a home:

*Selling:*

1 - Hire an agent

2 - Prepare your home for sale

3 - List the property

4 - Show the property

5 - Get offers (and negotiate as necessary)

6 - Accept an offer

7 - Agree on Purchase &amp; Sale (P&amp;S) Agreement terms

8 - Move out

9 - Close the sale, take the money, and hand over the keys

&amp;nbsp;

*Buying:*

1 - Get pre-approved for a mortgage and determine what you can afford

2 - Hire an agent

3 - Tour properties and attend open houses

4 - Make an offer (and negotiate as necessary)

5 - Agree on offer terms

6 - Get a home inspection

7 - Agree on P&amp;S Agreement terms

8 - Get a mortgage

9 - Close the sale, write a big check, and take the keys

10 - Move in

The P&amp;S is usually signed a week after the offer is accepted.  The closing is usually 35-40 days after the P&amp;S is signed.  

The added complication when doing both things simultaneously is to line up the steps in a way in which you reduce financial risk while also avoiding a period of homelessness.

We purchased our first home (a condo) in the Boston area in late 2011 for approximately $450,000.  Did a cash-out refinance in summer 2015.  Sold it for $700,000 in summer 2017.  As part of our sale, we negotiated use and occupancy of our home for three weeks post-sale.

Purchased our new house (a single-family) in the Boston area for $700,000 in summer 2017.  

As a requirement for a new mortgage (and, frankly, because of my risk tolerance!) we couldn’t own two homes at the same time – we had to complete the sale of our first home before we could complete the purchase our new home.  Ultimately, we made an offer to purchase our new home the day we signed the P&amp;S on our first home, and we closed the sale of our first home a week to the day before we closed the purchase of our new home.

&amp;nbsp;

**Work Necessary to Sell Our First Home**

Generally, you will need to do some work (structural or cosmetic) on your current home to make it sellable, or in an effort to increase the sale price.  For us, there were four main buckets of work:  

1 - Empty the condo of a lot of our stuff.  We had to do this both to give us the ability to more easily refinish our floors and repaint, and so our home looked more attractive and larger in photos and during tours and open houses.  In our case, we purchased some boxes for $55, and rented a large storage unit near us at a cost of $268 a month for four months, for a total cost of $1,127.

2 - In the process of emptying our condo, we decided to get rid of three old wardrobes and nine bookcases.  We disassembled them ourselves, but hired 1-800-Got-Junk to remove them at a cost of $358.  We moved a lot of clothing to storage, but still needed something to organize what was left, and ultimately replaced the wardrobes with a new dresser at a cost of $411.

3 - We repainted our entire condo, and built three new radiator covers.  We did all this ourselves, and had material costs of about $535.

4 – We hired someone to refinish and repair our floors, which were nearly 100 years old and needed a lot TLC.  In addition to the direct costs of this work, this also involved my family moving into a hotel for the better part of a week while the work was done.  Total costs of $6,095.

&amp;nbsp;

**Other Items of Note**

We interviewed three potential real estate agents for our sale, and ultimately decided to hire a Redfin agent.  Our buyer’s agent in the process was a different Redfin agent, the same individual we had used to purchase our first home.  (One specialized in buying, the other in selling, which is why we have two different agents.  You might be able to do both transactions with the same agent.)  I mention this not as a plug for Redfin (although I am a very happy customer) but because the economics of using Redfin are different than most traditional realtors.  You’ll see an atypically low seller’s agent commission (1.5%) in the list of expenses below, as well as a buyer’s agent rebate ($4,367) that is unique to Redfin.  

When selling a home, the seller pays both real estate agents (yours and the buyers) out of the sale proceeds.  The amount you pay, a percentage of the sale price, is negotiable.  We sold in a very hot market, and as such, only offered 2% to the buyer’s agent during our sale process.  Elsewhere, this could be as high as 3% or more.  

To have a more competitive offer on our new home, we waived the home inspection.  If you are in a market where inspections are still common and accepted, it would normally take place between the acceptance of the initial offer, and the acceptance of the P&amp;S.  In our case, I knew I wanted an inspection for my own knowledge, if not for negotiating purposes, so we had one completed between the P&amp;S agreement and final closing.  The sellers allowed us access to complete it, and we made clear to them that it was for our informational purposes only, and wouldn’t be used for any negotiations.  Ultimately, because of the age of the new home (~120 years), our home insurance company required a copy of the inspection report to insure the property, so it got double use.

Lastly, there are a few unique issues when selling a condo.  The buyer’s mortgage company typically requires the seller to complete a notarized condo association questionnaire.  Sellers must also produce a notarized 6D Certification, which states that they have no outstanding financial obligations to the condo association or the management company.  You’ll see line items below for having our management company complete the paperwork for us for a small fee.

&amp;nbsp;

**Take-Aways**

Every purchase and sale is different.  In our case, from start to finish, the process took a bit over four months, and required us to pay just about $50,000 out of pocket before we received the proceeds from our sale and turned cash positive.  Your transaction might go faster or slower, cost more or less, but it’s important to realize that these things take time, and require you to put up some amount of money along the way.  Plan ahead, and have money available.

Interview multiple real estate agents.  We were convinced we were going to work with the first person we met with, a traditional broker who had a great track record of selling condos in our building.  When we met her, she was a total dud – unenthusiastic, off on her numbers, etc.  Honestly, it sent us reeling and wondering if we were totally wrong on our understanding of our home’s value.  The second and third brokers we interviewed were much, much better.  

Expect that things will go wrong.  *(When we did our inspection a few hours before buying our new place, we found that the previous owners had moved out while leaving a ton of their stuff behind.  Thanks, guys!)*  Roll with it when they do.  Rely on your agent, mortgage broker, and lawyer – they’ve seen it all and know what to do.

If you’re married or otherwise partnered, I would strongly recommend that one of you be in charge of the purchase and sale.  It makes life easier for everyone you work with if they have a single person to go to, rather than wondering if they need to hear back from both of you.  It also guarantees that no one makes a decision having missed an important piece of information.  If you do this, the other spouse/partner has to be completely bought in to the idea.

Lastly, and perhaps most importantly:  You’ll see that we sold our first home for the exact same amount we purchased our new home.  By moving two towns over, we got three times as much space, a detached two-car garage, and a nice yard, for the exact same dollar value.  Buyers often get fixated on a specific town or neighborhood and don’t look nearby.  Take the time to look – small distances can make huge differences.",finance
personalfinance,Is double pension possible in my situation?,"I'm currently active duty Air Force with 3 years (30 years old now). I'm looking into ""double dipping"" possibility by going Guard and then buying my years back to into a new federal job. My question is really with the math and what could help me the most with getting two pensions.
I have researched this information:
If I get out of active duty at 5 years then buy back my time at the federal job, I could retire after 25 years of work and start that pension at my estimated age of 57. 
Then if I palace front which is to let my military contract end then join the guard and I'm not sure if I have to restart my 20 years or not but for math sake, I'll go for 20 years of Guard service to then receive a military pension at 52 years. 
Is this a legal option for double pension?

Visual Math making this career change at 32 years old:

FERS retirment: 30 years requirement - 5 year buy back = 25 pension @ 57 years old

Guard retirement: 20 years requirement = pension @ 52 years old

personalfinance,Cancellation of Debt?,"Long story short, I moved overseas and completely forgot about finishing payment on an engagement ring. I have enough money to pay it off, it just escaped my mind that I still owed.

I received a Cancellation of Debt (1099-C), with event code G.

I'm hoping to move into a federal position in the future, and something like this seems that it could be detrimental.",finance
personalfinance,"Sold house, can't find new one to buy, unsure how to proceed with managing $60K profits. (Maryland, US)","Hi PFers, I'm getting pretty stressed out with my situation and realizing that I'm having trouble thinking everything through clearly, so I was hoping to get some objective help from you all.  Here's my situation:

Wife and I sold our house at the end of January.  We are renting back until March 18 when new owners will take occupancy.

We've been house hunting in our area but finding nothing that we want to buy.  We realize it's early in the house sale season, but with interest rates going up we're worried that nothing new is coming to market any time soon as current owners would rather stay put than take on a newer, larger interest rate on their new home.

So our consideration have been twofold: first, if it takes 3-4 weeks to close on a house, we're currently right up against our deadline for finding something in order to be out by March 18.  We could rent somewhere else for a few months, but month to month rentals cost more than our current mortgage ($1800 vs. $1600).  We could find year long leases at $1400 per month, but there's a good chance we will have to break that lease if we find a house (or maybe not!  Who knows!).

Second, at the same time, I'm not sure what to do with the $60K we made from the sale of our house.  We'll need quick access to it if we need to buy, but it's earning nothing sitting in a savings account right now.  Not sure if there's a good place to put it that's flexible, but also earns better than .1% interest (my credit union has a money manager rate of .4%.  Whoopity doo.)

Like I said, I keep going round in circles in my head, so any advice here is welcome.  Thanks all!

(Another thing of note: we're locked into our region because of family and work, and there are only a few school districts worth buying in in our area, so moving to a cheaper state, or even cheaper area of the state isn't in the cards.)",finance
CryptoCurrency,You should know what is happening at HitBTC,"Hi, probably many know about this but for those who don't, wanted to let you in on what HitBTC has been doing for months.

So, HitBTC has been locking people out of their funds for quite a while, using various techniques. At this point, it's quite likely that they are not solvent and are trying to keep the thing going for as long as possible by stalling and keeping a few users happy with the other users funds. What amazes me is that they haven't made any honest statement about this for this long. I used to think they were pulling an exit scam, but after all this time, a hack and insolvency seem more likely. There's a positive albeit hyper naive option,  that they are truly under-staffed and quite incompetent.

First they started by not-crediting people with their deposits and not executing withdrawals to the blockchain. I was personally caught by depositing ETH through a contract. There was no mention of this on their deposit popup, it was only stated in their support docs, which you obviously don't check until it's too late. So I reported it **2 months ago** on the issue **#106549**, bear in mind that the fix on their side is just to check the address and credit the ETH (check address balance, set the same number on their platform). Yet they took 1.5 months to even acknowledge the ticket and are now just postponing with empty responses like asking for data they already have in the ticket and elevating the issue to another area of the company. Also reported to /u/hitbtc in both PM and by posting on r/hitbtc but got no response.

If you check r/hitbtc, there are 100's complaining about this for months, yet they are somehow still in business. At one point, they got the nerve to blame delays on overloaded blockchains and created a [System Health tab](https://hitbtc.com/system-health) where you can see the queue of deposits and withdrawals for each blockchain. I suppose some poor souls fall for it, the fact that they want to blame a 1 month delay on a blockchain is pathetic.

Their next move was to add ridiculous fees when you move funds, clearly to discourage people from doing so and giving them some forced liquidity.

Every now and then you see people posting on Reddit or the forums about finally being given their funds. I'm personally very skeptical, these could be fake posts by the admins or just that they make a few people happy to make it look like everything is alright.

At this point, I'm getting used to the idea that  my funds are long gone, but I'm keeping local copies of everything and will pursue this until the end. I'm hoping these guys are exposed asap, stop scamming people and go under.

**TL;DR:** Don't deposit on HitBTC, if your funds are in it, good luck to you

**UPDATE 2018-02-13 (next day):** After this post and emailing their accounts a couple of times about it, they finally credited the funds and also the withdrawal went through immediately. I wouldn't take it as a happy ending kind of thing, they basically withheld the funds for 2 months until the cost of doing so outweighed the cost of giving it back. Notice in the comments how many people actually withdrew from HitBTC just in case in response to this post. So, I'd still discourage anyone from depositing funds there",cryptocurrency
Economics,[Meta] Rules Roundtable #2: Submissions and RII,"Welcome to another rules roundtable, a series of posts for the /r/economics mods to  explain how we enforce the rules and the underlying reasons motivating them. Today we will be look at Rule II which sets the off-topic standards for submissions in the same way that [Rule VI](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/7vp3cf/rules_roundtable_rule_vi_and_offtopic_comments/) sets the off-topic standards for comments. 

##Why do we need a rule around submissions?

/r/economics is an economics subreddit.  While this may sound obvious we receive many submissions which are not related to economics in any way.  To keep the subreddit on track with its core mission we remove comments that have nothing to do with economics.  This keeps the sub free of clutter.  Attention and visibility are like all things are scarce and removing off-topic threads can help focus the efforts on the sub  on this core mission.  The mods have also noticed that off-topic threads typically have comment sections that are full of rule breaking comments, contain low quality discussion, and draw frequent complaints from users.  Good submission rules therefore establish the foundation for good discussions.


## What is Economics Anyway...

Economics is a discipline that touches on a broad range of topics which means it can be hard to come up with a firm definition of what economics is.  What all economics has in common though is an attention to the preferences and incentives individuals face and how these factors get translated into the production, consumption and distribution of goods and services.  It is important to note that when we say goods and services we don't just mean the things that can bought in stores, but also important non-market goods such as environmental quality or health.  When judging if submissions are on-topic we will look for one of the following things:

- *Written by an Economist*:  Generally this means someone engaged in the community of economists as a whole. In particular we think about an economist as 1) People doing traditional economic research, either in a university setting or at a public institution like the Fed or Treasury.  2) People in research, or research like positions at think-tanks or private firms (eg. The McKinsey Institute, research section of a Bank or tech company ect...)

- *Engages in Economic Analysis*:  This means that the article brings about concepts from economic theory to analyze or explain a topic in the news or some other phenomena.  

- *Cites Economic Research:* The article makes clear reference to economic research or interviews the authors of relevant research.



## Removing A Source Doesn't Mean It Is Bad 

Often when we remove a source we don't mean to indicate that it is not worth discussing.  What it does indicate is that is not consistent with the focus of the subreddit.  We would encourage you to find other communities that may be better fits for the article such as /r/business , /r/investing and subreddits for other related topics.  

##  A Note on Stock Markets and Business News

Article on stock markets as well as news about particular firms will generally be removed under RII.  Why?  The stock market is not very [indicative of the health of the economy as a whole](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-stock-market-is-not-the-economy/) and short term movements generally carry very little information.  Likewise, as in the case of personal anecdotes, the experiences of one firm often can teach us very little as we are unable to understand how representative the firms experience is. There are some exceptions.  For instance, articles that use the story of a firm to motivate a broader discussion of some economic topic.  However, these topics will need to clear a high bar to be approved.

personalfinance,Lowering tax liability vs. larger emergency fund,"Hi all, just looking for opinions before I reach a final decision.  I have about $12,000 in an emergency fund, and a baby on the way.  

My scenarios:
- Pay the $2K in federal taxes and have $10K left in the emergency fund.
- Max out traditional IRA, pay $1K in taxes and have about $7K left in the emergency fund.

I make about $95K and owe $9,500 in student loans (4%), $263K on mortgage (4%), and $18K on car loan (0%).  I already max out the company match on my 401K (dollar-for-dollar up to 4.5%) and I max out my ESPP which acts as a forced savings account.  I always sell that right away each cycle and use it to pay down my debt and/or beef up the emergency fund, depending on my needs at the time.

I have five months of maternity leave but once I'm back at work I'll need part-time daycare which could run as much as $1,000 per month around here for an infant.

Now that I'm re-reading this I'm leaning towards just paying the taxes as-is, but I still want people's opinions.  Thanks!",finance

personalfinance,Should We Buy A House? Are We Setting Ourselves Up For Being House Poor? (CAN),"Hello! I've come to this knowledgeable place to get some opinions on our current situation/dilemma

My partner [24M] and myself [23F] are seriously considering buying a house. 
Here's some background information on the both of us


I inherited a sum of money last year from the death of my parent. Currently, I have 12k in a long term investment for my retirement and 40k in other shorter term investments (invested with the intent to use for a house or whatever, etc). I am currently in my final year of my degree program (Bachelor of Nursing) with an expected graduation/employment date for Spring 2019. 
I have around 9,400$ in student loans right now, but where I live I don't pay interest on them and don't need to start paying them back until 6 months after I graduate

Income wise, during the school year I don't work, but rather I work full-time during the summer and make around 10-12K, using this to pay for school and live off of during the school year. I also recently started receiving CPP (Canadian Pension Plan) death benefit that amounts to 244$/month while I am a student. I also currently have around 5k in my own regular savings.


My partner is in his final semester of his degree (Engineering) and has already signed a contract for a job offer. His works part time currently (~16hours/week) at the company already, slated to start full-time employment in May. Once he is working full-time, his salary before taxes will be roughly 64k/year. No student loans, but currently has a 20k student line of credit which is at 0$ right now. Both of us have very good credit scores (~800)

We've sat down with a mortgage specialist at the bank and got pre-approved for ~280k, this is with a 10% downpayment. Of course because my partner is not working quite yet, we might not get approved. But overall with our situation of my partner having a signed job contract and salary, and my own independent investments, the mortgage specialist we spoke with said we stand a good chance to get approved.

We have found a house we are seriously considering buying. The house is brand now (built in 2017) and listed for 269,900$. 1000sq, 3 bedroom and 1.5 bathrooms. The house has everything we could mostly want for a first home and is in an ideal location for traveling to work/school. I expect that if we don't make an offer on the house this week, it will sell very soon after.

My partner and I have been crunching the numbers over the past several days and feel conflicted about making a decision. 
Here's a breakdown of what our finances would look like if we bought the house.

**Of my 40,000$ investment:**

Down payment at 10%: 26,900$

Closing Costs/Lawyer/Fees/CMHC ETC: ~5-6k (this is at 2%)

Total: 32,900

Depending on how soon we were to move, we'd also use the rest of this money to pay for the mortgage for 2-3 months until we start receiving higher steady income in May. We may also use some of this money to buy a few pieces of furniture/items we'd need for the house that we don't already have (couch and small items).

**Our Estimated Costs- Monthly (For 2 adults with 2 cars)**

Mortgage: 1182.50 (Believe this is at 3.3% interest rate)

Utilities: 227.50

Property Taxes: 250.00

House insurance: 91.67

Phone: 134.00

Car payment: 294.00

Car insurance: 250.00

Gas: 279.50

Groceries: 300.00

Internet: 70.00

Total: 3079.17

**Our Estimated Income- Monthly Combined AFTER taxes**

February: 532.00

March: 532.00

April: 532.00

(Depends which month we'd buy the house/move in)

May: 2933.00

June: 5866.15

July: 5866.15

August: 5866.15

Leaving us with roughly 2786.00 in excess income for savings/emergency fund/unexpected costs each month

Then I would go back to school, so we'd be down to a single income

September - April: 3,733.33

This would leave us with roughly 654.00 in excess income for savings/emergency fund/unexpected costs each month


**Here are some of our concerns:**

1) Buying a house before my partner starts full-time employment (which 2-3 months away) even though he has signed a contract. His probation period is only 1 month.

2) We don't have much of an emergency fund at the moment, even though we are buying a brand new home obviously unexpected costs could happen with the home or cars (both of them are relatively new and in good condition).

3) Would our excessive income each month allow us to put away enough for emergencies/unexpected costs

I will be graduating in Spring of 2019 with a very employable degree and will be making around 65k/year also when I land employment. Through Sept-April 2018/19 I can also obtain a part-time job to supplement our single income while I am still finishing up my last semester of school.

It is clear that we won't have a lot of extra money, and that's okay for a short amount of time until I start employment full-time.

I guess overall.... with our monthly costs vs expenses are we going to be house poor?
We are okay living frugally while we are on a single income but are we risking too much by buying a house?

**Consideration for Buying a House vs Renting**

If we decided NOT to buy a house and rent, we won't be using any of my 40k investment. Renting a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom in our area would run roughly 1300$/month and we would have to pay utilities still and possibly pay for parking. The difference money wise is negligible (200-300$) between what we would be paying if we bought a house or if we decided to rent. The main difference is obviously buying a house is a WAY bigger responsibility.


I appreciate your time and suggestions! Let me know if there's any pertinent information I'm leaving out.

personalfinance,"Paying for a wedding and long term debt with tax money: Pay off as much as possible, or save some for emergencies?","Hi Everyone! First time poster here! Long story short, my fiancé and I are getting married in August and we’ve been planning for a little over a year now. This year, I was able to claim head of household on our taxes so we got a very nice return from Uncle Sam. The state was about a third of size of the Federal return, so we used that to buy a number of decorations and supplies for the wedding, plus pay off some monthly bills and other miscellaneous items. We still have the federal return coming in, but we’re having a bit of an argument as to how it should be done, I think we should take large chunks out of our larger debts and save a few hundred bucks for emergencies, while my fiancé thinks we should put the entire amount towards the wedding and our credit cards. We’re paying off one of our debts that will begin to accrue interest in a couple months, but the rest are very manageable.  We’re not in any dire financial straits, but money is a bit tight with the wedding and the aforementioned debts. Any opinions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!!!",finance
personalfinance,pay off the car or pay off the credit cards?,"Hey, I need help deciding what to do...I finally decided to use part of my savings to pay off something.  Originally, it was going to be my car.  I owe $11674.00 and the interest rate is 4.64%.  Last year, I moved a lot of high interest credit card debt to 0% interest cards.  5 of them.  The big balance ($10182.00) comes due in August of this year.  Another card ($1214.50) comes due in April of this year.  The other 3 cards have balances of $2000., due in October, $993.00 due in January 2019 and $3596.00 due May 2019.  I currently have one balance transfer offer but that card only has $300.00 available.
Do I pay off the car with the known interest rate and set payment or do I pay off the big card before the interest rate hits.  I was hoping that I would get another 0% offer by August but the fear that I won't has been with me all year...
My car payment is $256.00 per month and I make about $500 per month in payment to these debt cards.  I have one more card for daily use that I pay off weekly.
Please lend me your wisdom.  I am still a newbie to taking care of finances but you all have helped me so much to make the right decisions.

Needing new help,"Over a year ago, I made a post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4gltcg/trying_to_escape_the_66k_debt/) looking for help to get out of debt. I have managed to clear out two pieces of debt (private loan and credit card), but I still have some more questions I need help with. 

I was able to stall the student loans for the most part but will eventually need to pay that off obviously. I'm at $41k at this point. I went up in pay, so I make a decent amount of money most times when I'm working. When working, I make about $1200 a week. 

So right now, its

$41k (4.6%) student loan

$9K (5.4%) car

$500 (0) for phone

(???) incoming medical bills due to an injury I had that put me out of the work for a while.

But last year, I got a phone call from some lawyers that my father's old properties had been sold and there was going to be some money coming to me. I really wasnt expecting this, so this is a complete surprise. One of my coworkers keeps telling me to buy a house, live in it and then flip it in two years, and another keeps telling me to invest it in my own business. I don't really have any business ideas of interest, so I scrapped that. I'm skeptical on buying a house because (1) the housing in my area has gone up exponentially (Homes are like $300K+ here) and if the state scraps their incentive programs (which is what keeps me working), then there will be some major crashes, (2) when the incentives do get scrapped, it's very possible I will have to move to another state, which owning a house might keep me tethered here if I need to leave. That coworker is pretty convinced I'll have time to jump ship, but I feel I shouldn't be taking a risk like that. Is there something you all would recommend?

I'll post my updated budget as well:

Rent $430

Utilities(power, gas, water, internet): $150, sometimes higher depending on the season

Phone: $90

Insurance: $160 (full coverage with 1 accident on record)

gas: $60-90

Food: 40-100 (It's usually cheaper because I'm sometimes fed 3 times a day when working)

Misc: $50 (This is for Dropbox, or able to use wifi in other places because it's convenient when working).

Right now, there is no take home pay as I lost my job after I wasn't able to go to work anymore when I woke up with some pain preventing me from work, and the season for work starts back up at the end of the month anyway. Right now, I have $7k, which goes down after paying physical therapy and doctor visits.",finance
personalfinance,Anyone have experience with student loan consolidation?,"Looking for some advice here. I have 2 sets of student loans: Stafford Loans and Private Loans. The Stafford loans total 20k, broken up into several parts all with fixed interest rates varying from 3.7-4.6%. The private loans total 40k, broken up into several parts with fixed interest rates varying from 7.1-8.9%. 

Is consolidation something I should look into? Should I consolidate all or just part of my loans, maybe just the private since the stafford are already relatively low? I’m fairly new to the idea so any advice would be great.",finance

personalfinance,Pay down on house loan or save extra money?,"Hi everyone, first time poster here! I'm 25 years old single woman, that bought my first apartment 3 months ago. 

From my apartment, I have $315,000 in house loans. The interest rate on this loan is 1,9%, and I pay about $1,200 every month on that.

I make 65k/year, and after taxes, paying my loan and living costs, I get about 15k extra every year ($1,000 every month + some extra money in the summer and winter).

I have a savings account (3.9% interest rate) with 50k in it. The rules for this account is that you're only allowed to put in a maximum 3k a year, and I've already filled it with that.

So my question is, should I use the extra 15k to pay down on my loan? The interest is pretty low and manageable, so I don't feel like I'm in a hurry to pay it down. Or should I invest or save it, and then use it on my loan after some years?",finance
CryptoCurrency,McAfee joins Knowledge.io ICO (probably without realizing there is an ongoing FBI investigation into the founder),"Hello everyone. John McAfee has sent out a few tweets from his official ""officialmcafee"" about an ICO that he just became an advisor of. He has joined the  Knowledge.io ""Knowledge Token"" ICO that started today, but he may not realize that the individual behind the ICO was recently indicted and arrested on 29 federal charges. 

The FBI and USA Attorney General are leading the federal case, for which a surprising amount of public records are available.

According to http://ImmersiveEducation.org/alert  (the educational non-profit that owns the""Knowledge Token"" trademark) public records indicate that the individual responsible for the ICO's unauthorized use of the ""Knowledge Token"" trademark was just indicted by the United States Department of Justice on 29 federal charges including conspiracy, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, and currently stands accused of defrauding a health clinic out of $2.8 million.

I don't have a Twitter account, but would love to see his response when he realizes that he might end up on the wrong side of the federal government over this and other coins he pumps (and in his most recent Knowledge.io ICO tweet he is very clear about the fact that he is paid a substantial amount of money to promote this ICO).

If you happen to join in on that Twitter discussion please let me know, since it's hard to keep up!

personalfinance,(US) How do taxes taken out each paycheck relate to how much I owe the federal government?,"So at $65,000 a year, I used the current tax brackets and did the ($5,226.25 plus 25% of the amount over $37,950) to calculate how much I owe.  Between retirement and benefits, my ""taxable income"" is $58,000.  So I calculated that my federal income tax should be around $10,238 per year.  Right now, I am getting right at $300 taken out per paycheck ($600 a month) and that adds up to $7200.  So does that mean that come tax time (if it was a year from now), I would owe the government $3000? Or am I missing something.

personalfinance,"Debt Collector just told me my student loan rehabilitation program was cancelled, can I dispute this?","So I took out a tiny student loan that I forgot about and it ended up in a debt collection agency, I was young and stupid and that's on me. In 2016 I enrolled in a program to get my loan out of rehabilitation via a 10 month repayment program. In the duration of this repayment program my tax return got authorized for offset which hurt me quite a bit on top of the bad credit and such. I submitted tax information to the debt collector, and I was told I needed to reupdate my income information in 2017 for the program to be finalized. I authorized them to email and leave me voicemails because the times they were calling me I was working and unable to answer the phone or even know it was them because they call from random numbers. They still called and left voicemails with no info other than a callback number, which I could never reach anyone on other than a voicemail, which began a series of phone tag of them calling me and me calling them.

Flash forward to December when I havent heard from them for two months and have been periodically calling and leaving voicemails, I began calling every day and leaving voice messages after getting a new job and changing hours. I finally got ahold of someone one day who transferred me to another department and had me leave *another* voicemail, so I called them back saying I havent got ahold of anyone for months and want to know the status of my account, which the caller said they were having problems with their phone lines in their building and that's what theyve been having a hard time managing returning calls. I ended up filing a complaint with the department of education because I had been trying to get ahold of them with no answers.

Skip forward to *today* when I finally get a call, which invites me to enroll in the rehabilitation program. I stop them as they began their script and say how I'm already enrolled in a rehabilitation program, to which they inform me that my program was cancelled in *July*(2017) because they didnt receive the proper tax forms and the tax forms I had sent in were incorrect. I corrected them saying the last caller who called me said everything on file looked good and I never recieved notice that they were incorrect, to which they put me on hold and came back saying they sent out a notice letter in *September* (2017) that my account was going to be cancelled if I didnt get updated information, which I again said I didn't recieve. I took this to the manager (hate asking to speak with a manager but the person I spoke to was stonewalling and I didnt know what else to do) who then said they were trying to call me to tell me its in danger, but again I stressed how I told them I worked during the hours they called me and I couldnt pick up the phone because 1.) I didn't have enough free time to talk to them because every phone call with them has been +20 minutes due to federally required scripts they read and 2.) they always call from different numbers and I have no way of differentiating them from a spam caller.  3.) I gave them the ok to leave me voicemails and emails, none of which were sent or recieved by me mentioned anything about a danger of the program getting cancelled The manager said they recommend with the new program that I answer every phone call I receive to make sure it's them calling to ensure this doesn't happen again, and then offers me to speak to their boss. I transfer to them and as the conversation begins the phoneline disconnects, I call back and it rings out to a voicemail again, which I leave my contact info and state I was just on the phone and it disconnected.

I called back the department of education and filed another complaint after that whole ordeal, and right now I feel scammed, frustrating, and on the verge of crying as I was expecting to be done with the program right now, not told I have to start over from the beginning and have another tax return offset. 

Is there anything I can do at this point? Or does this debt collector hold all the cards on the table and I have to play by their rules?",finance

personalfinance,Addressing debt with a tax return,"Okay here's what's going on. I have a crap credit score, (mid-500s) and my current credit usage is at about 88%. I have a store card with an interest rate of 27.9% and a card with 24.3% interest rate, both of these are almost maxed out. (I'm really great with money)
I also have a car loan with a 9.99% interest rate, but I no longer have the car.
I just got my tax return, and I'm wondering what the most effective thing to do with the money would be. I read the WIKI and I know that the first step would be to build an emergency fund. (I don't have one at the moment) My thought is, it'd be a lot easier to begin setting aside an emergency fund if I didn't have a $200 car payment for a car I don't have. I'm also thinking that it'd be nice to pay-off those high-interest cards, which I could cover with almost the entire return. Clearing those balances would help my credit score a bit, and free up the minimum payments to put towards the emergency fund. 
The other option I have is to use the entire return plus the funds from a personal debt that I could call in (I sound like a loan shark, it's not like that, I swear) to pay off the entire car loan, which would free up a lot of funds to pay down the credit debt, which would then free up even more funds to start saving. I just don't know what to do, I have a little anxiety about blowing all the money at once, especially since I don't have any current savings. 
Of course, there's always the option to pay a little down on all three debts and stick a little in savings as well.

personalfinance,Continue to rent home or sell. Current tenant has expressed interest in buying.,"Hello. Here's my current situation. I bought a home in 2012 for $201,000 with 3.25% fixed-rate 30-year mortgage. In 2015, I decided to move across the country and thought that renting the home would be better than selling it because of the low interest rate and potential appreciation. 

I have a company managing that property and have had no problems. The same tenant has been in the home the whole time and has recently expressed interest in buying it. I think it might be worth it but would love some advice. I will also check with my tax person but this seems like a good place to get some ideas.

According to Zillow (who knows how accurate that is), the home is worth about $275,000 and I currently owe $177,000. I am making about $150/month profit after mortgage, insurance, PMI, HOA, and management fees are paid. There have been no major repairs needed. 

I also have about $25,000 in low interest debt in the form of a student loan (3%) and a credit card consolidation loan (5.9%).

personalfinance,Should I pay off part of student loans before graduation or contribute to Roth IRA?,"I am currently an undergraduate junior majoring in STEM. I received a decent amount of scholarships and only have to take out a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan each year to pay for schooling. These loans have interest from 3.5% - 5%. I have done an internship and am currently involved in paid on-campus research that will be converted to an internship over the summer with much better pay. After my calculations, I will have more than enough extra to pay off my loan from freshman year + all the interest it has accumulated. My question is, should I do that or just use that money to help pay for the last 3 semesters of college? My intuition says to start from the beginning since the interest is accruing and paying that off early will lower the effect of that interest compounding. It is between doing that or contributing all that money to my Roth IRA which has $2500 in it currently.

I have already participated in a study abroad program with the money I earned from my first internship and that was an experience of a lifetime. I have $5500 in an emergency fund and my housing is covered. My car is paid off in full and my parents still pay my insurance. I am very frugal but I also make sure to budget for hobbies and fun money. I am just torn on which option I should throw extra money at.

They also said during the same interview:

&gt;**If we lived in a dystopian world** without trust, **bitcoin might dominate existing payment methods.** But in this world, where people do tend to trust financial institutions to handle payments and central banks to maintain the value of money it seems unlikely that bitcoin could ever be as convenient as existing payment means.

personalfinance,Car loan options,"My husband and I are buying a used vehicle.  We need something big enough to cart 2 kids plus our stuff.  We're planning to use our tax return to make the down payment and possibly pay off an existing loan as well.

Our initial plan was to pay off the existing car loan because it's at a higher rate than I *thought* we'd qualify for.  It's been a couple years and we've been building credit.  We don't owe much, only $4,000.  We wanted to pay it off and then borrow somewhere between 10 and 13k, get a used Highlander or CRV. 

We're in a spot where we could *almost* buy a vehicle from a person locally and pay cash, but it's *just slightly* too much of an upfront cost.  We really cannot wait a year or 6 months.  There are a LOT of times when we need 2 vehicles but, not having another, we postpone errands or family outings.  It's tough and as the kids age, it will get tougher.  (Not to mention the benefits of having a bigger vehicle!) 

 At a lower interest rate with a long repayment term, our monthly payment would stay about the same, very affordable for us. Our top priority is affordability on a day to day basis, including repairs, gas and insurance.  So, if it's cheap to begin with and a low monthly, paying 1,000 total extra in interest over 6 years is fine with me.  We need this vehicle in the next few months.

My husband called the credit union to start figuring out their financing offer. They're offering the exact same interest rate as the current loan and suggested we borrow 17,000 at 4.9% for 78 months and refinance the current car.

I was, in a word, irritated.  In my view, this ""deal"" is just making them more money because now we'll be paying off the 4,000 remaining over a longer period of time, and more interest on the 13,000 we need because we'll owe more than we would have, plus they're not offering a better interest rate even though his credit score is higher by quite a bit?
 
Am I being unrealistic?  I truly thought with a credit score above 700 and their advertised rates being well under 4%, even with the long repayment terms we'd be sitting around 4.25% maximum.  Second, am I wrong that this 17,000 combined loan is a bad deal for us?  Even at a lower rate, it seems sensible to pay off the loan we have now.  If we were to refinance, the rate should definitely go down a little.

They also advertise .5% reduction in rate if you set up automated payments.  We have automated payments for our current loan but she did not mention the .5% or offer it, so maybe 4.9% includes the reduction.... or they won't give it to us unless we press it.

This is a local credit union, btw.  I'm just really frustrated, am I being unrealistic or are these terms a bad offer?",finance

I have been reading about how this can be a common problem when you have multiple W2's, but I still don't really understand WHY. I was told that, for example, if I have two jobs in the year that were 40k each, I'll be taxed at 40k by payroll, when really I should be taxed at 80k. Thus, I was undertaxed and owe. 

Sorry if this is a very stupid question but I can't seem to wrap my mind around it -- 
When I start the 40k job for example, there isn't an 'end date', so when I get my very first check how am I already being undertaxed? If I'm just making a weekly salary - shouldn't I be taxed assuming that is my annual? I don't understand any of this and I resent that I wasn't taught it in school!

personalfinance,Should you both be 100% sure when buying a home?,"Of course you should, right? Well, its more complicated than that.

Hi PF, 
I wanted to get your opinion on the biggest decision of my life. No big, deal, right?

We put on offer down on a house earlier than expected. I feel we were pressured into a fast decision. We can afford it and is has nearly everything we want and need. It’s a beautiful, solid house. The concern is the area. The median income at this time is much lower than ours. That much is visible (and I researched everything about this endlessly)

I have some pretty big moral qualms about moving in. I posted in relationships and many people told me that gentrification isn't real, look out for yourself, etc, but that’s simple to say when you aren’t living it and seeing it. I know it is a big and valid concern of the existing community. They watched it happen in other areas of town. 

I'm sure you've guessed, We're white. I feel uneasy looks from people. I believe someone has already shouted at me to go home. 

I'm pretty sure the investment is a good one. Houses in the area are selling for highest-ever amounts and developments are planned for the area. We can MAYBE afford a 3/2 elsewhere in the city, at 100k+ more. This would be without a ton of wiggle room for the future. There is very little out there. Interest rates are rising.

All of the practical reasons point to ""buy"", but some overpowering emotional reasons point to ""don't"". 

Our due diligence was extended. I have been going back and forth, mostly with extreme hesitance, with my husband wanting to go forward, but concerned about me.

I have watched nearly every other neighborhood fall out of our reach, but I feel a bit sick over this move. People talk me out of the feeling, I'll allow myself to get excited, then it creeps back up. Then Condos and houses we will grow out of soon start looking appealing.

How does ""go with your gut"" come into play when you feel your best, and sometimes feels like only, option is a questionable one? Does ""100% sure"" come to first time home-buyers with limited budgets?",finance
personalfinance,Should my parents borrow from me or take out home equity?,"My parents are about to get some necessary work done on their house.  They're planning on taking out a home equity loan to do so.  But it occurred to me that they could just borrow the money from me instead.

However, it's possible that I would want the money back in the next few years - sooner than the end-date of a home equity loan.  I was thinking that, when and if I need it back, they could take out a home equity loan for the portion they still owed me.  The upside of this is that, at that point, they would only end up paying interest to the bank for a portion of the amount and possibly for less time.

The only downside to that is that I hear talk of interest rates going up, so I'm afraid that increased interest rates at that later date could negate the money saved by postponing the opening of the loan.  But I really don't know much about interest rates and home loans.

So, what would be more cost-effective?

1. They take out a home equity loan for the full amount at the current interest rates now.

2. They borrow the money from me now and, when and if I need it, they repay the remainder in 1-3 years by taking out a home equity loan for the remainder of the amount owed.

personalfinance,H&amp;R Block Tax Deluxe software E-file bug,"I've used H&amp;R Blocks tax software to do my own taxes for the last 3 years and have never had any issues with the program, it's always worked well for me in handling my regular forms as well as other forms until today.   The bug or flaw is in the E-File process involving the activation code for the federal filing portion which indirectly affects the state filing in the following way.  

When I bought the program from Newegg they failed to send the activation code for the software so I called H&amp;R Block and got one from them after Newegg said they couldn't help ( they tried resending the email but I had downloaded it already ).   I used the new code from Block and went about doing my taxes and upon completing them I started the E-File process and opted to pay for the state E-File from my bank card.  When I submitted federal and state to E-File the activation code I was given showed in the little popup window and began processing both fed and state returns then came back with an error message that the activation code was incorrect.  After retrying the code three more times I called back to Block and got a new code and it worked, I asked the representative if I would get charged for the failed attempts and was assured that I would not.  Today I go to get gas and can't get anymore than $7 so I check my account and find that the software had dinged me for each failed attempt.  I called back to Block about it and they were only seeing one charge though my account says otherwise.  I called my bank to get help and they've jumped on it ( thanks Wells Fargo! ) then called back to Block and got to tech support to discuss this problem.  Here's the rub, Block knows about this bug or flaw and the tech support guy said his hands are tied and there's nothing he can do.

personalfinance,Advice on repaying loans,"Alright, so I had different post that was related to questions regarding the snowball effect, but figured detailing my current situation might be a little more helpful. I’m looking for a little bit of insight.

I currently make about $54,000 before taxes. I don’t have any credit card debt and have car payments of $307 a month. I have just under $40,000 in student loan debt as detailed below. 

My questions are, what is the best approach for me to tackle these? I really like the idea of the snowball effect, but I’m not sure if that is in my best interest. Also, should I look into consolidating my loans? 

I really appreciate any input I can get!

personalfinance,Student Loan Debt - pros and cons of lower payments?,"A little background... I'm currently almost 2 years graduated from a local state university in Pennsylvania. My student loans were relatively high because neither my family nor myself could afford to pay out of pocket. I am currently making $37,500 salary at a job I love, and pay $300 in federal loans per month, and about $505 in private loans. I was paying about $250 and $475 for these, but bumped my payments up a little bit to try and knock some of the interest down. I am currently living at home to try to save as much as I can. My father also lost his job recently due to downsizing and hasn't had much luck finding anything else, so I have been kicking my parents $150 each month to help out with my phone bill/car payment. Due to these high payments, I have had to miss out on a lot because I just couldn't make it work financially: getting an apartment with my girlfriend and starting our lives, saying no to trips that I would love to be a part of and all of my friends can afford, and having to really pinch as many pennies as I can. I have considered lowering my payments so that I can enjoy life more while I'm still in my 20s, but I don't want to put myself in a bad position for the future. Here are some of the questions I have...

1. If I begin to pay the required monthly amounts ($365 and $162) rather than the extra I've been paying, will the required amount steadily increase each month since I stopped paying more? Would I end up paying more in interest this way?

2. Should I look into consolidating, or getting on an income-based repayment plan? How would these affect my interest rates?

I know both of these options mean I will pay longer, but my philosophy is that I will make more money as I get older, so if I pay less now, I can make up for it later on. Basically what it comes down to, is it worth it to pay less now so I can enjoy life more while I'm still young?",finance

personalfinance,Multiple Savings Accounts?,"My wife &amp; I have been operating with two joint accounts (one checking &amp; one savings).  We recently decided to start saving for the sole purpose of our next car, so I’ve been pondering the best approach to do that.

My gut reaction was to open a new savings account and name it “New Car” and have the money automatically transferred there monthly.  I’m not concerned that we’ll touch the savings in our normal account (we don’t now), but just that it’s easier to “see” what we have for the car this way.

personalfinance,A novel approach to my emergency fund. Want to get some input before I pull the trigger.,"Hey all. 

Longtime lurker of PF but never had anything worthy of its own post. I recently started working on a new way to structure my emergency fund and have yet to find anyone else on the web doing something similar. I wanted to get some feedback from some other like minded folks and this seemed like the best place to get some input. This crosses into some macro econ / investing topics so any input from someone well versed in those topics would be greatly appreciated as well.

##(Background)##

I am 25 - and have always been more of a saver than spender. I'm also extremely risk averse. After doing some research on the web (and finding this sub) I came to understand the importance of keeping a sizeable emergency fund of 3-6 months salary to fall back on. Post college, while living with my parents to save on costs, I was able to save up about $20,000 in an emergency fund in addition to a checking account front loaded with all current-month expenses. I have a job in the financial sector, so I was able to get some ""on the job"" type working knowledge with investing. With that in mind, I came up with this strategy oriented to someone like myself. 

##(Strategy)##

When I got my first job out of college, my employer set me up an account with Fidelity to manage my 401k. Not here to shill for Fidelity; I have never used another brokerage and don't know if doing this someplace else is any more/less effective. That said, Fidelity allows you to buy new issue treasury debt commission free. They also have a feature that allows you to automatically repurchase treasury bonds/bills once one of yours expires. As you may or may not know, the treasury issues new 4-week ""bills"" just about every Monday. My strategy as an alternative to using a high yield online savings account for my e-fund is to take my $20,000, divide in into 4, and purchase $5,000 worth of 4-week, zero-coupon T-bills at one week intervals, opting into the ""auto-roll"" feature. 

##(Pros)##

I live in a state with high state income taxes, so by using federal treasuries I am shielding my emergency fund from state income taxes. By splitting my e-fund into fourths, I will have interest income coming in 4 separate times per month. Because we are in a rising rate environment, using short term treasuries renewed weekly will expose me to the freshest ""new high"" rates faster than most savings accounts usually react to rate hikes. Because I'm opting to use individual bonds and holding to maturity, I am reducing the risk of principal loss that one might find with a short term treasury ETF or mutual fund in a rising rate environment. I believe the difference between a 1 month t-bill and an FDIC insured savings account is negligible from a general ""safety / credit quality of investment"" standpoint. 

##(Cons)##

Less liquidity. If I were in some kind of life or death emergency and needed cash, pronto, I'd be at the mercy of waiting until the market opened on a business day to sell off the bonds for quick cash. If this were to happen, I have a $5000 credit card limit, a $3000 personal line of credit at a local credit union, and a few hundred in cash in a safe. 

##(TL;DR)##

Any downside to auto-repurchasing 4-week US treasury bills at weekly intervals in my brokerage account as an alternative to an emergency savings fund in a traditional bank savings account? 

Thanks for your consideration. Any input would be greatly appreciated.",finance

I own my home (commercial building with upstairs apartment, relatively high interest rate) on a 15 year loan. I owe about $40k on it; it's valued at around $80k. I have lived here since 2009. There's a main level space that I don't occupy currently; it sits vacant. I had rented to a local fraternal organization that has since moved out and the main level is in need of HVAC and cosmetic repairs - it's not in the best shape. They were paying $150/month to meet there a couple of times per month so it's not a big loss but it's still a loss. 

I'm making ~50k per year, paying $525/month for my mortgage. Live-in girlfriend helps out with mortgage and bills to the tune of $400/month. Her salary is around $40k. We've been together for five years, it's serious, and I'm going to marry this girl.

We enjoy a pretty good (and probably pretty wasteful) quality of life - all the incidentals, full cable package, Netflix, Hulu, eating out a lot, the whole nine yards. 

I own around $700 USD in Bitcoin, just throwing $20 or so in here or there whenever it dips.

I use the app Stash to make easy, high-level, diversified investments which is sitting at about $2500 USD. I also use the Acorns app to round up purchases made from my debit card to the nearest dollar which has about $300 in it right now. I contribute ~$50 combined to both of these weekly.

We're eventually looking to move closer to the town where we both work (only about 15 miles or so away). Our building is currently for sale at an asking price of $84k, with some buyer interest, but no offers or anything concrete as of this posting. We're primarily looking to move because of the proximity to where we work, but also because the idea of a more traditional home is becoming more attractive. This is a 2 story brick building with rickety metal stairs and she wants a dog. Our washer and dryer is shitting out. Our oven doesn't work. The drawbacks are manageable but it's far from a traditional way of life and I'm about to turn 30. I will love this quirky loft apartment as long as I live but I'm wrestling with the idea that it might be time to grow up.

I just have so many questions about what I should do. Whether I should be approaching this market with a seller's mentality and try to make improvements to my home and main level space to appeal to commercial/rental buyers, or just wait out the market and sell it as-is without any improvements, or just hold down the fort and keep paying the space off and living the way we're living. Is having $15k just sitting in savings a waste, or could I be applying this more intelligently to the remaining debt on my home?

My employer matches my 401k at 6%, to which I'm contributing the full amount. Should I open another Roth IRA and put some money into that too, given my age and my current ""cheap living"" situation? Another idea is to put some money into renovations on the main level and turn it into a business (small town of about 1700 people - coffee shop? Antique store? Aggressively attempt to rent it out?) 

I'd be more than happy to answer any specific questions about my situation to help shed any light on where I'm at right now. I just want to try to best capitalize on where I'm at right now to make sure I'm in the best possible position for my future, and I know my situation is a little unique.

**tl;dr I've saved a little bit of money, but I'm not rich. I'd like to eventually move into a more traditional home with my girlfriend soon, or else put my current space to better use, and I don't know if I'm putting my money to work for me in the best possible way.** 

Thank you for reading, and thanks in advance for any insight! I would love any and all guidance! :)",finance
personalfinance,Large Debt how to handle inheritance,"Hello PF - throwaway account

I am a long time lurker and have learned a lot in the past couple of years, I have violated some of my learnings in the past year and racked up a lot more debt that I wanted, I would really appreciate it if you could spend some time looking at my information and possibly give some advice.
&amp;nbsp;

My wife and I planned a big wedding because we both wanted to celebrate with our friends and family and our grand parents wanted us to have a big wedding and were going to pay for it, sadly they both passed away last year after we had entered the contracts with the vendors, so we managed to pay for it ourselves using loans (I know the opposite of what PF would have told us to) in their memory, we also knew that she would receive an inheritance that covered the loan. So in their memory we moved forward with the wedding and it was a fantastic time. 

&amp;nbsp;
Recently we were notified that her inheritance would be approximately 60k and are trying to figure out how to best tackle our mounting debt but set us up for a good future. I make approximately 80k a year and she makes about 50k. Our debts are higher than I had hoped but the wedding is around 25-30k of our debts which I am embarrassed to say. However we are both in a mentality to move past this debt and live as debt free as we possibly can (minus a home loan which is our next goal)  Also important to mention we have a 1 yr old hence daycare costs and larger groceries.

&amp;nbsp;

Our debts are as follows:

&amp;nbsp;

Account | Total | Payment | Interest
---|---|----|----
Loan 1 | $5,800 | $300 | 9.5
Loan 2 | $7,500 | $210 | 27
Loan 3 | $4,000 | $150 | 18.74
Loan 4 | $2,100 | $150 | 10
CC 1 | $10,000 | $280 | 24.5
CC2 | $1,800 | $50 | 24
CC3 | $2,000 | $50 | 24
CC4 | $600 | $25 | 20.2
CC5 | $500 | $25 | 24
Loan 5 | $1,900 | $100 | 22
CC6 | $3,061 | $100 | 0 for 10 months then 30
Loan 6 | $3,115 | $130 | 5
Car 1 | $11,383 | $500 | 21
Car 2 | $9,000 | $400 | 22

*Note - Student loan of 80k omitted as this will be something we plan to chip away at through life, currently living with mother in law so our next goal is to get a house and start chipping away at this debt. 
&amp;nbsp;

As of right now my thoughts were to pay off all the debt but the cars but looking at the interest rates it may be more wise to pay down the cars at least to a point of refinance.  
&amp;nbsp;

Our planned budget is as follows (IF we pay off all the debt minus cars)

Item | Monthly Cost
---|---|----|----
Car 1 | 395
car Insurance | 210
Daycare | 500
Internet | 80
Groceries | 600
gym | 25
water | 70
Car 2 | 525
netflix | 15
power(House has a pool) | 300
Dinner out | 200
His spending Money | 200
Her Spending Money | 200
rent  | 1000
Phone Bill | 200
Student loans | 280 
**Total** | 4343

&amp;nbsp;

Our income ~  5600  - 5612.4 = 812 towards a housing fund ever month 

&amp;nbsp;

14,500 to emergency fund  ~ 3 months of safety to avoid any chances of charging to credit cards 
&amp;nbsp;

Looking at the APRs in a table it may be wise to pay down part of our cars and refinance (currently upside down too far to refinance otherwise) This is my initial go over of how we should handle the approximate 60k, I want to make sure we have at least a 3 month safety fund to avoid using our credit cards for anything but bills (autopay off at the end of the month)

&amp;nbsp;

I know this is a lot of debt to start a marriage with and we probably shouldn't of had a large wedding, but you only get married once and thats what we wanted. I would appreciate any advice you may have on how best to maximize our efforts with this windfall. 
&amp;nbsp;
We would like to buy a house within the next year or so and then begin working on paying off our student loans. Please let me know what you think.

&amp;nbsp;

Note* there may be a few math typos I was trying to bring this over from my budget spreadsheet and may have messed up a few things transitioning to reddit format

personalfinance,What are some good bond ETFs to hold in a taxable account for a goal that is 5 years away?,"For reference: 
• This goal is for a down payment of a house. 
• I’m maxing out my TSP account. 
• I’m in the 22% marginal federal tax bracket (under the new federal tax rates), and my marginal state tax rate is 4.75% (MD) 
• 24 years old, $69K salary, no debts, fully funded emergency fund, extra $ saved for new car down the line. 
• I’m going with Vanguard 
• I am also buying some stock ETFs as part of my taxable portfolio, but I’m not asking about those here.

I realize bond funds aren’t ideal for taxable accounts, but I don’t see lower-yielding cash equivalents as any better. I don’t think I am in a tax bracket that makes sense for me to invest in municipals/treasuries over corporate bonds. Also wondering about the length of bond funds I should be investing in?

computers,Advise needed about Roommate and his computer,"I am in the D/FW area of N TX

I need legal advise concerning something I am wanting to do.

Here is the situation...

I have a roommate who can't afford to pay for his own internet account. I am paying for a mid-range level package through Time Warner (now Spectrum). The problem with my roommate is that he has no filters what-so-ever when he is online, he clicks on all hyperlinks he comes across whether they are in emails,. chats, etc, clicks on pop-ups, clicks on shady computer ads, visits many porn, conspiracy theory and religious website that catches his interest (as those site groups are notorious for spreading all kinds of virus', malware, spyware, etc). I have repeatedly told him what he needs to do in order to keep his PC as clean as possible, only to have my lessons go in one ear, bounce around his brain a few times and fly out the other ear faster than the words went in.

Due to his lack of online intelligence, I have, after repeatedly fixing problems on his current PC and after destroying 5 other PCs and one laptop, turned on parental controls on his PC which do no work (even though he complains that what he is trying to do requires admin permissions (which I don't give unless he can explain to me why he needs a new program or new software installed)). I want to download and install a few good Net Nanny programs on his comp to monitor and track what he does online. The last time I was on his PC was 2 months ago to install the most current windows updates. When I install updates, I do go over his installed programs and scanning kits to make sure that they are up to date, clean out all but the most current restore points and to see how much free space is on his HDD (at that time he had 215Gb of free space). Today as I was heading to work, he called me to his room to see why his computer was running slow, after a quick check, I found that he has less than 1.5Gb for space left on his PC. I told him that I can't even work on his computer until Wednesday at the earliest and before I begin to work on his system, I needed a list of every site he has visited (he has no idea what browser history is).

Honestly I am afraid to get on his computer as I may see things I don't want to see. I did inform him that if I can, I am going to install software on his PC that will let me know on a regular basis what sites he has been to, links he has clicked or tried to click and what he tried to download and install.

Right there is where I am needing advise on. I am paying for access to the net for both of us and I am wanting to know if I can install monitoring software on his PC to cover my tail to make sure that he isn't doing anything bordering on or is illegal. I have tried googling this and have found one case where a homeowner in Wisconsin was convicted of receiving and transmitting CP on their unsecured Wi-Fi network.

I have also informed my roommate that once I fix his PC, I will no longer help him in the future as he can not, will not listen and accept any and all advice and lessons about safe internet browsing.

As an F.Y.I., 7 years ago, I kept his hide out of jail for credit card and mail fraud after UPs, Fed-Ex and the USPS dropped numerous packages on the front porch of our former home (at least 8 55"" LCD TVs, clothes, random electronics and various other goods) as I was doing homework for one of my ISS classes. After I talked him into letting me and copy see his IM logs and emails concerning what he received and will be receiving, taking photo images of what was delivered and stopped off at the police to report what I thought he was getting into against the law on my way to class.

TLDR: The police was notified about the roommates activities, they came by while I was at school after reporting my suspicions talked to the roommate and confiscated all packages as it was determined that he was roped into taking part in credit and mail fraud.

In the initial 5.5 years since, he has been behaving himself online and not doing anything stupid (save for destroying many computers). In the past 1.5 years he has destroyed 1 laptop and two PCs by doing things online that he shouldn't be doing. His last PC is in storage with 3 others that were similarly destroyed by him installing numerous cloud servers, computer maintenance programs, etc.

Any help that will lead me in the right direction would and will be greatly appreciated.",technology

CryptoCurrency,What should I buy for my Mom?,"Hey all,

I've been lurking in the crypto world for about 2 years.  My best friend wanted me to buy ETH at around $17 bit I simply didn't have any money I could afford to lose at the time.  Flash forward and I've been hodling a few different cryptos myself since early December.  I share interesting news and big market swings  (either way) with my mom, and she just asked me yesterday: ""If I were to give you $500 tomorrow, what would you invest in for me?""

It's a simple enough question, but I'm not sure which way to go with it.  I'd this was a buddy of mine, I'd tell them to research things they find interesting, ask me questions and find a project the like or seems solid.  But this is my mom, someone who has very little desire to do her own research, but trusts me.  

So, do I put it in smaller projects that I believe will multiply (higher risk) or just some ETH that should net her much, much more than the .2% interest rate it would have otherwise made in her savings account?  With my money, I'm willing to take risks, but I've never invested for someone else.

Second bit, would any of you charge for doing all of the research and ""legwork""?   If so, what would be fair?  I likely won't charge my own mother, Doge knows I owe her so much for bringing me into the world...but if I enjoy this and want to invest for other friends/family, what do you think is a fair ""cut""?

Bitcoin,REPORT: FEW AMERICANS REPORTING CRYPTOCURRENCY TRADING TO IRS FOR NOW,"The IRS considers cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin as property for federal tax purposes

Less than 100 people out of the 250,000 individuals who have already filed federal taxes this year through company Credit Karma reported a cryptocurrency transaction to U.S. tax authorities, the company said on Tuesday.

This is despite nearly 57 percent of the 2000 Americans surveyed by the credit score startup and research firm Qualtrics last month saying they had realized some gains from cryptocurrencies, according to a Credit Karma study.

Roughly the same percentage said they had never reported cryptocurrency gains to the Internal Revenue Service, while nearly half of those polled said they understood how owning cryptocurrencies affected their taxes, the study said.

The IRS considers cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin as property for federal tax purposes, meaning any profits or losses from the sale or exchange of the virtual coins should generally be reported as capital gains or losses.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Company made a change in my paycheck which caused part of my pay to be taxed higher?,"I work for a company which has about 300 people who work remotely.  We all get a car allowance.  We're paid every two weeks and get the car allowance every other pay period (12 times a year).  Up until the end of last year only federal taxes were taken out of that allowance.  No social or state tax was taken out.  After a number of years of this I was used to it and had made other changes so that I wasn't hit hard each year at tax time.  This year they changed it so the car allowance is now subject to the same deductions as our regular pay (social, state and federal as well as 401k deduction).

According to my calculations the car allowance is now being taxed slightly higher than my regular pay.

I'm wondering if this extra pay is being treated like a bonus which we all get a couple times a year and is definitely taxed differently.

I'm hoping someone can tell me if extra allowances like this do get taxed differently, what that rate is and if there might be some reason the company couldn't just change our pay so that the allowance is just part of our salaried pay and not an ""extra benefit"".

The only reason I can think why they might not want to just roll it into our regular pay is that our raises each year are percentage based and that extra allowance would be more base pay to which a percentage was applied and hence they'd be paying out a greater pay increase each year.",finance
Bitcoin,Fed throwing FUD at bitcoin. Clearly no ulterior motive there.......,,cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,If scale is so important,"If crypto needs to scale to succeed it might help to have a brief history of scale:

1968-1989  IBM's CICS is the first middleware,  a transaction processing monitor who's primary motivation was to increase the number of users mainframe applications could handle, scale.  CICS would collect user requests for database access,  and more efficiently get those requests in and out of the database.  Because back then the users were hard wired to the hardware,  a lot of CICS also deals with terminal handling,  but the secret sauce was the concept of middleware to scale.

1989-2000 In 1989 at Bell labs in Cherry Hill New Jersey, Marc Carges develops TUX, (Transactions for Unix).  It's essentially CICS for Unix.  Later the TUX team creates a distributed version of TUX, they call it TUXEDO (TUX Extended for Distributed Operations).  This is the first distributed transaction processing system.  It introduces a new term, '3 tiered architecture'.  Tier 1 was the database,  Tier 2 was all the business logic , Tier 3 was all the users, all running on their own dedicated hardware.  TUXEDO was quasi productized around 1992 and quickly found customers like NASDAQ and FedEx.

2000-2010 The advent of Linux and cheap hardware begins the age of 'scale by mass'.  You no longer needed to squeeze performance out a few expensive machines with expensive middleware.  As a result, scalability issues DID NOT go away completely,  they just moved down the road.  An example was the Java App Server.  It was middleware,  designed to manage connections to databases and execute business logic.  It was still a three tiered architecture,  only now some of the third tier was moved elsewhere.  It took three years AFTER Java App servers were commercially deployed before they would start scaling.

I think crypto is following the exact same development path with side channel,  it's crypto's middle tier in a three tier architecture.  

So I would NOT bet on 'one coin that can scale'.  'The' side channel will scale any coin,  am I right?  Or will every coin's proprietary side channel scale each coin individually?  IBM tried to compete with TUXEDO back in the day and failed (Encina). 

TUXEDO would never had sold if it were not for the fact that it worked with ALL of the popular databases of the day!

Damn I wish I could invest in side channel independent of any one coin!  Can I?

Who's working in crypto on side channel by NOT creating a coin first?",cryptocurrency

ethereum,McAfee's Ethereum ICO founder indicted on 29 federal charges,"I used to trust McAfee because of his business background, but because of the ICOs he has been promoting  (which he proudly admits he is paid to promote) I have lost all respect and believe he may be driving himself into serious legal peril. I don't know how much damage he may be doing to the Ethereum name itself, but most of his ICOs are based on Ethereum so I can't imagine he is helping the cause.

It seems painfully obvious to me and just about everyone who understands cryptocurrency, but I am amazed at how many people on his Twitter account reply with enthusiast thanks and appreciation when he puts stuff like this out.

Here is just one of many examples (I posted this to r/CryptoCurrency  yesterday after doing just a modest amount of due diligence on his new Knowledge.io ICO):

John McAfee has sent out a few tweets from his official ""officialmcafee"" about an ICO that he just became an advisor of. He has joined the  Knowledge.io ""Knowledge Token"" ICO that started today, but he may not realize that the individual behind the ICO was recently indicted and arrested on 29 federal charges. 

The FBI and USA Attorney General are leading the federal case, for which a surprising amount of public records are available.

According to http://ImmersiveEducation.org/alert  (the educational non-profit that owns the""Knowledge Token"" trademark) public records indicate that the individual responsible for the ICO's unauthorized use of the ""Knowledge Token"" trademark was just indicted by the United States Department of Justice on 29 federal charges including conspiracy, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, and currently stands accused of defrauding a health clinic out of $2.8 million.

I don't have a Twitter account, but would love to see his response when he realizes that he might end up on the wrong side of the federal government over this and other coins he pumps (and in his most recent Knowledge.io ICO tweet he is very clear about the fact that he is paid a substantial amount of money to promote this ICO).

If you happen to join in on that Twitter discussion please let me know, since it's hard to keep up!

personalfinance,"23, Trying to decide whether to save or pay off debt first","Hi all,

I am 23, working full-time (plus pet sitting on the side) and living at home while I save money. I have about ~14k in car loans and ~55k in student debt. I don't remember the interest rates off the top of my head but I believe the car is 6.4% and the student debt is 3-4%. I'm also working on building a nest egg of ~10-15k for an emergency fund. My debt payments are around 1100 a month, and I've budged to have around 700 after everything else.

From what I've read here so far, and my instincts say I should pay the car down first. Currently all my pet sitting money and any insurance refunds goes directly into savings so I'm contributing at least a little every month to the nest egg, but I haven't decided if my leftover at the end of the month should go to savings as well, or to pay off the principle of my car, or if I should trade off every month. I like the idea of paying off the car to have more to be able to put into savings, but I recognize the need for an emergency fund.

Any thoughts?

Bitcoin,Will banks interest rates rise to encourage people to continue using fiat?,"Banks already use people's money that they store for safe keeping to make investments to earn the bank some extra cash.  As crypto goes mainstream less and less money will be stored in banks and instead kept in crypto wallets for safe keeping.  This may incentivize banks to raise savings/checking interest rates to keep the cash in there vaults.  Currently a bank can make anywhere from 3-6% off of ""safe investments"" such as mortgage loans using customers money but only offer .25-1% interest making up to 600% profit by lending other people your money.  As people withdraw funds to cash out and store money as crypto banks won't be able to lend as much.  To combat this they may raise interest rates for customers to keep the cash coming in.  Will it work?  Probably not.  

Will we see online wallets start to mimic banks by storing crypto and offering loans to customers using other people's crypto?  Probably.  Big banks will smart up and create online ""crypto banks"" for users to hold there money securely.  Maybe even offer a guaranteed rate of return for doing so.  I'm sure this won't happen for a while but you can almost guarantee it will eventually once mainstream adoption takes place and markets stabilize. 

I'm interested to hear others views.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Filing taxes is such a pain,"I have an issue I cannot find anywhere online referring to taxes and receiving refunds. 

Last year, 2016 I went to a community college. Well I paid for my classes and I found out the school charged me out of state. Well, they fixed it, I got my money back, but on the 1098-T, it still showed the out of state amount I had paid and I received no refund through filing. I had tried to go up to the school to get an updated 1098-T to reflect those changes made from out of state to in state, but the school said they cannot update it and give me a new one. They said I should file it on next year's. I had been filing 2016 through Turbotax, and since I was technically out of state on that form I received no refund, turbo tax auto filed it for me before the deadline for some reason too. How would I go about removing this? I tried to amend last year's and so I went to school website, my 1098-T from 2016 still reflects out of state.

personalfinance,how do you *actually* spend less?,"Hey everyone, I hope you're doing well. A year ago I got my first credit card, and I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/52ff8g/anxiety_about_credit_where_to_start/) talking about my anxiety with getting a credit card. I got great advice, which of course I didn't follow. Looking back on that post I realized that much of my stress was coming from the fact that I didn't (and don't) trust my self with the terrible power credit cards offer. 

Now I have 3 cards and about am about $1,700 in debt. That may not sound like much to some of you, but I had originally planned to pay my statement in full every month. Obviously my spending got away from me, and even though I should be able to clear this up completely within two paychecks, it still worries me. 

I've heard people describe me as 'disciplined.' Though from the inside i've never felt disciplined. I can eat well because I don't keep cookies in the house. My gaming pc is on a standing desk, so I'm only playing if I really want to. This 'monkey proofing' style of self-discipline is the only kind I've had success with. If I opened the fridge and found cake I would scarf it. If my games were in front of a couch I might be there all day.

When I was in college my savings was a wine bottle stuffed with 20 dollar bills; super easy to deposit money into, but kind of a pain to remove (I had to shatter the whole bottle and clean the mess up, which prevented me from withdrawing unnecessarily. Thanks college me! that wine bottle paid for my computer.)

So I dig around in this sub and /FinancialIndependence from time to time, and am totally in love with the philosophy and advice, but I have a lot of trouble putting these ideas into practice. 

In reaction to this creeping debt, I've stopped carrying any credit cards around. Actually right now I'm not carrying any kind of money in my wallet day to day, except when I am running an errand that I know beforehand requires buying something. (an extreme measure pherhaps, probably just until this debt is gone, though I am starting to like the simplicity of this lifestyle.)

I'm also getting rid of my car, partly because it didn't pass inspection, and the repairs will total it. But i'm not replacing it because I walk to work anyway, and I'm realizing that beyond insurance and gas, any time I drive I usually end up spending money at the destination. Driving enables poor spending habits, at least for me. 

I've seen people suggest having part of your paycheck direct deposit into you savings, and I do, but it's all too easy to move money from my savings to my checking. So my savings is empty and my mutual fund has become my savings (I know, I know) just because it's such a pain to withdraw from. Perhaps I should get a savings with a second bank and have my savings deposit there?

tldr; What stategies/tactics do you all use to spend less money? How do you fight the constant pressure of city life to buy things all the time? 
I'm talking specific things - 'spend less' or 'only buy on credit what you already have money for' is useless to me; Good ideas, true, but they are as easy to say as they are hard to do. How do you save money in real time?

personalfinance,Why Homeowners Are Richer Than Renters,"Why Homeowners Are Richer Than Renters

The reason: You can't help but build savings as you pay down a mortgage.


Eli Beracha, associate professor at Florida Inter­national University 

By PAT MERTZ ESSWEIN, Associate Editor   
From Kiplinger's Personal Finance

Eli Beracha is an associate professor at Florida Inter­national University. He is coauthor of ""A Revision of the American Dream of Home Ownership"" published in the Journal of Housing Research.

Why do homeowners accumulate more wealth than renters? Homeowners must make a substantial down payment when they buy and a mortgage payment every month. Part of every payment goes to pay loan principal, so that's like having a mandatory savings account. Plus, they've purchased an asset that, on average, they hold for a long period. None of those actions represents the best way to accumulate wealth, but together they are better than doing nothing. Most renters spend the difference between renting and owning a home on other things. So, for the average American, it's better to own, even with the changes to the tax law (see 26 Ways the New Tax Law Will Affect Your Wallet).

How does home-price appreciation compare with the return from investing in stocks and bonds over time? People believe that home-price appreciation in the U.S. is much higher than it really is. Over the long run, it exceeds inflation by about one-quarter to one-half of a percentage point per year. Increases in home prices and inflation must, by definition, be similar because housing is the biggest component in how the Federal Reserve calculates inflation. But stocks historically have returned an annual average of five to six percentage points more than inflation. Of course, you can't live in a stock, so it isn't fair to compare price appreciation of homes with the return on stocks.

Homeowners also un­derestimate the cost of ownership. They overlook how much they pay for expenses such as maintenance and closing and selling costs, and they don't value their time and effort.

So what must renters do to accumulate as much wealth as homeowners? We found that renters could, on average, accumulate more wealth than homeowners if they saved and invested the equivalent of a down payment, plus the difference between a monthly mortgage payment and rent, in a diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds. But the reality is, they don't.

personalfinance,"My father passed away a little over 3 months ago, and I'm trying to help my mother decide what to do with life insurance.","**Very long, but I would really appreciate your input, trying to make the most sound decisions**

Hello everyone,



I've been looking on this subreddit for quite a while now, and I figured now might be my time to ask for a little help/advice. My father passed away somewhat unexpectedly at the end of October 2017. He had a decent amount of life insurance, some of which my mother has already used to pay off a car, credit cards, and gave some to my father's sister as a gift to help her and my uncle pay off some debt to decrease their monthly expenses drastically (they described it as life changing so I'm very happy she did it), etc.



Right now, I'm trying to help her out with deciding how to handle/where to put the life insurance money. The insurance money will need to be used to help with monthly expenses and hopefully build some for her to use while she is in retirement which she plans to do in 7 years as she just turned 60 in January. I'll break down her finances below:

**Income:**
 
**Monthly Take Home Income: $2600** (Maxed out 401k, income will be a little higher as she will finally receive cost of living and merit raises for the first time in 10 years, but we're being conservative) 
 
 
**Monthly Expenses:**
 
 
Mortgage - $1774 (including Homeowner's Insurance, PMI, and Property Taxes - 3.6% interest rate - approx $240k left on note) - Also, she may potentially want to downsize our house and move closer into town, but that will be a few years from now more than likely)

 
**Utilities and Monthly Bills:**

Cable - $165 (will try to cut this down - DirecTV really knows how to stick it to you) 
  
Power - $220 

Water - $30 

Cellphone - $120 

Internet/Home Phone: $135   

Car Insurance - $145 

Storage Unit my Dad rented - $260

Plane...yes, a plane - $309

Exterminator - $35

Church - $100

Food, Gas, and Entertainment - $600 (This will also be adjusted potentially)

**Total Monthly Expenses: $3893**

401k: $125,000
Checking: $8000
Savings: $300,000 (Remainder of life insurance)



I'm off at school at the moment, but I will be moving back home to begin my clinical rotations at the beginning of May so I'm not home everyday to help her manage everything. We are currently trying to sell the plane, and it has about $24k left on the loan (this is something my dad did without my mom knowing a long time ago with a few friends of his). Based on the value of the plane, we should be able to sell it for no less than the remaining balance of the loan, which we are in the process of doing now. Unfortunately, it's not the quickest process, but eventually, the $309 will be off her monthly expenses. No legally, she doesn't have to do this, but she has agreed to until it is sold.
Additionally, after I move home, I will be able to help her go through my dad's storage unit and sell/donate/get rid of the stuff we can, so this too will be off her monthly expenses just not within the next 6 months or so. Lastly, we plan on shopping around for a new homeowner's and car insurance provider as their rates have actually gone up since taking my father off the policies.
 
  
 
Currently, she has around $8000 in her checking, and around $300,000 in a saving account with Wells Fargo. As soon as she deposited the life insurance, she was approached by a financial advisor (seemed like a nice guy as I met with him as well) who works with WF Advisors. I actually appreciated them approaching her as I didn't really know where to begin, but essentially their idea is to place $250k in mutual funds to help build it up for her retirement, but also provide her with an income each month to help offset what my dad was bringing in. They also wanted to place around $50k in a savings account as an emergency fund. 
 
 
 
**Here are my questions:**
 
Does this sound like a decent plan? Some of the monthly expenses will eventually decrease or subside so we can also adjust how much is being taken out of savings to offset the income/expense differential. 
 
 
Does WF Advisors have a decent reputation for treating their clients well? How are their fees generally? I know the banking side doesn't as I was apart of them opening up unwanted accounts. 
 
  
I know most people here recommend Vanguard, Fidelity, or Schwab. Is this something they're capable of handling for my mother? What potential advantages would they have over WF Advisors? She told me today that she really likes being able to speak with only the same person so she feels it might be easier to do this in person with WF.
 
 
Also, she is very weary of putting $250k in mutual funds as we're thinking there will be a bigger market correction soon (whether rational or not). I would feel more comfortable if she wasn't trying to use some for income or if retirement wasn't within the next 7 years or so. It would be safer to place $200k in mutual funds and $100k in savings, but I also want her to be able to maximize growth while she can.
 
 
Any and all feedback is greatly appreciated. I know it's a very long post, but I really thank you for reading it all.

personalfinance,"Looking to change banks, how do I know the best options out there and where can I find the best benefits?","So I’ve been banking with the same small local area credit union for about 10 years - First Heritage FCU, it’s the bank my mom had used the entire time I was growing up so I just went with the same one years ago. I’m currently involving myself with a huge financial overhaul, I was and am still extremely lacking in terms of financial knowledge but over the last week I’ve begun to educate myself on everything, I’ve started working on some digital budgeting spreadsheets on my laptop, am going to start using the envelope method for budgeting my biweekly checks because I have always had a horrible time budgeting. I’m hoping to fix my cash flow issues asap and get an emergency fund locked down. I want to have all my current debts other than my mortgage (only 1 year old) and vehicle (about $18k left) gone by the end of 2018. Then I’m hoping I will have educated myself enough on investing to be comfortable to start diversifying. 

Now, rewind back to why I am posting this, I’m considering looking into different options for banks that may be larger and offer more benefits than my current one. How do I know what banks have the best benefits? (I’m still rough around the edges on terminology here but APY’s? and things like that? I’m not really sure what to look at at all to compare what banks are good and which ones are better)

Like I mentioned, I’m currently using First Heritage Federal Credit Union. Some of the options I was considering looking into were Bank of America, USAA (I’m a vet and have a credit card and my insurance already through usaa), Corning Credit Union (Employee of Corning Inc required-which I am), can someone help me compare and contrast the ups and downs to these and possibly, if you know of other good options, include them?

personalfinance,Amended Return | $15 additional refund,"I e-filed taxes two weeks ago using H&amp;R Block Deluxe online software and already received my refund of approximately $350 (federal refund). North Carolina refund of $30 hasn't come through yet but should within the next few weeks. 

One of my income sources was $160 in Dividends from my Vanguard Brokerage account. The 1099-DIV form hadn't come through yet when I initially filed my taxes, so I ended up putting $160 as ""Ordinary Dividends."" Turns out my impatience got the best of me, and when Vanguard finally released the 1099-DIV two days ago, I found out that $150 of the dividends were actually ""Qualified Dividends.""

I amended the return using H&amp;R blocks software and it turns out this mistake will actually get me an additional refund of $15! The state return does not appear to be affected by this change (shows $0 in additional refunds). 

Anyways, now is the part I am confused about. I always e-file my tax returns, but since this is an amended return 1040X, I have to actually mail this in. 

With my original return, I had the following forms filed:

* 1040 
* 8889
* 8962
* 1095-A
* 1099-DIV
* 1099-INT (three different ones)
* W-2 (two different ones)


What exactly am I supposed to send them?? Do I also need to file an amended return for NC, even though the income and refund didn't change for NC?

personalfinance,26-Year-Old Grad PhD Student With $0 in Savings: Paying Massive Taxes Every Year and Trying to Save Up For a Car...Am I Doing This the Right Way?,"Hi /r/personalfinance, I have a question about paying taxes as a grad student and saving at the same time. I receive an untaxed stipend, so I just get an amount deposited into my checking account every month that's not taxed.

That means I don't get a W-2. I only get a 1098-T from my university, so I put info from that into TurboTax. So I end up paying taxes every year, not getting a tax refund. I end up paying around ~$3300 federal and ~$700 State (CA) every year when I submit my TurboTax online in the spring (before the April deadline). Those numbers are for this year.

So, tax season is frightening for me. I basically save up money all year from my meager grad student stipend to manage to pay taxes and lose it all when I submit TurboTax. I don't have any savings - so every year when I pay my taxes it's emptying out my savings account, and I have to start from scratch to save up enough to pay taxes the following year. If I live very frugally, I can save ~$300-400 a month on my stipend, so ~3600 to $4800 saved in a year.

I live independently, have no loans, and have no car. The grad school stipend covers all of my living expenses such as rent, groceries, transportation, etc., and I live carefully/frugally but comfortably.

Am I doing things the right way as a grad student? Should I be paying taxes throughout the year somehow to lessen the blow? Is this the life that other grad students live, if there are any of you out there? Or past grad students...what did you do to pay taxes and save up at the same time? I am afraid I will graduate with no savings and no way to purchase a car to commute to my first job with.

I just feel so bad every tax season, I know that taxes must be paid, but to be left with an empty savings account makes me feel like I'm not progressing in life financially. I already put aside money every year for taxes, record (on an excel spreadsheet) and am aware of all my expenses and live frugally, so I don't know what else I could be doing to save money.

I guess I should also add, my parents opened a Traditional IRA (mutual funds) for me when I was 20, and they've been contributing to it for the past years now, which I am very grateful for. The plan is, they will hand it over to me when I get my PhD and start my first job. I am very thankful and grateful that they did that for me and I want to understand it to the fullest extent, and at the same time also put in work when I can to save for my future on my own as well.

I'd really appreciate any insight on how things went for you as a grad student, if I'm doing the whole taxes thing right or if I could be doing it in a better way, anything at all. Thanks in advance.",finance

Well recently they discontinued the card and moved everyone to the Citi TY preferred card which just gives 2% off entertainment.

Ever since they nerfed the card I've been trying to get a PC (Product Change) to the Citi DoubleCash but they wouldn't do it until now! I didn't want to close the card so I just called them up today after activating the new Citi TY preferred card and they accepted the product change!

I can save the capital one card for traveling since it has no foreign transaction fees

I called Fed Loan Servicing trying to reduce my payments to income based repayment. They informed me that my account with them had been passed on to the Department of Education back in DEC 2016!!! I was never informed that my account was passed off to them, prior to my even applying for forbearance. Low and behold, since I was unaware that I was no longer under Fed Loan Servicing,  my account was then sent to collections where I now owe $10,429.00. And I cannot do anything until I am out of collections and then will be placed back under the umbrella of Fed Loan. I was never informed via, email, phone call or paper mail from Fed Loan, Department of Education or Collections. 
I even made sure to call Fed Loan in Feb. 2017 where I was told by a representative that my forbearance had been approved. I am just at a loss of what to do, because once I worm my way out of collections, the money of what I owe them will be tacked onto my current outstanding student loan balance.

personalfinance,Looks like I get to start over,"After more than a decade together, my husband and I will be divorcing as soon as we can unload our condo.  I have to make some decisions rapidly.  Pain aside, I have the opportunity to reset my entire life, including the money.

I'm mid-40s, 70K income, 20K in retirement.  You can see the problem.

I should personally net about $75,000 from the sale of the condo, in about 2-3 months.  At that point,  I'll be homeless.

Where do I land?  I'm in a decent-sized city, and I've been at my employer many years.  A decent 1-bedroom is $1500/month, which is all I theoretically need.  A 2-bedroom condo starts at $225K.  A 2-bedroom house starts at around $300K.

I'll have a $20K student loan; nothing else except living expenses.  Good credit.  No kids.

As for future lifestyle plans, I'm in great physical condition, relatively young, outgoing, and interested in meeting people.  I think a small house fits my needs and wants best, but I need to be investing $2000-3000 per month for the next 20 years.  I'll only be able to achieve maybe $1500 per month if I buy a $300K house, and that's stretching things to the limit.  I average a 7.5% annual pay increase, FWIW.

65 sounds good for retirement, and I'll move to a cheaper city.  Monthly retirement expenses will be about $2K, because wherever I retire, it'll be in a paid-for home.  I may remarry, I may inherit, but I don't think it's wise to factor those ""maybes"" into this decision.

""Why don't you rent for 6 months so you're not rushed?""  I might, but a) I already know this city well, b) I have 2-3 months to decide, and c) interest rates are headed up.  If I need more time, it won't be much.  I can couch surf or AirBnB for a few weeks.

I could also move a state away and take a comparable job with a major supplier of mine.  It'd be a lower-COL area, and I have family there too.  My personal support network is slightly better there, but it's good here.

**tl;dr:** Divorcing, retirement is underfunded, mid-40s, decent income, little debt, $75K cash soon.  Buy a house, buy a condo, rent an apartment, or move a state away?

Forex,EURUSD fundamental analysis 2/13/18,"So I pulled up the data from January 2017 on both Euro and USD. I think everyone can agree that was when you wanted to go long EURUSD. Here's what I found on each of the categories that I've been told are important to fundamental analysis:

* 17-Jan	euro	usd
* interest rate	0	0.75
* inflation rate	1.8	2.5
* gdp growth rate	0.6	1.2
* unemployment rate	9.6	4.8
* balance of trade	-1583	-48715
* government debt to GDP	90.3	105.8

Here's where we stand today:

* 18-Feb	euro	usd
* interest rate	0	1.5
* inflation rate	1.3	2.1
* gdp growth rate	0.6	2.6
* unemployment rate	8.7	4.1
* balance of trade	26273	-53118
* government debt to GDP	89.2	105.4

As I've noted before the big thing that stood out in the Jan 17 assessment is that negative trade balance on the US side. I still maintain that $48B/mo in negative cash flows (now $79B!) just from running the economy has to dwarf any contribution from Forex speculators, but maybe I'm wrong. Yes, trillions of dollars move through Forex and derivatives, but these are Euros being bought with no stop loss or take profit, and minimal concern for order entry position. We would have to go all the way back to May of 2014 to see conditions that greatly favored the US.

Comparing this year to last, Euro is down 28% on its inflation but up 9.4% on unemployment and 1.2% on government debt. The trade balance has swung $24.7B in favor of the Euro. GDP growth rate and interest rate has not changed.

On the other hand, the USD had doubled its interest rate while losing 16% of its inflation. GDP has more than doubled and unemployment has improved 14.6%. The massive trade deficit has worsened 9% to -$53B. Government debt improved last year 0.38% but I expect that number to worsen once Trump's tax plan is on the books.

Tomorrow's inflation data is projected to show 1.9% which would be even worse at -24%.

So going category by category:

* interest rate: favors US for the moment (see below)
* inflation: favors Euro
* GDP: greatly favors US
* unemployment: US
* BoT: greatly favors Euro
* Government debt: favors Euro, soon will even more heavily 

I'm not seeing inflation to justify interest rate increases on the USD side. If you want to buy bonds I think now is the time to do so. You can resell them later once the US announces it is backing off from interest rate increases. The Trump tax plan did prop up the stock market momentarily, but it also incurs debt that's going to hurt the US if it wants to continue raising interest rates.

The US cannot fix its trade balance. The new tax plan really only helps plutocrats. I don't think giving more money to the average citizen would help either since the average citizen would just spend more on foreign goods. The only thing I can think of is some sort of redistribution of wealth, with a focus on helping small businesses. At any rate, I'm not a politician just a speculative spectator.

Other than long EURUSD, JPY, ZAR, and CNH all look strong with high trade balances to counteract the USD. ZAR and CNH have higher interest rates, though Oanda doesn't pay interest on the CNH trade. NZD looks more risky but it might be worth a play as well. There isn't as much pressure for them to drive their currency down like there is for JPY and CNH. I like ZAR mostly as a hedge against the negative carry trade from being long the other currencies, but it should improve in value as well.",finance

personalfinance,Need help deciding for or against continuing my education.,"Hi everyone! I have exhausted my friends and families help and am looking for more advice. I am a 23 year old female in New Jersey. I have an undergraduate degree from a state university and will be finished my Masters of Social Work degree at that same university in May. As of right now, I have ~80k student loans from both my masters and my bachelors degree (6 years of school). 

As a social worker, I cannot expect to make a huge salary. I knew this going in. On average, I would make ~50k a year in my state doing what I want to do. So for this information, I will assume that the PSLF will be out of business because I cannot be relying on the government to be kind to me. On the standard repayment terms, I would be paying $888 a month at ~6% interest rate for 10 years. $888 would be about ~22% of my monthly income.

Dilemma: I have a desire to earn an additional masters degree to become a nurse practitioner relating to my social work degree (Mental Health Nurse Practitioner) to 1.) make a higher salary (2x) and 2.) help my patients more and 3.) have more autonomy/be more in the leader position.

Cost wise: an accelerated Masters in Nursing plus the NP certificate could put me out another ~120k in debt. Nurse Practitioners in my area doing what I would like to do make ~100k starting a year. For this data, using the standard repayment terms, I would be paying $2,200 a month at 6% interest for 10 years. At 100k a year, $2,200 would be about ~28% of my monthly income. I know if I stop my education now I probably will not go back so paying off some of my debt in between schooling is not an option for me. In addition, I cannot work during the accelerated Masters in Nursing due to the program not allowing us to.

Question: Should I place myself more into debt for the higher income because the % of my income of student loan payments would be almost equal? Or should I not go back to school and stay at my lower income doing what I am already doing just to not to get more into debt? Is there a third option?

I appreciate anyone reading this or commenting to help me! I am just having to make so many decisions for my future and am trying not to rely on any loan forgiveness programs or loan repayment plans because I cannot trust that those programs will still be in place 10/20/25 years down the line.",finance
personalfinance,Is it unusual to make 18k and only receive $173 in a refund?,"Compared to the last two years, my refund is significantly less. Last year my AGI was 19,065 and I got return of $590
This year my AGI was $18,925 and my return came up to $173
My AGI was only $140 less this year but the return was $417 less than last years. 
Looking at my W2 from this year and last, there was actually quite a bit more being withheld from my 2016 check than this years. 
(Fed, Social, Medicare, State) but the difference between this year and last year's AGI is so little, I can't imagine the huge difference in the return being because I made a little more last year, enough to have so much left over. 

My bf insists I did something wrong but since I used turbotax (double checked in TaxAct) I can't imagine that something went wrong in the filing process. Turbo is pretty cleanly explained. I was ready to just shrug it off and say ""Well that's our system"" but now I have a twinge of doubt that maybe I did mess up somewhere. 

I thought maybe the taxes just went way up this year so our state and fed kept most of what they took out of my checks but they took out less this year than they did last year. There was $552.95 more taken out last year than this year but I still had quite a bit leftover despite the AGI difference being only $140.
I don't think I filed as head since you need to add dependents to file as such but I don't and never had any dependents so the website wouldn't have let me send in my return with that status. I think in 2015 my ex filed us jointly. Not only do I not remember making that decision, I don't remember how much we got back on the return (it went into his bank).

So my confusion lies in how I could make pretty much the same this year as last, have more taxes withheld last year than this year but somehow get back less this year. 
There must be something I'm missing here..something in the calculations and jargon or something because we need the money to put down on a home so if I'm screwing something up, I gotta know so I can fix it.",finance
personalfinance,Boyfriend and I both have low credit scores but need to replace a broken down vehicle,"My boyfriend’s car (2002 Subaru Forester) broke down last week. Our household is down to one vehicle, my 2000 Toyota Camry. The Camry seems to be running in great shape but we are worried about it being our sole vehicle due to its age. My boyfriend is anxious to replace his car and be mobile again but unfortunately has a low credit score of 580 due to identity theft several years ago (several credit cards opened in his name went into collections). His last vehicle was purchased (with an exorbitant interest rate racked on) from a buy here pay here lot and he still owes $1500 on it. He can pay off the difference with his tax refund but won’t have much left for a down payment on a new car, and won’t be able to get much for his current vehicle aside from scrap maybe. We’ve investigated and it’s not repairable. He is looking to purchase another Subaru, probably 2009-2011 for our budget which we hope will be more reliable based on our research. I want him to go to a more legitimate dealer, but we think he would face issues getting financing due to his score. 

Unfortunately my credit score is also low at 616 just because I only opened up my first secured card a month ago and am just building my credit, but have no debt to speak of. I think this rules me out as a potential co-signer. 

It seems like doubling down and buying another car from a BHPH lot is not the way to go, but what are his choices? Buying a beater in cash for a few grand from Craigslist also seems like a risky move when we are trying to build our savings - we have some, but not a ton to spare and don’t want to get burned again. I wonder if using my credit to apply to purchase a more reliable car and then refinancing when my score has improved makes sense, or if there is some other alternative we aren’t considering.

My income is $67k, his is $38k, our rent is $1600 a month (we’re locked in an 18 month lease and just moved in last week). Other than that no credit card debt, student debt, medical bills etc. Just utilities and food are our only other expenses. 

I’ve never taken out a loan or bought a car from a dealership before and am a little clueless on the process so the more detail the better.

Additionally will receive 10,000 stock options (this is a pre-IPO startup, so extremely difficult to evaluate the value of the options). The gotchas are:

1. Need to repay the ""full net Retention Bonus"" if I leave or am terminated with cause (i.e. fired for a reason)
2. Need to repay a ""pro rata portion of the full net Retention Bonus"" if terminated without cause (presumably if affected by a layoff).
3. Release employer/investors from any existing and future legal claims (known and unknown) up to the end of the 18 month period (excluding claims that are legally ""not waivable""). 

I'm not actively looking to leave this company, but I'm concerned that the repayment and release of liability clauses are too heavily stacked in the companies favor. Obviously, I like keeping my options open, but 20K is a nice chunk of change even after taxes.

*The 20K represents about 15% of my normal base salary. 

*Company has lost ~30% of staff mostly due to employees jumping ship. 

*Financial issues are temporarily resolved for the next 12 months or so, as long as the company meets specific performance milestones. 

Any thoughts are welcome. 

*Specifically, I'm curious how often employers actually try to enforce these agreements if the employee is laid off without cause.

*I've seen some anecdotal evidence (via google search) that a payback clause may not always be enforceable in California. Is this anywhere close to being true?

*Finally, does the term ""full net Retention Bonus"" legally imply that the payback amount excludes taxes that were originally withheld (approximately 40% in Fed/State/FICA)

Americans Can’t Get Enough Consumer Debt
 - After taking a breather during the recession, Americans have a voracious appetite again for credit-card, auto loans

By AnnaMaria Andriotis
Updated Feb. 14, 2018 9:59 a.m. ET
47 COMMENTS
Interest rates are on the rise, but that hasn’t curbed Americans’ appetite for consumer debt.

If anything, consumers are borrowing more on credit cards or through auto loans than they have in years, and lenders seeking growth are happy to oblige them.

Abe Schilling, a 33-year-old car salesman in Great Falls, Mont., said he signed up for more than five credit cards over the past year, from issuers including Capital One Financial Corp. and Discover Financial Services , after he received offers in the mail. He also took out a $36,000 loan to buy a new Jeep Grand Cherokee.

Mr. Schilling, who currently rents his home, said the offers have been arriving as his credit score has improved. He previously had dozens of collections and other negative marks on his credit reports after failing to pay back bills. With a steady income and months of debt counseling behind him, Mr. Schilling says he feels confident in his ability to pay for his debts.

So do plenty of other Americans. In the fourth quarter, consumer debt, excluding mortgages and other home loans, rose 5.5% from a year earlier to $3.82 trillion. That is the highest amount since the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began tracking the data in 1999. Moreover, consumers’ non-housing debts accounted for just over 29% of their overall debt load, also the highest amount on record.

Many observers say they aren’t worried yet. Their concerns about non-housing credit are nascent since delinquencies are rising from historically low levels. Also, household debt including mortgages, the biggest category, barely edged up from the third quarter and remains well off the crisis-era highs as a percent of U.S. economic output.


“In good times, people tend to take on a little more consumer credit because they think ‘Well, my income looks good, my job looks very stable,’ and when the economy turns down, they dial that back,” said Tom Miller, professor of finance at Mississippi State University.

Still, there are signs that consumers’ ability to handle these increased debt levels is getting strained. Student loans, the largest debt category consumers hold after mortgages, continue to have persistently high delinquencies.

Overall, households are paying about 5.8% of their disposable personal income to stay current on their nonmortgage debts, according to third-quarter Federal Reserve data. This figure, which is at the highest level since the end of 2008, bottomed out at 4.9% in 2012.

An improving economy has fueled much of the growth in consumer borrowing. Low unemployment and rising confidence have increased consumers’ appetite for big-ticket purchases and made lenders more willing to dole out larger loan balances while increasing credit-card limits. The boost to loan volume and balances has helped lift bank earnings and overall retail sales.

The shift to nonmortgage debt, including credit cards and personal loans, carries some drawbacks for consumers, including higher interest rates. “This type of debt is problematic,” said Cris deRitis, senior director and economist at Moody’s Analytics. “It should really be temporary,” but for some consumers “it can be hard to get off that treadmill.”

 
The boom in consumer debt outside the home is in part the result of lingering effects of the last recession that have kept many consumers from buying homes out of fear of foreclosure or because underwriting requirements remain stricter than other types of loans.

Some banks are tightening lending requirements in an effort to get in front of any problems. Discover’s chief executive, David Nelms, said in October the bank lowered spending limits on some of its credit cards and it is scaling back on some of the personal loans that it is originating. “There’s been a big increase in supply,” he said in an interview at the time. “We’re having to make adjustments.”


Consumer loans have also become easier to obtain in recent years as lenders compete for loan volume. That has resulted in an abundance of loan solicitations in consumers’ mailboxes and inboxes, even as losses start to rise.

Despite the strong economy, missed payments and losses that lenders are taking after borrowers fail to get back on track with their bills are increasing, raising concerns among some banks and their investors. The average charge-off rate for eight of the largest U.S. credit-card lenders by purchase volume was 3.25% in the fourth quarter, up 0.36 percentage point from a year earlier, marking the seventh straight quarter of year-over-year increases, according to Fitch Ratings.

Some of these loans also have variable interest rates that climb after the Federal Reserve raises rates. With more rate increases expected this year, the result could be more losses to come for lenders and heavier burdens for consumers.

Already, the average repayment period for loans issued to buy new cars hit an all-time high of 69 months, according to third-quarter data from credit-reporting firm Experian. Personal loans extended to consumers during the first half of last year averaged $6,285, according to the latest data from credit-reporting firm TransUnion, up 7.8% from a year earlier.",finance

I received subsidies to help with the premium payments. 
Later in the year I needed some rather expensive home repairs, so I took money out of my retirement plan. I don’t know what I was thinking, but I just didn’t realize this would be counted as income. 
Long story short. Filing taxes, and the disbursement put me over the 400 % poverty guideline (just by a couple grand), so I have to pay back the entire amount of the subsidies I received.

Forex,Demand raising CPI?,"So I assumed the CPI data would be higher. The expected rate was 0.3% and I knew that was low. Paying attention to oil prices there's no way the bull rally for oil was going to mean a passive CPI release.

I think inflation will rise before the March rate hike, but why would higher prices means higher inflation UNLESS the biggest mover of higher CPI was the firm's increasing prices to keep up with higher consumer demand.

If the consumer demand doesn't change then higher prices on consumer goods should mean less inflation. If you have $100 for groceries every week but groceries keep costing more then you should be buying less right?

Does anyone have info on the consumption rate, unemployment rate, disposable income, or other relevant metrics for the last 3 months?

personalfinance,Looking for options on refinancing a car loan.,"Hi all,

I bought a car a little over a year ago in December of 2016. Due to my situation at the time I had very little money for a downpayment and needed a car almost immediately. My line of work involves a lot of seasonal jobs and moving around the country, so I needed something relatively new that got good gas mileage. My dad was able to set me up with a friend of his at a local dealership and after being convinced by the salesman I left with a brand new car, despite the fact that I was only making $800 a month before taxes. Looking back, I know this was not a smart decision because of my low down payment, not that great credit score, having no cosigner, and various other finance related issues, but I needed a good reliable car and was easily convinced buying a new car was my best option.

The issue came, however, with the interest rate on my car loan. In order to be approved for the loan I was given an interest rate of about 16% but was told by the salesman (my dad's friend) that I would have no problem refinancing the loan later on. Back in October I attempted to refinance the loan with pretty much every type of loan service I could think of (bank's, credit unions, pre-approved refinance offers in the mail) but was repeatedly denied because now I owe about 150% on the car's value.

I have been at my current job almost 6 months now and make closer to $2,300 a month and I am still hoping there is some option for refinancing the car at a much lower interest rate. My car payment is my main expense right now since paying my credit card debt off and while I have no problem making the payments, it is disheartening to pay $450 a month and hardly see any change in the amount I owe on the loan. I will be moving to a new job starting in May and will be making a little less money and have a lot of necessary things to purchase before then while still hoping to save some money, so my immediate funds available are quite low. I was wondering if there were any other options for refinancing that I may have overlooked or that would be worth trying?

TL;DR Bought a new car a little over a year ago with a 16% interest rate, tried to refinance, failed, and trying to find other options.",finance

I wanted to get an idea about my tax situation and making sure that I am doing things correctly.

-Married Filling Jointly, 2 kids.
-Both husband and I claim 0 on both Fed/State taxes

Questions 1: With the new tax plan we are in the 22% single and married. I take this as an easier way for us to calculate our taxes since now we don't have to worry that individually we are not being taxed enough and then have to worry about paying more once we add in our pay together. We typically get a small return since our CA mortgage interest/Medical is deducted while filing the taxes. I am aware that those things will not be as useful with the new tax plan, but thats ok with me as long as I don't ever owe money.  With the new tax plan, if we are both being charged 22%, both claiming 0, there should be no reason that we OWE money, correct?

Questions 2: With that being said, have I calculated my paychecks correctly? Right now we are paying less for Medical/Kaiser but its post tax. I've added in all my calculations on excel and then figured out the % of fed/state that I'm being charged based on what is taken out of my paycheck (one a month).  I then duplicated the situation so that Medical/Kaiser is taken out pre-tax as well. From the numbers (assuming I didn't make a mistake) it makes more sense to pay for medical before taxes even though its a higher premium. I want to up my 403B by 100 which will then make the monthly take home the same as my current one but with extra money I saved from pre-tax medical rolling into retirement.

Ripple,"Thought on the fabled ""Bank of Amazon"" speculations","Forgive me if this has been done before, but I had this thought in light of the recent news coming from Ripple partnerships. My big question is if xSuite and ILP can allow one to create a new bank that does not have the need of a nostro account built into its original framework.

Beyond the hype in the past few months about this juicy partnership hopefully being on the horizon, what if Amazon is waiting to launch a bank specifically because of Ripple's disruptive xRapid implementation?

When I think of the ""first mover"" (Ripple) and ""early adopter"" (SBI Holdings, etc.) advantages, I come to the conclusion of one obvious remaining advantage no current bank or FI could have. Being built natively with the use of xSuite and the ILP in mind from day one.

Am I crazy? If I was Bezos I would be waiting in the shadows while SBI and WU do all the leg work of testing xRapid and actual cross border remittances so I don't assume any risk. It's pretty similar to what Jobs did in his early return to Apple; wait for other people to develop great ideas and tech then implement them when the upswing is imminent.

15% My Salary --&gt; 401k (my contributions, I must minimum put in 8% for this)
12% My Salary --&gt; 401k (company contributions)
15% Her Salary --&gt; 401k
Approx 90k in 401k total now combined

Total Savings Liquid Cash - 30k

Yearly savings at the end of the year is really only around 5-10k liquid. Since we were married we have purchased the house (downpayment), 2 cars (one with cash one with a 16kish loan as seen above), made some finishes to our house, made first home purchases, and made ourselves comfortable, but not a ""ton"" of savings like we were when we were scrounging in a small apartment saving for a 20% down payment.

Both aged 28.

Life Insurance Me - 600k Policy
Life Insurance Her - 200k Policy 

My max out of pocket $ for the delivery and care is going to be 6k but I expect it to cost around 3k-3.5k.

I am not worried about expenses in the near future, but I am wanting to plan for the future. The baby was planned since we have a small window in which we can have a child every year based on her work, so I wasn't exactly planning on it happening the first year, but nonetheless it is here. My original plan was to shift the car payment which will be complete before this year is over to paying off my principal mortgage on my house, but if there is a better option like college or something I would prefer to that if it makes more sense. I will also have more expenses (another mouth to feed, diapers, child care, etc etc.) so I may have to move that 550/month towards that stuff for the first year or so while we get settled in.

Couple of quick questions?

College: How do I set up a College fund, what is it called, what are the benefits. Also if he/she were to not go to college and/or get a scholarship and not have to pay for College what happens then? Does the fund pay for housing or just tuition?

Anything other college like accounts to open up for child?

Should I look to start looking into a better life insurance policy for her after she has the child (I probably should have before I know) I think 600k would be enough for her/child if something were to happen to me.

Any other suggestions on what to start doing especially with the extra 550/month I will have after paying off her car. (Put towards house/college/newcar/etc?)

The biggest thing for me is Financial Security for the future. I am currently pretty secure now and I am not worried about the near future since my job is very stable and so is hers. I just want to get a plan early to try to stick to it as much as possible",finance

personalfinance,Should I pay off my 14.5% APR car loan immediately?,"Hi guys. I bought a new car (2015 Corolla) recently, for about $15K after fees and taxes. I put a $6,000 down payment down, so the total loan is now $9,000, and the first payment is due on March 7.

The reason I'm writing this is because I have a very high interest rate on the car. This is for a few reasons.

1. I'm self-employed, and could not provide any pay stubs or proof of employment, even though I make $40-$45k per year, and had 0 debt (before the car loan) from credit cards, loans, or medical bills, or any other sources. 

2. I had no active credit accounts until last month, when I signed up for a credit card (with a ridiculously low $500 limit.) Previously, I had two student loans, which I repaid in 2015. I have had no open credit accounts since then (which I realize now was a mistake)

For these two reasons, I showed up in the Toyota credit system as essentially having a ""0"" credit score. I was also unable to get pre-approved by several lenders, so this did not surprise me. 

I needed the car, so I figured that I should just take this hit, and start paying off the car as soon as I can, so I signed the paperwork. However, I also want to build up my credit score. 

I have enough cash to buy the car outright and pay off the remainder of my loan -- now, if I wanted. I have 8.5K in a checking account, and 12K in a high-yield Discover savings account. 

Obviously, it would not be ideal to blow all of this money on a car. So, currently, my plan is to drop $5-6K towards the loan on my first payment due date. This way, I could reduce the $212 monthly payment, and save about $2k in interest over the lifetime of the loan.

Doing so would drop the monthly payment significantly. Then, I would pay $250-$300 more than the monthly payment every month, until the car is paid off, which would take a little bit over a year.

I may even refinance within 3-4 months, if that's long enough to build a solid credit score, and get a much lower APR.

My question is this. Is this a good idea? I know 14.5% APR is insanely high, but if I put a lot of money towards my loan during my first payment, is it worth paying a high APR for a few months in order to help build up my credit score? 

Or am I better off pulling money from my savings, and paying down the entire loan now? I would still have enough money for a rainy day fund and my Q1 quarterly freelance taxes -- but that would be about it. 

Any input you have would be valuable. I appreciate it.


EDIT:

Thanks for the feedback, guys. I think I'm going to try to pay off the loan immediately. I should easily have 6-12 months of emergency cash left over, and if I think about it as a 14.5% ROI, it makes a lot more sense then just sitting on my money for no reason, while paying egregious interest rates.",finance

personalfinance,Clarification on Underpayment Penalty for Quarterly Tax Payments,"Let's say in 2016 I paid $20,000 in federal taxes working in the United States (specifically California) through employer withholding.

During 2017, I ended up quitting my job sometime during the end of the year. I ended paying $16,000 in federal taxes through employer withholding. 

However, during let's say February of 2017, I also sold stock and say I owe $9000 in taxes after the sale.

It wasn't until now that I realized I completely forgot about possible underpayment of taxes, and foresee underpayment penalties coming.

I obviously don't meet the safe harbor of paying taxes up to the amount of prior year's taxes (100% of 2016 taxes).

I also definitely didn't pay up to 90% of this year's tax liabilities when accounting for the capital gains I made through selling stock. (0.9 * (16k + 9k)) = 22.5k

So, it looks like I'm gonna get hit with underpayment penalties. And since I didn't make any quarterly payments at all for 2017, I would get hit with the penalty from all four quarters.

------
1) My first question is, did I pretty much get all of the above correct? I slightly changed some numbers to make everything easier on the eyes/mind.

------
2) Is the amount of money that is subject to the penalty only based on the minimum amount I had to pay within all quarters? 

So, my total tax liability for 2017 would be (16k + 9k) = 25k.

90% of 25k = 22.5k 

100% 2016 tax liability = 20k

------
Based on this, I could've paid a total of 20k in taxes (assuming proper amounts paid per quarter) during 2017, and completely avoided underpayment penalties.

Is the amount of money that is subject to the underpayment penalty rate the difference between this amount (20k) and amount of taxes I had already paid (16k) ... (20k - 16k = 4k).

Or is it the entire amount of tax I haven't paid yet subject to the penalty? (25k - 16k = 9k), which is the entire amount of tax I owe for the stock sale. The entire amount that I owe by April.

I'm thinking it's the former, but I would love some confirmation on this.

Also, I assume this pretty much works the same way in individual states (specifically California), just that the quarterly rates for each quarter may differ from Federal.",finance

personalfinance,Considering Contributing to a Traditional-IRA for 2017 and then doing a Rollover to a Roth IRA in 2018. Does this make sense?,"Hello PF!

After much research and thought I am planning on contributing to a Traditional IRA this year to lower my income and then, next year or another year within the next five years, roll it over into a Roth IRA. However, **I want to make sure I am not missing anything obvious here.** Who better to ask than PF?

I've read through the FAQs about Roth vs Tradtional over at [this page](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/rothortraditional) and the following line caught my eye. 

""Here's a self-description of someone who should probably go Traditional: 

-I expect tax rates to be lower in the future.

-I expect periods of very low income that will be opportunities to convert to Roth, such as years spent going back to school, starting my own business, early retirement, or staying home with my kids""

**My Current Situation**

-My wife and I got married in 2017.

-My wife was on the ObamaCare Exchange and received an income-dependent Advanced Premium Tax Credit.

-Our AGI of 63K is likely to drop next year. My wife will earn less money and we will have no more bitcoin left to sell.

-We are exploring putting solar panels on our house that receive a 30% federal tax credit and a 25% NYS tax credit

-We are likely to have children in the next three years and would like my wife to stay home with kids. I could also experience a decrease in income if I use the NYS Paid Family Leave benefit.

-I am exploring going back to school in the next 1 to 3 years and will not earn money during that period.


**I think we should contribute to a traditional IRA and convert to a Roth IRA for the following reasons**

-The amount we receive in the Obamacare Advanced Premium Tax Credit goes up by $240 if we contribute 6k to traditional IRAs (3k each). However, we will not receive this benefit next year due to my wife getting on my insurance at work. 

-The our federal tax rate will drop from 15% to 12% due to tax reform next year.

-Our income will be lower in future years due to the possibility of staying home with children and going back to school.

-If we put solar panels on our house, it would take many years to earn enough to ensure that we earned enough to fully receive the benefits from the NYS tax credit. However, if we pay less NYS tax this year due to contributing to a Tradtional IRA, and then rollover next year, then we could shift the NYS tax from this year into next year. It's possible will move from NYS and this would ensure we could receive the full benefit.

What am I missing? Does this make sense?

TL;DR My wife and I are likely to earn less money in the next 3 years. I want to shift taxes from this year into next year via a Traditional IRA to Roth Rollover.

- ""Application of U.S. trade laws, or trade laws of other countries, may also impact, either directly or indirectly, our operating results. For example, in April 2017, a U.S.-based manufacturer of solar cells filed a petition under Sections 201 and 202 of the Trade Act of 1974 for global safeguard relief with the U.S. International Trade Commission (the “USITC”). Such petition requested, among other things, the imposition of certain tariffs on crystalline silicon solar cells imported into the United States and the establishment of a minimum price per watt on imported crystalline silicon solar modules. In September 2017, the USITC determined such products are being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury to the relevant domestic industry. The USITC has proceeded to the remedy phase of its investigation, following which it may recommend remedies, such as tariffs, quotas, or trade adjustment assistance, to the U.S. presidential administration. In October 2017, we submitted a letter in a non-party capacity to provide the USITC with information to inform its remedy recommendation. Thin-film solar cell products, such as our CdTe technology, are expressly excluded from the petition. However, it is unknown how the resolution of the petition, the scope or form of any resulting remedial action taken by the U.S. presidential administration, or any other U.S. or global trade remedies or other trade barriers, may directly or indirectly affect U.S. or global markets for solar energy and First Solar’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.""

personalfinance,Rear Ended: Insurance Payout for total loss,"I'm wondering if anyone with experience with total loss insurance payments can help me out. I hope this is an appropriate sub to post this in, I've seen a ton of great advice on here since I started following /r/personalfinance.

A few weeks ago I was in my car, stationary at a red light when a high school aged girl rear ended me. My car is a '96 Toyota Avalon, she was in a 2012 Jeep Wrangler. The jeep basically had no damage, just a scuffed bumper cover. My car's bumper shoved the metal floor of the trunk and the trunk lid forward, partially broke the taillights by pushing them out of alignment, and the bumper cover is pushed in with a hole in one side.

We both contacted their insurance (Nationwide) who told me since their customer was 100% at fault, my car would be repaired to the condition it was in before the accident (which is not true.) I went to a local collision shop and got an repair estimate ($2500 to replace the whole bumper, trunk lid, emblems, and brake/turn signal lights,) which they also sent to Nationwide. Nationwide then sent one of their people out to review the damage and do a value evaluation.

Given how old the car is, and a small amount of previous damage (cracked front bumper from someone presumably backing into me with a trailer hitch- a hit and run essentially) they told me the car is considered a total loss. Estimated resale value was only around $1500. They offered me around $700 to keep the car, or about $1000 to turn it over to them. This doesn't seem reasonable to me, because the car has been incredibly reliable and still drives perfectly fine. I understand this may just be the way things go, but I wanted to see if anyone else has dealt with this situation and can confirm there's nothing else I can do but accept the $700.

I found another collision shop that was willing to fix the bent in trunk and put junkyard parts (bumper and rear lights) for $950 including all parts and labor.

So, am I missing anything here, or is my only decent option to suck it up and pay the $250 difference in what Nationwide is offering?

Also, if anyone is familiar with the process to repair a total loss vehicle (in PA specifically) I'd really appreciate it. I've been told I have to send my title in to Penndot, have them issue a salvage title (at which point I cannot drive the car anymore) then get the car fixed and send to a mechanic who will do an enhanced inspection and submit details to Penndot to get a reconstructed vehicle title. I'm wondering if I can file for the salvage title and then immediately get the enhanced inspection after I actually have the repair work completed?

Thanks in advance if anyone can help guide me through this or identify if I have any other options. Some people I've spoken to told me I should ask my insurance to fight Nationwide for more reimbursement, but when I called them they said there's nothing they can/will do since I already filed the claim with Nationwide. Some people also suggested sending nationwide a couple years of past work done to keep the vehicle up and running, not sure if that would help anything.",finance

personalfinance,I want to create a savings for my son but I also have school loans and have other money issues.,"I don't even know how to start this but I'm really stressing on what I need to do. Sorry in advance but my post is going to be all over the place and its LONG, lack of sleep and its 2am.

Here is some background, 
My son is 5 months old and was diagnosed with a rare liver disease called biliary atresia, long story short he had a procedure called kasai procedure to see if his body will return bile fliw but it looks like it didn't work so eventually he will need a liver transplant. Bills are still coming in from when i delivered him and his surgery which we still owe about 4k in all which is getting paid off slowly, although there is going to be more hospital bills trickling in. He also has medication we have to buy each month and he is on a specialty formula which insurance only covers if he has a nasogastric tube which he doesn't. Our insurance covers part of his antibiotics and covers fully of his Vitamin k.

Ursidol = $40, Antibiotics = $12, Infant multivitamin = $25, Vitamin k (haven't gotten a refill yet) = $0 when i first picked it up, Vitamin D drops = $12 every 5-6 months
And lastly his specialty formula costs $172 for 6, 16 oz cans which only last us about a month since he is on 26 calories diet because he isn't gaining any weight. Im still able to breastfeed about 2-4 times a day but his nutritionist only allows me to breastfeed him 2 times a day which is hard sometimes since he refuses bottles with me randomly. 

I went back to work part time as a waitress and make roughly 210-420 in tips for the 3 days I work, and sometimes its less or more hard to calculate. Monthly I get a paycheck of about 300 bucks? My husband makes 400-800 dollars a week as a mechanic for Firestone, hard to calculate his due to his shop getting work or not. We bought our house in Dec. Of 2016 and mortgage is around $1600 at a 4.75% interest rate, we bought our home for 288k, not sure how much we owe now but hubby wants to try to refinance this year. Here's roughly some of our monthly payments. 
Utilities = $ ~300, Internet = $70, Netflix = $10, Phone = $130, Credit card = $100 (not sure how much my husband pays towards his CC bill) and lastly $40-50 to furniture warehouse. 

And we also have 1k each in credit card debt, plus ~$500 we owe to furniture warehouse.  

I really fucked up when I was younger and studied for something I had no interest for so I owe $~27k in loans don't remember my interest rates for the unsubsidized and subsidized loans. $3-4k to my vet tech school and $2k to Salliemae. Luckily hubby has no school loans but has tool bills which he pays $100 to each week. 

I put away $20 for my little one every time I get tips, and $40 if it's a good night, and I randomly stash away other $20s here and there so I don't spend it all. Little one's box is filling up and I want to do something with that money but I have no clue where to start even after looking through threads.

No matter how much we pay it seems like we are getting no where, hubs is bad at saving money with no savings account, and I have about $500 in mine. We do have about $3-4k for my son from his one month birthday we've been using to slowly pay off medical bills as well.

All in all, I need help in reducing my loans and what to do with the money I saved up for little one (very hard thing to say... but I need something that may help if little one were to pass away from his disease) ? 

Thank you for taking the time in reading! Sorry if this is all confusing, if you need clarification just let me know.",finance

Even more challenging is that almost every fund is less than 10 years old except for the big banks ones. Almost every index fund is also based on 30-50 companies instead of 500 like the s&amp;p. Since there is less local companies to invest it's probably easier to differ the good ones from the bad ones which gives mutual funds an advantage over index ones.

personalfinance,"Claimed 0 allowances for 2017, still owe ~$900","Hi all, I have been struggling with why I owe a significant portion of my income for taxes in 2017.
To start, I claimed 0 allowances on my w-4 for 2017. I get bi-weeklu pay stubs that show my check amount as well as my withholdings for things such as FICA-Med, Social Sevurity, federal withholdings, etc.
I got my w-2 this January and low and behold, my federal withholdings were so low and social security withholdings were very high. I don't know if I should give out numbers, but I will for sake of clarity.
I made ~18k this year, (5k more than last year) and had federal withholdings at ~$300 and social security at ~$1100. What happened there? I will owe close to $900 this year instead of getting a refund.
Last year (2016), I got a tax refund. I made changes to my withholdings after filling taxes in 2017 to withhold more (or not apparently), but before that I had claimed one allowance. I had ~$1200 federal withheld and ~$760 social security withheld.
I don't understand how or why that little of federal taxes was withheld and why social security is so much more?

I am a dependent of my parents yet, but this year I will graduate from school and be on my own which would mean that my parents shouldn't claim me starting in 2018 right?

personalfinance,Chapter 13,"I've seen a lot of people talk about debt and come to this sub asking for advice.  For what it's worth, I thought I'd share my story just in case it helps anybody.  
  
I'm happy to go in to more detail if anybody cares.
  
**Financial Problems**
  
Like a lot of people, I was laid off in 2008 during the height of the housing market collapse.  Things got very tight, very fast, and my wife and I quickly found ourselves facing a crisis in our household budget.  We made as many emergency expense cuts as possible, but that wasn't enough.  
  
Rather than ask to borrow money from family, we decided the lesser of our bad option was to borrow from ourselves.  We prioritized our financial obligations and continued to pay all of our debts on time.  We used credit cards to supplement our monthly cash shortfall - mostly on groceries, heating, fuel and the other unavoidable expenses.  
  
**Bankruptcy**
  
Within about 90 days I still hadn't found work, and the minimum monthly payment on our revolving credit was soon to be more than we could afford.  The wheels were going to come off and insolvency was imminent.  
  
With our last few thousand dollars, we hired a bankruptcy attorney and filed chapter 13.  We re-affirmed our student loans, mortgage and car payments.  Everything else, as unsecured debt, was defaulted in the filing.
  
Because we bought our home with an 80/20 split to avoid PMI (which you could do back then), 20% of our monthly mortgage obligation was technically a home equity line.  A market appraisal of our home value demonstrated insufficient value in the asset to secure both the primary mortgage and the HELOC.  Because the primary is in the first lien position, we successfully petitioned the court to consider the HELOC to be unsecured debt.  That was included in the default.  
  
**During Bankruptcy**
  
We were put on a plan whereby we had to pay a fixed amount to the court appointed chapter 13 trustee who represented our jilted creditors.  The terms of the plan were 60 months of monthly payments.  
  
3 years in to plan, the trustee agreed to allow us to pay the remaining two years as a balloon payment and emerge from bankruptcy 2 years earlier than plan.  
  
**Post Bankruptcy**
    
After discharge, I applied for and opened a secured credit card with a $300 limit.  I used that at about 25% utilization for 10 months or so, and then was able to get approved for a $3,000 line with a high interest rate through Capital One.  I used that at the same utilization rate for another year.  Then I was able to get a modest car loan and replace my ten year old car.
  
**Present**

This month marks 7 years since we filed Chapter 13.  I have confirmed that transunion, equifax and experian have all removed the filing from our credit reports now.  My wife's FICO is around 800 and mine is around 780.  
  
We're putting our home on the market in the next few months and intend to apply for a mortgage.  
  
Anyway, I just thought maybe someone would want to hear a story about how it's possible to come out the other side of things like this.  I made mistakes, got myself in deep shit, and then eventually got back out again by following a careful roadmap and with a lot of luck.  AMA",finance
personalfinance,"New job, old dilemma. Allowances and exemptions","Morning all. Sorry in advance for my formatting, I am on mobile.

Started a new job and had to complete the W4. According to the instructions, since I am technically single, I have two allowances. I believe the same applied to state taxes.

I work in DC but live in MD. Just received first paystub and it says I have 2 exemptions for Federal, 2 for MD and 2 for DC.
After a quick look at my paystub from previous employer, I had only 1 exemption for Federal,and none for state.

What in the world is the correct approach here?

Thanks in advance",finance
personalfinance,Selling state/fed tax free Muni bonds to max out 2017 IRA contribution?,"Hey everyone.

I have a vanguard funds account that currently holds PA Muni bonds. I live in PA, so all I earn on them is 100% tax free at both state and federal levels.

I recently opened a Roth IRA to hold REITs because I can't stand the late filing of paperwork every year that they create otherwise.

I am provided a 401k by my employer which I am fully contributing to. So I know this limits the impact of having the Roth IRA on my taxes.

So, in this case, other than shifting allocations from the Muni funds to REITs, does selling off some Muni bonds to max out my 2017 IRA contribution help me with my tax situation?",finance
worldpolitics,"Fed Warns Inflation Has Arrived: Philadelphia, New York Fed Prices Paid Soar | Zero Hedge",,finance
personalfinance,Have income tax brackets officially changed yet? Not seeing any changes in my pay stub (U.S.),"For context, I am your basic single filer with no dependents making $70K/year. I need to check my W-4 since it's been a while, but I'm either claiming 0 or 1 personal exemptions and typically get a federal refund of a few hundred dollars every year.

I'm currently being taxed at 25% federal income tax on my returns and haven't seen a change in my paycheck from today. Is the new tax plan/brackets in effect and is this something my company just hasn't updated yet? Or are the reduced tax brackets something that not every person gets (i.e. could my rate still be higher if I am claiming 0 exemptions)?",finance
personalfinance,Auto Loan - Avg rates; best to finance through dealership or other bank/credit union?,"tl;dr Are auto loan interest rates pretty uniform, like mortgage rates, or will dealerships give lower interest rates as an incentive to close the deal?

Long form: In the opening stages of buying a car.  Trying to use pf best practices/rules of thumb for the purchase, i.e., down payment (plus trade in) of &gt;20%; &lt;10% net monthly income on car payment; loan no longer than 48 months.  When all's said and done, we'll be taking out an auto loan of $10,000.  Brief online research estimates 3-4% APR for a car loan.  Will the finance arm of a dealership be able to get me a better rate than I'm finding online?  We're budgeted for $200/month for a car payment and could stretch it to $225, but I'd rather avoid it.  (I know we're looking at like a $400 difference over four years between a couple percentage points, but still.)

personalfinance,Increased my 401k contribution and paycheck went up?,"Hey guys, quick question.  Probably not a huge deal but I thought I'd ask.  

I recently increased my 401k contribution by 1% and actually saw an increase in my paycheck.  I'm only putting another $30 per pay into it now, but my federal taxes went down by about $70, so now I'm seeing another $40 in my paycheck per pay.  Everything else stayed the same. 

What is happening here, did it push me into a lower tax bracket or something? I went from 12.05% of my taxable wages to 9.64%.  I'm mainly worried about my withholdings because I don't want to have to write another check to the IRS next year.",finance
personalfinance,Using the house to pay off student loans?,"My husband and I are toying with the idea of selling our house at a strategic time and using the difference to pay off his student loans. Tons of detail and financial info below, and happy to provide additional details as necessary.

So, we bought the house for $140K in 2015, original loan of $138K, payoff at the moment is right at $130K. The house across the street just got posted for $220K, though it’s ~100 sq ft bigger (1478 vs ours is 1380) and just got some cosmetic updates (exterior/interior paint, kitchen cabs and appliances, minor landscaping). There’s another in the neighborhood posted for $200K (1246 sq ft), but same sort of cosmetic updates. Zillow has ours valued at $189K and a generic 1 year later prediction of $202K, but depending on where these actually sell, I’m wondering if that’s low. They also give a rent estimate of $1450/month (compare at our monthly mortgage payment of ~$1100).

The other factor here is my husband’s student loans. Total amount is ~$67K, but rising steadily due to some outrageous interest rates (varying from 4.5 to 12.875% - but 85% of the total amount is at an interest rate of 9.25 or higher). Monthly payments for everything once they all kick back in, which they’re doing over the course of this year, is ~$900. Expected payoff given minimum payments is between 2024 and 2030. I know the strategy here is to pay off the highest interest ones the quickest, but given the minimum is so high, it’s going to be a challenge to even do that, especially if I continue to cut my work hours over the next few years by jumping into a PhD program starting in the fall.

So, back to my original question. What if we used the house to pay off this debt? Or as much of it as possible…. Taking out ~$3-5K in cosmetic updates that we’d want to put into it, possibly the $5K given to us by my father for the deposit, and the ~15% in profit taxes (we're in the state of FL in the US)… would it be enough to back to us to turn around and wipe out most of the loan debt? Would it make more sense to rent it out and pull in monthly profit and use that to help pay off the loans slowly over time? Or is it better to make minimum payments in the meantime and see where the house’s value is a year from now? Or send him back to school, defer the loans, pay the tuition out of pocket, and make payments on the continually rising interest in the meantime?

Let me know what other info I can provide. Very grateful for any help or guidance.",finance

personalfinance,"What happens to a CD when you take out a secured loan on it, specifically an auto loan.","Basically, I want to buy a vehicle before summer. I've had a 2005 Kia Optima LX in which I bought off Craigslist for a bit under $3000 after High School. The car has been running like a champion for 3 and a half years now despite my initial concerns of everyone shitting on Kias as bad cars. The A.C. system developed quite a big leak though, Last beginning summer I decided to recharge it, and it would be good for at least a week, but a couple of months later...only a few hours. So it's not an ideal car for summer driving and tbh not worth the cost in fixing considering the age and mileage of the car, going to pass it on to a younger sibling. Also, I'm sick of driving it when I can afford much better now.

I have been putting some research into the method of buying vehicles and also doing my best to increase my Fico Score, which I have at over 700 now at all 3 bueros, except the auto loan FICO, which is sitting at the orange colored fair, and barely above 600. I have a bit over 15k split between various credit &amp; store cards, all paid off. 8k in student loans that are deferred until the April, I could pay them all off at once, but from my research that would be a big mistake. Only 1 of the loans is unsubsidized, which I just made a payment on anyways because the auto fico simulator shows that paying off a certain amount of these loans would increase my score by a nice amount. Never missed a payment on anything, problem is that I only have a 1 year average on credit accounts. 

At first I thought an unsecured finance would work out well, but I'm not willing to pay those interest rates with my current auto fico. Then I thought about just buying the vehicle outright, but this does nothing for my credit score, but give me some collateral. So now I'm at this point where I decided that a secured loan would be best. I get a much better interest rate and the auto loan does a good job for my credit score. 

So let's say I put 50k into a CD, and use that as collateral for a secured loan. Am I correct in assuming that the CD would still mature while the auto loan is going on? Also, what happens to the CD? Do I lose all control over it until loan is paid off? Also, does their exist other methods of collateral? Like a Money Market Account and a savings account?",finance

I am still in school and will accumulate another $4,000 in loans before I am done.  My car loan is the only scheduled payment I make.  I have not communicated with the collections agency on that debt, and I make random payments in varying amounts on my hospital bills and student loans when I am able to.

I feel like I'm at a point where maybe paying my car off first makes sense, and then apply that payment to my student loans.  I also would be okay paying my collections bill in full with my savings, but not sure if that makes sense either.

personalfinance,Housing market now vs in 2 years,"Hi I'm curious if there is really any way to gauge how the housing market will change in the next few years.

Expected home price is 175-215k, credit is ~760 with no current or expected debt. The hope is not to have a PMI and a comfortable mortgage payment. I'm just concerned that waiting to have the larger down payment might be a total wash if mortgage rates increase say 2% during this time.

personalfinance,Cashing bonds for downpayment on house (USA),"Hey everyone,

I'm looking to buy a two family home, live in one unit and rent the other. My price limit is about $450k, and considering the area I'm buying in (North Shore of Boston), it'll almost definitely need some work done for the price.

I'm planning on getting a loan through the first-time homebuyer program, putting around 5% down. I have the cash on hand for the downpayment and any closing costs, plus an additional $12k in emergency savings. I want to have some additional cash on hand for repairs and other unexpected costs without dipping into my savings.

I've got some savings bonds that are worth ~$25k in total. They've reached original maturity, and although they have more time to mature, the interest rates are low. I don't have the numbers right in front of me, but somewhere between 1.5% to 2.3%, maybe lower.

It seems like a good use of the bonds to cash them in and put towards a house. I plan on hanging onto this house and renting out both units if I ever have to move. I have the impressive that I could get a much better ROI with a rental property than letting those bonds mature further.

In terms of my financial situation: I make $80k a year, have enough to cover the mortgage payment and my expenses, and still have up to $1000 to put towards the house/unexpected expenses. In total I've got about $30k in savings, plus the $25k in bonds.

I'd appreciate any insight someone more experience could give me. Let me know if you need any more details.

gaming,MW2 Remastered? Controversial Problems With The Game!,"First, let me begin this post by saying that I’m neither for or against any title release from Activision or its content creating partners (Infinity Ward, Treyarch, Sledgehammer Games, or Raven Software). 
	I have been a gamer for around 11 years. I’ve played on pc and console; both have their pros and cons. My biggest concern, as of late; has been the constant reminder that, regardless of how good I play the game, there is always someone out there better. I can appreciate that. What I can’t appreciate, is the cheats, hacks, glitches, mods, and the occasional people who take it upon themselves to reset the ranks of others. The last one infuriates me. 
I have been reset 3 times in MW2 (twice by a random individual &amp; once on purpose to unlock my classes so that I could play again) and once in MW3 because I was playing conservatively. I didn’t realize that playing so well had consequences. 
I am typing out this post in, order to try and take back what little control I have over the games that I love. So, with that in mind, let’s get this show started.
MW2 Remastered! Now that sounds awesome, right? I thought so as well until I started doing a bit of research towards how this game might be ruined a second time around. Here are 10 things that my research has found:
One: Some individuals think that nerfing the RPG, M203 Grenade launchers, Claymores, and other explosive devices could MAKE the game better. These are the same individuals that you would find in FFA’s with their friends boosting for titles, emblems, and nukes. Also, these individuals have never experienced a true concussion from one or any of these devices in real life; I have. Sorry, but an RPG will NOT get a hit marker on you when shot at the feet. 
Two: Danger Close. This perk allowed for the explosive devices to be more powerful so that you would not get a hit marker at close range with an RPG. Some individuals want to take this out of the game. 
Three: OMA (One Man Army): I agree when someone says that this needs to be nerfed or taken out of the game. In my opinion, if someone has an M203 Grenade launcher attached to their primary weapon; they SHOULD NOT be allowed to use OMA. 
Four: Nerfing scavenger to the point that Claymores and M203 rounds can’t be picked up as a replaceable item in the inventory? Tell me; what’s the point of using scavenger if you can’t pick up and replace all items in your inventory? 
Five: You guys are going to like this one. Someone once told me that they should have it to where sitrep is not able to detect tactical insertions! If I’m lying, I’m dying! Or better yet; taking tactical insertions out of FFA’s. Apparently, these people have never experienced the thrill of hunting boosters on a Double XP weekend. 
Six: Quick Scoping. Now this seems to be a very touchy topic when confronting individuals still playing MW2 on Xbox 360. Most of them believe that they are gods in the COD community. Reality is, they quit when you hit them with an embarrassing last kill and put them in the cam of shame for all to see at the end of the match. Quitting a match seems to be an ongoing theme for these individuals. They quit on MW3 as well. Someone needs to remind these children that if you leave; it counts as a loss, your stats are still affected with the kills/deaths you accumulated, and pointless. 
Seven: DLC (Downloadable Content). If/when they remaster MW2, they need to incorporate all DLC into the base game. Give people the content they paid for without making them pay for it again. Give us the option of looking for a match with/without it like they did for MW3. 
Eight: Better match balancing for team-based game types. Match players with their own skill levels better than in the original. I still find this a problem in MW3. Just because I hit 30+ kills in one game, doesn’t mean that I’ll do that in every game. More often that not, I’ll end up on the worst team in the lobby and have to carry them to the end. 
Nine: Kill streaks. Leave them alone. The kill streaks in MW2 were perfect. If anything, add the kill streaks from MW3 into the base game of MW2 as a separate tier to choose from. 
Ten: 3rd person FFA was the most horrible game type that could have been added to the base game. Leave it out this time. Replace it with Kill Confirmed or some other fun game mode. 
I hope that this has been helpful to some individuals. More or less, a better understanding of how the game should have been made to begin with. I know that the haters are going to hate, and that’s ok. I’m not looking for friends, I’m just putting my 2 cents in while I can.",technology

personalfinance,Receiving public assistance,"So, this a bit of an odd situation.  My son posted something online that everyone except the DA felt was innocuous teenage rambling.

We ended up in court, and my son was assigned an insane amount of therapy and counseling, as well as community service.

So, here's where I get to the point.

My wife and I both work.  We have pretty good health coverage.  BUT, we were required to basically sign my son up for both state and federal assistance in order to get Medicaid and whatever the state level health coverage is.  Medicaid  insurance was provided by United Healthcare, and when I called the court, they said to just ignore it and leave it alone.  The public assistance is being used to pay for all the court mandated therapy, counseling and mentoring that my son has to do.

Of course now it's tax time and I am getting 1095 forms for my taxes.

What kind of tax implications does this mess have on my federal taxes?  I expressed my concern to the courts that we don't qualify for public assistance and already have insurance and they were quite adamant that we should ""leave it alone.""

EDIT: On a side note, every last therapist/counselor/mentor has said that they do not understand what they're doing here, but their company has an agreement with the court for a minimum number of hours of work for any court assigned case.  Even the police repeatedly made comments about it being an ""election year"" and having real criminals to catch.  Sigh...",finance

personalfinance,Lump sum pay off of 39k student loan debt or keep paying monthly?,"First off, I'm fortunate to have this situation, and I know the answer is subjective but I'm looking for a diversity of opinions. I'm 30 years old and have private student loan debt of about 39k at a variable 3.81% interest rate, I currently pay $1000 per month toward this debt. I have 57k in savings, and I'm also able to save about $1500 each month. 

I am debating paying off the balance of the loans because after 5 years and 70k paid I have a bit of ""debt fatigue"". The variables that make me cautious of doing this are that I plan on getting engaged, married, and buying a house in the next two years or so. Engagement and wedding I anticipate needing 30k (don't tell me this is absurd and that I can get her a ring pop and get married in a courthouse, this isn't r/frugal, it's what I anticipate and am OK spending for this), and then another 40k for a down payment (S.O. would match this as well to hopefully put 20% down on a house, and it would be in a high COL area), and then 15k for emergency fund. This puts me at ""needing"" 85k in the next ~24 months.

If I pay the loans off I'll have about 18k remaining, but could then save about $2500 per month. This would mean I could get close to that 85k needed after 2 years, but I'd be stretched more thin paying for events as I go along, whereas if I just keep paying my monthly $1000 payment I'd have more of a cushion. I think what I'm struggling with is cutting a check for that large of an amount and being down to a little more than an emergency fund. Again, I don't think there's a right or wrong answer, but I just want some different perspectives.

I don't want to invest this savings because I have a short horizon for it's use.

personalfinance,Do I actually have to pay student loans? [US],"Hi all,

After undergrad, master's, working for a while and letting interest build (oops), and now getting my JD, I have accrued a little over $100k in student loans. Obviously this number is quite daunting. I am currently on an income based repayment plan (I believe REPAYE) of which I have never had to pay any amount (due to never making enough money to have to pay in the first place). It is serviced through FedLoan Servicing.

Now here's my question. I am focusing on an international aspect of law and fully intend to move overseas and work there (done it before, just really want to go back). If I take all my money out of my American accounts and put them in foreign accounts, am paid by a foreign company or government, and live in a foreign land (credit scores don't really matter from my previous experience over there), is there anything my servicer can do if I just decide to not pay them back? Will it actually negatively affect me?

I feel like I have to be overlooking something because it seems too simple

Edit: thanks for the responses. From what I'm gathering I would need a well established career, citizenship elsewhere, and probably have already gotten my assets up over there BEFORE I could consider not paying.

I am looking to refinance private loans again after 40 point bump in credit and by added my cosigner back on. Waiting for rate quote but I could be looking at sub 4% apr after refinance. My question is at what apr should I stop looking to quickly kill my student loan debt and instead increase TSP contribution? 

TSP is super low expense  and C and S funds where most my allocations are has 10 years return of 9-10%. student interest is also tax deducible so that is about 600 dollars annually in savings if I prolong loans for retirement savings. I am 23 in a safe gov job with marketable skills and increasing level of education so I am willing to accept large levels of risk.  

In my mind, anything under 4.5 apr I will switch to minimum payments and place difference into TSP.  Is this reasonable decision?

Bills are also calculated as being every 4-weeks for simplicities sake. Since I am paid weekly, every 3 months I have a ""bonus"" week where I have paid all of my bills and can use the income to bulk up savings, etc. 

**Rent:** $1480/mo

**Utilities:** $100/mo

**Groceries:** $350/mo

**Self-care (hair-cuts, gym, medication, etc.):** $200/mo

**True cost funds (electronics replacement, clothes, travel):** $480/mo

**Social life:** $200/mo

**Total:** $2810

**Remainder:** $2608/mo

Other financial data:

**Federal subsidized student loans:** $9200 (deferred while in school) 

**Emergency fund:** $7500

**Cost of a dog walker 4 days/week:** $424/mo

Most dog walkers in our area (at least the good ones) require that you commit to 4 days/week. These are good walks to off-leash parks where the dogs play and are out of the house for about 2 hours. 

I paid off all of my credit card debt at the end of 2017, so I have been aggressively saving to achieve a fully-funded emergency fund (~$15k), and then I will use the money to pay off student loans and bankroll tuition in the future. 

Budget-wise, I know that the money is there. I guess I'm just struggling with justifying the cost. I cut my expenses down last year while aggressively paying off debt, so it feels excessive. I CAN take him to the park by myself, it's just hard. I can't guarantee that a dog walker will help ease my work/school load, but if it does, I think it might be worth it.",finance

personalfinance,"Live in Illinois, work in Iowa, have a tax question","So I have been using Turbotax to file my federal and state taxes for a long time, but I recently moved. I now live in Illinois and work in Iowa. I understand that Illinois and Iowa have a reciprocal agreement so that if you make money in one state but work in another, you only pay income taxes from the state that you live in. However, when I was preparing my taxes, Turbotax prompted me to file a nonresident Iowa return since I made money there, which I then inputted the information for. It then told me I owed $12k to Iowa at the end, because zero money was withheld for Iowa for the year (all state taxes were withheld only for Illinois). I knew this to be incorrect because of the reciprocal agreement, so I ended up paying for TurbotaxOnline final product so I could visually see what they were inputting on the state file forms. It requires you to pay for the product before you can actually look at the physical tax forms. After I paid for it, I could no longer delete the Iowa nonresident forms, even after multiple calls to Turbotax. Apparently they do not have the power to delete forms after the product has been paid for. I can delete the info from the Iowa state return, just not the actual return itself. They told me to file the federal and Illinois returns electronically, and choose to file Iowa by mail, then to never mail the Iowa form in. 

Long story short, does this sound right to you guys? Since I can no longer delete the nonresident Iowa tax return, just choose to file by mail but then never actually print/file it?",finance

investing,Bonds vs Bond ETFs in Rising Interest Rate Environment,"In an environment when interest rates are forecasted to rise, is there any reason to invest in a bond ETF as opposed to a traditional government bond?

My understanding is that the value of the bond may change during its life, but upon maturity, the principal and interest are both paid in full (ie principal + interest, guaranteed for AAA bonds). One's ""loss"" may be understood as the difference in the bond's face value upon purchase and a potential increase in yield for that same bond during its life as a result of rising interest rates.

In bond ETFs, I understand that the value is inversely proportional to interest rate increases, or perceived sentiment on interest rate increases. Unlike actual bonds, there is no guarantee of one's principal being repaid in full should rates rise and ETF price drop.

If the above statements are correct, why then would anybody wanting fixed income opt for a bond ETF? While less volatile than equity ETFs, all seem to be on a downward price trend for the last 2 years or so.",finance

So, if my math is correct, say I have $10k in the account. Will I be earning 1.49% of my balance every month? (Respective to whatever the actual interest amount is for any given month.)

If that IS the case, would it be a smart move to have, say $14k in the account, then placing $4k as a down payment on a car, leaving me with that $10k to earn interest.

personalfinance,"Is this fraud, or am I stupid? - Mortgage COR fishy numbers","Short story leading up to this situation: I have been looking to perform a cash out refinance in order to pay off high interest debt and student loans in an effort to give myself a cleaner plate towards FI. To this end, I contacted my current lender to inquire about the refinance. Things seemed to progress smoothly as the required documents were collected and sent in. However, I keep getting sent revision and re-disclosure requests with some odd math that show the payouts increasing (no itemization), and the cash to borrower decreasing by a commensurate amount.

Example using faux numbers:    
Initial Disclosure    
- EST Prop. Value: $300,000    
- Loan Amount: $200,000 @ 5%    
- Total Closing Costs: $15,000    
- **Total Payoffs and Payments: $100,000** (current loan balance)    
- **Cash to close: $85,000**    

2nd Disclosure    
- EST Prop. Value: $300,000    
- Loan Amount: $200,000 @ 5%    
- Total Closing Costs: $15,000    
- **Total Payoffs and Payments: $150,000 (???)**    
- **Cash to close: $35,000**    

3rd Disclosure    
 - EST Prop. Value: $300,000    
 - Loan Amount: $200,000 @ 5%    
 - Total Closing Costs: $15,000    
 - **Total Payoffs and Payments: $165,000 (???)**    
 - **Cash to close: $20,000**    
    

The only line that changes is the total payoffs and payments line, and as a result the cash to close value. No explanation is given for the increase. No extra points added, no interest rate change, no increase in closing costs. These documents have been sent over the course of two months.    

I have contacted the lender regarding this issue and requested itemization of the total payoffs and payments, but have not heard back. Should I seek a different lender? As far as I am aware, at this stage there are no penalties for ending negotiations since no final agreement has been made. The situation seems very fishy to me.    

I don't post often, but in this situation I could use some opinions from  the outside. Thanks!",finance

I am torn between what I should do with this extra income. 

Income: 75k
Retirement Contributions: 8% with company matching 4% (18k within retirement account)
Checking Account: 10k
Outside Investments: Vanguard fund with 12k in it and contributing $150 every paycheck. 22% return

I am currently renting (820 a month) but am trying to decide if I should contribute more money to a vanguard account for a short term goal (house), pay off student loans, or contribute more for retirement. I will also most likely need a new car soon as my current car has 200k miles on it. I plan on running it until it dies but will likely buy a new one if a big repair comes up. This also leaves me torn between the % down and the car I can afford /should buy.

Vanguard - 300
Gym - 55
Groceries - 200 (chicken and rice)

Weekend activities -400 - budget 100 a weekend because working hard isn't fun when you arent looking forward to something
Misc - (Cloths/gifts/dinners) - 100 

Student loans:
3 tokens left worth 14k
3.3k at 6.6%
5.7k at 3.6%
5.5k at 4.4%


I realize these interest rates aren't the biggest but I hate having the cloud of debt over my head. Currently contributing all extra payments to the 6.6%. Once the 6.6% is gone I will most likely cut back on contributions and put that money towards a higher return fund. 

I don't have a lot of knowledge of investing (basically have gone off of this page) and just use vanguard. I am looking into a FA but am still not sure how to go about that process.

personalfinance,High-Yield Checking (2.53% APY). Is it legit?,"An east coast bank (with one of their few locations extremely close to me), [Kearny Bank](https://promo.kearnybank.com/high-yield-checking/?utm_source=homepagepromo) is offering a ""high-yield"" checking account with no monthly maintenance fees, $1 minimum balance required, etc, on balances up to $25,000. The fine print is as follows:
""The APY (Annual Percentage Yield) is accurate as of 1/30/18 and is subject to change without notice. Minimum to open account is $50. Rate tiers are as follows when terms are met each statement cycle: 2.53% APY applies to balances of $0.01 - $25,000 and 0.25% APY applies to balances over $25,000. If terms are not met, 0.05% APY applies to entire balance.""

This sounds too good to be true. If I maintained $25k in it, I would get over $600 in interest a year. My guess is that it's just some ploy to get a bunch of new customers and then they will drop the interest rate to something normal. Their terms say that the interest rate can change at any time. Is that likely to happen?
Is there any reason _not_ to do this?

Also, I'm thinking of leaving my current bank because my interest rates are complete garbage (0.03% or something, basically pennies per year). Can I just ditch my savings account and keep all my money in this high-yield checking?

personalfinance,Parents Plus Loan SSDI discharge: Tax liability?,"Background: 
Both parents are about 60, on Medicare and disability, and combined I think their SSDI is about $2.5 to 3K per month, plus mom works a small part time job bringing in about $12K/year. This is allowed without affecting her SSDI benefit level. They have no other savings, dad lost job 5 years ago, never recovered, burned through all retirement, they went through bankruptcy in 2016. BK cleared all consumer debt, but they reaffirmed a HELOC and mortgage to keep the house, believe it will be at least 20 years to pay off on current plan. They had about $70K in Parents Plus left after the BK. I'm sure they have some credit card debt now too because in our f-ed up society banks are fine giving out credit cards to people right after a BK. 

They also both went on SSDI in 2016, receiving a large lump sum for back payments retroactive to the start of their disabilities. All that money is gone, house needed a new roof and honestly I'm not sure where else it went - but I know it wasn't saved. Basically their budget is slightly out of balance and they are running a deficit that can't be sustained. They owe their dentist, an HVAC guy, and now me for emergency car repairs that I'm covering because they have no E-fund. (I'm only going to force them to pay me back so that I can hold the money in my own savings for the next time they have an emergency, if they won't be responsible, I'll do it for them)

Question:
After they were fully enrolled in disability, the Parents Plus student loans were able to go through loan forgiveness and they were approved. The loans were discharged in 2017, no taxes seem to be due for that year, but my father is worried that the forgiven amount becomes taxable income after a 2 or 3 year period. I cannot find any conclusive information on how this works for people on SSDI that are permanently disabled. Basically, they can't afford the tax bill if they get hit with $70K of income next year. Does anyone know where I can find solid evidence of whether or not taxes will be due on this? Their money situation has been dragging me down for the last 5 years as I've been called upon to fork over cash to cover their mistakes and they are so stubborn I can't seem to knock any sense into them that they are still in crisis mode. Dad made about $120K/year in banking before the layoff and they've never understood that going from that to basically $48K/year and no savings means lifestyle needs to adjust. Like I can't even get them to cancel cable, but they complain when the bill goes up!?! At my wits end and just want to know if I'm looking at covering a multi-thousand dollar tax bill in the near future.",finance

personalfinance,"100k in student debt, not working in field of study and I’m in dead end recruiting job now. I don’t know how to move forward.","**I just posted about being upset over financial situation, and now my friend’s girlfriend who doesn’t have a Reddit account wants advice regarding her position. So this is her post.**

I studied economics in college and while I got great scholarships I was foolish and took out loans to cover remaining tuition + ALL living expenses in the city. I racked up a bill of 110k (mix federal and private) loans. After college, job offers in my field were low and I knew I had a lot of debt. I was not patient enough to move up in the world of economics and I took an on online recruiting job that paid 55k + bonus off the bat (Econ offers stared at 40k). This was when I was 22/23. I’m now 26 and couldn’t regret it more.

I’m in a dead-end recruiting job. The pay is good but not relevant to my degree and certainly not the debt- I don’t even need a degree to get this job. I apply for jobs in my field and I get denied due to lack of experience (should’ve done entry level work when I had the chance) and I’m sure the fact that I never once had an office job in any industry doesn’t help. Now, entry level positions are being filled by college grads and I’m not competitive anymore, despite going to a great school and having a high GPA. 

**Expenses**
Monthly minimum student loan payments: $1,500
Rent: $800
Car: 200 + 150 for insurance. (It’s a lease, I can’t get rid of it, u know it was a mistake).
Gas: 50
Phone/utilities/WiFi: 250
Health insurance: 300
Household supplies: 100
Groceries: 300
This does not include other expenses, like medical copays, etc. 

**Net take home:** 4ishk. I put about 100/150 in savings every month. 

**Loans:**
Federal: 30k, 5% interest
Private: 80k, 10-12% interest. I keep getting denied for refinancing, despite having good credit. 

I have been actively job searching for 2 years now and can’t find something out of recruiting/HR that would use my degree (and have higher earning potential). I always get interviews but when they were I’ve never had an in person job, I can tell they’re turned off. 

Is it worth it to try to find something in my field or should i just stay in recruiting forever? I am applying to law school (on big scholarship, hopefully) to almost reset / redo my post grad years. I’m currently looking for paralegal work. Do you have any other options/suggestions? It KILLS me that I’m in insane debt and not even benefiting from it.",finance
personalfinance,Starting new job with $60k signing bonus. Is this a good plan for it?,"I'm starting a new job in Seattle next month that includes a $60k signing bonus. The bonus is split over two years $35k the first year, $25k the second. After some research, it seems that a signing bonus is considered supplemental income and will be taxed at a flat federal rate of 25%. I can't find any info about Washington taxing it, but seeing as there is no state income tax I'm assuming they don't tax supplemental income. So with that, I will be getting a check for ~~$26,250~~ $23,572.5 (as /u/Default87 pointed out, I forgot medicare and SS).

Right now my financial situation is as follows:

With my new job, I will be making a base salary of $140k a year, and will receive around $40k a year in equity. My plan is to just live on the 140k and when I receive the equity sell it immediately and invest in a low fee index fund. I will be maxing out my 401k, and IRA each year. I also have a fully paid off car that is still in good shape.

I have a very detailed budget for the new job. With that budget, I will have an extra $1,300 left over a month for savings/debt payment.

I have $2,000 in a high APY savings account.

I have $25,199.88 in debt. The breakdown for that is as follows.

* Credit Card 1: $6,418.04 @ 0.00% until 06/15/18
* Credit Line: $4,310.01 @ 11.5%
* Student Loan 1: $3,345.76 @ 6.8%
* Student Loan 2: $11,126.07 @ 3.4%

My thought right now is to do as follows:

* Immediately pay off both credit cards: $10,728.05
* Pay off 6.8% student loan: $3,345.76
* Up E-Fund to 3 months expenses: $9,012.91
* Leftover: ~~$3,163.28~~ $485.78

I'm not really sure what to do with the leftover. I could put the rest into my E-Fund? Pay off more of the 3.4% student loan? My girlfriend and I want to get married in the next two years (I'm going to propose over Christmas when all of our family is around). We also want to buy a house at some point, but marriage/wedding should come first. I also would like to get a nicer car at some point. But I recognize that there isn't really any financial value in that. I guess we could also use it to have some fun. I was thinking about taking a vacation to visit family, but that feels iffy with the debt still there. I'm not really sure. What do you think?

Edit: Formatting, and more taxes.

Edit 2: Well, given that I forgot Medicare and SS, my leftover is a lot less than expected. That being said, is there something else I could do that would make more sense?",finance
personalfinance,Would it be crazy to refinance my auto loan to a higher interest rate to get with an institution i trust?,"My situation: 

My wife and I use USAA for banking, investments, credit cards, and insurance. We've been very satisfied with the service and help we've always gotten from them, and feel like we ""belong."" 

We do well for ourselves, both have excellent credit scores (780-ish), and our only debts are our home and this car, which we owe $26k on at 2.99%. The loan is with Wells Fargo Dealer Services, it's on auto pay, and we pay $450/month on it... 64 months still to go. 

I want to make additional payments on the principal balance, and don't think that i can through the website. I've tooled around a bit and it looks like i can only make future payments, not principal-only payments. I've tried calling Wells Fargo's posted phone numbers multiple times and have NEVER been able to get through to a representative to get help or have questions answered. 

This led me to looking into refinancing the loan with USAA for the ease of communication, the consolidation of finances, and honestly the fact that i trust them as an institution WAY more than Wells Fargo. Here's the thing though... USAA is only giving me APR options between 4.6%-5%, almost double what Wells Fargo is. 

Understanding that we want to be making additional payments of varying amounts geared towards cutting down that principal balance, would it make sense for us to make this transition? Or is it a big enough difference in money we are likely to pay in interest that we should stay the course with Wells Fargo and try and just make those early additional payments?

Maybe there's not a ""right"" answer, since the variable is what i am going to pay extra each month, but i would appreciate hearing what you guys and gals would do in my position.

thanks!

personalfinance,Sister in $15k of CC debt. Is it best to keep utilizing balance transfers to pay it down or some other method?,"So my sister finally confided with the family that she needs help with her debt, we've taken immediate steps to help her out short term but long term she will have $15k in CC debt (she actually had way more but parents are going to pay off student loans and took on some of her other debt) starting in March. 

We've laid out her budget and she can afford to pay ~$450 a month towards the debt: my question: would it be better for her to keep jumping from a 0% APR card balance transfer to 0% APR card balance transfer for the next 3-4 years as she pays it down? Or some other method? despite her massive debt, she has a decent credit score at 701.

Would her credit rating decline because of frequent balance transfers if her  revolving utilization is going down every month? Or would we be better served trying to get a loan at a lower interest rate to pay off? Her current CC interest rate is at 18.7%

investing,Dividends and taxes are not bad,"Lately on this sub I have been seeing the ridiculous notion that dividends are a ""waste"" and ""horrible"" for taxes, which simply isn't true. 

Let's start with taxes. 

2018 Capital gains taxes are as follows: 
Long-Term rates:
0% for up to 38,600 for single, 77,200 for married filing jointly
15% for 38,600-425,800 single, 77,200-479,000
20% over 425,800 single and 479,000 married
Short term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income rates, the tax bracket you fall under for your yearly income. I won't list each income range, but rates are 10-12-22-24-32-35-37%.

The key difference to keep in mind is what falls under long term rates and short-term rates as well. 

Long Term: qualified dividends, dividends from stocks held longer than one year. Holding a stock for greater than one year, then selling. Dividends from stock index funds and ETFs as well. 
Short Term: interest income, bond interest, REIT dividends, Peer-to-Peer, CDs, high-yield savings, selling stocks/mutual funds/ETFs shorter than a year. 

Majority of us have access to some type of 401K/403b/457 and a Roth IRA. That would give you 18,500 and 5,500 a year for tax-advantaged growth. Double that if you are married and max it out. After that point, you will have to put money in taxable accounts.

Keep in mind, there are risks and downsides with strictly putting ALL your money in tax-advantaged accounts that nobody seems to discuss. The tax code can change in 30 years, your tax rate is concentrated at one point of your life rather than a smooth average, less flexibility with your money, high fees and poor options offer by your job's 401k, you may never get to enjoy it (death or extreme illness). 

Having a taxable account with TAX-EFFICIENT investments is not a waste. Qualified dividends, individual stocks, and Municipal tax-free bonds are all great taxable investments. A rate of 15% is very fair and low compared to what people get paid as income to use their actual bodies and time. No FICA taxes either. Once you pay taxes, it's your money, and do not have to have the government telling you what to do. For every 1,000 you earn in dividends, you'd pay 150 dollars. Someone working as a laborer making 60,000 a year could pay as high as 15% in federal taxes. 

Dividends have accounted for as low as 25% to as high as 60% of the TOTAL RETURN of the S&amp;P 500, depending on which time frame you select to use. To all the religious ""time in the market, beats timing the market"" followers, this is the large reason why it matters, the compound effect of reinvesting dividends, not the price change of the index.

A dividend is real money given back to the owners, you the shareholders, as you see fit. It's not a waste. If you bought a pizza business, you would want to enjoy some of profits rather than continuing to invent different kind of pizza dough. If you rented a home, you'd want to enjoy some of that monthly rent, not keep painting and upgrading the rental. So why wouldn't you want the same from companies you own?

Not every company is Amazon, Facebook, and Netflix, where you have 50% year after year change in price. Many companies cap out on their rapid growth and mainly have to focus on a dividend growth strategy. The FANG stocks will at some point as well, only so many ways to reinvest their capital. Apple had so much cash and no other ways to rapidly grow, they had to give a dividend and buyback shares rather than keep hoarding from shareholders. 

91% of Warren Buffets stocks are dividend paying stocks. His top holdings are all dividend paying stocks as well.

TL;DR Taxes and dividends are not bad if you use a buy and hold strategy.",finance

Out of all of this, I paid only $100 in federal taxes and about $40 in GA state taxes.

When I input everything into credit karma tax, and have filled everything out to the best of my ability.. I supposedly only owe $368 federal and $75 state.

Theres no way this is correct, right? Is this not taking into account that I didn't pay a cent in SE taxes on the $5000? Do I need to look into more advanced options to file? I don't feel comfortable ""only"" owning ~$450 considering I have been planning on owing well over a grand.

personalfinance,"Question about Colorado state taxes -- does CO tax income from other states for nonresidents, or not?","After quite a long time of poring through numbers and researching Colorado state income tax, I am sort of confused and frustrated, so I would like some input on this.

In Colorado's FYI publications about Income Tax (Found [here](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/tax/fyi-publications-income-tax) on the Colorado Department of Revenue's website), in [Income 6, for Part-Year Residents and Nonresidents](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/Income6.pdf), under the section ""Colorado Source Income,"" it says:

&gt;Income earned by an individual while they are not a resident of Colorado will be taxed in Colorado only if it is
considered Colorado-source income and is included in their modified federal adjusted gross income.

Indeed, Colorado has a separate tax form, [Form 104PN](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/104PN.pdf), specifically for Colorado Part-Year Residents and Nonresidents to use so they can apportion Colorado and non-Colorado income for state tax purposes.

However, I noticed that my tentative Colorado state refund shrunk considerably after entering a W2 including income from a different state into my tax software. So I did some digging and found out that Colorado (sort of?) taxes non-Colorado income, despite its claims to the contrary. Consider the following scenario, very closely related to mine:

Samantha is from Texas, but she spent 3 months in Colorado for temporary work. Therefore, even though she lived and worked in Colorado for part of the year, she never moved to Colorado with the intention of making it her home, and is considered to be a Nonresident of Colorado. She also worked in Texas during the other 9 months of the year.

**A = Income from the W2 Samantha received from Job A, in Colorado**  
**B = Income from the W2 Samantha received from Job B, in Texas**  
**C =** Total income from line 1 of federal tax form 1040EZ = **A + B**  
Assuming the standard deduction:  
**C2 =** Taxable income from line 6 of federal tax form 1040EZ (i.e. after deductions) = **C - 10,400 = A + B - 10,400**

According to Colorado's [Form 104PN](https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/104PN.pdf), this is a somewhat simplified version of how Samantha's Colorado income tax is calculated:

&gt; - Take all income from form 1040EZ Line 1: **C**

&gt; - Take all income from **C** that was earned in Colorado: **A**

&gt; - Assuming Samantha has no other taxable income, additions, subtractions, etc. (e.g. added income from capital gains, subtracted income from charitable donations), **C** and **A** can remain unchanged.

&gt; - Divide **A** by **C** to find the ratio of Colorado income to all income, and round to 4 significant digits. i.e. **D = A/C**

&gt; - Determine Samantha's tentative Colorado income tax burden by multiplying her total amount of federal taxable income (**C2**) by Colorado's flat tax rate of 4.63%. i.e. **E = C2*0.0463**

&gt; - Multiply Samantha's tentative Colorado income tax burden by the ratio of Colorado income to all income to find Samantha's final amount of Colorado income tax burden. i.e. **F = E*D**

By going down the chain of dependent variables, we can see how Samantha is being taxed in Colorado for her income earned in Texas.

&gt; **F = E * D**

&gt; **F = (C2 * 0.0463) * (A / C)**

&gt; **F = ((C - 10,400) * 0.0463) * (A / C)**

&gt; **F = ((A + B - 10,400) * 0.0463) * (A / (A + B))**

This clearly shows that Samantha's Colorado income tax burden, **F**, is influenced by **B**, which is *Samantha's income earned in Texas, while living in Texas*.

Now, you might have noticed that **B** is in both the numerator and denominator of the expression for **F**. So in order to see how that affects things, we have to do a *little* more minor algebra:

&gt; First, some rearranging of our last expression for **F** just to tidy things up:


&gt; **F = (A * 0.0463 * (A + B - 10,400)) / (A + B)**

&gt; Now distribute the coefficient **A * 0.0463 = .0463A** to the other term in the numerator:

&gt; **F = (.0463(A^(2)) + .0463AB - .0463A*10,400) / (A + B)**

So we see that while **B** is in both the numerator and the denominator of this expression, in the numerator it is accompanied by the coefficient **.0463A**, while in the denominator it is not. Therefore, unless **.0463A = 1** (or in other words, **A = 1 / .0463 = $21.59**), changing **B** will affect **F** -- in other words, Samantha's income earned *outside of Colorado, while not living in Colorado* will affect *Samantha's Colorado income tax burden*.

Can someone please explain to me why this is? Colorado's own FYI publication states that *only Colorado-source income* will be taxed, yet that is clearly not the case.

personalfinance,Is debt consolidation a good step? (Can),"75k Salary
35k take home after taxes, medical, rrsp ect.
Aside from loans/credit cards, my monthly debt that is unavoidable is  1425, for Hydro/Gas/Cells etc.

I have 2 horrible fixed rate/term loans.

- $8600 40% interest paying $574 a month paid off in 2 years.

- $7000/$11000limit 21% interest rate on 4200 0% on 2800(store card 0% on in store purchases over 200) payments right now are $190 a month

- $995/$4000limit 17.9% interest payments are $35 a month

- $400/$5000limit 19% interest payments $10/month

- $4000 furniture store $1800 currently at 24% payments of $72/month other $2200 is on no interest no payments until October


I am wondering if its better to keep paying until those really shitty loans are squared up, then take the payments I was making to them and pay off my cards.  Or would I benefit from applying for a consolidation loan.  My current credit score is only 670, up from 632 last month so its rising.  I have absolutely no negatives on my report.

Anyone curious a few years ago, my credit was really bad so I went to EasyFinancial and Citifinancial borrowed $6000 from each with no intention of fully paying it off.  After a few months I could see a relly positive change in my score, so I got a secured card, then a furniture store card, ect.  It took me along time to get to where I am at, but I own my house and another and my wife buys the cars, so I knew what I was doing to my credit I just didnt care and in the last year I realize how important it is.",finance
CryptoMarkets,"Post here your undervalued coins under 15M Cap of real projects with 10x/100x potential (these are my picks: WAND, FDX, OPT, ARY, WISH, AIX, EVE - see the description why)","Hope you are all ready for a new altcoin run now after two months of a bear market. From my side, it hit me quite hard going from a 5/6x return to only a 2x return and learned some good expensive lessons from it for the future. 

I believe now it is the best time to step in again, so that's the reason why I am writing this post. Next to this I am using the responses on this post to scout for advanced traders in undervalued gems (so write down which ones are your picks and the reasons why). Also feel free to follow me on twitter @NootFan

My picks:

* WAND 2.9M: Smart contract architecture enabling seamless creation and trade of any ERC20 Token or combination of them. This coin has a super low market cap still as it is only on ED but they are close to a new exchange and in March they are launching their pilot marketplace. Then this coin can go towards a 60/70M cap.

* FDX 15M: World's 1st Marketplace for Tradable Insurance Policies; tackling a trillion dollar industry. Went down around 60% during the crash. They are very close on getting to a new exchange and are now starting to work on their marketing efforts. They are almost hitting a milestone in their roadmap what will be the prototype launch of their marketplace within 1/2 weeks. This coin can really go to become one of the top 100 coins in the future when they hit some bigger exchanges.

* OPT 4.4M: The first decentralized music platform, competing with Voise 20M but their team and whitepaper looks more serious. Went from 1500 to 400/500 now and is on HitBTC and only and has fixed orders which made it difficult to break out. Now the market is picking up I believe it can break out again and then it can go really fast to those previous numbers which means a fast 3x.

* ARY 10M: This project I am probably the most bullish about on the long and the short term. ARY is disrupting the trucking/logistics industry by integrating blockchain with solutions to track the trucks, products and drivers and by this they are solving a huge problem which is called detention payouts (these are fees that need to be paid if the transfer of goods has not been on time). It is well below the ICO price now, they are signing fast new partnerships and launching their new updated website soon. This coin could be up there with Walton, VeChain when they start to sign partnerships with companies like UPS FedX etc. and go on some more exchanges. 

* AIX 10M: DAO Insurance Protocol on a blockchain which enables community, companies, developers to build insurance prediction markets and insurance products themselves, using on their infrastructure for cutting edge technology products like drones, battery's, self-driving cars etc. This went totally down from ICO and tried to break out even during the crash. Now when the crash is over I see it for sure breaking out and then you can see a 4/5x growth fast.

* EVE 8M: Devery allows organisations selling products via e-commerce to ensure their supply chain is secure. This prevents counterfeits and ensures supply agreements are honoured. This is another coin that I am very bullish on; certainly at this price (far below ICO). They are now only on IDEX and ED and a joint group of traders have been spreading fud together about the coin in their telegram chat to drive the price totally down to buy cheap. The same as ARY this coin can be a top 100 coin once they get on some bigger exchanges. 

Other coins I am invested in and also worth checking: B2B, SNOV, ELT, ATL

personalfinance,"One of my four undergraduate loans is now paid off, but the interest is a killer on the remaining ones - need help with an interest reduction strategy","About myself: 28, unemployed and have been for a while (1.5+ years). I have a BA and a JD. 

Loan situation: 
My parents always planned to pay for college, with the understanding that I would pay for my own law school. My law school loans are all Direct Plus loans that I was actively servicing while working, and which with IBR are now set to $0 monthly payments. I'm not worried about those as such at the moment (there are many decades to let that debt ruin my life).

My more immediate concern is with the undergraduate loans taken out on my behalf. My freshman and senior years were Parent Plus loans, and so I am not the borrower. The first of those two is now paid off in full, the other has a while to go, because the terms of plus loans changed between them, so the senior year loans were deferred, with repayment having only begun in 2014.

For my sophomore and junior years, the loans are private loans with my father as the cosigner. In keeping with what was always the plan, those have been reliably paid off by my dad. There are zero missed payments. But, as is inevitably the case with private loans, the interest rate keeps going up, and is now at 9% on at one of them, and 8.75% on the other. I don't recall the rate on the Plus loan, but I know it is somewhere between 7.9% and 8.5% as well. 

I know there are all sorts of private companies that offer to refinance student loans, but I'm not sure how viable they are as an option given a few problems:

1) My income is currently $0 and I am the primary borrower.

2) One of the three outstanding loans isn't even in my name.

3) I also have law school loans that I DO NOT want to consolidate, because IBR is the only thing keeping me afloat. At the same time, I don't need and can't utilize anything like IBR for the undergraduate loans, which are being paid by the consigner (or borrower in the Plus case).

My credit is quite good (just north of 750) and I believe my cosigner father's to be similar. He has a solid six figure job. And there is zero late payment history on any loan to which either of us are or ever have been attached. 

As my father will remain the person paying the undergraduate loans, he obviously needs to be attached to them in some capacity. And in any case, he's the more creditworthy borrower given that he has a solid income stream. 

What can be done to lower the interest through consolidating/refinancing given the above? Are there private loan refinancing options where I can apply with a cosigner and consolidate the two private loans, despite my own otherwise obvious inability to qualify for refinancing? Likewise, do student loan refinancing companies offer any sort of refinancing option for Parent Plus loans that my dad could take out in his name? Is there some more creative option we should be exploring?",finance

I built my gaming pc about a year ago. At the time I was still into gaming but I have no desire to game whatsoever anymore. I haven't touched a video game in several months. I owe ~$3000 tuition that has to be paid out of pocket and ~$1000 in car repairs. The $3000 is split into two payment plans of ~$1500 each (two different schools). My credit score is pretty solid (740ish) so I opened up a Chase Freedom Unlimited card with limited 0% APR for 24 months to pay off my tuition without paying ridiculous interest rates if I went the private student loan route. I'm thinking of selling my build to help pay off these costs quicker, to purchase a school-oriented laptop that will last me my remaining 3 years of university, and allow me to quit my part-time job which I'm only still at because I want to pay off the $3k in tuition. Quitting my job will allow me to fully focus my time towards school and keep my GPA as high as possible. I believe doing so will net me much higher financial gains in the long-term than if continue trying to balance school and work. Thoughts?

personalfinance,"Can one refinance / consolidate different types of loans together - for example, personal and student loans? (And other general questions)","I’m trying to educate myself and determine the best course of action to tackle my debt.  I recently graduated with a higher level degree which left me with about $55k in government student loans (that was even with a scholarship for almost 3/4 tuition!) - I also got a new job, doubling my income. My plan after starting new job was to immediately pay off my credit card debt  that accumulated while in school, which was about $11k at the time. However, a few months after starting my new job, a few things happened: due to breakup of long term relationship/moving out, end of student loan grace period, etc., my expenses have more than doubled.  So in terms of what I’m saving, I’m basically back to square 1.  

The interest rates on my student loans range from 5.4-6.8%, with the highest Loan at 6.8, and I think if I refinance I could reduce the interest rate and my monthly payments which would give me more each month to pay down my credit card (now about $7.5k).

I’m also wondering if it makes sense to take out a personal loan for my credit card debt, just so there would be a lower interest rate on that.  Is this a good or bad idea? I’ve been told to be leery of personal loans, but if I could cut the interest from what it would be with the credit card, that seems like a no brainer to me. I’m clearly a novice on these issues so I’m not sure if there are other considerations I could be missing.  

If I do in fact end up taking out a personal loan for credit card debt, prior to refinancing student loans, is that something I could refinance together with the student loans through a private bank?  (I know I can refinance the federal loans without going to private lenders, but assume I find a much lower fixed rate and am comfortable going private)

Other than the interest I’ve been paying, I’m not currently adding to my debt, but without doing something I don’t think I’ll be able to make a huge dent in paying the credit card debt.

Any advice on anything here is much appreciated - finance is really (clearly) not a strength of mine!",finance

House: $900k

Down payment: 20% ($180k, with closing costs everything comes out to around $195k)

Interest rate: 4% (10 year ARM)

**Question #1:** We have enough money to put down 25% on this house. But the catch is our lender is saying they won't decrease the interest rate. So our thought process is that we put that extra 5% straight to the debt and settle that once and forever. Good call?

*Baby in the next couple of years at the earliest. 

*We're thinking about a second property (to rent out) in a high growth area maybe a few years or more out on this goal. 

**Question #2:** After we get a good cash reserve, we're thinking about aggressively putting money towards our mortgage to pay it off as fast as possible.

personalfinance,Seeking advice in paying down debt to achieve specific goal of purchasing second home.,"Approximately one year ago I purchased my first home. Its located in a very desirable school district and in a great family neighborhood.  I owe $60k on the mortgage and if sold today, it would fetch around $100k.  The property became available to me at a significant deal due to some family circumstances.  I happened to be looking for my first home at the time and would have been stupid to turn down the opportunity.  The problem is, I'd rather live in a more rural setting with some acreage instead of in a housing development on a fifth acre lot.  Unfortunately, it would likely insult some members of my family to simply sell this house quickly however I have been encouraged to rent the home in the future which is what I'd planned to do.  It would rent for 1000/month + utilities however I would need to refinance as the terms of my mortgage prevent it from being rented.

My Debts: 

Mortgage - $60k @ 3.125%, 30 yrs 

Student loans (federal subsidized) - $36k combined @ about 5.75%.  

I pay $500/mo for the mortgage, tax &amp; insurance and $100/mo on the student loans under income based repayment.  These are literally my only debts.  I own my car outright and have no credit card or medical debt.

My income:

$25-$30k from my primary job.  I'm quite frugal and generally have $200-$600 left over most months.

I also have a $10k rainy day fund that I rarely touch

I'd like to know how best to pay down these debts in order to be in the best position to purchase a second house in 4-5 years.  Should I simply pay down my student loans first as they are the highest interest rate?  I have 19 more years before they will be forgiven if not paid off.  Or, should I work to pay the mortgage down because it'll increase my equity?

This is my first time posting so forgive me if I haven't done something quite right",finance
personalfinance,Should I refinance my car or trade it in for a new car with a better loan?,"I'll try to make this short..

In September of 2016 my car at the time broke down. I was in desperate need of a new car.. single father... I needed something with good gas mileage and more importantly something that would be reliable. My credit at the time was awful.. the only way they could get me in the car was to finance me with a really terrible interest rate (12.4 I believe)

Since then I have worked very hard to work on my credit. With the advice of my sons grandfather I have managed to repair my credit and i am proud to say I have paid my debts and my score has went from a 595 to 700 since then.


I recently applied for a credit card with my credit union. I was approved for a 7k card with 0 interest for the first year... And 10.9% after that. I decided to get a card to further try to build my credit and pay it off every single month..

The credit union approached me because when they pulled my credit they see how terrible of a loan my car is in.. they said they can refinance my car at 3.9% ... Which is obviously much better than the rate I'm in now, but they require 3800 cash to do this because since the car loan I have now is so terrible I haven't paid all that much in principle.

I don't have 3800 to drop right now... Am I better off just trading my car in and getting a new car with my credit union with a way better interest rate than I have with my car now? Is this even possible? Recommended? I'm just tried of seeing my bill and looking at how much is really going towards my principle it's gut wrenching...

personalfinance,Could a Cash-Out Refinance Be good for me?,"oblig. ""this is a throwaway"" - People I know would recognize my main.

My wife and I have always had a bad problem with debt. I've done credit card counseling before, got everything paid off, but then we opened new cards and did it again. Then we got a consolidation loan to pay everything off and were going to be done, but then my wife had to quit her job to maintain her mental health, and the 7-8 months it took her to get where she wanted to be has us right back in the hole again.

At this point, we are ready to get things paid off, close all of the accounts, cut up the cards, and literally never open another credit card ever again because we obviously aren't responsible enough with them. I've been reading PF quite a bit, and we 100% want to follow the plan outined in the sidebar. But here's the problem. Because of how bad we've screwed up, and a $500 a month student loan payment, I have zero extra income to put towards the credit cards, and our credit scores have dropped too low to qualify for 0% balance transfer cards. I've trimmed the budget as much as it can be trimmed - we dropped cable tv, cheaper cell phone plan, have called all insurance and other vendors and made sure we are as cheap as possible, etc. Only non-essentials are cable internet (with my own modem/router) and Hulu, because we have to have some form of entertainment to remain sane.

I had mentioned this conundrum to my mentor, and she recommended looking into home equity loans. One of the few things I have going for me is that my house which we purchased at $117k, and owe $105k on is now worth around $148k. 

I'm not too interested in a HELOC, because of the variable interest rate, but the idea of the Cash-Out Refinancing sounds enticing. Even with only about $15k, we could pay off my vehicle and enough cards to free up aorund $700 a month (minus the increase in mortgage payment), which would obviously make a huge difference for us and allow us to aggressively pay off other stuff.

So what is PF's opinion on these loans? Good idea or am I just digging another hole?",finance

personalfinance,Buying a house after a short sale,"A year ago I had to short sale my home. Before ya'll start lecturing me about not paying my bills, my company relocated me and I am fond of feeding my family and keeping my health insurance (especially when my daughter was having health problems and facing surgery at the time). But I digress. My credit took a hit but I had an 815 score before the short sale. Right now it has partially recovered one credit bureau is giving me a 730, another 800. Haven't checked the third. We have been renting in my current city and my job is very stable here. I have been renting for 18 months and have never missed a month or any other bill. I would like to be a homeowner again someday. Has anyone had a similar experience? Or is someone in lending and can tell me what to expect? My spouse is a stay at home parent but has an 800+ credit score. The house I would buy would be 1.5 to 2x my income, hopefully on the lower end

Here are some questions. I would like input on any and all of them:
1. How soon can I seek to get a mortgage? Will i get rejected if it is too soon?
2. Am I expected to have a bigger down payment than 20%?
3. Will I get screwed on interest rate?
4. Are there any government loan programs? I am guessing the interest rates may be higher?
5. Am I doomed to send my spouse back to work in order to qualify for a loan?
6. There is a chance I could borrow a portion from a relative, should I take a 401K loan on the remainder? Pros/cons on the 401K loan

Any other ideas or things I need to know?

Our daughter graduated last year and is in her freshman year at college.

He does very well and had no problem agreeing to this when the divorce was settled back then . Come time for college we find out that he has not prepared at all for financing this. 
We decided that that we would do whatever it took to take care of this for her. We ended up having to cash out 401K, it was last chance for us.

This is mainly because my Mum has ""no income"". She has been an Uber driver for just over a year, but they cannot accept her income unless she provides two years worth of tax returns.   
They stated that even if she made $5k per year, they would be able to put the application in for a better interest rate. However as she has not been Ubering that long they won't look at her income.   
The only option they gave us was for my Mum to go get a part time job and then we can provide 3 months' worth of payslips.

personalfinance,Paying off Student Loans in totality with a gift: taxes? Fees?,"Hello,

I am currently looking at about 15K total in loans (federal and through my school) for my college (United states, Oregon). My question is, if I have a family friend willing to hep me pay it off entirely, will it negatively affect me? We are aware of the gift tax filing for gifts over 14K, but I'm not sure how educational loans work. Would it be considered a sale because someone else is paying it early in entirety? Would I then be taxed? Do I have to file anything?

I work a part time job at my school, but don't make enough to file taxes, so I've never filed, although I'm claimed as a dependent on my parent's taxes. Is this a problem if I make a big payment? Would it be okay for my friend to pay directly, or would they need to gift me the money which I would then pay off the loans with?

I also want to know what sort of documentation I would receive if I paid a substantial amount/paid in full into the loans. My address (that the IRS uses: State of Hawai'i) is still my parent's, as I haven't filed to change it. However, if I get a letter/form from the IRS, I would not want them opening it and knowing the amount of loans I've had to take out/paid off (one of my parents has been known to take and request money from me, and I would not like them to know what loans I have out/paid off). My parents also claim me on their taxes, so if I do pay off/pay substantially into my loans, will they need my information for their taxes? These school loans are the only one's I have right now.

Thanks for the help, I know very little about loans and taxes!",finance

personalfinance,Resident debt + home + new baby?,"Hey all,

Long time follower of this thread and I didn't find anything quite similar.

Presently a graduating medical resident, entertaining job offers around $250k per year with $300k student loan debt that is on PAYE. Wife and I have about $15k saved.  I am pulling in extra moonlighting and expect an extra $3k saved by graduation. 

The new income based repayment proposal spreads all existing graduate loans to 30y. 

To take the new job with decent income, we are moving to an area where we wouldn't want to live in apartments (kinda sketch), houses could be found that maintain decent market value and have decent growth potential for 250k-350k. We anticipate staying in the area for 5-7yr.  With physician loans, our mortgage would be around $2-2.5k.  And wife is presently due in August, roughly a month after new job would start. 

Here's the questions: 1) continue on PAYE vs pay off (I am leaning this way, planning to max out monthly payments after rent/mortgage, 2) should we rent a condo/apartment, or buy a moderately priced house &lt;350k under physician loan?

My gut is stop PAYE, refinance, pay max monthly, and get a moderately priced home, but I am in way over my head.  Also- who can help more in correlation to my present market area if necessary?  A financial advisor or an accountant?

*edit: some factors that might change the situation:*
* *rent is equivalent to the mortgage depicted above, price/rent ratio 13*
* *physician loan keeps out other cost factors for the mortgage (0% down other than to lower points, no PMI, no realtor fees until selling in the future, still competitive interest rate)*

Bitcoin,Legality of Bitcoins in Estonia,"Estonia - the country of Skype - is supposed to be the champion of innovations but in case of crypto-currencies legislation this Baltic nation's regulators demonstrate notable conservatism. First, the Supreme Court of Estonia ruled that Bitcoin falls under the anti-money laundering law, which means that all crypto-currencies mediators must follow AML and KYC procedures. Then the Estonian Financial Supervisory Authority (EFSA) expressed an opinion that tokens, depending on their structure, might be considered as securities.

Furthermore, following the report that Estonia had proposed launching its own token - the ""Estcoin"", a representative of the European Central Bank stated that ""only the Euro is the legal tender and the monetary policy lies exclusively with the European Central Bank"". That have left a little doubt that the Ministry of Finance and the Estonian Central Bank will fall in line with this out-dated policy.

CryptoMarkets,"Bail In By Banks, and FRDI bill in India and the requirement of CryptoCurrencies","Firstly, lets know what a Bail in is:
1. In this situation a Bank  or Financial Institution is allowed to stay afloat by using Depositors Money. In this regard, Suppose theres a bad loan worth few millions of dollars given by your bank. Now the Banks financial Heath goes critical. Thus, a government Committee can : a. Use your Money to allow the Bank stay afloat. b. ""Fix"" your deposits for a considerable time period with minimum or zero interest rates

2. In this regard, the G20 summit at Cannes used the following arguement "" If the Bank performs healthily and  depositors are getting interest rates, and the safety is being insured, why not take up the liability too when the Banks health goes awry""

3. In the same regard Indian government came out with a FRDI bill. We have already seen in the previous day how a Jeweller scammed a famed PSU bank in India worth Rs. 12000 crores (1 crore = 10 million) . Previously we have also seen the Kingfisher Airlines scam  (worth Rs. 9000 crore); the BoB scam  (Rs. 6000 crore) etc. In India, the largest Bank SBI made Rs. 1771 crores in 1 quarter for not maintaining ""Minimum Deposit Balance"" on Accounts. Via the FRDI bill, the Government will introduce a new body RC  that will ""try its best to protect the interest of depositors "" (however there is no minimum Insurance clause, like how much deposit is insured) and ""they may decide for a bail in but the consent of depositors is not required for a bail in""

In the face of such Draconian Attempts by Governments and Banks (which themselves are responsible for all the economic Malaise; by corruption and malpractices and vested interests) Cryptocurrencies can be the new light. How? 

1. Decentralized Lending would never allow NPA as such to be the issue as it has become
2. There is no middle man in the name of Banks to entrust your security to. You are responsible and accountable.
3. Foul play by Capitalists cannot be a menace as it is today. Since, in a free market, there will be near ideal competition.
4. In a Blockchain Based Accounting system, that is Public and not Private, it can be made subsequently difficult to Launder Money. Land record maintenance can be made pretty transparent too.",cryptocurrency

I’m about $12k in debt, between $3k to student loans, $6.5k to my car loan (which is 14% APR), and about $3k give or take on my credit cards (one of them has a $2.3k balance on a $3.3k limit).  

Now, this is where I need help. My father is going to loan me about $4-5k in a month, which I’ll be paying back over the course of a year to two years, interest free of course. What I essentially want to do is put this entire $4-5k towards my car loan, whose balance I stated previously. However, it has an APR of 14% and I kind of feel like I don’t want to play myself and pay the loan in full, with such high interest. So I would much rather refinance, get a lower interest rate, and THEN pay it off in full. But here’s where it gets messy. I’m currently rocking a 599 credit score via Transunion. Granted, there are a few heavy payments that haven’t been reported to TU yet (according to credit karma), which will raise my score even higher. Regardless, I called a couple local credit unions recently and was essentially told I might get an even higher APR because of my low score.  I kind of feel like I’m caught in a checkmate. 

The guidance I’m trying to seek is just some general advice on what I should do with this personal loan. Should I just say forget it and pay off the high APR car loan? Will me trying to raise my score to get a lower APR make THAT much of a significant difference? Or should I use this money to pay off my student loans, plus take a fat chunk out of my credit card debt, and raise my score? Then, whatever money I would’ve put towards my monthly payments on these bills could just be applied to paying my car off. I unfortunately am at a weird spot in this game of chess and would just love for some relieving advice. Thank you guys so much.",finance

personalfinance,Advice on homebuying needed please,"This post is associated with the one I previously posted below: https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/7tm4qd/too_old_to_rebut_when_can_i_fi/

I could use some advice on homebuying. Just turned 39 and have never owned. I think I would like to purchase within the next, say, 1-2 years. I say ""think"" because I'm not 100% sold on doing so. I want it to be the right financial move for me. Please note: I currently don't own a car.

With that said, I was trying to think of what type of home to buy and what price point to limit myself at. I make $90k a year now (not including an 8% bonus I get annually). 

I could go the ""cheap as possible"" route and get something under, say, a max of $130k. Would much likely be a 1/1 apartment style condo in the city, older, but 50/50 chance of being near public transit which would be nice because I don't have a car and could continue living longer without one...potentially.

Or, I could up the budget and go for something closer to say $190k. This would either be a newer condo or loft in the city in a prime location definitely near transit (still likely a 1/1 apartment style condo or loft...a new 2/2 in the city would go for more like $300k here fyi). For $190kish I could also instead go for a new larger place (newer 3/2 two-level townhome) that is not dead center in the city. It would likely be right on the outskirts of the city which means having a car and dealing with traffic which is extremely bad here.

On going the inexpensive route: This is enticing as it means less in monthly payments.

On going the higher route: Is enticing because I could get a newer/nicer place and likely continue being car-less. Or if I go the 3/2 townhome route I would always have the option of getting a roommate which is kinda like ""insurance"" to me in case something happens to my job. Or I could have one to help pay half the mortgage...either way I really like the idea of having this flexibilit knowing I could still afford the payments on my own.

So. I'd basically like opinions on what you would do:

First, would you buy a home at all? How much would you aim to put down as a first time buyer? Would you be pressed to buy sooner rather than later considering interest rates are on the rise?

Second, what price point and type of home would you be more comfortable with? The cheapest route of setting a max of $130k and getting an older 1/1 condo as in my first example? Or would you go higher and get something closer to $190kish? 

Lastly, if you went the more expensive route, would you consider going with a newer 1/1 condo in the city center or a newer 3/2 townhome outside of the city? As mentioned, I live in a city where traffic is the biggest complaint/drawback, and areas in the inner city are gentrifying as people are looking for ways to decrease commutes which is having an impact on home prices in certain areas.

Lastly, a few things about me: I work from home so it is important I like the place I buy a lot as I'm home so much. I'm 39, single, female with no plans to have kids. Not a handy person. Have moved a lot in my life and not 100% sure I will retire here but don't have plans at the moment to move again any time soon (reached a point where I'm tired of moving). A friend mentioned to me a condo in the city at a cheap price is best as if I had to move again I could rent it out. I'm willing to save for a while to get what I really want (which would be something in that 190kish range), yet I'm willing to sacrifice what I want and go for something cheap now if it's the smarter thing to do.

personalfinance,Is there special debt assistance for those on Social Security? I'm on Disability and drowning in debt.,"I was poor but doing well on my $750 a month, working hard to establish good credit so I could buy property at some point. However, I ended up with a significant other nearly as broke as me. This led to my contributing more money than I had, believing him when he said things would soon improve. Five years later we are breaking up, and I'm nearly $5000 in credit card debt. (It's literally mostly from food costs because my $190 a month in Food Stamps couldn't feed both of us.)

The interest rates of my cards range from 24.99 to 19.99. I'm drowning. Even if I could get a loan with a 16% rate, it'd take me three years of paying $200 a month, which I can't afford, because my rent is $450 and utilities are more than $50.

I am selling what I can to make a dent, but that's also tricky because if I generate too much income my benefits can be screwed. 

Since it's better to get back their money than to have me claim bankruptcy, is there some program for people on benefits who need debt consolidation loans? Any other suggestions?

Bitcoin,Pay off the US National Debt with only $200B?,"I was thinking about the relationship between the US Federal govt and Bitcoin recently.  Suppose the price of a Bitcoin went to $1M. That’s roughly 100X of the current price.  If the US FEd govt bought $200B worth of Bitcoin and the price went to $1M, their holdings would be worth $20T which is the size of the national debt. 

Of course, one minor problem is that there is only $160B Bitcoins now.    

So then you say, if we had $20T bitcoin and $20T debt, do you pay it off or HODL??!!   

Anyway, I predict govts around the world will begin investing in Bitcoin and probably already are.

personalfinance,"[Taxes] UTMA Account, Tax Liability for Capital Gains?","So I have a UTMA account that I would like to cash out to have the funds in my name and liquid and available in a checking account.

My question is if I have tax liability in selling the investments, for capital gains. It's an account my mom set up.

So say it's $20k, began as $8k, invested in a not too great mutual fund account with high fees that has underperformed relative to indexes and I want the money in my name so I can buy a new car with no financing.

But, do I need to set aside 30-40% of that for my next year's tax liability? Similar to a taxable security account? So technically it's more like $13k towards a new car instead of $20k?

Or is there some way that I would actually be entitled or able to get the full $20k available and liquid to me without owing taxes?

If taxed, who owes them?

My mom and I are each in roughly the same tax bracket, earning $30-50k each. So I'm thinking the tax rate would be federal capital gains of 15%?

I left a job I hated and she has a job in the medical field that's so high in demand that she would have no problem getting a job anywhere, ever. 

I invested in real estate once I left college in 2008 and made a good chunk of money.

We sold everything except my car and went on our adventure. 

35-40 countries and a lot of perspective later, we are back in July 2017. She immediately finds a job but I settle for odds and ends jobs while I get my real estate license and find a real job.

January of this year I just got hired on to my dream job and couldn't be happier, but now I'm trying to get my financial house in order and figure out what to do.

 Current situation:

800ish credit score

Absolutely no debt
2400/month in spending includes rent, investment property carrying costs (tax, insurance,utilities)
Currently living in an apartment
200k savings
5k emergency fund
72k 401k
Own both cars
60k investment property (approx value)
We both contribute 10% of our salary to 401k with a 6% match. 
No student loans(just paid off wife's 75k)
 
Income for one is 80k plus possible 25k in bonus and the other is 85k a year.

The problem is that we aren't sure what a smart next move is. All of my real estate investing has put us in a great position but I feel like I could really get us to a comfortable spot with the right moves.  We are planning on selling the investment property in the next few months.

We want to buy a house and start working towards a very early retirement. 

I'm considering getting a mortgage on a property because interest rates are so low. I also want to invest in a Roth IRA. 

I'm concerned my sabbatical might hurt my chances of getting a loan.

personalfinance,Emergency fund interest rate vs school loans,"Right now me and H have a couple school loans left to pay at around **~3%** interest.

We're moving the emergency fund from a crappy Wells Fargo zero-interest account to another financial institution where we can hope to get maybe 1% or more on a savings account soon.

I was wondering though, Is there any other device I should investigate to ramp up the EF's interest rate so it's at least equivalent to the remaining loans? **Meaning around ~3% as well**.

Or is it just an unavoidable a characteristic of an emergency fund that since it has to be easily accessible, it has no chance of being stored in a device that gives ""reasonable"" interest rates?

We're on a fixed repayment plan for the loans, refinancing them is only going to end up with a higher rate, we've been told to just keep the plan and pay them off in lumps as we go, which we've been doing. But there's still $15k remaining on them and I just dislike the thought of them encroaching on the fund.

Housing: I live with parents and would like to begin home-buying process when fiancée arrives. I’m planning on taking advantage of the first-time home-buyers loan offered by the USDA.

personalfinance,"26 years old, graduating with $170k in student loans and a 100k salary. I know I'll be ok but I'm feeling overwhelmed.","Hi, I'm about to graduate this May and have received a job offer that pays MUCH more than the average for a new graduate in my field ($100k instead of $60-65k). Employees also receive a $10k raise every year. I have about $170k in federal student loans right now, after interest. All of my loans are unsubsidized so they have been ballooning the entire time and the interest will capitalize pretty soon. The lowest interest rate is 4.5% and the highest is 6.9%. The majority of them are in the 5%-5.9% range though.

I'm currently on the income-based repayment plan that has forgiveness after 25 years. I signed up for that one at the beginning of school because I figured I was going to start at around $60k and wanted to be safe in case I couldn't make huge payments. However, I'm very lucky that I was offered this job and I would like to be as aggressive as possible on paying them back. 

I've been pretty good about living frugally and have been keeping my total living expenses at about $9500 per year while in school, and I don't mind continuing to live this way when I'm out (truthfully I don't know how I would spend more even if I wanted to). The only thing is that my cost of living is going to increase a little since I'm going to Las Vegas which is a bit more expensive than where I am now, although I'm pleasantly surprised at how much lower it is than I expected. 

I want to balance aggressive loan repayment with saving for retirement. I wish I had started saving for retirement at 18 but there's nothing I can do about that now. I know that my loan interest rates are pretty high so I don't know when I should begin to worry about the retirement savings. Like if I should just put 100% of my extra money towards the loans until they're gone, or if I should allocate money to both goals right away. And if I should start retirement savings now, what percent of my income should I put towards it? 

I have not worked out the details of what my employer will pay in the way of retirement at this point but he is a very successful person who believes very strongly in generosity and workplace satisfaction (I have talked privately with many of his employees and they have all only had positive things to say). 

I am currently single with no kids, and no plans of having kids soon. My car is paid off and is running fine right now. My credit score is around 750. I'm not sure if I should buy a house here, but rent prices are about equal to mortgage payments so it's something I am considering.

CryptoCurrency,Socratescoin.io [SAPIS] Very likely to be a scam. Help me to look into this!,"Guys, I don´t know where to start. I have been looking into this for the last couple of days and all leads scream SCAM but I haven´t found the ultimate proof. Following I will provide everything I have found so far.

[Socratescoin.io](http://socratescoin.io) is hyped by some social media influencers lead by the (according to Forbes) #1 female influencer on Snapchat of 2016 Ginicanbreath (Virginia Salas Kastilio).

I will start with the soft facts first and then go to the more damning hard facts. But first you should have a look at the [website](https://socratescoin.io/) and the [whitepaper](https://socratescoin.io/whitepaper.pdf) called Socrates White PapeR_russia.

**Soft Facts**

##Whitepaper
First of all the [whitepaper](https://socratescoin.io/whitepaper.pdf) is written by people who have no clue about what a cryptocurrency and the blockchain is. Reading it you will get the impression that it is written by a few people on a single evening while they shared a few $5 bottles of wine.  No big giveaway but doesn´t sound like a serious business at all.

##Nauka University
The the Nauka university that the Socratescoin will be used for. There is literally nothing to be found about online even though it is in development since the early 2000´s. By googeling the ""founder"" Alfed Hasselbacher I have found [naukauni.eu](http://naukauni.eu) on his xing profile. That domain is registered since 2007 and belongs to a Prof. Dietrich Greve who has witten ""NAUKA University - by Moscow State University"" on his website. Keep that in mind because we will come back to the connection to Moscow later. The websites redirects you plenty of time until you finally end up at an addblocker for Youtube that looks kinda sketchy. Besides that there is nothing to be found about this university/idea/project and nothing was ready to be shown yet which seems odd to me since they claim to ""have strategically leveraged an investment of 2.5 years and $5 million of another company´s personal funds[...]"". The same happens with naukauni.com which is owned by another guy that in affiliate marketing and is from the same region as Dietrich Greve.

##Token Sale
You will just receive an email with two deposit addresses (BTC and ETH) and the promise that after the token sale period has finished you will receive instructions on how to take delivery of your SAPIS tokens. According to their [announcement](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2937986.0) on Bitcointalk they want to aqquire 46,900,000.00 USD with 46,900,000 ""tokens"" available for the presale and the ICO. With a price of $1.11 per coin but prices as low as $0.70 and 30% bonusses at the presale and bonusses of 15% during the ICO there is a problem with the math that even my little one who is just in the third grade sees.

##NAUKA World
All in all it sounds like a Second Life like enviroment but just for studying and with historical sites as your places to study at. And don´t forget AKUAN your personal avatar. Then they list a few names from Isaac Newton over Alfred Nobel to Pythagoras but don´t that if virtal resemblances will be found in the NAUKA World.


##Big Point Player
That´s where it begins to become interesting. Big Point Player is said to be a partner of Nauka but it´s never really said in which field or why. It is basically a training system/course for amateur to semi-professional tennis players. The webiste is from 2014 and they have added a clickfunnel to get their blueprint in 2017 but since then nothing has changed. What is more interesting are the Experts. Mark Jeffery and Robert Carlbo will part of the team as COO and consultant. Besides a bunch of testimonials on their own website there is nothing to be found about them. Mark Jeffery posts videos on Facebook every now and then but never says Big Point Player.

##All other companies mentioned
All other companies mentioned in the whitepaper are dead ends. ""Eonthy Sports"" is nowhere to be found and Google suggests [TennisTender.com](https://tennistender.com/) whoch features Robart Carlbo but besides that it´s not what it claims to be. The Elixir Group LLC mentioned under ""Advisors"" is nowhere to be found as well as Mr. Alfred B. Thacher J. One died back in 2001, one is born in 1919 and probably already dead too and the third one who is still alive is not the one shown on the photo according to his relatives. So is the Elixir Group LLC. All companies with a similar names are non existant anymore and never had any relations to anyone called Thacher.


**Hard Facts**

##Website
The website is hosted on 193.9.21.222 which is the same host as [proncoin.io](http://proncoin.io) uses and it´s using the exact same template and the exact same Terms of Sale [Socratescoin](https://socratescoin.io/Terms_Of_Sale_Socrates.pdf)|[Proncoin](https://proncoin.io/terms.html)). This tells me that there has to be the same man behind the two projects.

##Milan Kozlevčar
The owner of both Domains whose name has been mentioned around cryptocurrencies back until 2013 when he claimed to buy Bitstamp. While proncoin.io is registered since 2004, socratescoin.io is just registred since the 7th Dec. of 2017. Him and Manuel Batista (CEO of Socratescoin and Nauka) are friends on Facebook since Nov '17 so it raises the question why Milan had to register the domain.

##Proncoin
This brings another name to the game: Mladen Babić who seens to be very involved in Proncoin. Him and Milan know each other so quite some times and he has been arround cryto projects for quite some time but always kept his name out of the game. However there is no link between him and Manuel Batista to be found. The GFY forum has already called this coin a scam: [here](http://gfy.com/fucking-around-and-program-discussion/1292716-proncoin-whos.html).

##Piplcoin
Milan´s last project with a coin for a job board called [Piplshare](https://piplshare.com/). All jobs are fake, links are dead and of course it is still in beta... [Piplcoin.com](https://piplcoin.com/) looks like and early version of the websites of the both coins mentioned before, so does the whitepaper. At least the coin went live but it is technically useless.

#Addresses
The address given on the website and the whitepaper (279 Main Street - GX111 AA - Gibraltar) is the adress of a law firm calle Massias &amp; Partners who will gladly register you company in Gibraltar for the right amount of money. However upto now there is no Sapis Investment Ltd. registered and the law firm has never heard of it. Then they have sent out another pitch per email to a friend of mine. The address mentioned there (42 North Mole Road GX11 1AA Gibraltar) is non existant and probably somewhere in the ocean...

##Legal representation
So there is no company registred for Sapis or Socratescoin or the Nauka University? No, but it is never mentioned anywhere. On the 11. of January this year someone calle Hasselbacher Alfred has registered two companies in Malaga, Spain. One is called Sapis Investments Brokers SL and the other one is called Nauka Virt-Un SL which raises the question why those companies are never stated somwhere related to the project.

##The myth around Alfed Hasselbacher
The same Alfred hasselbacher has registred a few more companies in Malaga in the past. One for example (Ngt Hasselbacher SL) sold these liquid screen protectors when they were a big thing via multi level marketing. Another one was in the field of Science and Labor with the name Skymond. Interestingly the (website)[http://www.skymondtechnology.com/] is still online with the same design but Skymond Technology is now active in the ""mobile world"" and run by some guy from the Netherlands. And as you can guess, all links to more details are dead. All companies founded by Alfred Hasselbacher have a capital of 3,000.00€ and have not been changed since. Back in 2010 he has ben fined for 310.00€.
Despite teh fact that Russia was a designated market for the liquid screen protectorsand  a profile on a website where he is looking for a russian bride there is just one strange article about the screen protector liquid stating that he has been working on a virtual university at the Moscow state university ((link)[http://energie.finde-dich-selbst.net/neue-nano-technologie-fuer-dein-handy/]).
Furthermore the name Alfred Hasselbacher is found as one of the medical advisors for (Bauer Natrition)[https://bauernutrition.co.uk/medical-advisors/] in 2016 and his name was also around dietary pills back in 2014 but then he claimed that his name was falsely used ((link)[https://www.gesund-heilfasten.de/diaet/blog/zyloslim-mitoslim-nuvocleanse/]) by a company from the UK. However there are many traces to the UK to be found.
What makes me wonder is that this name never showed up before 2010 in Spain and since then it is always around topics that promised to make a lot of money fast by more or less scamming people.

This is it so far. I have probably missed a lot but there are so many leads that it took very long to get together what I have found so far.

1. Loan company A: Principle balance $40,496.64 with three loans, two of which are 6.55%, the other is 5.95%. 
2. Loan company B: Principle balance: $24,334.83 with two loans from them at 3.5% and 4.25% (we think, about that) 
3. Total loan between the two as of today: $64,831.47
4. Currently paid ahead by 18 months on Loan A, and 12 months on Loan B. (We often cite this as a buffer/safety net if one of us lost our job or something). 


Questions:

1. The big question is which are we better off going with? Is it smarter to go with a consolidated loan (about $65K) at 3.35% for about five years, OR stay on track with the current loans with an unknown end date (probably 6+ years). 

2. Apple gift card is not a deal breaker, but is a nice incentive. Would we have to pay taxes on that at the end of the year? 

We're not that great with math and don't really know how to figure out which loan will cost us more in the long run.",finance

Opinion: Wells Fargo auditors could soon deliver another blow to the bank

Investors should watch for KPMG’s opinion on the bank’s internal controls by around March 1

Wells Fargo investors have learned a lot about the bank’s worsening issues recently, but they should be watching carefully over the next couple of weeks for possibly more bad news — from the bank’s auditors, KPMG.

KPMG must opine on Wells Fargo’s WFC, -0.12% internal controls by around March 1, and investors might not like the answer: the very real possibility of an adverse opinion from the auditors identifying material weaknesses in the bank’s controls.

On Feb. 2, the Federal Reserve Board released a consent cease-and-desist order that requires the bank to improve its governance and risk-management processes, including strengthening the effectiveness of oversight by its board of directors. The Federal Reserve Board stated that the “firm did not have an effective firm-wide risk management framework in place that covered all key risks.”

That Wells Fargo is in a dark place right now should be a surprise to no one. Recent reporting by The Wall Street Journal, a review of filings with the SEC and other public disclosures have raised significant concerns about material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting at the end of 2017.

personalfinance,Question on paying debt and question on Roth IRA,"HI PF,

My wife and I have some money beyond our EF, and I figured you all could direct us on how best to spend it. 

We currently have 3.5k above our EF.

Debts: 

Student Loan - Federal Subsidized - 30k @4.625%

Student Loan - Personal Loan - 5.5k @ 3.86%

Car Loan - credit union - 17.5k @4.49%

Credit card - 5k @0% until August 2018

Credit card - 2k @0% until February 2019



We were thinking of dumping it onto the 5k CC debt, to pay that off before August, instead of trying to roll it into another 0% card.

As for the car loan, we were upside down on my wife's old car. Sold that car and bought another used car, with AWD (live in a snowy area). So we are even more upside down on that car. It's worth about 10k and we owe 17k. Not sure if that changes anyones recommendation.

Should I try to refinance the 30k student loan? We saw a letter from SoFi that advertised a rate of 3.8 or so on a fixed rate. 

Also, my apologies for all of the questions, but I like to save them up! I was looking into opening a Roth IRA through Vanguard. It looks like it only takes 1k to do so? I currently invest in a company 401k through Merrill Lynch, with all of it in a 2050 Vanguard retirement fund. Should I pick the same fund when I open the Roth IRA, or another? 

Thanks for any help!",finance

personalfinance,First time (multi)home buyer. What are my mortgage options?,"Hi. I'm in my 20's and want to househack my first home locally in Connecticut. I prefer a foreclosed or undervalued multifamily home that I can fix up since I'm pretty handy. I'd like to use the home as equity to buy another home within a year or two or even sell.

I was told a NACA loan is perfect for me by an investor I met at a BiggerPockets podcast real estate meet up. He mentioned it would allow me to put nothing down and I'd get a very low interest rate. My realtor however told me an FHA 203B or 203K loan would allow me to be a live in landlord and give me more than what the home is worth based on the work that needs to be done to the home. 


He wants to introduce me to his mortgage buddy this week. Any other ideas on what might be best for me? I have ""excellent"" category credit, make nearly 6 figures, and have 40k in car/student loan debt. He says he can easily see me getting approved for 350k which is a scary bill to pay back for 30 years. Did I mention I'm a nervous investor when it comes to homes? Because I am. I may just leave CT altogether depending on the complexity of this. How many banks should I request a mortgage from to compare rates? Thank you!",finance

Please stop asking questions about Tethers, just stop. Yes it's legit, no you won't get an audit, so stop asking.
It's legit because my employee knows someone who saw the money on a bank account.  
No you won't get an audit because if Tethers are fully backed, Bitfinex may or may not have circumvented a few regulations here and there, so if we are too transparent it may trigger the FEDs and nobody wants that. See, nothing to worry about.

personalfinance,My Tax Nightmare - No Federal Taxes Withheld In '17,"Going to file my taxes this weekend I realize that no federal tax has been withheld for the past year. I'm a salaried employee and I recall seeing a small bump in my take-home but attributed it to the small raise I'd received, forgetting that I'd enrolled in the stock purchase program which automatically withholds a preset percentage.

Jump to now and it looks like I owe over $9,000. SS, Medicare, and all state withholding stayed as they had for my past two years with the company. Whether or not this was an error on me or payroll, I think I'm screwed.

Planning on saving what I can until filing in April and paying a lump sum from that and my actual savings account, maybe following the rest with a short term loan. Any better plan I should consider?

Thanks much. Pay attention to your pay stub, kids.",finance
personalfinance,Allocating income from a side job,"I recently started a side job making $2400/month. After setting aside $800/mo in taxes, take home is $1600. I have travel plans this year so I’m setting aside some of it for that and would also like to start building up a down payment to potentially buy a house. However, I’m also sitting on roughly $65k in student loans, all of which have a 6.5-7% interest rate. My current student loan payment is just over $400/mo and that’s the minimum going strictly to interest. I have an emergency fund with $11k that would take care of expenses for a little over three months. My full time job covers all of my regular monthly expenses, so my question to reddit is how should I allocate the money from my side job? I’d like to have another $4k saved by August to go towards an extended trip to Europe (flights are booked but no accommodations yet). Beyond that, what should I be putting towards student loans vs building a down payment? For reference, I’d likely buy a house around $200k (I’ll just continue to rent until purchasing in that price point becomes reasonable - in order to buy in a good location that will retain its value in my area, $200k is about the lowest I’d be able to find something). Suggestions? 

Other points worth noting: I’m single, no kids, medium cost of living area in the mid south. My regular income is $80k/year. I have 3% going to a 401k and 5% towards a Roth 401k. I also save $500/mo in a high interest savings account - the same account where I’m depositing the income from my side job. I know I should be putting more towards my retirement funds, but haven’t gotten around to it yet. I’m not the best at managing my money but I’m trying to get better.",finance

personalfinance,Accountant suggested borrowing from 401k to pay off taxes,"I just went to get my taxes done this weekend and I will be owing the government $5000.

I will be correcting this with my employer going forward. 


For the past 2 years, I have aggressively payed off (largely due to advice from this sub) all of my credit card debt and a major portion of my student loans.  Because of this strategy, I have a smaller savings account of $6000 set aside. My accountant advised me to keep my savings where it is and borrow from my 401K to pay off the taxes owed.

None of my business I know, I am just super curious with this question after all my Google searching.


Question 1: If you have no income, then you should not get any money from the IRS for claiming your children, correct?


Question 2: Is this possible? Can I create fake income from work I did not perform in order to claim children and reap the benefits? 


My girlfriend earned $17,000 this year and after filing taxes will receive $10,000 back from Federal/State. This is well over half of the income she earned throughout the year.

personalfinance,"25 y/o, new position and 401k account through Transamerica. What funds to invest in?","Hi PF,

Title says it, I'm finally getting my finances on track and am trying to start building portfolios for the future. No student debt, renting apartment, own a car. I can manage all of that and still have some money to invest. 

Currently, I am allocating 100% into a State Street Target Retire 2055 NL Class K fund, but the option is there to allocate into short/long bonds, stocks, multi-asset, etc. I'm putting in 8% pre-tax and my employer matches up to 5%. I've heard vanguard is a good choice, and is an option to allocate to (vanguard wellington, vanguard small cap value/growth index). I'm curious if anybody has any advice on this, or what would be a solid path to go down while I'm young. My next step would be to speak to a consultant, but why do that when reddit is free and full of financial professionals right??

I've also read that I should open a Roth separately and only contribute what my employer matches to my 401k. And since vanguard is an option on transamerica, could I open a roth and link those two accounts? 

My grandparents left me with some CDs as well, and that's sitting in my savings account. I would rather lock up some of those funds early now in something that'll help me down the road, but am gridlocked into not wanting to make the wrong decision.

I don't remember exactly what I claimed as I changed it due to circumstances in 2016 and haven't looked at it since but it will be 2 or 3 and my wife claimed 1 on our W-4's. I'm baffled as I put my child's info in and then put in my income. That alone we were set for around $4k refund total. After I put in my wife's income that's where we ended up... Owing $100+. I made over 3 times as much as her. 

I made over 3 times as much as her and not even close to the next tax bracket. Why did putting in her income take out so much??

Also... The year prior (2016) I worked, my wife didn't work, claimed our new baby, and my mother in law as she was living with us and didn't qualify for disability yet and we received close to $5k in return.

This year (2017 taxes)... I worked (made a bit more not much cuz of a promotion, wife worked, still have baby, mother in law received disability and moved out so I didn't claim her.

**WHAT**

""Envisioning a smarter, healthier and transparent food and pharma ecosystem connecting producers, retailers, consumers and markets though distributed apps, sensors, automation and blockchain based data revolution.""

The project consists of the following four components:

&gt;* **1. Ambrosus Data Ecosystem**

&gt;Ambrosus is creating an open scalable data management protocol that can integrate with every data source across multiple organizations in the food ecosystem, including food producers, suppliers, supermarkets and consumers. This data architecture would comprise of a combination of distributed storages including cloud storage as well as the blockchain.

&gt;* **2. App Development Kit**

&gt;The main value of the Ambrosus Data Ecosystem is that it will unlock a plethora of opportunities for the development of Mobile and Desktop Apps for a variety of use cases by connecting to the Data stored on the Ambrosus Ecosystem. Ambrosus is developing a user friendly App Development Environment that could open up businesses worth millions of dollars.

&gt;* **3. Sensor Technologies**

&gt;The main pillar that the entire Ambrosus Ecosystem rests on is high quality reliable data and measurements. This is especially true for measuring parameters such as quality of food products, fish, dairy and meat. Pharmaceutical Industries require sensors to have special certifications that ensure reliability of measurements. To aid the development and installation of compatible sensors that can directly speak to Ambrosus Blockchain and Distributed data system, Ambrosus has set up a lab to integrate sensors from some of the most reputed sensor manufacturer around the world.

&gt;By having a repository of appropriate sensors, Ambrosus can help advise partner companies to install the latest state of the art sensors to improve the quality of the data fed into the system. Ambrosus has set up a state of the art research lab in Lausanne that is currently interacting with various Sensor Manufacturers and developing the hardware so that these sensors can directly talk to Ambrosus Distributed data management systems.

&gt;* **4. Smart Commodities Market**

&gt;The final element of the food supply chain revolution that Ambrosus aims to bring is the establishment of a Decentralised Market that will enable different supply chain elements to dynamically establish trading contracts that is fair and transparent. The crossroads browser is a step in this direction and is close to release. It will help in trading of futures markets for food commodities.

**WHERE** 

Based out of Switzerland, which is perhaps the single most crypto-friendly country at the moment. Also historically one of the most innovative and influential nations in the financial field. Worth noting the projects' connections and strong relationship with the Swiss government, as they've received funding from the Swiss Canton of Vaud Government, opened a research lab in Lausanne, and has the official endorsement of the Swiss Quality and Safety Association. A handful of the team members also have some impressive connections with the Swiss government. Lastly, it's definitely worth noting that Roche and Novartis, respectively the second and fourth largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, are both based out of Switzerland.


**WHEN**

The CEO has stated that the alpha network out next week and the cryptoeconomic model to be released in late March/early April at latest. Longer term, the updated Product Roadmap will be released on Feb. 21.


**WHY**

At an ~$87 million USD market cap (rank 169) it should be obvious that AMB is criminally undervalued. Also should acknowledge the massive Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs), according to the CEO:

&gt;We currently have about 20 NDAs in place. We deal with the following industries (next are some examples of profiles we have: 1) Producer of chemicals and commodities with 100 Billion+ USD in annual revenues; 2) Manufacturer of cosmetics with 4 Billion+ USD in annual revenues; 3) Manufacturer of a variety of foods with 30+ Billion USD in annual revenues; 4) Retailer producing various consumer goods including food with 25 billion+ USD in annual revenues; 5) manufacturer of food processing equipment with 2 billion+ USD in annual revenues).

Given the industry leaders &amp; pioneers that make up the team, the all-star advisors/partnerships (Gavin Wood is a big fucking deal), industry connections, use-case, NDAs, and geographically friendly location, Ambrosus won't be slept on for much longer. 'Investing' in altcoins right now is ultimately a betting game. Given the fundamentals of the project, it seems logical that Ambrosus is a low risk/high reward investment to safely park your money for a few years.",cryptocurrency

What could I expect to see for vehicle interest rates in the next year or so?,"We recently had our first child in our family and we need a reliable long distance car that is comfortable for all of us. Our fleet of three were purchased for a pre child life and are either too small (2013 chevy volt), too old (2004 Porsche Cayenne Turbo w170k miles...a unwise decision, but fun car from a few years ago), or too beat up from offroading (2004 Isuzu Trooper) for what we need. 

We plan on keeping the Volt and swapping out the other two vehicles. All are paid off. 

We had been planning on keeping the cars we have have until student loans are fully paid off this year, 39k left to go with average of 5.3%. Between our saving and year end bonuses right now we have 30k in cash plus 18k in emergency funds. But watching interest rates climb on auto loans has left us wondering if we should slow down paying student loans a bit and find something while we can get a rate significantly lower than our student loans. I would hate to exhaust our funds on student loans only to have to turn around and take out a higher apr on a vehicle. 

So what would you do PF? Should I pay cash or make a substantial down payment with a small loan for a vehicle now?  Or Attack the student loans, gamble with the fleet of cars I have and deal with potentially higher APR's and higher monthly payments on a vehicle?
 
The vehicles we are looking at would be in between 20-35k used low mileage (probably either f150 crew, Toyota 4 Runner, or Volvo wagon) We have good credit around 820. My monthly finances, mortgage etc are in decent order, CC paid off monthly+ save 1k or so a month. we contribute 10% to the 401k and get a 8% match.

personalfinance,"18 y/old working 2 jobs, trying to save up for college and travel, wondering how and where to allocate my money.","Alright so I’m just looking for some advice on my situation. Im currently working 2 jobs, one is a retail job that I work about 30-35 hours at and my bi-weekly paychecks are around $530-$630. Then, about 3 times a week, I strip at a club where I make $1000-$1200 a week. I’ve been doing this since the beginning of February and I’ve saved exactly $3550. Currently I have my money from my retail job deposited into my Chase bank checking account and then I have half of my stripper earnings in my Chase savings.

This is how my money is allocated:

-I use my money from my retail job to pay for all my necessary expenses. $600 for rent (I live with 3 other girls), $60 for utilities (water, electricity, gas),  $80 for groceries, $10 gym membership. I spend about $150 on “leisure” activities like eating out with friends, live music and sometimes buying clothes. For the most part though, I’m very frugal. These are the things that I pay for directly.

I am taking a gap semester from college also and I plan on enrolling in a community college in the fall. However right now, I’m using this free time to do somethings that I’ve been wanting to do for a while. My goals for the next 6 months is to travel to a different country and go to a big music festival so I’ve been wanting to save money for those. My plan is to use money from my 2nd job as a stripper to help with these goals. I determined that I want to split up my earnings with 50% going towards saving up for school tuition, 30% towards my travel/experience fund, and 20% to an emergency fund. I also want to take at least $100 from my earnings from my retail job and put that towards school too.

I don’t have much of a need for materialistic or extravagant things. My main goal is to save money and spend it on things I find more meaningful like my college education, traveling, and possibly helping my family.


What I’m really struggling with, is the best way to keep this money organized. I have 2 bank accounts, Chase bank and Navy Federal. I feel like the best way for me to keep organized is put the savings for college in my Chase savings, my travel savings in my Navy Federal savings, but I’m not sure where I would put my emergency fund? I was thinking keeping it in cash but I read that I should keep it liquid so I can access it whenever. Where should I hold my emergency fund? My goal is $4000.

My goal for school savings is $20000 for school and I was wondering what kind of account I should have that would be best to hold that money. The only account I have knowledge of that could work is a Chase Certificate of Deposit for large sums of money. 

Please ask questions if you have any about my situation. Also please do not judge, I’m just looking for objective advice on how to best allocate my money and keep it organized. I want to stay focused and I’m looking to gain some insight on handling my finances. Thank you!

personalfinance,Student in debt and waiting on Medicare,"Medicare/Medicaid, I always get them flipped so if it's the wrong name, just go with the other. They are nearly the same deal.

Long story short is that I applied for Medicare back in October of last year, in my state there is a *minimum* of a 6 month wait list. So I'm nearing the point when my application will hopefully be reviewed and accepted. I have no healthcare, it expired in January (yay for getting older). I work a student job on campus, have been looking for a job for over a year, this summer will be 2 years. 

I'm operating at a loss, the only thing keeping a roof over my head is my student loans, and that means in the summer I either borrow money from family to keep the roof or find some odd jobs to patch together my half of rent.

To the **point of the post**, I got a medical bill in the mail recently for over 400$. Medicare representative told me explicitly (i have the recording, I checked it) ""Do not pay anything, we will not reimburse you"". Which is all fine and grand, sure, but the medical folks are sending this bill to the collectors at the end of the month. I have 1 more statement coming and then basically they will send a second as they send it off to collections.

I've lurked here plenty to know that I can just ignore the collector, send them notice to not contact me such and such ways and only this other way, to verify the debt and such. But I'm curious if it would be better to pay it and just take the hit, or ignore them for 7 odd years and wonder what else they will try to affect? I have a hair over the debt cleared up on my credit card (which is also coincidentally maxed from medical stuff), so I could pay it. The medical office representative says if I pay them and then medicare goes through and pays them, they will refund me, but that sounds like too many people saying too similar of things. I tend to err on the safer than sorry.

**Superfluous information** I'm making just over 300$/month from this student job, under 9k$ in credit card debt (pretty good interest rate though 10%), owe my family 4.5k$ (which they don't expect back, but I'm tracking and adding a bit more on every quarter or so), and of course I've broken 50k$ in government student loan.  I also owe my lawyer 1400$, which is going to go up even more here soon, but I have a payment plan set up with them.

Rent is 1150$, child support is 325$ (covered by the job), internet is 80$, lawyer is 50$, petrol is 50$ (about every other month or so, I share vehicle), food is less than 200$ (about once or twice a quarter, we are able to stretch our stores), credit card is 300$. All of this is **per month, unless otherwise specified**.

**TL:DR** Should I pay my medical bill despite what Medicare told me?",finance
personalfinance,27 y/o making 30k a year w/ 73k in student loan debt.,"HI PF! I graduated 6 years ago and have been making minimum payments on my loans since. About 6 months ago I moved back in with my parents(the first time since high school). My car is now paid off and my only other bills are insurance, gas, food, and my phone mostly. I am hoping to change careers in the future to make more money but I don't see that happening any time soon. My loans are through navient and the highest interest rate i have is 6.5%. What are my best options for paying off this loan.

Also, I have a mutual fund, that was set up when I was a child, given to me when I moved in. It is currently worth 10k and I contribute $50 a month. My job offers a 401k plan that matches 6% and 100% vested. I'm not sure how much longer I will be there so I haven't set anything up with it. I have also heard that opening a low fee index fund with Vanguard is a good idea. Is it possible to move my mutual fund there?

personalfinance,"[Taxes]18y/o working first job at my university's campus, claimed federal tax exemption when I shouldn't have(?), and how to fix it when doing taxes?","Context: As stated in the title, I am 18 and started working at my first job in my university (a University of California) making minimum wage, starting in late September until end of 2017, paid biweekly (worked around 8-9 hours a week at minimum wage of $10.50). 

My first two paychecks were taxed before I claimed exemption. After that, I saw this button (on the website my university uses where I can see my pay details called [ayso](https://atyourserviceonline.ucop.edu/ayso/)) underneath the tax withholding section called Fed/CA Exemption. 

This is what it states:

&gt;In order to claim exemption from Federal and State tax withholding, you need to meet BOTH of the following conditions for exemption:

&gt;Last year you had a right to a refund of ALL Federal income tax withheld because you had NO tax liability.
This year you expect a refund of ALL income tax withheld because you expect to have NO tax liability.

&gt;If you are eligible to claim exemption for the following tax year, you must renew as soon as possible after January 1 of that year. Otherwise, the exemption will automatically expire in early February of that year. Please check with your Payroll office for your campus renewal deadline.

&gt;If you cannot claim exemption from BOTH Federal and State tax withholding, you need to contact your Payroll office to file your UC W-4/DE 4 form.

I clicked on the submit after scanning through it and it was like magic (yes, I did a stupid thing), my paychecks were no longer being taxed. 

I don't know what tax withholdings/allowances are, but I'm guessing its the amount I choose I can withhold from my paychecks and not be taxed?

More info on my current tax withholding situation

For Federal Tax Filing, it says:

* marital status (same thing for California State Tax filing): single

* personal allowances: exempt (guessing it says that because I clicked the button), 

* Additional Taxwithholdings if any: $0.00

For California State Tax Filing, it says:

* single, regular withholdings allowances: 0, additional withholding allowances: 0, additional tax withholding if any: 0.

More context info I don't know where else to put: I got my Form 1095-B, which is just the IRS health coverage form verifying that I am enrolled in my university's health coverage plan. It says that it gives me relevant info needed to do my tax returns (it shows my employee ID and months worked in 2017.)

.

After getting an email from my university releasing my W2 form where it says I made $1,155.01 and federal income tax withheld at $18.89 (my first two paychecks were taxed before I clicked the exempt button)

.

So here are my main questions:

**Which form(s) am I supposed to use to do taxes?** Is it the W-4, 1040EZ, or fill stuff online and have them do it for me (I don't know if this counts as advertising^removeitifitismods, but someone advised I could use TaxAct for free)?

**Am I getting the concept of ""tax withholding/allowances"" correctly?** They are the amount that is taxed from my paycheck. I get to choose what my withhold amounts are and the actual amount is what is processed during tax season. The government's withhold amount from my paycheck is an estimate, so I would get either a tax refund (if I overpaid the government) or a request to pay the government (if I underpaid the government).

**Was I supposed to be exempt? How to stop claiming exemption if I'm not supposed to claim exemption?** Is that through changing my withholdings amount? The ayso site my uni uses provides 2 links ""estimate federal tax withholding"" ""estimate CA tax withholding"" calculators.

**Most importantly, how to do taxes if I claimed exemptions incorrectly?** Would just a single 1040EZ fix it?

personalfinance,Is a 5% down payment mortgage a bad idea in my situation?,"Context: Married couple, late 20's. Incomes are roughly the same. Household income is about 100k annually. We currently save about 50% or more, although for the past few years ""save"" really means paying off student loans.

So this year all but one of our student loans will be paid off. The last one is around $10k and has a low interest rate at 4% so I've decided to slow down the payment on that loan and focus on a down payment for awhile instead. We have a mortgage right now and have lived in the house for 7 years. It is a cheap fixer-upper and we pay &lt; $400/month on it. The downside of the cheap housing costs means that I currently drive about 45 mins each way to work. Spouse just got a job close to mine, and it doesn't make sense for both of us to drive or carpool. Plus, we want to move out of the current area we live and into a nicer one.

The way I see it, interest rates are just going to go up from here. We have enough for a 5% down payment right now. We also have a one month emergency fund and around $50k in various retirement accounts. Our cash flow is high. Would it be a bad idea to try for a 5% down payment in our situation? We want to buy a new house before we sell our current one. The plan is to move into the new house and spend a month or two doing various projects to get the old house market ready. Plus it just seems way less stressful to buy a house and sell a house separately instead of trying to coordinate them at the same time. Also it's so cheap I don't see a huge deal in paying 2 mortgages at once (gas savings will offset it a bit as well).

Would a 10% down payment be significantly better? Should we just suck it up for a year or so and try for a larger down payment? Thanks in advance!",finance

That was a 9 week break period, and I've bounced around some FT positions making a little over 60k right now. I don't have any passion to have any sort of corporate career and want to retire ASAP. I've tried SO many times (hundreds) to get a Federal position but it seems impossible (known to be very hard to get fired from, very relaxed, 100k income) with the business degree that I have. 

I currently have $405,000+ saved in after-tax funds across various brokerage accounts (small amount in an IRA as well, I don't contribute to 401k since the gains are terrible).

*Income*

Salary ($2600 a month base with a possibility of $250-$350 extra in tips and bonuses. My fiance makes a once monthly bonus of anywhere between $150-$200 a month. I received tips based off of the number of hours I work a week, but they have not exceeded $100 a month in the time that I've been with Starbucks.)

Car ($293.86)
Insurance ($142.26)

Cell Phone ($30)
Loan Payment ($150)
Food ($300)
Subscriptions ($50)
Gas ($100)
Misc ($300)

~$2400

*Debts*
Collections ($195, on payment plan) ($383, dispute awaiting decision) ($363, falls off in one month)
Student Loans ($5000, in hardship forbearance with 6.2% interest; $7500 already paid down) 
Credit Cards ($2000, payments being made on time because the 25% interest rate makes me gag)
Car ($10,000)
Family Loans ($1500, flexible in time frame with small payments being made)

~$19,500


As stated above, we have about $10K left on the car, a 2010 Honda Fit. We got a decent loan rate at the time as we had no credit, but since we've started to dig our way out of the hole and are slowly rebuilding (we both finally broke 600), we're looking to refinance or sell and buy used.

In January, we had some hardship (the flu took us out of commission for almost the whole month of December) and fell behind on the car payment. We currently owe January and February, in addition to March being due sooner rather than later. The past due amount is $600-ish and with March's payment added in, we'll owe about $900. That is the only thing we are behind on currently.

We are getting a tax refund of $4455. It was my thought that we should first pay the car, then pay down all of the credit cards, leaving us about $1000. I believe that I should eliminate some of the remaining debts I have before we take our student loans out of forbearance and begin making payments again. We have a tiny savings but are in a really good position, I believe, to start building a future. My fiance and I have fought our way out of really terrible times (illness, death in the family, and my first marriage wrecking a lot), and want to get off on the right foot with the refund.

personalfinance,Citibank attempted to knock me out of my promo period,"Recently I did a balance transfer to a 0% intro APR through Citibank. Everything was great up until today.

I have setup the account to make automatic payments of an amount that would payoff the debt within the promo period. This payment was scheduled to be made on the 17th of every month (the due date). With every single month there had been a minimum payment due of around $45. However, today I noticed that my payment was not taken into account, and then I found out that my minimum payment was somehow $0.

After contacting support they mentioned that the amount would not be taken out if the minimum payment due was at $0.

Honestly, I don't know if they're trying to pull one over on me, but with a few months of not having this happen, that is exactly what it seems like. I triggered the payment manually for this month, and I will be watching next month as well. 

Just in short, it's important for everyone to be checking on payments and things like this. Ensure they go through every month so you don't have to go through any annoyances. I've got a sheet with all of my credit cards, their limits, balances, interest rates, and payment dates.

personalfinance,Should I refinance all or even part of my student loan debt?,"Thank you for taking the time to help me today, I apologize for any formatting errors since I do not post often. I am looking for advice as to whether I should refinance my student loans, either entirely or in part. 

I am an attorney at a small law firm, just my boss and myself,  making $80,000.00 per year. Other than my student loans, my only other expenses are rent (1,100.00 per month) and utilities/groceries. I share household expenses with my girlfriend, we do not have any children.  I do not have any auto payments other than insurance ($100.00 per month) and my healthcare is covered by my employer. 

My student loan debt is not insignificant. I am currently enrolled in the IDR plan and have an unpaid principal balance of $179,009.80 with an unpaid interest of $6,213.84, leaving a total unpaid balance of $185,223.64.

My student loans are divided among Graduate PLUS Loans and Stafford Loans. My Graduate PLUS IDR Monthly payments are $183.97, I actually pay $750.00. My Stafford Loan IDR Monthly payments are $109.88, I actually pay $350.00. I have taken full advantage of lowered interest rates due to auto-pay etc. 

My Graduate PLUS Loans are broken down as follows: 

* $54,613.58 at 7.650% fixed
* $38,284.61 at 7.650% fixed
* $24,006.96 @ 6.160% fixed

Graduate PLUS Total Balance: $116,905.15.

My Stafford Loans are broken down as follows: 

*  Subsidized $8,641.08 at 6.550% fixed
*  Unsubsidized $14,834.15 at 6.550% fixed
*  Subsidized $8,641.07 at 6.550% fixed 
*  Unsubsidized $14,167.35 at 6.550% fixed
*  Unsubsidized $22,034.84 at 5.160% fixed

Stafford Loan Total Balance: $68,318.49.

As you can see, my total monthly payments of $1,100.00 barely covers interest and only nominally affects the principal of my unpaid balance. I am three years into the IDR plan. I have looked at refinance options and have been given preliminary quotes from 2-4% interest rates on the entire outstanding debt. My credit rating is approximately 740. 

However, I am concerned about my job security since I am in a two person law firm. If anything happens to my boss, I will need to find other employment. I am therefore reluctant to refinance the entire debt because of the protection and forgiveness that government loans offer. 

With that said, under these circumstances, I need help deciding how to proceed because I am not sure my current trajectory is sustainable. Should I refinance my entire debt? Should I just refinance the $54k Graduate Plus loan with the 7.650% fixed interest rate? Should I consider other options?

personalfinance,"Currently trying to budget for my summer internship, first time doing any of this, need help","Hello r/PersonalFinance.

I was fortunate enough to earn an internship position this summer and I'm trying to construct a budget beforehand so I can get a feel for how much money I'll end up with.

According to my internship agreement, I'm capped at 30 hours a week, at $14/hour, with no possibility of additional hours (to avoid having to provide full time benefits. This puts me at an $840 biweekly paycheck before taxes. I'm in Michigan, so I'm using the rule of thumb that about 25% of my income will go towards state and federal taxes, and social security.

I have the option of selecting which days, and how many hours I work each day, so in the name of efficiency I'm considering working three 10s. With this arrangement, I have the possibility of taking a part time position in a restaurant the other four days, again, to maximize income. I'm only considering restaurant jobs closer to the hostel though, so the cost of gas goes down significantly.

With taxes taken into account, that gives me a take-home of $630 biweekly, or $1260 a month, for three months. I'm looking at a student-hostel about 20 miles from the internship, which costs ~$560 a month, with rent and utilities included.

I expect to use about $10 each day I work on gas. Food, I don't know, maybe $10 a day if I eat cheap (Rice/beans/lentils/eggs).

My recurring costs add up to $23 a month, so that's pretty minimal.

Considering these numbers, I end of with a maximum take-home of $1,525 over the course of the summer. I would expect this to end up being much lower, as that's assuming I don't deviate from this budget at all.

Looking at this is really discouraging because I worked my ass off for this internship and will end up making significantly less money now than I would if I worked somewhere near my parents' house. I realize the experience is necessary for engineering, but still.

What else should I consider?

personalfinance,27 - Need Help &amp; Advice - Struggling to stay afloat &amp; save,"Hello everyone and anyone, 

I desperately need help and/or advice and have lurked on here for a while using my main account (this is a throwaway that I'm using to ask questions and right now these issues are my most pressing and my 1st post) but have seen so much varying info and details on every subject that I can keep it all straight.  
I figured making a post and having a conversation about it would be more beneficial since everyone has a unique scenario going on with life.  

Some background and info - 

27 - age
Live in PA (Eastern PA, Philly area)
$46,435 - salary (per 2017 info) - not sure the exact pay for 2018 as the tax plan passed and I do get an extra $110 a month now which started last paycheck but it doesn't make a difference. 

$9000 - total Wells Fargo credit card debt (1 card, credit limit $9500)
Interest Rate on Purchases keeps changing, it's now 18.24%, was previously 17.99%, while the Annual APR is 24.99%.
Debt rose sharply because of bad winter a few years back and paying for car repairs and new tires and using CC to pay for rent, and having difficultly paying it down.   
But I can't see or access the statements from that time period.

$500-600 - split among 2 Wells Fargo account - 
want to combine them but WF in the past said no cuz one account is an original one I had since Wachovia existed but the newer one I think has a better interest rate.  

$2722 - total pay in a month (as of 02/2018)
FICO Credit Score (according to Wells Fargo) - 731

Bills (monthly) - 
$100-120 -- gas for car per month
$140 - cable/internet (comcast only option, live in apartment)
$1080 - rent (might rise to $1350 very,very soon.) 
$60-75 -- power bill (sometimes as high as 150-200 in bad summers)
$220-250 - minimum credit card payment (Per WF statements, paying $325 would pay it off in 3 years, minimum payment would take 27 years) 
$120 - minimum ring payment ($460 left to go) Engagement ring for Fiancee' 
$240 - blue apron (we use this as we need to learn to cook and it saved us money on groceries)
$100-200 -- groceries (includes basic necessities not just food, usually averages $150 or less)

Random payments (monthly or every now and then) -

$1850 - Health Insurance deductible
$370 - car insurance (each June and December)
$300 &amp; 275 - Rx Meds (had to leave the $275 med behind)
$16 - spotify
$11 - netflix
$60 - Playstation + (every March)
$100 - amazon prime (every August)
$108 - doc visits (was told I wouldn't need to pay co-pays by the office but now have received a bill for it)
$30.50 - need to renew PA drivers license for 4 years.
$40-50 - engagement ring insurance that I still need to get

Other things needed - 
To split from family phone plan and get my own w/a new phone as mine is too old and cannot be updated so I can't use certain apps needed for work. 
Still need to see a dentist about a chipped tooth and the fact that I need 3-4 crowns (due to a former dentist and his fuck-ups which my family ended up not suing for because we all hated him so much and just wanted out).   
That would run about $3000+ for all the crowns at least, probably higher due to deductible and cavities, cleanings etc.
My car needs 2 new back tires, rear brake pads, drums, and shoes before inspection due in March which regardless of pass or fail still costs money.    Quoted out previously would run about $600-800 depending on specials, coupons, etc.
This doesn't include the paint it needs too since there was a paint recall on my car but I never got the notice because it was around when we moved, and I got a quote on that and it's high of course but I won't bother with it. 

I would go to family for help, but my family is the type to hold things over my head and is pretty two-faced. 
They would cause more stress and problems especially since they'd want the money paid back.
Plus, I have never asked them for money and I don't ever plan to. 
Fiancee's contract job shafted her and she's been fighting them over the lack of work so her income is 0. 
Plus, she's only got a few hundred dollars and I tell her to save it just in case.  
We want to plan out our wedding but due to money concerns we may never have one and just do the paperwork and call it a day.

Apologies for the long post and there's definitely more info I can add. 
There are things I'm trying to cut and change but it seems like once one thing changes another takes it's place in a worse fashion.  
I have thought of going to Wells Fargo to talk to them about options but I don't want to resort to a loan or transfer balance card because I still wouldn't be able to pay it off based on their time periods.  
A lot of things are changing which affects a lot of this stuff and I feel like I'm losing my mind.  

Any info, help, advice anyone can provide is much appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,[Debt] Seeking opinions about the smartest option for pay-downs,"My minimum monthly bills equate to $1713.
I have a car loan amounting to $13,700 at a 2.95% interest rate.
I have 4 student loans:

* $13,770 @ 3.875%
* $12,845 @ 5.31%
* $8,255 @ 5.31%
* $7,861 @ 6%

I currently have $950 in savings, with my #1 goal being to get that to $5,140 to cover 3 months living expenses in case of emergency. 

My question for you all is, in your opinion, should my second goal be to practice the snowball tactic and get rid of those smaller student loans with the 6% and 5.31% rates?

personalfinance,Tax questions,"So I last year, I was working two jobs, one 1099 and one w2. I had the w2 job first so when I got the 1099 one, I upped my federal withholding to compensate. However, at tax time I discovered my W-2 employer hadn't been withholding federal income tax, so even with the higher withholding, I would still owe several thousand. The company accountant offered to do my taxes that year and asked that I send him my mileage from the 1099 job (I had to drive about 100 miles per week).

I sent all the documents to him in March. I came to find out in September after I haven't received anything from the IRS he hasn't filed them yet. I've been hounding him to no avail since.

So now I have a few questions about this year. Obviously I still need to file. Can I claim my (now former) employer didn't withhold and have them front the bill? What kind of penalties should I expect for non filing last year? Can I claim my tax guy as delinquent? I expect some of this falls on me, I just don't want to take on more responsibility for this than I legally have to as the company kind of screwed me on my way out (story for another time). I think I know what I need to do, but I want to make sure I'm not overlooking something.

personalfinance,"Finally debt free...but low income, low savings, high COL and still feel like I’m behind. What do I do next?","I just made my last loan payment today (yay) and now have officially paid off about 60k of high interest student loans (6-13% federal and private). I graduated 2 months ago and started paying of my debt (and not accruing more) my sophomore  year. I realized I only had classes twice a week and was able to hold 3 jobs and threw all of it into the loans. Debt scares me more than anything (because at least with low income you can move to a low COL area, but debt follows you everywhere D:).

Now I have negligible CC debt that’s paid off monthly and my living expenses.

Monthly income: about $2,500 net (main job) + 800 net (side job). Total of 3,200 net.

**Total expenses (that no matter what I can’t change for now): 2,700 before food + household supplies**.  I can decrease my rent by $900 in June when lease is up (right now paying $2,400 in rent and the lowest available is $1,500 even with roommates). My rent is very high because initially I was splitting it with my s/o but we broke up and he is no longer paying. He was a legal roommate on the lease not tenant so I’m screwed on that front. I’m planning to take him to small claims but that’s a different story. For now I’m stuck with the rent. 

Assuming 400/month on food &amp; household needs, that leaves me with $100/month.

Savings: $9,500 (I would ideally want it to be 15). 

I’m 22 and just began a job in my field (20/hour gross). It’s low but it leads to a far larger career. Currently, I cannot find a higher paying job without at least a year in this position. I also babysit for an additional 800/month. Ironically I used to make more money during college (serving, bar tending) than I am now. I’m trying to find a weekend / weekday evening serving job again and have gone on many interviews but scheduling is difficult since my availability is far more limited now than it was in college. Weekdays the earliest I could start is 6:30 (my job is 10-6) and weekends are generally for senior servers. I have a different interview tomorrow which will hopefully work out and bump up my income but for now, I am left with $100 at the end of the month until my lease ends is up in June.

Is there anything more I should doing that I’m unaware of? Right now I’m working on building my savings until 15k, should that be my only priority? If I’m able to get a job and add another 500-600 / month, where should that money go? I don’t currently have retirement (employer doesn’t offer it) or healthcare (won’t pay penalty, claiming it’s too expensive and will qualify with employer in a couple months) so should I start contributing to retirement or investing? 

Any advice appreciated. Thank you.

personalfinance,Am I better saving and paying off a lump sum or overpaying on my mortgage?,"Hi everyone

So I’m about to take out a £50,000 mortgage for a £90,000 property. The other £40000- £10,000 is being gifted to me out of what would have been money left in my grandfather’s will (but he’s agreed to release it early) and the £30,000 will be an investment from my dad in return for 30% ownership of my property. The reason we’ve done it this way rather than having a higher LTV ratio with only the 10k deposit is that I cannot get a larger mortgage than 50k due to my current income. I’m receiving another £5000 gifted for legal costs etc. And whatever is leftover after that to go towards furniture and appliances. 

For a 30 year term, my mortgage repayments will be around £200 a month for the first two years and then £280 based on current interest rates for the remaining 28 years. For context, I’m 21 and have 1 year left of university before I graduate. I currently work part time and study part time, and am spending £250 per month on rent at the moment. I don’t have any debts except ~£1500 to pay off on my phone/iPad, but this is on 0% APR credit. I currently earn £11,950 a year. Also, I’m obviously in the U.K. so whilst I have student loans they aren’t of immediate importance as I don’t need to start paying them back until I earn over 21k, and at that point it would only be ~£10 a month anyway.

The property is a two bed and I’m planning on renting out the other room for ~£250 per month. This would cover the mortgage repayments. My question is, am I better to save my contribution of £250 per month ‘rent’ or to overpay on my mortgage repayments?

The latter seems more sensible. However, I don’t earn much at the moment and I don’t have any savings, I think saving for an emergency fund might be a good idea, especially once I’m a homeowner in case of repairs etc. Obviously my monthly mortgage repayments are relatively low. However I don’t want to overstretch myself financially in the next year before I graduate, so it seems to make sense to me to still budget for it but to save my extra ‘£250 rent’ in an accessible savings account, in case of emergencies. Once I graduate I’ll be looking at around £20k as a starting salary, depending on what job I get. Once I’m earning more it seems that making higher payments would make sense, as I could do that as well as saving, and I’d only be leaving it around a year and a half before I started overpaying.

The other issue would be that eventually it would be preferred to buy my father out of his share, to give me more equity and potentially in the more long term future if I moved, to enable me to rent out the house whilst getting a new mortgage on a new house. Also, he is currently 54 but once he reaches retirement he may require the funds. 

Just wondering if anyone had any wisdom on this?",finance
personalfinance,Disputing my medical debt accounts that went into collections...

Parents would send me monthly the amount they currently pay to FedLoan, with me paying the remainder of the monthly payment.

Figure it will save 6 or 7 thousand in interest to cost me $100 a month. I figure I can also refinance it again in two years to a 5 year repayment, thus cutting another year off.

Not sure if the ~$1.2k in repairs is worth it when I know there are other issues. I live across the street from my campus and don't really need a car until this summer.

I will be moving my savings/checkings (Capitol Federal and Bank of America) into a CU I found that has a lot of affiliated branches in my future city (Kansas City, KS), with a 1.65% APY.

I would like to put as much of it into savings as possible. My company will also match 3% into retirement, I gathered going with a Roth IRA?

My first line of business is to either fix my old car or buy a newer (used) car. My friend may be selling her 2001 Honda Civic with 120k miles, so that may be an option as well. Then, save as much as I can. Fortunately, I have been back and forth with having money in my bank so I know the lifestyle of not-spending, eating canned peas, and not going out that much. (Not that I will still have to do that in future, but I don't see me going crazy with my new income either).

If there is any advice on how to go about saving money better than the Credit Union's 1.65% and a retirement fund, please let me know. I subscribed and have started to read into r/investing, but it's a bit overwhelming.

I feel like I am going into a pretty good situation, I just want to make sure I make the most of it while I'm young. Thanks!",finance

CryptoCurrency,A Merchant´s View on Accepting Cryptocurrency,"Hey fellas. Just want to vent for a bit.

I have been a retailer for all my grown life. Started selling pirated burned CDs in my university, in Venezuela, around 2002. That was my first business. After that, I had a small chicha cart (a local beverage), and later on I opened my first retail store.

That was before the Venezuela´s currency exchange controls were tightened, and I started importing clothes from China and overstock from USA. Then, things got complicated. It became impossible to change your Bolivares to hard currency at the government rates, but there were alternative ways. I ended up opening a bank account in the US, and buying USD in the ""Permuta"" grey market, which was basically a bond swap, you bought them in bolivares and the broker sold it in the US, and you got your USD without issue. Still was an escape valve for the forex control. But then the government also banned that,

Now there was only the black market. And a black market, with low supply and working in the shadows, where the price is determined in the few exchanges that still take Bolívares in the Colombian border town of Cúcuta, is a recipe for disaster.

I kept doing business like that. Ended up leaving Venezuela a couple years ago, setting up a shop in the Caribbean. 

Local banks in the island I live in have many limitations. Still to this date I don´t have a credit card, a lot of requirements for Venezuelans here. 

My US account was closed because they flagged a wire transfer I made to China as unusual, and asked me to go to the bank´s offices. And in this island there is no branch. So they closed that account.

My experience with banks has been plain torture.  I am fed up with the banking system. After I started a line of sunglasses for my brick and mortar store, selling online got into my head. 

But given my experience with banks, I took a drastic decision: I would give up around 99% of my potential market, and refuse taking credit cards, and just accept crypto. Just started a couple of weeks ago.

So far the experience has been great, reception has been encouraging and the community has been nothing but supportive. Right now I am accepting Bitcoin Cash, Ether and Nano.

Maybe later in another post, I might explain why I picked those cryptos to start, the payment gateways and the process of setting everything up.

personalfinance,"(Taxes) How to go about moving to a new state so-as to avoid pesky ""state income tax""?","Colorado here, here is my scenario:

I currently have a lawsuit going in the federal courts (was also originally filed in Colorado), according to my attorney the lawsuit will likely settle soon with the way case is going (in our favor), we believe it will settle within the next 6 months.

I am aware that Colorado has this pesky ""state income tax"" that I would like to avoid if at all possible. The idea I had in mind was: in the next few months, pre-emptively move to a nearby state with no/0% state income tax such as Wyoming, Nevada, or Texas... and then when the lawsuit finally settles and I am paid I'll only have to pay federal taxes as I now ""reside"" in a 0% tax state - thus saving myself the 4.5-5% I would lose for nothing to the state of Colorado. As an added bonus, I've grown tired of Colorado and don't like it here anyways; this place is DONE FOR with all the weed smokers/out-of-towners having made it unliveable and too frickin' expensive.

I'm expecting a decent chunk of money, anywhere from $70k-$160k (we don't know yet), so 4.5-5% state income tax could be a sizeable tax bill just from Colorado taxes alone.

My rationale is as follows: if I'm going to lose 4.5-5% of my money to state taxes ""anyway"" I would be better off instead just using that money to cover my moving costs to a new state and a fresh start.

For example, let's say it settles for $100k, Colorado taxes on that would be roughly $5k... so why not just ""avoid"" that and ""advance"" myself that same $5k from my savings to cover an apartment deposit in a new city, gas to get there, etc? I'm trying to think ahead here...

Could someone knowledgeable in taxes please clarify this hypothetical scenario for me?

Monster Hunter World: I'm just not a Monster Hunter man. It's not fun to me getting stun locked to death by Monsters or facing against flying monsters but you can't actually hit them because you are using a melee weapon. 


I'm going to listen some of the multiplayer games I have played in no particular order:


Castlevania Harmony of Despair (This game holds a very special place in my heart. I used to love grinding away on chapter 7 for Miser Rings or chapter 10 for the gear that dropped there)


Halo 3 (Infection was my jam. I used to love playing stuff like Close the Door, Raccoon City, and many others that I can't remember)


CoD (I have a love hate relationship with CoD. It's too damn expensive for how much of the same thing they keep releasing. That being said MW2 was my favorite because everything was viable and very rarely did any gun outshine the others)


League of Legends (I love the premise of this game. That being said, I'm pretty bad at it and also the community drives me up the fucking wall. I used to have a thick layer of skin to deal with people but something happened and I just can't deal anymore)


RB6 Siege &amp; CS:GO (I list these both together because they basically fall under the same category when it comes to me. I really enjoy the premise of both of these games but I am god awful at them. I played a Shadow Run game on 360 that had a purchasing system similar to that of CS:GO and also really enjoyed that)


Terraria (Have over 500 hours in it but most of that is actually single player)


Starbound (Did not enjoy this game near as much as Terraria. Did a coop playthrough with my friend and the game just felt very tedious)


Halo Wars (I really enjoyed the original Halo Wars because it was very lax for a RTS game. I have tried Starcraft 2 and I just can't)


Speedrunners (I enjoy the silliness of this game)


Divinity Original Sin 2 (Really enjoyed this game once I convinced my friend to buy it and play it with me. Unfortunately he lost our 40 or 50 hour save file and I haven't been able to get back into it since)


Phantasy Star Universe (Grinded the hell out of White Beast and some MAG as well. Also did the Vivienne mission a lot as well)


Dark Eden (Really enjoyed playing Vampire back in the day but never really got into the end game, barely got into the mid game lol)


Final Fantasy 14 (As far as MMOs goes I really enjoy this one but idk too grindy and boring for my taste which is weird cause I liked grinding in CV:HD)


Borderlands series (Bullet sponge robots aren't fun) * L4D2 (Zombies are fun with friends but only with friends. FeelsLonelyMan)


Destiny (I refuse to pay this much ever again for a game that feels mildly complete)

Long-time reader, first-time poster. My wife and I currently live in the San Francisco Bay Area, and we're both working professionals. We've been in school/training for most of our lives, and from around mid-2015 to present day we've began making a steady income and saving money. As most of you know, the housing market here is absolutely insane...median home prices are breaking $1.5 mil, and any house you see goes for $300-600k over asking.

We currently have a good amount saved up, and if we wanted to, we could probably empty everything we have and buy a home. Our mortgage would probably be 2.5x-3x what we're currently paying in rent, not including maintenance/repairs/upkeep that we currently don't have to worry about as renters. However, we've started looking at other avenues of spending our money that might be more ""useful"" long-term.

For example, my wife has $150k+ in student loans at 6.8% interest rate. In addition to our savings, we have a 6 month emergency fund, and we already max out our contributions to our employer-sponsored retirement accounts and a SEP-IRA. Given the high % interest rate of the loans, are we better off dumping a bunch of our savings into paying down the student loans, basically ""guaranteeing"" a 6.8% return on our investment? Or should we look towards investing the $ elsewhere? We've all but given up saving money for a home in this market.

**About Me**
I'm 20 years old in my 3rd year of college working on a bachelor of computer science. I'm technically an intern, however, I've been working there throughout my 3 years of college, and have a job offer waiting when I graduate. My internship pays me around $1,500/mo during the school year, and $4,000/mo during the summer because I work more hours. My credit score is 700, and I'll graduate with about $42,000 in student loans. The starting rate for my job when I graduate is $70,000 if that makes any difference.

Currently looking at a 2008 Nissan 350z for $14,000.
Not married to it but I'd like to stay around the $15,000 range.
*Suggestions Welcome!!*

My parents are basically telling me to get the cheapest thing that runs and pay down student loans faster. Is it crazy for me at my age to be considering something in this range? I realize that I could be doing more with my money, but I feel like I'm finally in a place in my life where I'm *somewhat* independent from my parents, making my own money for once, with very few responsibilities. A car like this would be impractical If I say had a family or a mortgage, but being in my situation, in my mind make the car seem less impractical.

Also having never bought a car, I'm unfamiliar with whats typical for like down payment, interest rate, monthly payment, etc.

We purchased our first house last August but the interest rate that we paid on it last year didn't really seem to amount to anything.

If I could get a tiny bump by adding the allowance that'd help me with some of the new expenses we have, but if PF thinks I shouldn't need to do so I can still manage the finance relatively comfortably, though I will need to budget a bit better.

To list an item on Sesame, sellers need to make the information available through IPFS and reference the item on the Ethereum blockchain, giving it tags to make it discoverable.

As such, listing an item, searching for an item and paying for it are all decentralized, auditable and trasparent.

We currently have an almost finalized MVP on the Ropsten testnet which we will release in a few weeks and we would be eager to hear your opinions and suggestions, so, if you'd like to get in touch and try Sesame, here's our Telegram group: https://t.me/joinchat/CShSohL6tMWyzbhBZyxRlQ .

We do not want to raise capital through ICOs or embed a token in the Sesame ecosystem, as that would add friction and confusion for users. We are planning, for example, auction-based premium listings.

More importantly, we do not want to impose fees on top of those of the Ethereum network, as such, Sesame will be free to use for all.

What we would like to do, instead, is to cooperate with stable-coin projects to incorporate them in Sesame, allowing people to swiftly use them.

Is it best to invest higher amounts later (i.e. $2.5k after 18 months) or lower amounts sooner (i.e. $1k to investments, $1k to loans). The average interest rate on the student loans is 4.25% fixed rate.

How can she reclaim these, if at all?","TL;DR: My grandmother and I found a securities receipt in a box of old papers, which says she bought 500 shares (at $1 each) of 'Eastern Empire Corporation Stock' in October of 1966. She is curious to know how/if she can reclaim/sell this stock for money. If so, how?

__________

This is my first time posting in personal finance, so I apologize if this is the wrong sub for this post.

Anyway, I was over my grandmother's house visiting during this past weekend. We got to talking about how I just recently picked up day-trading as a hobby to make some extra cash. Making small talk, I asked her if she has every bought stock (wholly expecting her to say 'no'). Surprisingly, she tells me that in the mid-1960's her brother told her about this startup insurance company that was 'going to make it big'. *Eye Roll.* Long story short, she ended up buying 500 shares from this company called Eastern Empire Corporation.  She bought 500 shares at $1 per share (i.e., a $500 investment). Upon purchase, she received a securities receipt that says her Certificate Number and the Description of the stock purchased (that is the paper we found).

Along with the Securities Receipt, there was a letter from the company (on official company letterhead) that notes her address change, since she moved in 1973.  This letter merely acknowledges that the company got her notification that she moved and that the company was storing her new address on file.

My grandmother told me that she always got letters from the company notifying her of changes to the directors, status of the company, etc. However, these letters stopped sometime in the mid-1970's.

A preliminary search revealed that the company is still in business with Entity Number 104515. They have three officers (Pres., V.P., and Treasurer) and that they had a lawsuit filed against them in 1975 for various violations of the federal securities laws. Turns out the lawsuit was dismissed (i.e., the company won).

I am not very knowledgeable about redeeming stocks and securities, as I am a fairly green investor and new to the whole 'trading world'. My grandmother wants to 'cash out' so to speak and get rid of these 500 shares since my grandparents are both in their 90s. After doing some basic research to make sure the company is still active, I don't know what to do next. I want to help out my grandmother, but I am not a stock/securities expert. What should be my next steps?

Additional Information: 

-We live in Lansdale, Pennsylvania (USA). 

-The 1973 company letter head provides the following information: Eastern Empire Corporation, BOX 491, Camp Hill, PA, 17011, (717)-761-5684. 

-The 1966 comapny securities receipt provides the following information: Eastern Empire Corporation, 2101 North Front Street, BOX 3782, Harrisburg, PA, 17105.

-Looks as if all the officers live in Lansdale, PA (USA) as well.

personalfinance,Student Loan Consolidation - good idea?,"Hi PF.  I'm hoping that I can ask for your advice in regards to whether I should consolidate my current federal student loans and, if so, with whom.  

I'm currently paying off a set of three loans through Nelnet with a total balance of approx $38k.  It is on an **Extended Graduated Repayment plan** and is set to increase monthly over the next few years.  By the time I'm done with them, I'll be paying over three times in a month ($446) what I'm paying now ($182).  

(For those going bug-eyed, I'm stuck with this graduated payment because, admittedly, I done goofed bad and missed the first few months of the loan payment.  My fault entirely and I've owned up to it, but this was the only way out of being placed into collections or defaulting.)

Each group of loans has a separate interest rate.  The smallest, which is about $3200, is at 3.4%.  The next highest, $10100, is at 3.86%.  The largest monster, at $24700, is at a whopping 6.8%.  

So help me, PF.  I'm thinking it's a no-brainer to consolidate with a locked in interest rate to spare myself from gigantic payments to a whole bunch of interest down the line, but I'm not sure what a good interest rate is to shoot for, nor who I should try applying through (reliability, not prone to screwing you over, etc).  Any and all advice is greatly welcomed.  

Thank you in advance!

ETA:  This EGR plan (aka the late payments) began approximately between Oct 2015 and Mar 2016 with the plan starting in May of 2016.  The first 24 payments at the lowest rate ends in a few months (May), so I'd like to try and nip this in the bud before it gets uglier.",finance

personalfinance,"Question about IPERS, pensions as a whole, and how budget for and prepare for the worst","I am going to say in advance that this post is somewhat long. The questions that I have are listed at the bottom, but some of them rely on you having knowledge of what I’ve written here. Thanks!
_____________

I am a public employee in the state of Iowa. I currently pay into the Iowa Public Employees Retirement System, or IPERS. At this time, IPERS is highly-regarded by public employees (to my knowledge), and the anecdotal evidence that I have about IPERS from people I’ve spoken to is generally positive.

BUT, I am turning more and more into someone who tries to always prepare for the worst, so, I am less than convinced that IPERS alone will be sufficient for my needs after retirement. I am posting this in an attempt to open up discussion about how to prepare for IPERS (or any pension plan) not living up to the expectations placed on it.

My situation: I currently make just over 40k after taxes. If you include my IPERS payments each month, I made just under 44k. My before tax pay is just about 55k right now. I am a young professional, am unmarried, have no children, currently rent an apartment, and in general live below my means; however, I do have some CC debt (~6k), and have quite a bit of student loan debt (~7k state loans, ~56k federal loans). I have recently paid off my car (woo!), and have about 1 months of expenses in savings as an extremely limited emergency fund.

*As a note regarding my federal student loan debt: I currently qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program through the federal government. I am on an Income-Based Repayment plan for my federal loans, and after 10 years of payments, my remaining balance will be forgiven (up to a certain amount). This forgiveness is not considered income, so is not taxed. This is all assuming that this plan does not disappear.

I have done some planning and prioritizing, and have set my financial goals for the next couple of years. These goals are: (1) pay off my CC debt, (2) establish an emergency fund, (3) begin saving for a down payment on a house, and (4) begin investing regularly.

Here is a breakdown of my monthly budget (giving percentages of monthly income):

Rent: 23.29% Insurance: 3.07% Utilities: 5.75% Phone: 3.29% Gas: 2.74% Debts/Loans: 9.32% Food: 9.32% Entertainment: 12.33% IPERS: 7.54%

*At this point, I have shown roughly 77.19% of my income. Note that this does not include my employer contribution to IPERS.

In the short term, the remaining 22.8% of my income is going toward (1) paying off CC debt, and (2) paying into an emergency fund. Once those have been set, however, I am a bit at a loss. I have looked at the suggestions give by this subreddit, but I am unsure as to whether the guidance relating to 401k accounts generalizes to pensions (hence the post).

I have recently (in the last 2 months) opened accounts with Betterment and Robinhood. I currently have a Roth IRA set up through Betterment, but I do not contribute regularly. In my account with Robinhood, I do own stock in a number of companies; however, my investments as a whole across both my Roth IRA and the Robinhood account amount to less than 500 dollars at this point.

My thoughts for the rest of my money (after I have an emergency fund and my CC debt down) are this:

Roth IRA: 7.46% General Save/Invest: 15.35%
__________

Up to this point, all percentages given up are post-tax. For pre-tax percentages of retirement and savings, see here:

IPERS (my contribution): 6.33% Roth IRA: 6.25% General Save/Invest: 12.87% IPERS Employer: 9.49%
____________

So, if I follow this plan, I will be contributing 12.87% of my pre-tax income to retirement through both IPERS and my Roth IRA. If you consider both my and my employer’s contributions to IPERS (15.82%), then my total retirement savings pre-tax jumps to 22.08%.

The remaining 12.87% of pre-tax income goes to general savings and investments. This money would be where I save for things I want, like: a new car when I need it, vacations, down payment on a house, wedding (whenever that happens), etc. This is also where small-ish unexpected expenses/incidentals would be covered each month (i.e. trips to the vet, doctors appointments, unbudgeted expenses, etc.).
__________

I’m sorry for the long post so far. This is the question part.

Is this a good plan? Am I contributing enough to my Roth IRA? Or should I act like the IPERS doesn’t exist, and contribute a full 15-20% or my pre-tax income to my IRA? Are there things I haven’t considered that I should be?

Any additional guidance beyond these questions would also be appreciated.

Thank you for reading and answering if you do!

personalfinance,Scary scam phone call from person pretending to be from FBI?,"I got a phone call today from a spoofed number (real police department number) pretending to be from the police department. He said some irs is checking my older tax return and found some improper tax reporting of my scholarship. They were gonna put out a warrant to arrest me and he was going to help me by putting me through some process.  Halfway through the call I got suspicious and mentioned I should probably get a lawyer, and he hanged up.
I called the number back, and it was indeed the police department. He immediately said it’s a scam and it’s been happening a lot. He ensures I will get something in the mail if I actually have problems with the irs and calmed me down. So it turned out ok.

My concern was that the scammer was actually able to gave the name of my university and the exact scholarship amount(they were from 6-7 years ago). And he somehow also had the idea that I might have reported it incorrect?(I don’t think so but I wasn’t sure) how did he get that information and how should I protect myself in the future preventing situations like this?",finance
personalfinance,Is there a potential way of paying loans that is better than Snowball or Avalanche?,"PF advocates for the Avalanche and (sometimes) Snowball methods, are these really the only 2 good options? As far as pure efficiency is concerned, shouldn't you pay the loan that has the highest monthly accrual in interest first? Not just the loan with the highest interest rate? As a general rule of thumb, high interest rate = higher interest, but that's not always the case. Let me make an example...

* Loan A has a Principal balance of $2,000 at 5% annual interest
* Loan B has a Principal balance of $6,000 at 4% annual interest

Both the Avalanche and Snowball methods would recommend paying off Loan A first, however using a simple monthly interest formula (Principal * Interest / 12), shows that Loan B will accrue almost 2.5 times as much interest every month as Loan A (Loan B accrues $20/Month in interest, while Loan A only accrues $8.33).

The true hidden enemy of a loan (aside from the loan itself, of course) is not a high interest rate, but the accruing interest itself. If efficiency in loan payments is about focusing on decreasing your interest, shouldn't that mean in cases like this, neither the Snowball or Avalanche methods are correct? Please let me know if I've missed something or have done some math incorrectly somewhere.",finance

personalfinance,Lifetime Learning Tax Credit - Laptop eligible for online classes?,"Hi all,

In the coming fall I will be starting online classes to get my Masters'. I know that the Lifetime Learning Credit only covers things that are *REQUIRED* for admission or participation in a program, so normally a laptop would probably not qualify as you could use a library or computer lab on campus when needed.

However, with this being an online program, I have to be able to access it via a computer, and since there are proctored exams, I need my own private computer that I can use in a private area, so using a computer at the library won't cut it in this case. A computer isn't written in the requirements to participate in the program, but I believe that it's pretty apparent that a computer is necessary in this case. I do own a computer that fits the bill, but it is a desktop and I'd prefer to have a laptop (the laptop I have is a Chromebook and won't run the requisite software). Not to mention, I really don't want their exam proctoring software on my main desktop; it is, as far as I'm concerned, glorified spyware as it requires access to share your screen and access your webcam and microphone.

So my question is, would a laptop be an eligible expense in this case? Would my already owning a suitable desktop disqualify the purchase? And, if I claimed the laptop under this credit, is it similar to writing off a business expense in that the laptop cannot ever be used for any non-education related purpose, or are they a bit more lenient on the education credits?

Thanks, all!

*EDIT*: so I think I remember hearing that you can only credit equipment and supplies via the Lifetime Learning Credit if they are required to be purchased FROM the school itself. If that is the case, would it be an option to open a 529 plan, fund it with enough to pay for the laptop, and use that to buy it? (Ohio, to my knowledge, allows you to deduct 529 contributions from your state taxes, so while I would get no break on my federal tax due to the money not having time to grow, I'd save some on my state tax just from contributing)",finance

personalfinance,(CAN) looking at re financing Auto Loan,"i'm sorry for the long block of words, hoping you smart people can give me some insight. 

i'm a 27 year old male that made a bunch of wrong choices in my early 20's and am trying to clear everything up. a little over a year ago my familys car broke down and it was costing a lot to fix it we got to a point where it was cheaper(or so we thought) to look for a new car. As I had no extra funds at the time we ended up having to fiancé a car the terms we took was a three year loan of 13000 at 29.5% interest with bi weekly payments of 228 at this time my credit score was 375. 

Over the past year I have made each payment on time paying back a little over $4000 but still owing 9k on the car.  I have also started paying back my 8k worth of cellphone payments and loans that I never payed back with a debt repayment program. I have managed to get my credit score up to 572 and am getting my life slowly back on track 

I went in to re finance the car but was told that I owed to much money for them to do it. they however had a approval of 15.9% if I wanted to trade in and get a new car. I feel as if I am almost at the point where the ball is in my corner and I have the power to demend what I want but I'm not there yet. 

I have sat down with my wife and we came up with a budget and determined what we can afford and cannot afford my payment to my old debt is 225 every month to have it paid off in two years. 

we have said 230 bi weekly is our max for a car payment bi weekly but we want lower payments as we have a newborn on the way and need to budget stuff for him.  I really feel as if staying with the super high interest is not in my best interest moving forward but if I trade in my car to get a better interest rate I will have to eat 4k worth of loan onto the new loan. 

should I push other deal ships and try to get even lower interest rates? and try to get away from the loan sharks so to speak? is my credit even at a place where going to a dealer is a option?",finance

personalfinance,Opposite Refinance,"Just curious if anyone knows if there is a way to take advantage of a low fixed rate long term mortgage when rates rise.  For example is there a way for me to lower the balance on my loan in exchange for the new higher rate?   

For anyone unfamiliar with my thinking: the value of a bond increases or decreases inversely with interest rates. A mortgage is essentially a bond I issue to the bank with my property as collateral, which I have the option of calling (in the case of a mortgage this is refinancing). Given rising interest rates I wasn’t wondering if I can offer a lower payoff, or if I could decrease the value of the loan with the new higher rates? 

I’m familiar with the calculations of when this makes sense and the values that need to be hit, I’m just not sure if this is possible with a mortgage?

personalfinance,Questions about a SIMPLE IRA,"First time poster here, could really use some advice.  
Let me preface by saying that I’m 30 y.o. and have not been a very good financial planner my whole life.  I never made that much money, and I always spent what I made.  Down to 0.  Now, I am trying to be more responsible about my money, and make a budget, make monthly deposits into accounts for the future, etc.  These are all things I never even considered doing before.  
So.  I just started (3 weeks ago) a new position at a small organization that offer a SIMPLE IRA with 3% match.  I’m planning on sticking with them for a while (hopefully a few years).  We are a tiny little non-profit, and my current salary is only 30k (pre-tax)... I have no investments, and my only understanding of savings accounts is the one I created with my bank that offers a 1.35% interest rate, and that account is more for short term goals (like saving for a trip somewhere). I think it’s what people refer to as a “flex-savings”? 
Anyway, I have never had a “retirement savings account” and don’t know if the SIMPLE IRA is something I should do.  I researched it, and it seems like my employer will match 3% of my salary (which would be like $900).  From what I understand, if I sparse out contributions over 12 months to be $900, I’m maximizing the benefit of my SIMPLE IRA.  But what I’m unclear about is “using the money” part of the equation.  I know that I can’t touch the funds for 2 years, but then even after 2 years, I still need to give some percentage somewhere because I’m under 59 1/2 years old, right? And what tax do I need to pay? This part (the distribution) is what I’m confused about.   Let’s say in 3 years I decide to leave this organization, and there is 5400 in the SIMPLE IRA.  And I want to use the funds.  What would the breakdown of fees, taxes, etc. be?  i.e. what would I end up with in my pocket, after all is said and done? 
Again, I’m new to this whole “be financially responsible” thing, so I apologize in advance for my ignorance… but that’s why I’m here also, asking these questions…  Any help is appreciated and thank you!",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage / Line of Credit Options [CAN],"**tl;dr:** 

1. Line of Credit, Mortgage, or blend of the two? 
7. 41 year old divorced Canadian  
2. Shared custody kids.
2. 600k worth of house, no savings.   I have life and critical illness insurance. 
3. 370k in outstanding mortgages and line of credit (LOC)
4. 625 credit score, 925 bankruptcy index

**Long version:**
I got divorced in 2013 and lost 90% of my savings although I did manage to keep the house.  Then I got laid off at work, failed at my own business, then had major employment problems, and so my financial situation devolved into ""dumpster fire"".  (score was 430)  All retirement savings and emergency funds were used.  Due to shared custody, moving was never an option (and is still not realistic.)

Work was finally found, but only paying just enough to get by.  I was able to get a last-ditch home equity loan about a year ago, paid off my cards, family, and get into the ""treading water"" stage.  Turns out my score as of today is up to 624! (Equifax 2-point check)  Not bad! 

I saw a loan officer at a credit union today.  My 1st and 2nd mortgage terms end in a few months, and I'd like to get all my pickles into one jar.  It turns out I have a few options available to me.  The first is a line of credit that is up to 65% of the value of the home.  The house is worth at least 600k, so I can get around 400k in LOC, cutting my payments from a little north of $2000 a month (1st mortgage, 2nd mortgage, and LOC) into about $1400 in interest (when the LOC is maxed out) plus whatever principal I add at any time.  Sadly, the 2.86% rate that I did have on my first mortgage will not be available ever again.  I'm looking at about 4.1%.  (The last-ditch mortgage is at 9.95% but hey, at 430 you take what's available.) 

They also suggested a blend, so I could get (for example) a 300k mortgage and then a 100k LOC to give me mostly the same idea, but a better interest rate and a still giving me the flexibility of the LOC.  I'd have to re-qualify for the mortgage every couple of years and the rules keep changing.  With the LOC I qualify once and then as long as I keep paying I'm good.  The downside would be that if I only ever pay the interest, I never pay down the principal and would never own the house outright.  (With a 25-year amortization, that's retirement age anyway.)

**Which is a better choice?**  My main concern is employment stability.  I'm not worried about the house price dropping.  Even at $1400 a month, rent for an equivalent place would be near $2500.

Trying to do my taxes right now. I work in NYC and live in NJ as title says. I thought it was business as usual until it said i owe $1,500 to NJ. Why would this be? I don't remember doing this last year and nothing has changed since then? My NY return says i will be getting 145 back....

The screen where it says federal w-2 wages and state w-2 wages should both read the same # correct? It originally had my wages doubled, but i corrected it to the federal number (58K), which made it go to 1500 owed. I notice when I put this to 0, it says I don't owe NJ anything, but that seems like the wrong thing to put?

Seeing as SegWit TXs still rest around roughly 14% of all TX on the network and the number of UASF nodes is dwarfed by Core nodes that aren't SW enabled, will this have a palpable impact on SW adoption in general? 

If so, what do you all believe could be the implications behind this here? We could definitely have a system where we have two ""types"" of Bitcoin floating around here and since they aren't fungible, its hard to justify that they both should have the same inherent  value.

personalfinance,Confused On Estimating Paycheck After Taxes,"Hi, all. Thank you to all those who help in advance. Much appreciated! 

I’ll be starting a federal job at Grade 7, Step 2. According to location, that comes out to $47,504.23/year. 

According to federalpay.org, after entering in the appropriate information such as location, county, grade and step— I get the aforementioned annual amount, with bi-weekly pay at $1827.08 and $22.76/hour. 

So— is this my paycheck after taxes? I assume that’s not the case. So should I take off around 30% to account for that? I’m a single male with no independents. 

However, what is confusing me is if I calculate it by hand. When I take my annual salary and divide it by 24, I get 1979.33. With this number, I know for **certain** that I still need to take out value for tax. 

So why is that number higher than the number that federalpay.org is giving me?

personalfinance,"Should I accept a $7,500 unsubsidized federal student loan?","First off, I’m using a throwaway since theres a lot of personal numbers here. 

I’m finishing up my sixth year in college as an undergrad in aerospace engineering with one more year to go if all goes well. 

I was considered a dependent student until this school year and I was over the federal loan limit of $31,000. However, now as an independent student I can borrow up to $57,500.

Each semester including materials is about $4,000. I’ve paid this semester and the last 3 semesters out of pocket. However I’ve been completely reimbursed for two of those semesters by my part time job. I am close to the reimbursement benefit limit for the calendar year and will only get $1,500 back once this semester is complete. Also my workplace changed the policy so that they could take back any reimbursements paid within a year from separation date. I do not believe they will actually do that though. Starting next school year I qualify for grants, however it is only enough to cover one semester. 

---

My current financial situation:

INCOME/ASSETS:

~$20/hr and 25hr/wk but I do request a lot of days off for exams. It is not uncommon for me to not work at all during a few weeks out of the semester.

6% of my paycheck goes to my 401k to maximize employer contributions and another 10% goes to the employee stock purchase plan. 

I have $2,500 in stocks and $1,800 in RSUs with 1/3 vesting every year until 2020. Another $2,000 in RSUs are expected soon with similar vesting until 2021. 

I have just $1,000 in my checking’s account with a non existent savings account. 

STUDENT LOANS:

$20,000 unsub $2,500 interest

$14,000 sub $100 interest - probably from when I took a semester at a community college and the system didn’t recognize I was still in school.

Interest rates range between 3.4% and 6.8%

CREDIT CARDS:

I have about $7,000 in credit card debt but all on 0% interest cards. About $2000 expires in 1.5 years and the rest in about a year.

I’ve never paid interest on a credit card and I don’t intend to. This should be paid off in time as I’ve done before. My tax refund will cover about $2,500 of this and selling off my stocks is my backup plan in case I don’t have the funds in time. My backup backup is to take advantage of the 0 interest balance transfer offers I’m getting from my current banks. 

EXPENSES:

I still live at home so the monthly things I pay for are:

$40 phone

$130 gas

$30 gym

$30 chegg/netflix/music

$300 food 

Typically one of my paychecks will cover my monthly expenses and the other I use to pay off debt.

I’ll need about $4,000 in loans to finish off my undergrad. However I do not need it right now since this offer is for this school year (which is already paid off) and I will get another similar offer for next school year. 

I am considering accepting the full amount in case I need to take more time off work this semester. Also I should be able to pay off my loans within 2 years if i’m able to penetrate the job market. However, I’d like some input on what the best course of action is.

Do I decline the current offer and just accept the next offer for the $4,000 l’ll need?
Do I accept both offers and use it to pay off my older loans with higher interest?
Do I take the money and travel the world before I’m locked into a 9-5 for the next 20+ years?

Please talk me out of a bad idea and into a good one.",finance

personalfinance,Question about TurboTax - buy Deluxe Version or just mail in forms?,"Trying to file my taxes for 2017 through TurboTax (free edition), which lets you file federal and state for no charge.

My issue is that I moved to a different state last year for a job, and I would like to deduct my moving expenses. TurboTax free doesn't cover that situation, and it says if I upgrade to the deluxe version ($39.99), that I will be able to move forward with that deduction. Problem is that it looks like the Deluxe version doesn't cover the state portion of your return, which they offer for an additional charge of $36.99.

personalfinance,IRS can't verify my information...I don't think I can actually pay my taxes,"I owe like $65 on fed taxes, apparently my withholding was very good (go me!).  However, the IRS needs to verify my identity apparently using a multitude of different ways.

PROBLEM THE FIRST: according to my tax software, you need to know either your gross adjusted income for last year's taxes, or your PIN for last year's taxes.  I don't remember either.

All hope is not lost!  You can request a transcript from irs.gov.

PROBLEM THE SECOND: To verify your identity on irs.gov, you need to have either an expensive postpaid phone plan (I know the reasoning behind this, but still, I'm like 85% sure it's a conspiracy by telcoms; there's other easy ways to verify identity; see PROBLEM THE THIRD) or get a PIN mailed to you.  Which is another layer of hassle but fine, I'll get the PIN mailed.  I'm seeing on the web that you can only get the PIN mailed to the address of your last tax return though, and I don't live there anymore wtf

But before I even got to that screen...

PROBLEM THE THIRD: I *also* had to enter *another* form of verification, which would be *just as goddamn useful* as using a mobile phone plan.  The  options were either mortgage, car payment, other expensive ass shit that I don't have, or credit card number.  Cool, I can do that.  I enter the last 8 of my credit card...it's literally sitting in front of me...nope, that information does not match their records.  I try again.  Nope.  I try another card.  Nope.  Aaaaaaand now I'm locked out of the website.

personalfinance,Mortgage Pre-Approval Questions,"Hello! 

I was hoping I can get words of advice from people familiar with the process of mortgage pre-approval. 

Here's my situation: 

A friend's friend is a mortgage broker and is currently helping me with the pre-approval process. He's been super transparent with his numbers and has been giving me tips on how to increase my credit so I can have a lower lender's fee. Give my current financial situation, he said I'm eligible for a 600K mortgage at 4.5% interest rate with a ~$3000 lenders fee. 

Now, my realtor, a family friend, similarly told me his company that they can offer me 600K mortgage as well but at 4.3%, NO lenders fee (the company will pay for it) and even a $500 rebate if I decide to go with them, based on my current financial information. 

Now my questions:
-Is my realtor's company actually absorbing that lender's fee cost? Or are they simply increasing his commission down the line so that the seller of a house I'm interested in will have to pay for more? (and might subsequently increase their asking price)? Are they going to hit me with some other fee down the line?

-my mortgage broker, after hearing about this, pretty much said that my realtor's company is bullshit, there's no way they can offer  a lower interest than what he's offering since he can see all of the available rates from all of the banks. Is this true?  Is it possible that the realtor's company has a good relationship with local banks that can offer their clients a better rate that my mortgage broker can't access? 

In conclusion, I trust both of them that they're not actively trying to scam me. I'm just trying to pick which option can potentially save me the most money during this pre-approval process. 

Sorry for the wall of text, really appreciated if anyone can offer any insights! Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,"I thought I was paranoid, but I got phished. Read my shameful account of said phishing so they don't get you too.","I have different passwords for every website I log into, 2-factor authentication when possible; I thought I knew all the scams and could spot them a mile away. This one still got me. 

I was meeting a friend at a bar. Two drinks in I got a call from someone identified by my phone as Wells Fargo. I'm fully aware this could be spoofed, but it did not raise alarm bells yet. I was at a bar I did not frequent and have gotten calls from my bank before on suspicious charges that were legit, so I answered expecting this to be the case.

The person I spoke with said they were with Wells Fargo and they've identified fraudulent charges on my account but they need to verify my identity before they can discuss details. They said they sent me a text message (via the cell number they just called, which is my first clue this is phishing). They asked me to read back to them the 6-digit number just texted to me to verify my ID. Being two drinks in, slightly expecting what this was about, I had zero alarm bells going off. My bad, this was stupid of me. I read the number to them. They suggested it timed out and I needed to read another number they texted to me. Minimal time had passed, a mild spidy sense was tingling, but I still was not concerned enough to ask questions and read them a second 6-digit code.

This person then read off 5 recent charges on my account, 4 of which I recognized as legit and a 5th that was a $1000 charge to a credit card I did not own. I immediately identified this as a fraudulent charge and they said ""no prob dude, we'll freeze your card and send you a new one"". They even gave me the last 4 on the card it was coming from. I was appeased enough to continue (sadly). 

Finally, they said they sent me one final 6-digit code to confirm that they were crediting my account back with the $1000 fraudulent charge. I just needed to read off the final code they texted to me. At this point things seem weird to me but they got me at a good time. I was 2 drinks in, was interrupted from hanging with a close friend I hadn't seen in months and was outside trying desperately to avoid the loud noise inside the bar but still dealing with traffic noise outside. I just wanted to be done with this. I read them the final code and they thanked me and hung up. 

At this point, I see why my phone had been vibrating constantly through this call. I had 4 emails from Wells Fargo. 1) Your user name has been reset, 2) your password has been reset, 3) Welcome to Zelle! an awesome $$$ forwarding service, 4) You've just forwarded $1000!!!!!

I called Wells Fargo via the number on the back of my card. After being on hold for 45 min trying to get the fraud department, I start to tell my story only to have the call drop (I'm pretty sure they hung up on me). I called back and was on hold for 1 hour 20 min (my account has been compromised &gt;2 hours by this time) to get a second person. He told me this was a scam they've been dealing with for 3 months and I needed to go into a branch with 2 forms of ID to deal with it. There was nothing he could do tonight.

TDLR: Dude spoofed Wells Fargo when calling me on my cell, requested a reset of my user name, password and approval for $1000 transfer. I stupidly read off the confirmation numbers I received via text to him, he entered them into Wells Fargo website to approve all these requests. Wells Fargo has known their customers have been getting scammed for 3 months and didn't bother to warn anyone. I now have to go into a branch, hang my head and tell my shameful story to a person and beg for access to my account because someone else has control of it all night tonight.",finance

personalfinance,1040X? Think tax software double counted real estate taxes paid,"I used H&amp;R Block online filing for the first time this year due to their zero cost advertising. I have previously used TurboTax and TaxAct with no problems. I didn't find the program as intuitive as the others. It asked specifically about real estate taxes paid and then a separate question asked about my 1098. Suffice it to say, I think they double counted my real estate taxes paid and I got a bigger refund because of it.

It doesn't seem to matter nowadays how much I clean out the dust I keep running into problems and I suspect it's all just starting to die and I'm fed up of constantly tweaking everything and swapping in parts.

I'm looking at a fairly decent way to upgrade my RAM etc. without spending too much or worrying about compatibility and I was checking out motherboard bundles. Has anyone here actually bought them? Would be nice to get some general idea of whether they're a good idea or not, they seem to look like exactly what I want as I already have the spare parts for a brand new computer nearly anyway.

I may even buy a cheap new tower as well on top of that because I did admittedly ruin my old one I have currently by being a pillock and not knowing much about computer building.",technology
CryptoCurrency,Let's *actually* talk about EOS,"There seem to be a huge number of misconceptions floating around the EOS project. Some involve its functionality, some the way the ICO was conducted. In the long run, the misconceptions won't matter visa-vise the success of the project, but they are annoying nonetheless.

Misinformation about EOS's functionality:

EOS is not just an ethereum competitor with a higher tps. It is an entirely different economic and token model. If bitcoin is money, and ethereum is gas, then EOS is land. Land on a decentralized island that everyone wants to develop on and use. To get bandwidth on the EOS blockchain, you need to lock up EOS. The more EOS you lock up, the more bandwidth you get. EOS tokens can also be locked up to give a certain amount of decentralized storage. This means EOS competes not just with ethereum, but things like Filecoin. Since so much EOS needs to be locked up to use the chain, it will have a very low velocity, meaning a very high price since so little supply will be available. Conceptualize the land aspect of EOS as being an operating system. EOS is extremely developer and user friendly. It has on-chain governance, is self-funding, bug fixes, and even lost account recovery and 2FA. It has a block confirmation time of less than a second (compared to the minutes of ethereum), which is what is needed to run a real DEX or decentralized social media website.

Misinformation about EOS's funding:

The ICO of EOS has been one year long and taken in a huge amount of money. That money is not being run away with by the developers. Rather, it is being mostly fed back into the chain itself. See, the ICO model of EOS is also completely different than ethereum. On EOS the ICOs are *already funded*. That's what the token contract was doing! It was crowdfunding all the future ICOs of the EOS chain. The money from the EOS ICO has gone toward the EOS VC Fund, which is partnered with big names like Novogratz and Eric Schmidt's personal VC fund, and currently is devoting 1.375 billion (with a B) toward chain development. What this means is that, rather than sending in ether to participate in an ICO, just holding EOS is participating in EOS ICOs, and you will be airdropped the products of the EOS VC Fund. These are already happening with upcoming airdrops. These drops aren't like the ones in ethereum where you get some small portion of the dropped chain. Rather, the entire supply will be given away to EOS holders. Why? Because the EOS holders already funded all that development! The EOS VC Fund will pay the development teams who give away the tokens for free to all EOS holders.

I hope that clears up some questions about the EOS function and economic models, and what is unique about it.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"Need some help determining if i should put a large (30-40%) down payment on a house, or follow my financial advisors advice of investing my assets.","Hi r/personalfinance I am a 29 y.o. who sold my house last year for a great profit. Me and my wife have our first child on the way and are closing on a new house in one month! Here is where i am fighting with myself.   
personally i have always followed more of a Dave Ramsey mindset in the sense that i put a large down payment on my first house with a 15 year mortgage that i had almost paid off by the time i sold it. With the new mortgage coming up i have essentially been given 2 options and i would like to hear your thoughts on both.  
  
The house were buying is 275k  
I have roughly 100k in liquid assets  

  
Option 1: (what i feels more comfortable) I would put 100k down on the house with a 4.5% interest rate. Financing 175k on a 30 year mortgage would land me 886$/month for my mortgage.  
  
Option 2: (what my financial adviser is recommending) I would put the minimum down payment that i can (20% or around 52k) down on the house and invest the other 48k into low-medium risk investments which for the last 5 years has netted me around a 6-9% average return. But at a higher interest rate (5.375% or so) I would then pay the higher mortgage (around 1600 a month or so) out of that account. so essentially trying to make more money than the difference in interest rates with the investments.  

What are your guys's thoughts on these options? I will be around to provide any more information that might help with your advice.   
  
Another 3rd option would be to put down around 82k and invest the remaining 20k. which would give me the same 4.5% interest rate.

My question is - is it worth refinancing through SoFi at this point, or should I just stick it out with Great Lakes since I am pretty close to paying off the loan anyway? I've never refinanced a loan before so I'm really not sure what to consider other than the interest rate.

Also - just a bit of history - our financial situation has been stable since I graduated 5 years ago so I am not concerned about the lack of government protections with a private student loan.

personalfinance,Should I consolidate my debt?,"I feel like I have a decent amount of debt to pay off. I own 7 credit cards with 3 of those having an interest rate of 29.9%, 20.2%, and the rest at 12%. I also have a student loan with a balance of $2,500 that is in deferment until next month when I have to start making minimum payments. So with all my credit cards and student loans, I have a debt of about $20,000. 

If I choose to consolidate, it would be to get a lower interest rate and only have to make one payment to the creditor. The other advantage I can see is that I would be able to save some of the money that I'm paying in interest fees and put that into savings. However, the only disadvantage I can see is if I have to take a high interest rate when my credit cards are consolidated. 

Are there any other pros/cons that I missed? How would you deal with the debt?",finance

personalfinance,What are some investment options that would have greater returns than a US Patriot Bond?,"Hello again financial wizards,

I am fortunate to say that since I was three years old, my grandfather had bought me savings bonds every year until I graduated from high school. I recently came across them, and they have a face value of almost $7,000, but realistically their actual value is about half of that. 

After some research, I determined all the bonds range in interest rates from 1.58% to 1.3%, and I was wondering if their was a more lucrative way to invest this money. I know some savings accounts offer higher rates, but I was curious as to what route I should take. (I have some knowledge of the stock market having purchased, owned, and managed various stocks in the past.)

I want to use all of this money to eventually pay off part of my student loans, so I'm not looking to be too bullish.

Lender A has run my credit and already received all of my W2’s, Pay Stubs, etc. They gave me a preapproval letter without an interest rate. I have had them check our monthly payment on various properties we have been interested in and they include an interest rate at that point. 

Lender B has run my credit. They gave me a preapproval with an interest rate. At this point I have not provided my backup financial documentation. They will be requesting it when we are ready to make our offer. 

When I am ready to make an offer, do I contact both of these lenders or do I need to have a decision already made? I think the interest rate from Lender A is a little high and I’m hoping Lender B can do a little better. 

If I proceed with Lender B and the interest rate is even higher, can I still proceed with Lender A? How does the timing with this work?

Forex,"DAILY DISCUSSION THREAD (Wednesday night into Thursday, February 22)","GIVE US NOW OUR DAILY THREAD

Wednesday night into Thursday, February 22

How about that FOMC? I am going to put up a separate FOMC thread, but basically we had a big event today, and I think the market is ready to tell us where it wants to go now.  USD talks, its the big dog in the room, and after January's sell off, many have been looking for further indications of where the market wants to go.  Hopefully today provided some of that. 

We are always advocates of *not* playing binary/high volatility events in the world of FX. For those of you who are new, take a look at your charts, and you are seeing why you shouldn't hold through these things.  Here's an example, Take a look at this chart: 

https://i.imgur.com/jn7QGLL.png

That is the /6A M15 chart. The /6A is the AUD future, think of it as a leading AUD/USD chart.  See that bull spike?  That's algorithms and AIs reacting to the news.  Now, you may state ""I could have held short through this"", but considering the following outcomes:

* Even though you were ""right"" in this case, and the FOMC minutes showed bullishness on rate raising (which is good for the dollar), you still face the risk of Stopout.  High volatility events can hit that stop loss - gets hit, almost every time.  Unless your stop is super wide, you face the risk of being stopped *even if you were right*. As well, you face the risk of whipsawing for several minutes.
* FOMC reverses off of what everyone expected, let's say they look non committal to rate raises, or the Fed appears to basically say ""we were wrong about inflation"", and the market craters as AIs/Algos, Banks, and Institutions flee the USD like rats off of a sinking ship.  You are suddenly massively negative, and have just paid a very large tuition for this valuable lesson.
* A third risk is that you have put in a limit buy in the opposite direction of a trade of yours in case your stop gets hit.... and the machines hit your stop, trip your limit buy, *then reverse like this chart did*, and you're double dipped. Ouch!

Hope no one got hurt today.

Everyone is doing awesome, keep contributing, this is growing and changing, and I love it. I want to see your reasons for why you took a trade, please post them.

personalfinance,Company reimburses tuition: pay off student loans each semester or invest it instead?,"So my company will reimburse me the full cost of my tuition at the end of every class, which currently amounts to $900/credit hour. I didn’t want to be out all the cash up front each semester, so I took out a Stafford Loan that covers all my tuition, with a 6.0% fixed interest rate.

I first thought about paying the loan back at the end of each semester, but then I also considered just putting the ~$9,000 a semester into a savings account and just using it to pay for the next semester. Get the money from Spring 2018 to pay for Fall 2018, get the money from Fall 2018 to pay for Spring of 2019, etc. But then I thought about a different scenario, and this is the one I need input on.

Suppose instead of keeping the cash, I just take out loans for the next three years at 6.0% to cover my tuition, and when my company gives me the cash back every semester, I invested in something that will outperform the interest I’m being charged on my loan. Then in about 5-6 years, I’ll pay off all the student loans and I’ll have money left over that will stay invested.

Is this a wise idea, and what investments would I want to consider putting the reimbursement into in order to have a high likelihood it’ll return higher than a 6.0%?

**Original post**
I have about 100,000 in student loan debt (Bachelor's &amp; Master's of Education), and I'm a high school teacher in California.  I don't make a lot of money, I have a family and my spouse has an expensive chronic medical condition.  As of right now there's simply no way we could make ends meet if I were paying the over $500 payments, I've been getting [deferments](https://media.tenor.com/images/6d8835a292a97851e3a2aa0e467ff3a9/tenor.gif).  Next year my son (our only kid) goes to school and my spouse may be able to start working, but we'll probably have to pay some sort of daycare and we really feel like we need to buy a house (not possible [nor wise?] with me not paying on my loans??)
   
Can I, like, legally (but unethically) pay a minimum or continue to defer to prevent default until I die?  Would that be really stupid?  I believe it's possible that I'll go the rest of my life not being able to do this.  It evokes a bit of panic because my wife's condition is as such that if she doesn't get her medication, she dies within a few weeks.  It's not that we don't have extra money, it's that we don't have a whole *$500* extra every month.
   
Another wrench in the works is I make more money than the average because I live in a high cost-of-living area so I'm afraid an income based repayment won't work as they base those off national averages (afaik).",finance

Forex,The big fat r/Forex FOMC Minutes and Dollar thread,"Let's talk FOMC and the USD.

&gt; &gt; FOMC Minutes

The short version is that after parsing through the language of the FOMC minutes, most analysts see a somewhat mixed to positive message:

* Some Fed officials see an ""appreciable risk"" that inflation remains below their 2% target, according to the minutes of their January meeting released on Wednesday.
* Wall Street has been focused on inflation since that meeting. Concerns about it — and higher interest rates — helped plunge the stock market into a correction.
* The Fed was otherwise upbeat on the economy, and expects tax cuts to support growth. [source](http://www.businessinsider.com/federal-reserve-minutes-fomc-january-meeting-2018-2)

Also

* FOMC members said they have revised upward the economic projections they made at the previous meeting in December.
* The January meeting was the last one for Chair Janet Yellen, who had guided the Fed through the first rate normalization steps a decade after the financial crisis.
* Markets already were on edge after the January Fed meeting, during which the committee said it expected that ""further gradual adjustments"" in monetary policy. [source](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/21/fed-minutes-all-signs-pointing-to-more-rate-hikes-ahead.html)

&gt; &gt; Why are the minutes important?

The key to understanding why FOMC is important this time comes from this statement:

* ""investors were reading them for more information on how FOMC members were thinking about inflation, and how much they could raise interest rates to combat it."" [source](http://www.businessinsider.com/federal-reserve-minutes-fomc-january-meeting-2018-2)

[Interest rates up means dollar up, it's that easy](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/101215/how-fed-fund-rate-hikes-affect-us-dollar.asp).  10 year rate hit 2.93% today, wow!

&gt; &gt;USD

Most targets, except for USDJPY due to it's correlation to SPX/SPY and DJI, are bullish.  I saw several small gap downs in futures which represent a strong opening for the USD.  USDCAD is looking to tear.  AUDUSD is potentially breaking a huge support line at .7800.

You aren't getting 100% guidance because ***that doesn't exist in FX***.  It's  anebvulous message.  There is likely other factors too:

* Fear that the market still needs to fill the gaps in it's shitty structure that was built during that insane Christmas/Post-Christmas bull charge
* Fear of the new Fed Chair: who is he? What is he like?  Another dove like Yellen, unpredictable like Bernanke?
* Fear that the Fed may not have as much power as they say they do?  So much wealth has been generated within private sector that it is becoming apparent that the Fed doesn't have as much leverage as it used to: private money is capable of dictating market courses sometimes now.

All in all is seems to be bullish for USD. Read this: https://www.fxstreet.com/news/forex-today-turn-around-fomc-minutes-bargain-hunters-buy-back-the-dollar-201802212341

personalfinance,Purchasing a house at or near retirement - possible approaches,"I follow this forum regularly, but am using a throwaway account for this thread, so appearing as new user.

I am wondering how others have handled, or think about, the following scenario:

Single

mid-50's-ish

~1.6 mil USD

approx 50% in taxable, 50% in tax deferred (IRAs, mostly in traditional; small ROTH)

no debt

low-cost, indexed approach, approx 65/ 35 stocks / bonds

life-long renter

still working, but feeling almost FI, and probably approaching the end of my useful working life

As I approach FI and RE, I'm not sure how to think about housing.

I've always had good financial and lifestyle results with renting. But with rental markets tightening (particularly in the NW US), and a desire to ""lock in"" housing costs long term, I feel like owning would be a good idea.

Say, I wanted to own housing in the $250K to $300K price range, is it better to think about a cash buy? Can FIRE types who are liquid, but no longer working, or working but in their 50's, obtain reasonable home mortgages (and with interest rates at 4.5 for 30 year fixed, is that approach starting to look too pricey)

I feel like, since I didn't take advantage of the house buying opportunities after the 2008/2009 collapse, I've painted myself into a bit of a housing corner.

I've never been a particularly high earner, and it's really just been since the recovery following the collapse that I gained net worth. If I had the portfolio I have now, back in 2012, I'd be in housing heaven :) But back in 2012, a $250K house felt pretty expensive to me.

Anyway, I realize I may simply be looking at moving to a LCOL area (not sure where), given my situation, or part-time work for a period of time.

My car - $10,500 at 1.9%. Minimum is $350 but I pay $400

I am mainly looking at the vehicle loan and student loans but would like some confidence in which direction to go in. If we paid the vehicle loan fast, that frees up the $400 to apply to her loans and so on. But we could also overpay her loans with high interest rate since the interest hit on my vehicle is low.

Proof of Work - very short, cuz it's well-known.

Bitcoin - to generate a new block miner must generate hash of the new block header that is in line with given requirements.

Others: Ethereum, Litecoin etc.

Proof of Stake

Nxt- The more tokens are held by account, the greater chance that account will earn the right to generate a block. The total reward received as a result of block generation is the sum of the transaction fees located within the block.
Three values are key to determining which account is eligible to generate a block, which account earns the right to generate a block, and which block is taken to be the authoritative one in times of conflict: base target value, target value and cumulative difficulty. Each block on the chain has a generation signature parameter. To participate in the block's forging process, an active account digitally signs the generation signature of the previous block with its own public key. This creates a 64-byte signature, which is then hashed using SHA256. The first 8 bytes of the resulting hash are converted to a number, referred to as the account hit. The hit is compared to the current target value(active balance). If the computed hit is lower than the target, then the next block can be generated.

Peercoin (chain-based proof of stake) - coin age parameter. Hybrid PoW and PoS algorithm. The longer your Peercoins have been stationary in your account (to a maximum of 90 days), the more power (coin age) they have to mint a block. The act of minting a block requires the consumption of coin age value, and the network determines consensus by selecting the chain with the largest total consumed coin age. Reward - minting + 1% yearly.

Reddcoin (Proof of stake Velocity) - quite similar to Peercoin, difference: not linear coin-aging function (new coins gain weight quickly, and old coins gain weight increasingly slowly) to encourage Nodes Activity. Node with most coin age weight have a bigger chance to create block. To create block Node should calculate right hash. Block reward - interest on the weighted age of coins/ 5% annual interest in PoSV phase.

Ethereum (Casper) - uses modified BFT consensus. Blocks will be created using PoW. In the Casper Phase 1 implementation for Ethereum, the “proposal mechanism"" is the existing proof of work chain, modified to have a greatly reduced block reward. Blocks will be validated by set of Validators. Block is finalised when 2/3 of validators voted for it (not the number of validators is counted, but their deposit size). Block creator rewarded with Block Reward + Transaction FEES.

Lisk (Delegated Proof-of-stake) - Lisk stakeholders vote with vote transaction (the weight of the vote depends on the amount of Lisk the stakeholder possess) and choose 101 Delegates, who create all blocks in the blockchain. One delegate creates 1 block within 1 round (1 round contains 101 blocks) -&gt; At the beginning of each round, each delegate is assigned a slot indicating their position in the block generation process -&gt; Delegate includes up to 25 transactions into the block, signs it and broadcasts it to the network -&gt; As &gt;51% of available peers agreed that this block is acceptable to be created (Broadhash consensus), a new block is added to the blockchain. *Any account may become a delegate, but only accounts with the required stake (no info how much) are allowed to generate blocks. Block reward - minted Lisks and transaction fees (fees for all 101 blocks are collected firstly and then are divided between delegates). Blocks appears every 10 sec.

Cardano (Ouroboros Proof of Stake) - Blocks(slots) are created by Slot Leaders. Slot Leaders for N Epoch are chosen during n-1 Epoch. Slot Leaders are elected from the group of ADA stakeholders who have enough stake. Election process consist of 3 phases: Commitment phase: each elector generates a random value (secret), signs it and commit as message to network (other electors) saved in to block. -&gt; Reveal phase: Each elector sends special value to open a commitment, all this values (opening) are put into the block. -&gt; Recovery phase: each elector verifies that commitments and openings match and extracts the secrets and forms a SEED (randomly generated bytes string based on secrets). All electors get the same SEED. -&gt; Follow the Satoshi algorithm : Elector who have coin which corresponded to SEED become a SLOT LEADER and get a right to create a block. Slot Leader is rewarded with minted ADA and transactions Fee.

Tendermint (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) - A proposal is signed and published by the designated proposer at each round. The proposer is chosen by a deterministic and non-choking round robin selection algorithm that selects proposers in proportion to their voting power. The proposer create the block, that should be validated by &gt;2/3 of Validators, as follow: Propose -&gt; Prevote -&gt; Precommit -&gt; Commit. Proposer rewarded with Transaction FEES.

Tron (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) - This blockhain is still on development stage. Consensus algorithm = PoS + BFT (similar to Tendermint): PoS algorithm chooses a node as Proposer, this node has the power to generate a block. -&gt; Proposer broadcasts a block that it want to release. -&gt; Block enters the Prevote stage. It takes &gt;2/3 of nodes' confirmations to enter the next stage. -&gt; As the block is prevoted, it enters Precommit stage and needs &gt;2/3 of node's confirmation to go further. -&gt; As &gt;2/3 of nodes have precommited the block it's commited to the blockchain with height +1. New blocks appears every 15 sec.

NEO (Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance) - Consensus nodes* are elected by NEO holders -&gt; The Speaker is identified (based on algorithm) -&gt; He broadcasts proposal to create block -&gt; Each Delegate (other consensus nodes) validates proposal -&gt; Each Delegate sends response to other Delegates -&gt; Delegate reaches consensus after receiving 2/3 positive responses -&gt; Each Delegate signs the block and publishes it-&gt; Each Delegate receives a full block. Block reward 6 GAS distributed proportionally in accordance with the NEO holding ratio among NEO holders. Speaker rewarded with transaction fees (mostly 0). * Stake 1000 GAS to nominate yourself for Bookkeeping(Consensus Node)

EOS (Delegated Proof of Stake) - those who hold tokens on a blockchain adopting the EOS.IO software may select* block producers through a continuous approval voting system and anyone may choose to participate in block production and will be given an opportunity to produce blocks proportional to the total votes they have received relative to all other producers. At the start of each round 21 unique block producers are chosen. The top 20 by total approval are automatically chosen every round and the last producer is chosen proportional to their number of votes relative to other producers. Block should be confirmed by 2/3 or more of elected Block producers. Block Producer rewarded with Block rewards. *the more EOS tokens a stakeholder owns, the greater their voting power

The XRP Ledger Consensus Process

Ripple - Each node receives transaction from external applications -&gt; Each Node forms public list of all valid (not included into last ledger (=block)) transactions aka (Candidate Set) -&gt; Nodes merge its candidate set with UNLs(Unique Node List) candidate sets and vote on the veracity of all transactions (1st round of consensus) -&gt; all transactions that received at least 50% votes are passed on the next round (many rounds may take place) -&gt; final round of consensus requires that min 80% of Nodes UNL agreeing on transactions. It means that at least 80% of Validating nodes should have same Candidate SET of transactions -&gt; after that each Validating node computes a new ledger (=block) with all transactions (with 80% UNL agreement) and calculate ledger hash, signs and broadcasts -&gt; All Validating nodes compare their ledgers hash -&gt; Nodes of the network recognize a ledger instance as validated when a 80% of the peers have signed and broadcast the same validation hash. -&gt; Process repeats. Ledger creation process lasts 5 sec(?). Each transaction includes transaction fee (min 0,00001 XRP) which is destroyed. No block rewards.

The Stellar consensus protocol

Stellar (Federated Byzantine Agreement) - quit similar to Ripple. Key difference - quorum slice.

Proof of Burn

Slimcoin - to get the right to write blocks Node should “burn” amount of coins. The more coins Node “burns” more chances it has to create blocks (for long period) -&gt; Nodes address gets a score called Effective Burnt Coins that determines chance to find blocks. Block creator rewarded with block rewards.

Proof of Importance

NEM - Only accounts that have min 10k vested coins are eligible to harvest (create a block). Accounts with higher importance scores have higher probabilities of harvesting a block. The higher amount of vested coins, the higher the account’s Importance score. And the higher amount of transactions that satisfy following conditions: - transactions sum min 1k coins, - transactions made within last 30 days, - recipient have 10k vested coins too, - the higher account’s Important score. Harvester is rewarded with fees for the transactions in the block. A new block is created approx. every 65 sec.

IOTA Algorithm

IOTA - uses DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) instead of blockchain (TANGLE equal to Ledger). Graph consist of transactions (not blocks). To issue a new transaction Node must approve 2 random other Transactions (not confirmed). Each transaction should be validate n(?) times. By validating PAST(2) transactions whole Network achieves Consensus. in Order to issue transaction Node: 1. Sign transaction with private key 2. choose two other Transactions to validate based on MCMC(Markov chain Monte Carlo) algorithm, check if 2 transactions are valid (node will never approve conflicting transactions) 3. make some PoW(similar to HashCash). -&gt; New Transaction broadcasted to Network. Node don’t receive reward or fee.

Proof of Space/Proof of Capacity

Filecoin (Power Fault Tolerance) - the probability that the network elects a miner(Leader) to create a new block (it is referred to as the voting power of the miner) is proportional to storage currently in use in relation to the rest of the network. Each node has Power - storage in use verified with Proof of Spacetime by nodes. Leaders extend the chain by creating a block and propagating it to the network. There can be an empty block (when no leader). A block is committed if the majority of the participants add their weight on the chain where the block belongs to, by extending the chain or by signing blocks. Block creator rewarded with Block reward + transaction fees.

Proof of Elapsed Time

Hyperledger Sawtooth - Goal - to solve BFT Validating Nodes limitation. Works only with intel’s SGX. PoET uses a random leader election model or a lottery based election model based on SGX, where the protocol randomly selects the next leader to finalize the block. Every validator requests a wait time from an enclave (a trusted function). -&gt; The validator with the shortest wait time for a particular transaction block is elected the leader. -&gt; The BlockPublisher is responsible for creating candidate blocks to extend the current chain. He takes direction from the consensus algorithm for when to create a block and when to publish a block. He creates, Finalizes, Signs Block and broadcast it -&gt; Block Validators check block -&gt; Block is created on top of blockchain. post with references you can find here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2936428.msg30170673#msg30170673",cryptocurrency

litecoin,Why litecoin won’t replace USD for shopping,"It’s tax season and I was reminded that any crypto currency is subject to USD taxes in America, during taxable events. This post is an argument I am making as to why the new payment system of litepal and others like it will not work. The moment you sell your blockchain currency or purchase something with the currency, it is subject to income tax at the point of conversion to USD, and/or subject to sales tax depending on the state where it was purchased and it’s tax rate. Sure, it’s up to the business to report the sale, but any reputable business will have to report the sale to account for the loss of inventory. After all, they still have to pay their taxes in USD. Simply put, if you buy something in America with litecoin you get taxed for the transfer to USD and then you get taxed for the sale. The business will not charge you the income tax required to transfer your block chain currency to USD, it will be you that has to report the transaction to the IRS at taxtime. (yes, buying a TV with the crypto currency must be reported as if you have sold your crypto currency for whatever US dollar equivalent announce at the point of sale.) So, if you buy an iPad with USD, it is $500 plus local sales tax ($541.25, in Houston). If you buy an iPad with litecoin, it is your federal income tax rate in addition to the sales tax, so at 33% rate of fed income tax, you are pushing $600+.) Want to be cute and not report your transactions to the irs? If you are audited, which does happen, and they find you did not pay your income tax after converting your block chain currency to USD for a purchase, you pay 0.5% interest per month on what you owe. Thus, I predict the value of Litecoin will drop toward the hundred dollar mark as it will be valued by the holders (HODL’ers) only and not the hype associated with these new crypto payment systems.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,My mother’s landlord wants me to buy her house super cheap. What should I consider?,"I was looking into buying a house before I moved across state lines, so I have some of the basics. This would be something that my siblings and I would come together for the down payment and closing costs. 

Also, let me know if there is a better sub to post this in.

I will update with information that you all ask me but what I have so far is:

The house costs $16,000 in an area where the average house sells for $40k+. The landlord has been renting to my mom for several years and just wants rid of the house but couldn’t find someone to buy it for her asking price of $25k. It has since been on the market for $20k and the $16k price is exclusive to my family. 

It is in Rochester, NY. 

It is a 2-bed 2 bath house. There’s an old bedroom that was repurposed with a standing shower and an attached .5 bath. The room can fit a full bed, but is currently being used as a wardrobe room. 

I’ll get the square footage from my mom later. 

Edit: removed question about the down payment 

Also, I know a little bit about there being inspections and whatnot. Is that a cost we still have to foot, or can we skip that since my mom knows the ins and outs of the house?

There is water damage from a clogged toilet that my mom caused. Is that something we should have the landlord fix before buying?

According to Zillow.com’s [mortgage calculator](https://www.zillow.com/mortgage-calculator/) she would be at $168 with a 7% interest rate. Any other monthly/ yearly costs I should consider?",finance

personalfinance,Should we rethink our blanket student loan advice?,"I have been reading here for quite some time and have as such been paying my student loans down heavily because that is the advice you will read over and over again here.  (1) emergency fund/ high interest debt (2) max out tax exempt contributions (3) student loans - something like that at  least.  However, I'm beginning to wonder if that's truly the best option for my financial situation and maybe for a lot of folks.  

Making extra payments on my student loan is very similar to an investment with a fixed return and almost zero liquidity.  I say almost zero liquidity because you will have an increased cash flow after the loans are zeroed.  With that in mind it's easy to compare this investment to any other investment and depending on your interest rates there may be a great deal of better options for you - and this is where it becomes situational.  

For me, I am paying my student loans down as a long term investment - I have relative income stability and a comfortable emergency fund.  For this reason, long term investments such as ETFs can be much more attractive than the fixed 4-5% return of my student loans as they have average returns approaching 10% and are much more liquid than extra investment in student loans.  This liquidity or lack there of for student loan investments is probably the biggest factor for me and I think it's one that is overlooked in r/PF.  The value of being able to access your investment can't be understated and can be just as crucial as a good emergency fund.  

All of that said I realize that taking all of your extra money and putting into the stock market carries significantly more risk than paying down student loans and I am not saying that is what anyone should do necessarily.  However, I do think people should consider more carefully their options when investing their extra money rather than blindly paying down student loans and ignoring all other options.  

My personal decision is to take a 60/40 approach. Invest 60%  in index funds and the other 40 goes against my student loans.  This gives me a more aggressive portfolio and also provides additional liquidity to support my emergency fund.",finance

investing,How to Plan for Rising Interest Rates and Volatility?,"Hello all,

The past bit has been a fun time as an investor! I believe it's safe to say that the days of easy money have departed for a while. When I began investing, my portfolio was extremely bullish/growth oriented because, well, the market was on fire.

However, with the recent volatility and rising interest rates, I'm struggling to determine a best approach to reducing risk. As a young adult, conventional wisdom tells me to move money to bonds when I'm faced with uncertainty. However, the recent rise in interest rates seem to have been killing bonds.

Alternatively, many suggest to put money into energy with the dollar depreciating, while others identify utilities as the safer harbor to wait out the rough seas. 

Which brings me to my question: as someone who simply buys stocks/ETFs/funds/etc, and doesn't play in options or futures (because I've never learned either), how can I, an average investor, find a safer harbor to ride out rising interest rates and volatility?

So that the core of global finance is included in the adoption of BCH and could use those reserves to legitimize its position within the financial global system... 

It would be an unseen move in financial history, and cement BCH instantly from this day until the end of times... It would create a more fair, distributed, inclusive, and functional pathway for BCH to global digital currency status.

Would such an idea be welcomed by the community, if only to consider? I believe a radical anti bank and government stands will never get us anywhere, in a realistic sense..",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Found some US Saving Bonds. Cash now and apply to deferred student loans or wait to mature?,"Hi PF,

I'm 26 in my first year of medical school, graduating in 2021. I have a hefty student loan burden, both private and public. The private loans have an interest rate around 9% but are all in deferment while I am in school.

I just found some Series EE savings bonds that were given to me when I was born and the first few years of my life. I looked them up on treasurydirect.gov to see how much they are worth now. They are worth the following amounts

* $200 face value bought in 1991, final date in 2021, interest 4.00%, currently $90.26 
* $50, 1996, 2026, 1.56%, currently $52.80 
* $50, 1997, 2027, 1.59%, currently $52.22 
* $50, 1998, 2028, 1.66%, currently $52.58 
* $50, 1998, 2028, 1.66%, currently $52.14

My question is what to do with these bonds? Do I wait for them to fully mature before cashing them? Should I apply them to my loans now since the interest rate of the bond is lower than the loan? Should I wait till I enter into repayment before cashing them?

Thank you for any advice.

personalfinance,Repairing my Credit with Student Loan Defaults in my History,"Disclaimer: Im running off a few hours of sleep and about to work a 14 hour day so my post will probably read terribly.

Im sure this topic has been beaten to death but any fresh ideas is appreciated. 

Long story somewhat short...

I neglected my student loans for a couple of years after undergrad starting in 2009 due to unemployment and unjustifiably depressed (don't study anthropology let alone get a masters in it). Got into a phd program that allowed me to suspend or defer my loans for the time being. Fall of 2013 I decide to leave said phd program and get a masters instead (yeah I know...). Graduate in 2014 with a useless post-graduate degree. In the next year I neglected my loans again due to unemployment and living with my mommy and daddy. Fast forward to 2016 I got a gig paying 80k and since that time as of a nine months ago I have done the following:

- started repaying my federal student loan (grad student loan) monthly that I took out in 2013.

- enrolled into the loan rehab program for my undergrad (graduated in 2009) loans which have been paid on time.

My only blemishes on my credit report are the student loans and I tried to go through one of the CRA's Dispute Form but it is saying that my information doesn't match. Presumably, I will run into this issue with the other two CRAs and I just have to provide current contact information.

My question is, is it possible to dispute or remove these blemishes since I am now repaying them? Would it take a phone call to the CRAs or provide some letter to begin this process?

Ive gotten lucky and in the last year and a half Ive landed a good well paying gig that the payment of the two loans combined(~630) isn't crippling to my week to week life. 

Any and all input/insight is appreciated.",finance

Assume 40k is at 6.8% interest and 40k is at 4% interest.

We currently own a home and are looking to upgrade our living arrangements. Assuming a 500k mortgage with 20% down starting in year 2018. 

For a 30 year conventional loan I am assuming a 4.75% interest rate if we purchase right now. If we wait until after the feds raise the rate (presumably we would purchase in 2019) what would cost us less, long term?

Pay the 40k off at 6.8% interest now and mortgage 500k at 5%

personalfinance,"Old Bank Account Being Drained By ""Service Charges""","TLDR: I discovered my bank was bought by another and this new bank has been needling an old, near forgotten account with $5 ""service charges."" Over time, 36% of the funds have been seized this way. Is this lawful? What can I do?

My very first job was at a bank. I was 17 and was pressured into opening at least 1 account with them. I opened a savings account because it made the most sense at the time due to what I was told about fees and interest rates associated with checking accounts. This employee account was supposed to come with certain perks like good interest rates and a sense of protection around that money, or so I thought.

The job ended, but I was encouraged to keep the account. I left very little money in there. The oldest statement I have reads $221.19.

Every so often, I received a statement and saw the balance was a little higher due to interest. Then I mostly forgot about the account or ignored it for almost 10 years.

If this were a fun story, I would rediscover this old account and find untold riches there.

Instead, I find that my bank was bought by another bank and that this new bank has been siphoning funds $5 at a time through so-called ""service charges."" The most recent statement reads $140.80.

I believe this to be unlawful. I feel like I have been robbed. I understood savings accounts, especially this special employee account, to be untouchable. I normally associate fees with checking accounts and low balances. 

I never authorized any changes to my account. As far as I am concerned, the account number is the same, so any protections or features originally agreed upon should remain regardless of who currently owns the bank, until they receive my authorization.

1. Is this lawful? I won't be surprised if it is.

personalfinance,Questions regarding raise in salary vs better health package.,"Hello,

I have an unique regarding my current employer. I am recently married (9 months ago) and my wife I are expecting our first child in 4 months. The company I work for has an outrageous family insurance employee contribution of approximately $800 per paycheck. I let the president of the company know I wouldn't be able to afford to work there any longer at my current salary since I will need to add my wife and future child to the insurance plan. They would really like to keep me as an employee, and through negotiations, I have two options:

* Option 1: $90,000 salary and my employer will pay all of my insurance employee contribution except $150 per paycheck. This $150 per paycheck that I will be responsible for will be locked at this rate indefinitely even if premiums increase in the future. Take home of $68,585.95.
* Option 2: $110,000 salary and I will be responsible for the full employee contribution of about $800 per paycheck. This contribution can change based on if our insurance premiums change in the future. Take home of $72,091.89 this year at the current premiums.

I have broken it down below (I have set the W4 allowable to 1 for simplicity):
                
Status | Salary | Semi Monthly Health Contribution | Net Yearly Salary | Net Semi Monthly salary | W4 Allowance | Semi Monthly Taxable Federal Income | Semi Monthly Federal Tax | Semi Monthly State Tax (3.6%) | Semi Monthly SS | Semi Monthly Medicare | Semi Monthly | Yearly Take Home
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----
    Married | $90,000 | $150 | $86,400 | $3,600 | 1 | $3,427.10 | $337.25 | $129.60 | $223.20 | $52.20 | $2,857.75 | $68,585.95
Married | $110,000 | $793 | $90,968 | $3,790.33 | 1 | $3,617.43 | $360.09 | $136.45 | $235 | $54.96 | $3,003.83 | $72,091.89

As you can see, Option 1 has a slightly better take home number, but Option 2 has the benefit of the security of having the locked contribution indefinitely in case my health premium increases next year or in the future. I have been an employee at this company for 5 years, and every year insurance premiums have increase by 10-15%. That was of course under the ACA, so I am essentually trying to predict the future market so I can make the best decision now.

Which do you think is the better option?",finance

There is no excuse for this and I accept all responsibility for my own actions. I am just trying to figure out the best way to tackle this debt and after reading the debt/collections wiki on the sidebar, I find myself only more confused especially with google searches yielding a lot of confusing information as well.  

Info: The debt originated from 4 credit cards. I lost my job/tried taking my own life--as a result, I (stupidly) avoided paying and was did not pay anything for 7 months now. SOL in my state is 6 years. Based on the most recent letters I have received from my credit card companies, all 4 debts have been sold to collection agencies. How do I go about reaching out to them/owning up to the debt and paying it off so I can get this huge rock off my chest? With my new current life situation, I am lucky enough to be able to devote all my earnings towards paying off these multiple debts since I have no rent and no food to pay for (have moved in with my parents, but they are not financially able to help me with this). My retail job will allow me to put 500-700 dollars per month towards this debt (with the rest going to just transportation).  

tldr: how and what is the correct process to go about this with collection agencies without screwing myself over even more than I already have and digging myself into an even shittier hole?

investing,Home Sales Falling Due to High Prices and Low Supply in Housing Markets,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-21/sales-of-existing-u-s-homes-unexpectedly-fall-to-four-month-low

Thoughts? Interesting combination of factors at play here. We have record low unemployment which is a positive for home prices, not sure how much lower it can really go. Wages should be under more pressure to increase but who knows if it will materialize. We also have rising interest rates which is a negative. There is also low housing supply which is a positive for prices. I think it will stall out the records high increases we've been seeing in housing recently.

In terms future prices what is your prediction?

My prediction: I don't think there is much more steam to be had from this economy. The market can continue to move gradually higher but eventually a peak will be reached followed by a decline. Unemployment will rise which will force people out of their homes and will increase supply to the point where home prices will have to retreat to a more sensible level. The catalyst for the decline will be rising interest rates and declines in consumer spending.",finance

1. Monero's own FUD. The community over there are going CRAZY about this, which means good business for all of us.
Heck, they even created a new 'gag' fork to confuse people about this one.  What does this mean?
I remember the good times of the Bitcoin Cash fork, and the warning from bitcoin core community. This feels harsher = good for us.

[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/kb9XUXo.png)

The Monero guys are known for doing this to all privacy coins such as Dash, Zcash, Sumokoin and others.
see - https://www.reddit.com/r/dashpay/comments/7vyuxl/why_does_the_monero_community_hate_dash_so_much/ - a VERY interesting read.


2. They seem professional, to-the-point, and development focused.
I've read the roadmap paper (https://monerov.org/MoneroV-Roadmap.pdf), asked around their telegram chat group, messages their emails, and all I got was clear answers.
They even suggest you wait out the extraction of coins until there is an open-source wallet that is checked by the Monero (and whole) community, alongside best storage practices etc.
Besides, the blockchain explorer is working, git already rolling out.


3. I'm fed up with Monero being centralized by 1-5 key ppl.
Fluffy Pony Is Monero, Monero is FluffyPony: https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/6d5yt5/what_fluffypony_just_did_is_not_ok/
At least now with supporting XMV, no one could claim authority on the coin and manipulate it.


4. They chosen the 'hard' way. Guys, if this was a grab they would've done what Monero gold did, or any other erc20 token idea out there.
They could have done a pre-sale, do a quick ICO, invest in marketing etc.. it's not the case here. They picked up a necessary fight with a vicious community.


5. Development plan seems ambitious but necessary.


In conclusion, this is going to be the best fork since BTC/BCH. I'm loving the FUD and cheer for MoneroV.
I wished they would invest more in marketing / bounty programs so that more ppl will take their side, that's all.

That's my 2 cents of a contrarian outlook.

personalfinance,What exactly to do with this windfall? (serious credit card debt issue),"**My situation:**

Debt | Amount | Limit | Interest Rate
-- | -- | -- | --
Bank1 CC1|-$29,000|$39,100|16.99%
Bank1 CC2|-$5,000|$13,000|14.24%
Bank2 CC|-$5,000|$10,500|16.99%
**Total** | **$39,000** | :(

**Total Credit Limit Across All Cards**: $76,100 (~ 51% utilization)

Asset|Amount
-- | -- 
Emergency Fund|~ $9,000
Retirement Fund|~ $130,000

**Income:** $160,000 / year.

**Context:** 
I’m a 33 y/o single male high income earner with some really poor spending habits that I am working to reign in. I finally paid down my entire student loan balance ($200K at graduation) this year, with some help from my mother who had a windfall of her own (thank you mom!!) 

Now for the credit card debt. My credit score bounces around 700-710 depending on balance, which I think right now is my largest black mark (credit score according to Credit Karma / Mint.) 

I have a one-time cash bonus from my job that I would like to put towards my debt or emergency fund. 

**What should I do with this $11,000?**

1. Pay off the Bank2 CC, a chunk of Bank1CC1, and do a balance transfer from Bank1 CC1 to Bank2 for 0% APR for 9 months, or 0.99% APR for 14 months. (And then cut up the cards and work on rapidly paying off balances). Do I need to worry about individual cards being maxed out hurting my credit more than overall balance of total credit lines? 

2. Pay off the Bank2 CC, a chunk of Bank1 CC1, _wait until my credit score goes up due to lowered utilization_, and THEN do a balance transfer from Bank1 CC1 to Bank2? Will I be offered better terms?

3.  Pay $11K of Bank1CC1, and possibly find a new bank to do a balance transfer offer with to kill Bank2 after waiting for my credit score to go up due to lowered utilization? 

4. Put more money into emergency fund? My current emergency fund is 3 maybe 4 months of living expenses if I really stretch, but the credit card payments would really kill me if I lost my job all of a sudden.

5. Pay off as much CC debt as I can and take out a loan for the entire amount of my cc debt to reduce interest rates, cut up the cards, and work hard on paying off the balances?

6. Other?

personalfinance,Missed Credit Card payments,"Hello,
Some years back (~3 years) right after I graduated from college, I didn't really have a job so I depended on my credit card to keep me fed. Due to not having an income I missed 3 months payments. Looking back this was extremely stupid. However, these missed payments still show up in my credit report and affecting my credit score negatively. Is there anything I can do to fix this issue? My credit card was a Capital One credit card. Any information or advice would be greatly appreciated.",finance
personalfinance,"Applying for my first mortgage, and I'm worried sick about debt. Give it to me straight!","My partner and I are looking to buy a two bedroom condo. The condo is $265,000 and I (solely) will be putting a $53,000 down payment (20%), and together we will be applying for a mortgage for the remainder.



We are looking for a two bedroom because we are in our late 20's (together for 7 years, lived together for 5).  We plan on getting married and having a kid within the next 5 years, so a two bedroom seems to be more plausible for us.  In addition, our thinking is that two bedrooms seem to be easier to sell, and we do not feel that the cost of a one bedroom makes enough of a difference. 



Financially I'm a little worried.  Not about monthly payments, but for being approved for a mortgage.  I currently make $55k, I'm on a 5 year contract which guarantees me a $5k raise each year (in September).  This does not include bonuses (which I'm also guaranteed for at 2k or more a year) or overtime (which I do work when given the opportunity - about once a month).  Due to some health issues last year my credit score has dropped from 720 to 625.  I'm currently $31,000 in credit card debt - that's 53% of my credit card utilization and the only negative factor on my score. While I have already paid off my student loans, and have no car loans, the debt seems overwhelming - I'm pretty financially responsible and I'm panicking.  I've been paying every penny of what is left of my paycheck after bills towards it, and I'm really trying the best that I can.  I have additional savings for any emergencies (about 10k) and I'm wondering if I should just wipe the whole thing out to pay off debt. 



My (domestic) partner who I will be applying for the mortgage with is a federal employee making $45k a year.  This does not include overtime, though with a federal job that is few and far between. He is currently $13k in debt.  It was formerly credit card debt, but he took out a debt consolidation loan through his federal credit union and got a very low rate.  So while he has 0 credit card debt, he currently has a 13k loan.   


We are attempting to set up a financial adviser through his union, but in the mean time I wanted to pick some of the brains of this group of financial geniuses. Do you think it's possible for us to get a $200k loan for this?  Are there some immediate actions that we could be taking in order to better our chances?  I know this is the age old ""have six months worth of income"" vs ""its more important to have no credit card debt"" debate for this sub, but what do you think is best for me in this situation?  I am having a hard time debating it myself, so I'm open to any ideas.  I have also been contributing about 10% of my take home pay to my savings.  Is it best to leave this 10k where it is and stop contributing to it for now?  Being young, unmarried, and without children (all things I'm hoping the future will change)  I have never not saved money, so I'm having a hard time allowing myself not to save.


** To be clear I'm not as worried about the monthly spending because of my (minimum) debt to income ratio.  While I know it will take me an entire lifetime to pay off my debt paying only minimums, my minimum payments are about 11% of my take home pay. The condo has a $740 monthly fee which includes property tax, snow removal, lawn maintenance, water, heat, cable, and internet.  This leaves my only other ""bills"" (aside from the mortgage obviously) to be: 

electricity

groceries

my phone - which my company pays for

gas - I commute to work which is paid for by my company - I drive my car about once a week and pay about $20 a month for gas if that 

All of my remaining money (and tax returns) will essentially go towards paying down debt.  This is the same for my partner as well.",finance

personalfinance,I've saved up the money to pay off credit cards but I don't understand variable interest rates enough to know that I'll be able to pay everything off fully.,"I have 2 credit cards right now that I've had balances on for almost 3 months now. Both were used to pay for some major expenses when I didn't have the cash up front. Now that I have the money, I want to pay off the cards.

1) Local city federal credit union at 12.5% with a balance of $2843.37

2) CapitalOne Platinum at 25.4% with a balance of $1840.44

My problem is that I still can't grasp how interest will effect my payment. So for example, if I go to my FCU with $2843.37 in cash and tell them I want to pay off the card, will 12.5% of that go towards interest and the rest towards principle? Or will that pay off my entire balance?

I tried calling CapitalOne to ask this question but the answer I would get from the rep was confusing - something about me getting charged interest daily and that depending on when I make the payment, a small amount would be left over.

Honestly I just really want to not have any CC debt whatsoever. I've saved money on the side for this reason specifically but now that I have it, I'm worried full payments wouldn't really be full payments. Am I going about this the wrong way?",finance
hardware,"FCC considers wireless future with high-spectrum bands, auction outlook","The Federal Communications Commission voted Feb. 22 to initiate a proceeding focused on opening up certain high-spectrum bands for commercial use that have long been considered the outermost horizon of the usable spectrum range.

The commission voted unanimously to move forward on a notice of proposed rulemaking that aims to expand access to spectrum above 95 GHz, though some also expressed reservations about the FCC's current approach to opening up more spectrum. The FCC's proposal seeks comment on making a total of 102.2 gigahertz of spectrum available for licensed point-to-point services. These bands would be licensed on a nationwide, nonexclusive basis, and a database manager would be established to keep track of licensees. The proposal also seeks comment on making a total of 15.2 gigahertz of spectrum available for unlicensed devices.

Republican FCC Commissioner Michael O'Rielly said he worried the FCC might be acting too soon on spectrum above 95 GHz given that the technology for these bands is ""nascent, to put it gently."" He added that creating rules around this spectrum ""feels like designing zoning laws for the moon.""

Meanwhile, Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, said that while the FCC has done a lot in recent months to open up new bands for exploration, it needs to turn more attention to how to get this spectrum into operators' hands.

""What we need now is not more studying and rulemaking. We need action,"" she said, calling on the commission to announce a spectrum auction and put it on the calendar.

During a press conference after the FCC's Feb. 22 open meeting, Chairman Ajit Pai reiterated that a key hurdle to holding any auction is a requirement in the Communications Act stipulating that the FCC deposit any upfront payments from bidders in spectrum auctions in ""an interest bearing account at a financial institution."" Private institutions have expressed less interest in holding these upfront payments in recent years, and public institutions have declined to set up the special purpose accounts necessary to offer such services. Pai has urged Congress to change the law so that deposits from spectrum auctions bidders can be sent to the Treasury Department.

""We need a Congressional fix in order to solve that problem,"" Pai said Feb. 22, noting that the House Energy and Commerce Committee recently moved forward on a bill that would address this issue. That bill would still need to pass the full House, the Senate and get approved by the president before it can become law.

Rosenworcel suggested during the press conference that the FCC does not necessarily need to wait for a legislative solution, however. ""We clearly found a way around [this issue] in last year's 600 MHz auction. We just need to be creative here, and our unwillingness to be creative is a choice to cede our leadership to the rest of the world,"" she said.

She noted that South Korea has a midband spectrum auction scheduled for June while ""a handful of other countries"" are also planning auctions in 2018.

Rosenworcel suggested reaching out to the banks that worked with the FCC on the recent broadcast incentive auction and placing deposits in multiple banks rather than just one as a potential strategy.

Also during the meeting, the FCC adopted a notice of proposed rulemaking that looks to implement rules around the commission's review of petitions or applications for new technologies. The rules aim to speed up the review process to comply with Section 7 of the Communications Act, which requires the commission to determine whether a newly proposed technology is in the public interest within one year of its petition or application being filed.

The commission also moved forward on its effort to streamline outdated rules, voting to eliminate rules around payphone data collection and also adopting a notice of proposed rulemaking that aims to eliminate the Broadcast Mid-Term Report for TV and radio stations. The midterm report, also known as Form 397, contains information about stations' Equal Employment Opportunity practices. According to the FCC, this form is duplicative because the information is already provided in FCC-maintained online public files.

Finally, the FCC also unveiled Feb. 22 its new national broadband map. The map is based on the data collected for the FCC's ""2018 Broadband Deployment Report,"" published earlier this month. In the report, the FCC found that as of year-end 2016, 92.3% of all Americans have access to fixed terrestrial broadband at speeds of 25 Mbps/3 Mbps, up from 89.4% in 2014 and 81.2% in 2012.

personalfinance,(CAN) Moving to the USA and have a house - do we rent or sell? Please help!,"Looking for some advice based on our current situation. I will try to provide as much background as possible.

Currently we live in Toronto and own our home. My partner recently accepted a job offer in SV and we plan to relocate there, however, we find ourselves at a crossroads over whether we should sell or rent out our home in Canada. From my perspective, while we can technically afford to rent the home out, there is a level of risk involved that makes me afraid (tenant laws in Toronto/Ontario heavily favour the tenant, it can take up to a year to evict someone for not paying with little recourse). My partner feels that we can potentially make more money on our home if we keep it for a year, and then sell it once we know we want to remain in California.

About us: we are both mid-20s, have a young child (preschool) and do not have any debt (school or credit). We are both SWE and I do not plan to get a job initially as I want to upgrade some courses and apply for a masters. We have approximately 60k in additional savings available to us (outside of RRSP, etc).

**Our home**

* Bought ~1.5 year ago for ~900k
* Current value is approx 1.1m based on comparables + appraisal
* Potential walk away is ~156k plus our original 20% DP after fees if we sell
* Potential rental income per month: $3000 based on comparables, not including utilities

Here are the expenses with running our home on a monthly basis:

* Mortgage: 2775
* Property tax: 375
* Gardener/snow removal: 154
* Garbage/City Tax: 100
* Insurance: 150
* Water: 61 

The other utilities (gas, hydro) would hopefully be paid by the tenant, but these come out to be around 150-250/month depending on season.

These figures do not include property management (~12-14% of monthly rent), which would be necessary since we are out of the country and cannot manage the home remotely. This also does not include maintenance, which we have allotted an extra conservative 800$/month. Considering these costs, and the original 3000 likely rental price, we would be subsidizing someone to live in our home under the assumption it continues to increase in value (to the tune of ~20k a year, or ~1700/month).

**The new job - figures in USD**

* Salary: 205k plus bonus, plus 55k in stock options per year
* After all of our expenses (savings acct, preschool, rent, food, etc), we are looking at a remaining ~$2500/month extra cash (the gravy). 
* If we add in the subsidy to pay the difference on the renter and account for some difference in currency, there's about $1200 left over.

The argument stems over whether we wait a year, rent out our house, and if we enjoy being in Cali, sell our home and buy something down there, or if we should attempt to sell now, take the hopeful earnings, and in the worst case, have to come back to Canada and buy a new place.

My partner's reasoning for not wanting to sell now is that if we sell, and house prices go up, we won't be able to afford even our old home in theory, we would have to pay more. My reasoning for wanting to sell is that there is a lot of risk being a landlord, and add in the fact we are not even in the same country, scares me. We also don't know what will happen with prices and if something bad happens, might get desperate just to get out. 

I don't completely object to renting in theory - I wouldn't want to sell our home just to sell, and I am looking for a fair price. On paper we can technically afford to subsidize the rent, but it makes me very uncomfortable considering we are so young and it can hurt our savings. I am also unclear about if the market will continue to go up at a good pace to justify the risk... so far YOY is at 0.3%, and interest rates are rising.

Please help me navigate this, or explain why you believe one option is better than the other.",finance

personalfinance,Taking out HELOC to pay off medical bills/pay for surgery and pay off CC debt,"I've searched but haven't found something that would quite apply to this situation.

Now they have insurance but the surgery/treatment that is needed won't be covered until reaching the $5k deductible. They are also on retired and on a fixed income with no savings, but the house is paid off. 

Would it be appropriate in this situation to take out a HELOC to pay off everything and start with a clean slate and only have to worry about paying back the loan which would presumably have a lower interest rate than the credit cards they currently have?

I had opted out of the 401k when they introduced it (dumb) but they apparently never actually did it. Left the job shortly thereafter but essentially after I left that job a date was passed where my 401k was passed to 3rd party company and turned in to a ""Conduit IRA"" until it was claimed by the owner.

Fast forward to now I get a statement about it and see that it is losing money long term on maintenance fees. I called them, went through the process with a consultant in which they called my current 401k company T Rowe Price to do a rollover. However, when in this process TRowe informed me my current 401k with my current job does not allow rollovers. The lady with my old 401k didn't really seem to want to tell me what to do further other than to contact my bank about setting up an IRA even that was wishy washy they just wanted to get off the line.



Any ideas on opening up an IRA with a bank using an old conduit IRA or if not that what other steps can/should be taken? I need to do some more research but I imagine the rules to opening an IRA is bank dependent, so it varies. My current bank is a small federal credit union.

Banking,Webster Bank Issues,"Hey guys, I need some advice. I've been using Webster Bank for my mortgage, and they have been giving me a ton of issues. Below is the latest example.

I tried to transfer money into my account in order to pay my mortgage this past month. I transferred money from my other bank account (USAA), which takes 1-3 days. Webster shows the money as in my current balance, but unavailable due to a standard 3 day money hold. Fine - understandable. The day my payment is due, I check my account to double check everything is ok. However, I find that my money is missing from my account. I never received a notification, email, or call about it. I call in, and they claim insufficient funds error - strange, I double checked I had the money. I checked USAA, the money is there. I call USAA, confirm everything is ok, and nothing was wrong. Now I'm forced to wire over the amount from USAA in order to make my mortgage payment. Now I'm stuck with wiring fees to send money, wiring fees to receive money, and a low balance fee for not having the money in my Webster account.

This isn't the first time Webster bank has pulled these shenanigans. I've had multiple unnecessary fees and other issues in the past 6 months since I purchased my house. Not to mention their customer service has been horrendous. I estimate over 5 hours have been wasted on the phone with them total... 

Is there any way to get away from this bank? If possible I'd like to shift my mortgage to another bank or something, but I don't know if that's possible without refinancing and getting a higher interest rate from the past few weeks...

Any advice is appreciated. To anyone reading: do yourself a favor and avoid Webster Bank at all costs. I have accounts at 6 different banks, and this bank is an order of magnitude worse than any other I've seen.",finance

The cost of living in the area I will be moving to is pretty intimidating to me (though my current area is expensive as well) and I’d like to get some outside advice on my financial situation. Below is my relevant financial info and further below are my specific questions. 

Current/future monthly take-home pay: $2013 / $2300 

Living situation: Currently splitting a 1-bed with my partner and hoping to do the same after moving. Partner may be able to contribute more than 50% to expenses if she is able to get a higher-paying job. 

Current assets

-No retirement savings or investments

Debt
-Student loans (in deferment): $48,863.58 with a weighted interest rate of about 5%...includes a mix of Subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans and one ~$10,000 private loan @8.125% that I would like to get rid of sooner rather than later
-no credit card debt or other forms of debt

-Total w/recreational expenses: ~$1,808/~$2,054

Questions
If you were in my situation, what would your monthly saving goal be (for both before and after the move)? 
-Part of me says that I should be very frugal since I have a significant amount of debt. Another part of me says that I should set modest saving goals and try not to stress myself out too much while my income is low- I need to stay mentally healthy during my studies in order to perform well and have a good chance of getting a high-paying position in the future, and I will be able to pay down my debt more aggressively if/when I have a better salary. 

Do you agree with my plans for how to use my savings during the coming years?: build emergency fund to 3 months mandatory + recreational expenses, then split savings between emergency fund and paying down my private loan until emergency fund reaches 6 months expenses, then focus solely on the private loan

If you were in my situation, where would you cut corners? Cutting down on restaurant food is an obvious one, but is there anything else that sticks out to you as excessive?

If you were in my situation, would you try to generate a secondary source of income? If so, what would you recommend? 
-I will definitely be busy with my PhD, but I may be able to spend a few hours per week focusing on something else, so long as it is very flexible. Some ideas I have are tutoring high school students and designing websites. I am already fairly qualified to be a tutor and I imagine there are lots of wealthy families looking for tutors in the city I will be moving to. I don’t currently have any web design skills, but I am interested in learning and my partner can help me out with this a bit, as she is a graphic designer.

Bitcoincash,CSW - Bitcoin is central banking 2.0 Statism,"https://www.yours.org/content/bitcoin-is-evolution--not-revolution-b118b792bbd8/

''The fact of the matter is that bitcoin is not anti-banking. In fact it is not even anti-central banking. What bitcoin does is take banking to a place it is never been before, one where we do not need to trust politicians not to debase the currency as they have throughout history. Bitcoin does nothing to stop central banking at all. A fully Keynesian bank can be set to run a purely bitcoin economy. I'm about as far from being a Keynesian as anyone could be, but at the same time I will tell you that bitcoin does nothing to stop a Keynesian monetary policy. A central bank basing its holdings completely on bitcoin is possible to be imagined. The only real difference with this system from what we have now is honesty. The government can take out loans in the same manner that they do today, and they can inflate the currency in the same manner that they do today but the difference is that the results of their actions will be immediately seen and not hidden for a time when it is politically expedient in the future and when it is other people's problems. A Central bank based on bitcoin has the benefit of not being able to be secretly debased'' - CSW

To begin I have consistently paid my student loans monthly for years. I am very frustrated seeing the amount of interest I am paying even though I make 2 full additional payments each year.

I am now in my mid 20's, I am very fortunate and grateful to have made ~$95k last year which gave me the opportunity to save more than I have ever thought I could at this point.  My current financial situation is as follows:

**Student loans**

* $28k student loan 1 at 6.8% interest (killing me)

* $1.6k student loan 2 at 3.6% interest

**Personal assets**

* $26k in savings

* $2k in checking | $2k tax return coming

* $7k in a 401k

**Personal debt**
*$1k on my personal bank credit card with a 7k limit
*I owe ~$2k on my car ~3.5% interest

**Side notes**

* My goal is to just pay off the 28K and then slowly pay off the 1.6k and my car which are both about the same low interest rate over time.

* I changed positions at my company and now make $75k fixed instead of ~$90k+ variable (I was in sales last year) and this was a personal decision I made as a career change.

* I am confident in my job security 

* My new salary easily covers all my living expenses and lets me still save monthly

* If there is a medical or financial emergency I do have family I could turn to for $5-10k but I would never want to ask unless I was completely desperate




So, why am I coming to you for opinions and advice?  My student loans have been something I have hated since day one.  They effect my everyday decision making and with this interest it feels like I will never pay them off unless I pay it all off at once.  Dreaming of life without student loans gives me a sense of happiness and the ability to contribute more to my retirement and savings on a monthly basis.  Additionally, it gives me the financial freedom of being debt free.  *I want to get rid of that $28k monster that has been sitting over my head for so long and I am at the point now where I can.* To me, the risk of being low on funds for a couple months and peace of mind outweighs having 28k incurring interest.  I have been very grateful and proud being able to save so much at my young age while living comfortably on my own but I would be even more proud not having this loan over my head anymore.  Yes, its hard to think 28k from my bank would immediately be gone, but at the same time it is EXTREMELY motivating for me to feel how much easier it would be to save and how much peace of mind I will have without this ball and chain around my leg.  




I would very much appreciate any help on this tough decision. I can't come up with any concrete reasons for me to NOT do this.

personalfinance,My grandmother is passing away in the near future and I'd like to keep the house we are living in. But she has a reverse mortgage and 5 kids.,"My grandmother was recently diagnosed with advanced lung cancer and will only be around for the next 12 months tops. She's currently at a long term care facility. My aunts and I pulled all the money out of her RM. 

The house is worth roughly 300k, and it's located in one of the most vied after tourist spots in the country (in Massachusetts). Housing here is incredibly hard to find, and what is put up for rent/sale is quickly taken faster than most locals are happy with. I've grown up in this house since I was a baby, spending more time here than anyone else in the family save for my grandmother. 
I'm only 21, have a fantastic FICO score, and have been out of work for the past 6-8 months. I have also been a full time student during this time. EDIT; I am about to get a job at a local CPA and am in my last semester of school. Family and friends removed from this side (my grandma and her kids) of my family have brought up to me that not only could I save this big chunk of personal history in the house, but that there is possibly a large opportunity sitting in front of me (as in renting out the house, especially in the summertime). All of my grandmas children live +300 miles away and don't have the time to maintain a home that far away. The line of credit my grandmother took out was about 160k

What do I have to worry about in this pursuit?

personalfinance,"$175 more taxes withheld in paycheck after updating federal W-4 per my company's request, but I got a $500 tax refund for 2017","In summary, my wife and I have been working for our respective companies for 4+ years now. Neither of us have updated our W-4s since starting and a lot has changed (raises, got married, bought a house).


My first paycheck in 2018 that reflected the new tax law reduced my federal income tax withheld by $48, so more money in my pocket, sweet!

My company asked me to update my federal W-4 due to the new tax law. I followed their worksheet and qualified for 1 federal exemption plus an additional withholding of ~$150 due to having a working spouse. I didn't really think much of it at the time, just assumed it would work out since I'm following the rules as outlined on the W-4 worksheet.

Now my paycheck increased my federal withholding by $166!

I'm not sure what the logic behind increasing my withholding is, especially when I have been receiving $500-$1,000 tax refunds each year for the last 4 years and we should be benefiting from a lower effective tax rate with the new brackets. 

We were in a good spot with our old withholding and I don't want to be paying into the government just to get some massive $3,000 refund next spring. 

A few more details: my wife and I file jointly as a married couple and simply take the standard deduction every year. Super simple. (our mortgage interest, property taxes, student loan interest don't exceed the standard deduction so no need to itemize). Our HH income is about $125,000 (each make about half of that)

I'm just trying to get a gut check from the PF community to see if I might be missing something obvious here or if there are options for me to get this withholding adjusted. Losing almost $400 a month in income hurts.",finance

I have a question on planning for getting another degree. I am planning on pursuing a part time MBA in the next year or two. 

I currently have no debt. $70K in 401K, $10K in Roth IRA, and $50K or so tied up in various investments (all liquid). I currently make $130-145K (depending on bonus structure). I am not in an expensive market (think rent prices in the $1600-1800s for higher end places).

I have never taken on significant debt, and I want to make sure I handle it responsibly. I likely will take on about $200K for the degree in total. I don’t plan on leaving my job. 

EDIT: this $200K includes $140K or so in tuition plus a very conservative estimate of $60K for travel/hotel expenses almost every weekend for 2-3y. 

Is it wise to pull out of my 401K as an exception to early withdrawal? Take loans for the majority and keep my investments/retirement going (assuming interest rates are low)? 

Looking to get an idea of the best first steps to start planning properly.

personalfinance,Have a substantial Federal Tax debt after closing my business. CPA is telling me to sell my house to settle with the IRS.,"Here we go: Owned a service business (S Corp) with my wife for 10 years in NC. She did the books and failed to tell me that she had not paid employee tax for the first 2 1/2 years it was open. CPA finally called me one day concerned about the debt that was stacked up. A payment plan was supposed to be arranged but never was. My 5 year old daughter also was found to have cancer so my attention was elsewhere. (She is healthy and in remission now, about to turn 8!)

IRS has placed personal liens on me because of the type of tax and since I'm signed off as the President of the business. Business has been closed as of November 2016. 

CPA recommended a Tax Attorney out of FL. Guy assured me we could make a settlement deal with the IRS. Sent him a $10k retainer and never heard from him again. Stupid. Filed police reports but no one seems to be able to do anything about it. That's a desperate issue anyway...

CPA now telling me to sell the house and with capital in hand should be able to make a settlement deal with The IRS. Debt with penalties and fees are in excess of $130k. Getting ready to put the house on the market and now CPA is back peddling saying they don't know if the IRS will accept a settlement since the Tax is considered ""Trust Fund."" CPA also tells me I cannot declare bankruptcy because if they type of tax owed. 

Worst case scenario for me is selling my house that I have earned a significant amount of equity in and can comfortably afford; being rejected by the IRS for a settlement and then liquidating the assets from the sale of the house and still being stuck with the remaining debt and essentially no credit due to all the liens. I have a family so it's not just my livelihood at stake. 

So my questions are: 

1.) Should I pursue another Tax Attorney? If anyone here has experience with this who would be the best person to contact in order to help. 

2.) Should I set up a payment plan instead of trying to settle? If so would that remove the liens? I'm going on year 7 now of destroyed credit because of this which is making any progressive steps almost impossible. 

3.) Is my CPA telling me legitimate information? Is there not a way to settle on Trust Fund debt?

4.) Any other general suggestions about resolving this situation is greatly appreciated. 

And for the record: My credit was excellent before the liens. Shame on me for trusting someone else to do the books for the business (even if it was my wife). I'm currently working now with a base salary of 67k, wife's income is about the same. I have no other debt outs side of the IRS and a small student loan. House is estimated to sell at $260k leaving me with around $80k to work with after the sale. Was going best case scenario to take a percentage of the sale to settle and use the rest as a down payment on another house.

personalfinance,Affordable Car Recommendations/Advice,"Hello All!

Since early 2015 I have been making payments on a 2014 Mitsubishi Mirage that I drive a few miles a day in the midwest. I still owe $8,500 on this car with a relatively low interest rate, and a payment of $250 with 3.5 more years on the loan. I currently pay about $100 for insurance for my car (I am a 24 year old with no accidents or tickets).

I have been thinking about getting a different car. I love efficient vehicles, but we have recently just moved to the downtown of our city and I only have to drive a few miles to work. Which I want to start walking more, but I won't be able to walk all year, since we have pretty cold, windy winters and pretty hot summers. 

Is there any way for me to get our from under this loan without just owing more money on it? I think  last time I checked they wanted to buy it back from me and leave me still owing like $4000 on my loan still, which seems like a kick in the nuts.

I really would love to get a truck to help friends move, do some woodworking projects, etc. And since we mostly take my girlfriends car on the longer trips, I don't have to worry about fuel economy. Since the Mirage only gets GREAT milage on the highway, which I rarely drive on anymore.

Any suggestions are welcome. I just feel like I am spending a lot of my income on a fairly crappy car (250 pymt + 100 insurance +30 in gas +20 maintenance on average yields $400 total/month). But it does seem like trying to get another car, even used, is just going to leave me underwater on this one for the forseeable future.

Any advice? I feel like I'm really paying too much for just a few miles/day, and I would love more money in my pocket to pay down my student loans. 

My overall costs are probably working out to like $2/mile, since I live within 2 miles of work. And the gym is the farthest I ever drive (like 8 miles round trip).

Interest: 5.625%
Years left: 12
Equity: $30-40K

However, I want to find a way to pay less than $320 a month without paying any extra, and I don't think I can extend the promotion on this card.


Is it a good idea to make minimal payments, and then open up another No Interest credit card to pay off this credit card before the 12 months are up?

* I receive the vast majority of my support from my parents, and my permanent residence is their house (abroad).
* My parents did not itemize deductions last year.
* I am 100% certain they can claim me as a dependent.
* I didn't file a federal 1040 in 2017
* I earned about $4,400 from campus jobs and an internship stipend last year, and deposited this money in my bank account.
* My parents periodically transfer money to the same account for incidentals and living expenses.
* I paid for $1,400 or so in textbooks out of this account.

I'm currently trying to figure out if I need to file an Illinois tax return. The IDOR website says I need to file if my Illinois base income - which is based on my federal AGI, after a number of adjustments that don't impact me - is over $2175.

My questions:

* As a dependent earning too little to file federal taxes, should I take any deductions into account when calculating my federal AGI?
 (this will be the same as the Illinois portion)
* If so, how much of the ~$1,400 in textbook expenses I paid using my account should I deduct as qualified educational expenses? Asking since money in the account was a mix of my earnings and transfers by my parents.
* As a dependent, I assume I'd need to consider my parents' income in calculating eligibility for tax credits (and the IRS free filing tool - parental income would me ineligible). Is this correct?

Last week, I checked my USAA account on their website, and noticed that my rate had shot up to ~$480/month.

Forex,🍻🍸THE WEEKEND🎣🍲 Weekend discussion thread,"What a week!  Big news for multiple pairs continues to confound retail traders and retail analysts. 

As always, the smart money knew where to go. 

This week, the USD once again seemed to vacillate, appearing to be weak, only to push against that needs, then when bullish news came... It sold off!!

US markets had a bullish finish right at the end, with Incredible strength going into Friday. This meant downward pressure on USD.

USD? The USD is supposed to be strong right? All of the tail end analysis seemed to predict that the US dollar was going to bolt, but the smart money acted differently. Always remember that the news that you are being fed is indicative of what analysts are saying, not what the smart money is doing.  USD did **NOT** live up to expectations this week. It completely underperformed contrary to the Fed's releas on Wednesday. As well, US markets resurged coming into Friday, almost giving the impression that the bullshit correction that we had in January is over...

JPY? Ha! The Yen once again showed that it answers to No One, pushing back against all pairs including the Mighty Dollar.

CAD took a hit on Thursday with bad Canadian core CPI numbers, but then rebounded on Friday with a very strong finish.

AUD? The analysis has been that Australian dollar has been weak weak weak, so what does the Aussie do? It gains strength against the dollar....

EUR? Eur faded throughout the majority of the week with a strong finish against the weak Friday dollar. European Union seems to lack strength this week.... do not interpret this as a week Euro. This is more likely smart money repositioning itself. Remember that the European economy is on fire right now, which means it downward pressure on the EUR.

GBP? £ demonstrated some remarkable strength this week.

investing,Are bonds really safer than stocks?,"Every article I see on investing says they are.  They usually recommend a bond fund so it's not like this is about buying and holding an individual bond.  Funds are always buying and selling so it's not like it's a guaranteed income for the full life of the bond. Interest is taxed at income rates rather than lower capital gains rate. Seems like there's a pretty significant risk of inflation exceeding generally low returns. And there's always the risk of interest rates rising.

Stocks certainly have their own risks but as long as you aren't going to liquidate when there's a downturn it seems like a safer bet. And using bonds to rebalance during a downturn just seems like trying to time the market rather than dollar cost averaging.

Even if you retired at the start of the Great Recession and your portfolio was cut in half it seems like you're better off in stocks.  Bonds wouldn't drop as much but you're not selling everything at that time.  You're only withdrawing a small percentage of your portfolio for living expenses each year.  Even if the downturn lasted years it seems like the upside of a recovery would outweigh the small returns you were getting from bonds during those years.  

I'm mainly a hands off index fund kind of investor though so not sure if I'm really interpreting things correctly.",finance

personalfinance,Wife wants to take out a loan...,"Hey everyone! Lurker for a while and now I’ve finally got a decent question for you:

So we’ve got some debt, as dumb young adults/students who weren’t taught much about budgeting. My wife’s debt is split over several cards, with different payment times and interest rates.
My wife told me this morning that she was approved for a loan for the amount she was in debt for. She told me that she’d researched through Reddit and several financial advice sites (that I cannot remember off the top of my head), and that the advice she got was to get a loan with a lower interest rate to pay off your cards and thereby isolate your debt to one entity.
We’d be able to pay off this part of our debt (~$10k) within three years at an interest rate of 17%, which is lower than the credit cards they’re on (~22-24%).
It sounds smart, but I’m just a dummy with no experience here and don’t know if it’s too good to be true. I trust my wife, but it’s important to us hat we are both on board with big decisions like this and I don’t want to commit to something like this without doing some research myself.
I’d appreciate some insight from a community that is more skilled at handling money than I am. Thanks!

Edit: So the relevant credit score is ~680. My wife has looked at getting a credit card with 0% APR to pay off instead of getting a consolidation loan, but it appears that no offers she’s found offer a credit limit in the range we would need ($10k).",finance
personalfinance,"Looking into amending taxes: correcting dependent claim makes my family eligible for nonrefundable education credits, effectively giving a net Fed+State refund of $1,600.","I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7zdedi/parents_owe_thousands_in_2017_federal_taxes_they/) earlier this week indicating that my parent's owed thousands in federal taxes, evidently due to not being able to claim my other siblings as dependents. Despite the reasoning, I was still in denial so I looked into other possible tax situations, ran the numbers again, and found out that this year my parents and sister are missing out on the $1,500 nonrefundable education credit - something they benefited from last year.

My sister graduated in the Spring of 2017 and moved back in to live at home for 7 months (more than half the year) until the end of 2017 as she was looking for full-time employment. She found stable employment near the end of 2017, which we thought at the time was enough reason for her to claim herself on her 2017 tax return (I know it should be black and white, but it wasn't obvious to us who should claim my sister). However, my parent's were still supporting her via rent, food, insurance, phone bill, etc., so my parents could also technically claim her.  In hindsight, the questionnaires I've taken on the IRS site and on TurboTax all indicate that my sister is eligible to be claimed as a dependent under my parents. And at this junction, I think this is where we messed up claiming dependents on the wrong tax return.

I helped her file her taxes already, where she claimed a personal exemption for herself. If my parent's claimed her, their tax liability would dramatic decrease due to the exemption from my sister and the [**nonrefundable education credit**](https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/tax-deductions-and-credits/what-is-the-difference-between-a-refundable-and-a-nonrefundable-credit/L5ZBHTL5Y) they would qualify for. On my sister's Form 1040A, she did not qualify for the nonrefundable education credit, because she was netting a positive tax refund as opposed to my parents, who owed ~$1,700 federal thereby benefiting from the credit. Effectively, it turns out the household would see a ~$1,600 difference to pocket from the federal and state tax refund had my parents claimed my sister. Claiming my sister under my parents' tax return is clearly a better path for us.

This was an oversight by me, the family's tax preparer, and I believe my next steps are to amend my sister's tax return. **If not, what would be my next step?** She probably already received the deposit from the IRS for federal and is still waiting for a state tax refund. If we were to amend my sister's tax return and file my parents' return, my first thought is my sister would have to pay back the IRS some money and my parents we 'recoup' some of they money after they file. I hope there's a less complicated way for the IRS to make up the difference.

We haven't filed my parents' tax return. Last year, I did have my parents claim my sister where they benefited from the exemption and the nonrefundable education credit. I can't believe I missed it this year. My sister should have been claimed by my parents this year.
Please provide insight and guide us in the right direction. Any things we should look into and questions we should be asking would be appreciated.

financialindependence,Does anyone here leverage their long-term investments?,"I know why leveraging short-term and volatile investments is a really bad idea. I'm having a bit more trouble talking myself out of leveraging long-term investments. It seems to make a lot of sense given otherwise sensible money management practices. 

For reference, the return-on-equity calculation is [return - (bank's percentage)*(loan interest)]/(your percentage). Most real estate investors are doing this. A lot of us are doing something similar by paying the minimum on our mortgage while investing in index funds, because it's more efficient to invest in an average 10% nominal/7% real return than the 3-5% nominal return from paying off the house, and we expect to be in the market long enough to get reasonably close to the average. 

Obviously margin investing is a bad idea if you were putting it all into Kodak 20 years ago, but that's what index funds are for, right? Markets lost 30% in 2008 - you'd have been out 60% of initial investment and still have to pay interest on the full borrowed amount, but if you have to sell at a low to cover costs you're probably doing it wrong anyway. In the longer run, a down year or two only costs the interest payments and the upside scales very high very fast. Depending on interest rates offered, of course. 

If we're investing instead of paying the mortgage down faster, why wouldn't we take a HELOC and invest the difference? (Or qualify for a HELOC, wait, and buy a dip with it?) It's hardly any more risky than not paying off the mortgage with our extra savings?",finance

personalfinance,Question about Debt Collection.,"Hi, apologies in advancing if this isn't flared correctly. I checked through the wiki on this and couldn't find it, if I missed it I am sorry. 

Well it is tax season and I just found that my Federal and State have been taken to cover a Student loan debt I was unaware of possessing. It doesn't show up in my credit reports and I haven't gotten any correspondence in any manner (phone, email or mail). I did ask them to verify it was mine and did receive a letter from the Collection Agency and my college confirms the debt is mine, they just for whatever reason haven't bothered to contact me about it for seven years which is largely why I have never paid on it, I flat out forgot it existed and with no contact from them I never remembered. 

Can a Collection Agency just take my Tax Returns without contacting me prior?  I received no notifications or warning that the school had sold the debt to a collections office, which apparently the office has had for about a year now. The Office hasn't contacted me either, I had to jump through phone call after phone call to find out what was going on. Is that legal? or just a shady thing they can do without issue? I live in Oregon if that assists with the answer. 

TLDR: Tax Returns taken by Debt Collection Firm without any prior contact. Is this Legal?",finance

Well, my state refund has been lagging far behind, so I decided to go ahead and amend just to be safe. I did that minutes ago, and as expected, there was no change to the federal. So that's good. I owe the state $1.00 (my original state refund, which I'm still waiting for, was $101).

CryptoCurrency,[DISCUSSION] Your U.S.A. 2017 Cryptocurrency Tax Guide :,"Warning: I am just a guy on the internet and if you believe everything you read on the internet you are going to get *burned*. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions. You were smart enough to “invest” in cryptocurrency and you should be smart enough to “research” your taxes.

It’s no joke when I say some of us “investors” are not here because we want to see cryptocurrency take over the world. We are here because we want to be filthy rich and driving a new Lamborghini for every day of the week. And the only way for U.S.A. “investors” to keep their money is to pay their taxes.

My guide below is for U.S.A. individuals who want to keep all their rightfully earned money by giving the IRS (internal revenue service) it’s share. This guide is made for those of who didn’t quite make enough to spend ($1,000-$5,000) on a tax expert but also for those who made more than a month’s worth of salary (100 to 9,999 transactions in 2017).  This guide is also for those who plan on treating their crypto-to-crypto trades as **not like-kind**. That is, a BTC -&gt; ETH trade will be counted as BTC -&gt; FIAT -&gt; ETH even if no FIAT was involved.

This guide is **not** for those of us who did any cryptocurrency mining in 2017. I am not a miner and cannot guide you through taxes for mining. **In fact, I am not qualified at all to guide anyone through taxes but you still need to pay them.**

The recipe for paying your taxes is simple and will take a weekend of your time if you are diligent. We are going to create a timeline of all your cryptocurrency events from 2017.

**Step 1)** Open a secure, non-malware invested, computer. Open excel or an excel equivalent.

**Step 2)** For each cryptocurrency you believe you traded or held onto at any point in 2017 go to [coinmarketcap.com]( https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/historical-data/) and scroll down to the tab ‘Historical Data’, change your search range to all of 2017, and copy the historical data into its own tab on your excel workbook. Label the excel sheet respectively based on what you copied. Repeat for each possible coin you held at any point in 2017.

**Step 3)** Begin listing out every cryptocurrency address you own or owned in 2017. (Nano-ledger addresses, Coinbase addresses, exchange addresses, etc.)

**Step 4)** For each cryptocurrency address in step 3 create a new spreadsheet (‘Address_1’, ‘Address_2’, ‘Address_3’, … , ‘Address_x’). Begin listing out all transactions related with each address. In the case of Bitcoin or Litecoin you are listing out all Ledger transactions or all Coinbase transactions or all Exchange transactions on a single spreadsheet because you own that account and all addresses related to that account. For other cryptocurrency like Ethereum I would use [Etherscan.io]( https://etherscan.io/) and export your addresses transactions using the websites export functionality. In your spreadsheet (‘Address_1’, ‘Address_2’, ‘Address_3’, … , ‘Address_x’) **the key columns of information you need** are going to be the following: ‘Date’, ‘Source’, ‘Action’, ‘Symbol’, ‘Volume’, ‘Currency’, ‘Price’, ‘Fee’, ‘FeeCurrency’. These columns are needed in a later step. 

Date’ = DD/MM/YYYY HH:mm:ss

‘Source’ = “Coinbase”, “LEDGER”, “EXCHANGE”, “PAPER WALLET”, etc.

‘Action’ = Buy/Sell

‘Symbol’ = ‘BTC’, ‘ETH’, ‘BCH’, ‘XRP’, etc.

‘Volume’ = Whatever amount this trade was for. (So 10 ETH and you would list 10).

‘Currency’ = This will probably always be ‘USD’

‘Price’ = Price in USD you paid per coin at the time (Use historical data).

‘Fee’ = USD preferably

‘FeeCurrency’ = USD preferably

**Step 5)** Print out (‘Address_1’, ‘Address_2’, ‘Address_3’, … , ‘Address_x’), grab a highlighter, and begin highlighting all transactions where you were moving coins from wallet A to wallet B. These are the non-taxable events from 2017. Highlight any other non-taxable events.

**Step 6)** Begin highlighting transactions that you know were trades for one coin for another. These will be your taxable events. 

**Step 7)** You are going to find out now that there are many transactions not highlighted. This is where you have to explore online sources and records to find out what the hell you were doing that Sunday morning at 3pm 9 months ago. You are the detective and this is your mission. Eventually you will give up or admit there is a mystery transaction. (Coinbase even threw me a few fake transactions that only existed in one of its reports and not the others.) For the mystery transactions that you can’t highlight you will have to decide if you want to report them to the IRS as taxable or not report them and hope that 1% change of an audit doesn’t come back to bite you. (Personally I bit the bullet and reported them as taxable events.)

**Step 8)** Begin entering all your taxable events into a single spreadsheet with the columns mentioned in step 4 above. Save this spreadsheet under a new name of type “.csv” and open a web browser.

**Step 9)** Open up [bitcoin.tax/home]( https://bitcoin.tax/home) and sign up for a premium account for 2017. (Cost = $20). It will cost $20 for each year you want but we only want 2017 today. Under the ‘trading column’ look near the bottom for a place to import our custom worksheet from step 8. Import all the data into bitcoin taxes, jump to the calculate column, pick your tax bracket for the year, pick how you want your coins to be moved around. (So first-in first-out (FIFO), first-in last-out (FILO), etc.) When everything looks sort of ok jump to reports &amp; export.

**Step 10)** Under the reports &amp; export column we want to check that your closing report matches what you actually do have in reality. If you have 10 ETH, and 1 BTC then the closing report should show you have/own that amount. If you are off by more than $100 then you probably missed a taxable transaction or entered some data wrong. So you will need to go through the “.csv” file created in step 8 and figure out what is missing or isn’t supposed to be there.

**Step 10a)** I found that my opening report was incorrect because I had trades from 2016 unaccounted for. This is where knowing your opening position is important. To make your final report accurate you need to fix your opening report or find the unaccounted for transactions in 2017.

**Step 11)** Once you have finalized everything under the Reports &amp; Export tab hit download and select the format for TurboTax (CD/Download). Head over to [TurboTax CD/Download]( https://turbotax.intuit.com/personal-taxes/cd-download/) and follow the steps to get the software based on your situation. Based on my tax situation and wanting TurboTax to take care of my state taxes I selected the Deluxe software for $70. Once you get started with TurboTax you will eventually arrive at a screen with tabs at the top. Have TurboTax walk you through everything but once you get to ‘Federal Taxes’ under ‘Investment Income’ you can add your exported spreadsheet from Bitcointax under ‘Stocks, Mutual Funds, Bonds, and Other’.

Step 12) TurboTax will walk you through everything else, submit your federal form, submit your state form, and rest in peace knowing even if an audit comes you did your best keeping the IRS happy and they might go easy on you.

Noob Notes: I was surprised to find out capital gains count as part of my adjusted gross income even though they are taxed differently. So I was bumped up a bracket which changed how I was taxed. I was also surprised to find that I now owed even more in state taxes because of this. Other than that everything went smoothly and I hope your journey goes well also.

I’ll be in and out all weekend to answer questions for you guys and if you need some help doing excel scripting I’ll be glad to help you for free to the best of my ability. (Of course I expect you to do the leg work and get your transactions listed out.) One big issue I found was Poloniex exported trades sheet wasn’t quite accurate when importing into bitcointaxes so I created an excel script to separate each trade out as Coin1 -&gt; Fiat and Fiat -&gt; Coin 2 based on historical prices.

Thank you for your time and good luck in 2018.",cryptocurrency
investing,Non-bank mortgage lenders taking on riskier mortgages while traditional banks shy away,"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-02-23/mortgage-loans-the-market-is-moving-into-the-shadows

&gt; Well, much of the regulation doesn’t apply to non-bank lenders, which typically originate mortgages and quickly sell them onward to be packaged into securities for investors. These “shadow banks” don’t take deposits, don’t have much capital, and are usually overseen by state banking authorities, which tend to be less stringent. They are also considerably more aggressive than their bank counterparts.

&gt; By operating with less capital, they can reap very large returns in good times. In bad times, however, they might not have the capacity to withstand losses or deal with the servicing burden created by widespread delinquencies. As a result, a large swathe of the country’s lending and servicing system could implode when the next crisis hits.

&gt; The shift has been even more extreme in mortgage servicing. Non-banks now service about 51 percent of all loans packaged into new Freddie Mac securities, according to mortgage analytics firm Recursion Co. That’s more than double the share of just five years ago. For securitized FHA loans, the share stands at a staggering 83 percent. Again, banks are leaving the business: Last year, CitiMortgage announced it would exit by the end of this year, transferring the servicing rights for about 780,000 mortgages.

&gt; The average FICO score at origination stood at 730 at the end of 2017, down from 750 five years earlier. For loans guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration -- an area where the non-banks’ share is greatest -- the average FICO score has fallen to 680.

And an article from last year mentioned about the rise of non-bank mortgage lenders such as Quicken Loans: https://www.washingtonpost.com/realestate/the-mortgage-market-is-now-dominated-by-nonbank-lenders/2017/02/22/9c6bf5fc-d1f5-11e6-a783-cd3fa950f2fd_story.html?utm_term=.6b6794e2b5a0

&gt; In 2011, 50 percent of all new mortgage money was loaned by the three biggest banks in the United States: JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. But by September 2016, the share of loans by these three big banks dropped to 21 percent.

&gt; At the same time, six of the top 10 largest lenders by volume were non-banks, such as Quicken Loans, loanDepot and PHH Mortgage, compared with just two of the top 10 in 2011.

&gt; “Now banks only approve ‘perfect’ loans, not ‘good-enough’ loans,” Taylor says. “This created an opportunity for non-banks that focus entirely on mortgages and are less regulated than big banks.”

Although there was this paragraph (and rest of the article) that sorta rebutted the article's initial warnings:

&gt; “This time around, the non-bank lenders are not being reckless,” Sharga says. “Some offer loans to borrowers with lower FICO scores, but they are still not making risky loans. Consumers are benefiting from non-banks because they offer more opportunities to borrowers who are not perfect.”

&gt; “Higher interest rates will cause funding costs to rise for non-banks, since they have to borrow money from capital markets to make their loans,” says Navigant Consulting’s Noring. “That could mean a rebalancing among lenders because banks fund their loans with deposits.”

TLDR: Traditional banks are unwilling to take on the same risks as pre-2007, and some even left the business. Meanwhile non-bank mortgage lenders are expanding into the high risk mortgage business, and instead of using banking deposits to back the mortgages, they're borrowing money themselves to make the mortgages.",finance

You currently have an outstanding debt with the central collection Unit, state of Maryland. 
This letter is to inform you that any federal vendor payments to which you may be entitled will be applied to this debt unless you make satisfactory arrangements within 60 days to resolve this matter. You can avoid this offset of federal vendor payments by entering into a remaining current with a payment arrangement. However, the balance must be paid in full to avoid the offset for your federal vendor payments. The balance above reflects the current balance due; however, interest will continue to accrue. Additionally, the department of treasury charges 17$ fee for each payment offset which will be deducted from your payment amount.”

personalfinance,how likely am i to be audited?[taxes],"let me start off with I didn't do too much research before filing, and this is the first year i did some side engineering work.

i filed a few days i got my W2's from my main employer. I also got a 1099. i ended up owing a couple hundred, but not too much. i told a friend about it and he said i should itemize my deductions. my only deductions are include: laptop, and car mileage. with the car mileage and laptop imputed, federal and state will give me a what I owe + few dollars.

i think i have a few possible red flags when i amend. The laptop i bought (bought late this year), didn't have enough fire power for the work i was doing so i returned it and got a higher model (and more expensive one). this was bought early this year. The car i use is a personal car, and my only car btw, it's a more upscale car (06 BMW M3). i kinda put a lot of miles on it almost 3k.

TL;DR i bought an expensive as laptop for work, which didn't have enough fire power so i bought a more expensive one this year. i put almost 3k miles on a on a upscale sporty-ish car. both of these will have the state and federal owe me a couple hundred dollars, which has me freaked out.",finance
personalfinance,Advice needed: I’m debating whether or not I should take money out of my ROTH IRA to pay off my student loan.,"I’m 32, I have about $115,000 in retirement savings ($25,000 in ROTH) and about $20,000 in student loans. My loan is a federal loan at 5.85% interest rate. This would be my last debt other than my mortgage. If I did this I would continue to max out as many of my retirement accounts as possible (Roth IRA, SIMPLE IRA and HSA) while also saving to replace my car with cash in about 2 years.

personalfinance,Separation - What to do with the house?,"Hey All - need done advice on what to do with the house after separation.

House in Darwin Australia - bought for 590k,  big deposit 510k remaining. 

We've only ever paid interest only - so no equity. 

My wife is moving out and renting and doesn't want the house so I can accept it and take responsibly for the mortgage if I want. 

My question... is that even smart?  

The house market is in a slump at the moment and the house would be worth mid high 400s to a buyer.

I do make good money - but I could have bulk cash flow if I just house shared. 

If I want to split responsibility for the house with the wife I must make a decision keep or sell.

Unfortunately my wife's affordability is low and any extra debt split after selling the house could bankrupt her - which I hear pushes the house debt over to me anyway plus making life hard for her. 

Also interest rates are very low right now - which means they can only go up...

I want to be a good guy - but also I dont want to inherit a ball and chain (pun intended) with this house of now is the time to split....

personalfinance,Investing Advice - 29 Years Old,"Hi All -
I'm trying to get some insight in sensible investment strategies. My wife and I have a gross income of roughly $148 per year (she's 27 &amp; I'm 29). We have roughly $70k in IRAs/401ks and $98k working in a Money Market Account. We have a $158k mortgage, along with $12k in student loan debt and about $18k in loan debt on our cars. 
The student loan debt will be paid off relatively soon as it's at a 6.8% interest rate. 
What investment strategies are suitable for the cash working in the money market account? Inflation alone, will continually eat away at any future returns. 
Personally, I'd like to get our cash position down to 7 to 8 months of expenses, but finding a suitable investment has been a challenge. 
What, in your opinion, is the best way to go, given that CD rates aren't really viable? I'm leaning towards allocating at least a portion towards an index fund.

personalfinance,"5 years into PSLF, expecting windfall soon. Pay off loans or continue towards PSLF?","So to start off, I'm not actually looking for advice on my overall financial picture and what to do with the windfall; rather trying to determine how much I would end up spending if I continue paying IBR for the next 5 years and have the rest forgiven versus paying off the total now.

**Current Fedloan balance is about $24,000** between 5 loans, they are consolidated and all eligible to be forgiven via PSLF. 

I submit the employer certification form every year. **I currently have about 60 qualifying payments of the 120 required for forgiveness so I have 5 years left.** My job is extremely stable; I know everyone says that but I work for an essential government service that isn't going away any time soon, so if you can suspend your disbelief, let's say it's certain I will have this job for at least the next 5 years.

**Interest rates range from 5.1% to 6.55%. Current monthly payment is $230/month**, but I think this is what it will stay at even as my income goes up. My income went up last year but monthly payment stayed the same, so I think I'm at the max for my loan amounts. I will verify this on Monday with FedLoan is open.

My plan was to continue paying the IBR amount until eligible for forgiveness in 5 years.

However, I am now expecting a **windfall of about $50k** in the next few months. This will be what I receive net after all expenses/taxes/etc. I would be able to pay off the federal loans, but it would be a substantial chunk of my windfall. If continuing towards forgiveness would mean *less* money spent overall, I will do that. Otherwise I will pay them off now.

**How do I determine how much I would spend if I wait for forgiveness vs paying off the full loan balance right now?** 

Is it as simple as $230 x 60 months = $13,800, which is less than the current total balance $24,000, so I should wait for forgiveness? I just want to confirm this with people smarter than me before I spend the next 5 years paying and then realize I made a really dumb mistake.

(This obviously depends on whether I'm correct that my monthly payment won't ever go higher than $230, but I can't verify that until Monday when Fedloan is open).",finance
personalfinance,On the financial brink... Should we sell our home?,"**UPDATE** Thank you everyone for the wake-up call, and I apologize for any defensiveness. I realize I've been numb to the situation and the truth hurts. This was my first time really taking a hard look at our financial situation because I've been in denial about it. When my husband came home from work we retooled our budget based on a low-end income month and found $1000 worth of overspending on groceries, sundries and current bills that can be cut back immediately if we are ruthless (some I didn't know was going out). I will be putting out feelers to nanny another baby in the neighborhood, I know many families in our area need childcare and I think I can bring in $700/mo that way. My dad called and offered to pay $1500 on our deductible for my car that was sideswiped on Tuesday in a hit and run. I don't think it will be that high, but this is the expenditure I thought would bring us down for sure. There's a light at the end of the tunnel, now. 

Our plan is to see what hubby's March paychecks look like (can't be lower than this past month) and set aside what we can in an emergency fund until we have 3 months' expenses saved. We'll call our lenders next week and work out payment plans for those we are behind on, using the Dave Ramsey method for the rest - paying off the smallest first and so on. We feel we can't move right now because it would be counterproductive to come up with first and last month's rent when we have to get our credit scores up anyway. We will refinance ASAP to remove the PMI from our payment. My sister's wedding is a ""we'll see"" for the time being, but I understand those who say it shouldn't be a thought. My husband is officiating and we're all in the wedding, so it's more complicated than just saying ""can't make it"". Maybe my dad will put the $1500 there if needed. We'd like to see a financial advisor but we're concerned that it will cost us money on top of everything else- that's why I started here, but we'll look into it tomorrow. I welcome any thoughts on this plan and again, thank you for being honest with me! 

*****

TL/DR: Husband took a pay cut and we are sinking under $2500 mortgage payment, $150k in student loans, $25k in high interest credit. No retirement, savings or investments. Won't be able to pay bills next month. Do we try to sell the house or is there another way?

Background: My husband (37) and I (35) married young and immediately had a baby, per the religious beliefs we were brought up with. His first job was in ministry making $13k per year, and we lived on student loans as he worked on his master's in religion. We both attended expensive private universities, his parents didn't help him at all, I never finished my degree, and after two ministry jobs in southern California we had no savings, no insurance, no retirement and $200k in debt to show for it. Our parents taught us nothing about finances and we lived paycheck to paycheck or worse the entire time.

We moved from SoCal to a less expensive state but hubby could not find a job in his field and we both worked in retail for a year, barely putting food on the table with our ever-mounting bills. A friend came through with a job lead and we moved to a small town in the south so hubby could take an administrative role at a religious university. It paid peanuts, but more than what we were making before. He lost that job after a couple of years as we were in the process of leaving our church. #noregrets

We moved to a major metropolitan area in the same state and because of hubby's education and a random neighbor connection, he was able to land a sales job at a great company with good benefits. He was bringing in $120-150k with commission. We played catch-up, tried to pay down some debt, but it always felt like we were barely keeping our heads above water even living pretty frugally. (Low rent for the area, no vacations, no crazy shopping or huge car payments.) We had two more babies because we felt like things could only get better and he was on a good trajectory at work: two promotions in three years. His insurance is great but takes about $1100/month out of his paycheck. We bought a house when our lease was up and interest rates were down. (Top of our FHA loan budget at $310k but low price for the area, great neighborhood, coveted school district.) House payment was $2200 because we only put like, $12,000 down and we bought in a MUD district so tax is a bit higher. We've probably earned $50k in equity in 2.5 years looking at neighborhood comps.

Immediately after purchasing the home, hubby was promoted into a director position that is not commission-based, but dependent on the total sales of his ""store"". His salary increased our yearly income at first, but in the process we saw 6 months where his checks were half of what they had been, and we whittled away at our savings and fell behind in some payments. By Christmas of that year, we had opened a few new credit cards and maxed them. We refinanced our house last January but because of a combination of being financially illiterate and our previous mortgage company screwing something up, our payment actually went up to $2500. We were able to skip two payments and that helped during a couple of bad months, but when the payments kicked back in we were swamped. Refinanced for $314k and still owe $309k, so I don't think we could even try to get a home equity loan to pay down debt.

I've had on-and-off low paying part time jobs and recently applied for a telecommuting admin. assistant position but didn't get it. With three kids and one not in school, it's made more sense for me to stay home than try to pay for childcare. It's been all famine, no feast since last year and last month was the first month we've had to choose groceries over credit card payments. We are ""robbing Peter to pay Paul"" and have borrowed from family and taken out payday loans. In the ""good"" three months out of the year we are earning $7k, half of hubby's best commission checks. In the bad months we are earning $5k. House-related bills are about $3k and our debt-to-income and credit are shot, so obviously we're in over our heads. We've had a lot of little emergencies/bad luck situations over the year with a sick pet, I had a hit-and-run ordeal with an 18 wheeler and someone rear-ended me, just stupid stuff that set us back. My sister is getting married in June and we have to fly the whole family across the country. I'm dreading figuring that out.  

Should we try to sell our house and rent something smaller and more affordable in our school district so we don't have to switch our kids' schools? Our credit is crap right now, high 500's/low 600's so I don't even know if we could find a rental in our competitive area and apartment prices aren't much better. I don't think there's any way to pull our credit up right now to even buy a much smaller place. We are in a two story, 2700 sq.ft. and could get by with much less. We never thought we were being extravagant when we built our home because the homes around us are all 3000 sq.ft. or more, and we went with an entry-level builder.

Just feels like everything's hitting the fan and we don't know where to start to try and fix this. We've trimmed our budget again and again, it's the high interest credit and our low credit scores that are killing us. At this moment we have about $150k in loan debt, $25k in credit debt, no retirement, no savings, and $50 in the bank. One more month will sink us. Hubby spoke to his boss months ago about the issue and asked for a guarantee but the request is still floating around in corporate meetings, I guess. We are actively looking for another job but he would take a pay cut anywhere he went so we wonder if it's best to stick it out where he is. I'm constantly looking for part-time work and doing all I can to watch the budget, sell stuff we don't need, barely leave the house to save gas, etc... Hubby works 12-14 hrs per day plus Saturdays so it's hard to find anything flexible enough to accommodate that schedule. I put a lot of research into selling on Amazon but I'd have to spend money to make money, and there's no money to spend. I honest to God think the autoimmune disorder I've come down with is because of all of the financial stress. It's killing me.

personalfinance,Married Couple Buying a House in Seattle,"My wife and I are looking to buy a house in the Seattle area, where housing prices are appreciating like it’s 2007.  We have been thinking of purchasing around August of this year.  Until then we decided to start looking at open houses to see what we’ll be looking at.  At one of the houses today we spoke with a mortgage lender who STRONGLY suggested we buy soon versus waiting till later in the year.  And that we should look at an 80/10/10 loan.  He said with interest rates rising and the housing prices here, any additional savings for a down payment between now and then is a drop in the bucket.  We save at a rate of about 3000 a month.  We have 75K currently.  Looking to buy around a 650K house.  I have a foreclosure that was finalized in may of 2013 and I have a 720ish credit rating.

personalfinance,Unexpected taxes in return,"Hello /r/personalfinance,

Decided to get the taxes done today and upon uploaded my documents I noticed several odd things popping up.

First off my w-2 reported I owed $300ish. This is odd since my situation hasn't changed from the last couple years, same income, same job, no major filling changes, and I always got a return of around $1000. Suddenly I owe money? According to a quick calculator online I would owe 10,800ish in federal taxes, I withheld $11890, so I assumed that I would at least not owe anything? Unsure of how to calculate social security/medicare withholdings but I assume my employer calculated those correctly as they have in previous years.

Second I was getting fined for ""early withdrawal or excess contributions"" to a retirement account. I was putting 10% if my income automatically into my 401k and did $5450 into my Roth IRA and made no withdrawals from either. Not really sure where this is coming from.

Third Turbo Tax is telling me that I am missing forms such as a 1040 Long form. Not really sure what any of these are. That specific one is an individual income form? Is that different from my W2?

Unsure what is going on here. As far as I know nothing about my situation has changed from last year but the return seems to be drastically different somehow...",finance
personalfinance,At crossroads,"Hi... Like many around here, I read a lot of your great advises, learn and apply to my life but I comment very little if anything. 

 So now my question, it is kind of lame that I do not have anyone around that I can ask and actually trust for advice, other than my spouse that is. See I live somewhere in Canada but I am from Los Angeles area. Moved here because my wife is from here and she missed Canada at some point.

  When I moved I decided I wanted to change my career and I became a carpenter. I started at the bottom, went to school and got my Jman ticket and red seal certification. I did all this with one company, the first people that hired me. I am happy because we do a lot of different projects, specially for the city. This has given me experience in many areas of construction. I always liked school, I am not the best but I love the challenge, so now I have decided I want to get a blue seal certification and a go back to University to get a business degree as I work. The problem is that the company I work for would not be big enough for what I want to do. The only career path I have is superintendent and then project manager. 

  A friend of mine is offering me a job with a way bigger company, better pay, better benefits, very interesting projects, lots of room to grow but I am kind of afraid of leaving as I am very used to this company that I have worked for  over six years. 

  We never ask or expect a raised because on the few meetings we have we are told we are just lucky to have a job and the reason we can keep the company busy is because of the lower labor cost. But the jobs we have been working on the past years are massive. We are always understaffed, overworked, we are not given the tools or material we need most of the time. I am getting tired of this. But I am afraid that if I leave the company, things are really worst out there. 

  I guess another sign is that people that have worked for the company for more than 15 years, are leaving because they do not Ike the course it is taking.

  My gut feeling tells me to leave... Am I making a mistake?",finance

I am also a property owner who pays about $6k in property taxes with $11k in interest for my mortgage. I'm also in the lovely CA where my state taxes come to about $6k. My financial situation will be similar for 2018. 

In both 2016 and 2017, after filing my income taxes, I got around $5k total from a state and federal income tax refund. I want to increase my allowances on W4 but don't know the right number to adjust to (the IRS calculator is down). 

With 2018 taxes, I will surely hit the $10k SALT cap (boo!) and add another $10k in mortgage interest to go above the standard deduction of $12k. From what I've been reading online, I should equate 1 allowance to roughly $4k. The difference between the tax deductions from $12k to $20k is $8k; does this mean I should up my total allowances at work to 4? 

Hoping to get a sanity check since I've been doing my tax game wrong. As a 28-year-old, I did not learn that it's better to owe $0 or a little something from income taxes versus getting a refund. I'm still salty about having to report the income tax refund on my 1040.",finance
personalfinance,Taxes - Filing jointly vs separately?,"I’m filing our taxes for the first time since we’ve been married and since I’ve been employed full time for the entire year.

Jointly

What I understand is that on my W4s, I may have reported that I could be ""claimed as a dependent"" for my first 2 jobs and not my current job. I was not sure I was a dependent during that time period but I was worried something bad would happen if my mother was erroneously claiming me. My current pay stubs say I put down Single and two allowances, and no federal tax was apparently withheld but ss tax, Medicare tax, state tax was.

Both years that I have filed, I made a pretty negligible amount of money and got all federal and state taxes returned to me. I made a similar amount this year, so after I file, I am expecting the entire federal and state tax back from my summer 2017 job, and then just the state tax back from my current job.

SO I am mostly trying to set things straight in my head after this misunderstanding. 1. Is everything that I said correct/possible and make sense logically? 2. Just the difference in one question, whether I am a dependent, is enough to cause them not to withhold federal taxes for me? I previously thought that tax was withheld by default and I had to explicitly request not to withhold taxes if I wanted that. 3. I always thought that social security tax and federal tax were the same amount, as in the same lump of money with 2 different labels. Now I guess that's not true. So if my W2 has ""189.20"" under Federal taxes withheld, and the same number under SS taxes withheld, that means they took 189.20 x 2 out of my paycheck for the year? And I will not get the amount under SS tax returned to me, no matter how little I make. 4. It is normal to have different #s for federal and state allowances right? I am in NM if it matters. 5. If I report by W4 to my employer, or I report to (the IRS?) when I file my taxes, that I can not be claimed as a dependent and then someone DOES claim me, are there any consequences? I have seen a few posts that say ""dependents"" have no say in who does or doesn't claim them beyond reporting fraud.

Thanks so much for any help, I am used to understanding things 100% and am kind of shaken right now since I have been teaching myself and my roommates how to do taxes.",finance

personalfinance,(IL) Owed State tax for the first time. How do I adjust this?,"I don't have a crazy tax situation, just my standard income (55k 2017) and a couple 1099-INT. I live in an apartment so no property taxes or anything else. I'm filing single and 1. But this year I owed $99 on my state taxes. Not a big deal, but I'd like to get a minimal refund back just so there are no surprises. I have a raise that took effect early this year so if my withholdings are off I'd like to fix it so next year I don't have a surprise state bill that will be hard to swallow. I checked my payroll department online and I can adjust my federal withholding, but nothing about state.

personalfinance,What to pay off?,"hey guys, so im trying to make up my mind on a few things. 

I have my car loan at $9,000 and I have a few credit cards totaling at $3000. Also, I did 1099 work last year and it looks like I owe money. I will find out Monday but my tax guy said it might be about $3,000 that I might owe (I made about 17,000 I added some expenses and he said he would help me out to bring the payment lower of what it is he will explain more on Monday and I can update this as well). 

My question is what would benefit to pay off first. I feel like my car would be a huge load off my back. Monthly payments are $330 with an interest rate at 4%. Should I refinance first before doing that if I go that route? I think I can turn around and use that money ($330) to aggressively pay off my credit cards. 

Savings- I have $8000 and will have $9000 on Friday. This is my emergency fund too sort of.

personalfinance,Filing taxes. Form 1099-MISC income earned in a different state than currently residing. Where/How to file?,"Ok I will try my best to explain this. So I went to college in the state of Virginia. First few months of 2017 I made some YouTube videos and I ended up earning approx. $2500. I stopped YouTube after I graduated, half way through the year of 2017, and moved to state of CT for my first job.

It was the income I earned when I was living there. Now I live in CT, so how should I go about filing this? Right now I am using FreeTaxUSA to file my federal return if that helps.

Also since this was just a few months hobby for me and I ended up earning some money, do I get to itemize some deduction so I can increase my total refund back? Was just wondering but probably won't do it cause it seems lot of hassle and I don't think I had much of an expense anyway haha",finance
personalfinance,Can I have more than one health insurance policy?,"I'm relatively new to the whole insurance/adulting thing, so forgive me if this sounds like a dumb question. Last year I received insurance via ACA/marketplace and had amazing coverage. I did have to pay part of the premium per month, but it was manageable because my copays for seeing my doctor, prescriptions, therapy, etc. were so cheap. This past November I received employment where I receive totally free health, vision and dental insurance. This is through a different insurance provider. Unfortunately while I don't have to shell out money for a portion of the premium every month, the copays are significantly more expensive and are costing me a ton up front. I haven't done the number crunching yet, but I'm fairly certain that despite my employer insurance being free, the insurance I had via ACA is far less expensive and way more manageable given the amount of money I have to spend on copays using my employer's insurance.

I forgot to cancel the ACA coverage which automatically renewed in January, so the plan is still technically active. I would prefer to start going back to using this insurance (especially since my former therapist is only in network with it) but I don't know if I can have both at the same time, or if ACA would make me cancel due to having ""free"" employer's insurance. If anyone has any thoughts or advice on how to figure this out, please let me know. Thanks!

TL;DR - Had better insurance through ACA last year, employer's insurance premium is free but copays are out of my budget. ACA policy never got canceled, am I able to keep it active and have both?

Edit: For reference, here are some numerical examples.

Income: 20-25k per year (yikes)

Average # of doctor's visits per year: 6-9
Average # of mental health specialist visits per year: 18-24

Insurance Plan ACA: $5 copay per doctor's visit, $5 mental health specialist visit; monthly payment of $65 towards premium (the full monthly premium is around 365, and I only had $300 deducted from my federal tax return funds due to my income)
Insurance Plan Employer: $30 copay per doctor's visit, $60 mental health specialist visit; no monthly payment",finance

CryptoCurrency,Why I like COBINHOOD,"Personally, I'm new to the ""Crypto"" game, and have only been active in it since November of last year. I generally use Kucoin and Binance, of course, however, I stumbled upon COBINHOOD and came to really grow on it. COBINHOOD is a zero trading fee Cryptocurrency Exchange [I mean real zero trading fees, you don't need to be holder of their token or a ""membership"" user for it at all] with a very solid team backing behind it with a great amount of determination for making sure the exchange is a success and the users are absolutely satisfied. Another great thing is the lack of selfishness, as the exchange is primarily user oriented, they take no commission from your trades/transactions and they **listen** to suggestions and constructive criticism. The token is another aspect, built towards the users, as they have an ""underwriting service"" where they host ICOs and holders of the ""COB"" token can get what is essentially an ""airdrop"" from these ICOs. Does CyberMiles ring a bell? Yeah, COBINHOOD underwrote that, and for every 500 COBs holders owned, they were granted 23 CMT (and it only cost a 1 COB fee to claim all of your CMT!) This is entirely based on my personal opinion but I would definitely say they're worth checking out, they may be in their early phases, but it's been growing, exponentially since launch day....

(The summary below is a copy-paste from the Telegram) 

The COBINHOOD exchange is **secure** [Includes multi-level asset security _ i.e Encrypted, offline multisignature wallet Cold-wallets], **insured** [Crypto assets stored in the Hot-wallet, in case of possible yet unlikely breaches], has high **flash crash prevention** [Risk management, Machine learning, and trading engine] and **breach prevention** [Leak-proofed KYC framework and database], a **daily reconciliation system and database check**, and a team + advisory team of reputable individuals and experts. COBINHOOD offers zero trading fees (and zero deposit fees) for any and all users, and puts the security and ease of use for the users as a priority. Along with that, we have an easy to use mobile app for iOS and Android that will regularly receive new updates. Furthermore, COBINHOOD provides an underwriting service [An ""ICO hosting platform"" in a sense] in which we facilitate the progression of an ICO/IEO by allotting professional advertisement/communication/technological/legal/ and listing service. The platform also intends to implement fiat to crypto trading and vice versa [Subject to bank cooperations and regulatory affairs], regularly list new tokens/coins (aiming for weekly) a margin trading program, and plans to develop a DEX that runs coexistingly w/ the centralized exchange. //",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,American considering graduate school in France seeking clarification for federal student aid for graduate students.,"Hello. I am a 27 year old American. I have been out of university for about 5 years now and working since. I recently made the decision to apply to graduate schools and one of them that I got into was in France, Sciences Po in Paris to be specific. I feel it is my best option based on the contents of the degree and the opportunity it presents (live abroad, new language, reputation of the school, lower tuition than in the States).

However, I do not presently have the money to pay tuition and living cost myself so I will be relying on federal aid. I was hoping that this sub could give me some clarification on 1) what types of student loans I am eligible for 2) what the loans can be used for 3) what is expected as far as repayment. I have already applied for a Sciences Po scholarship by the way. 

As I understand it, as a graduate student, I would eligible for unsubsidized direct loan(s) to cover tuition and PLUS loan(s) for living expenses (the amount of which would be cost of attendance - any other aid I receive, including the unsubsidized direct loan). There is an annual cap on the unsubsidized direct loan BUT NOT for the PLUS loan.  

When I did some back-of-the-napkin math, the maximum amount of the PLUS loan did not cover my projected annual living budget. So I am concerned. 

I know that is a lot and I thank you for bearing with me. Thanks.",finance
personalfinance,Rent out or Sell,"My fiance (to be married later this year) and I will be moving out of the state for her graduate school in the next 5 months. She has owned a new townhome for the last two years, and we currently live there. The townhome is in a very rapidly growing suburb (top 20 fastest growing towns in America over 50,000 in population). There are a ton of townhomes being built in this town.Her graduate school is going to be fairly expensive, with about half of it being covered by un-subsidized federal loans, and the other half would have to be covered by direct+ loans etc. While she is in grad school, we won't have a lot of disposable income as we will both be living on my salary (around 70k gross per year) in a fairly expensive part of the country.

After her graduate school (2 years from when we move) we would both like to end up in the area we currently live in (but you never know where life will take you). So we have two options, and my question to you all is, which option would you do?

Option 1: Sell the townhome. Should be be able to come out about $2,000 over what the home cost her when she bought it (after commission and any other selling costs). We would have the equity, about $45,000, to avoid any high-interest loans on her graduate school, and we would save/invest the rest for a future down-payment on a home.

Option 2: Rent out the townhome. Based on similar rentals in the area, we think we could get the mortgage+property taxes+HOA fees+utilities we would have to pay in rent each month. We don't have any friends that are in a position to move into the home as renters, so we would just put it up on the market and see what we get. Neither of us have had rental property in the past, so this would be completely new to us and we'd probably pay a relative in the area to maintain the property. After my fiance's grad school we could either sell the townhome, move into it if we are moving back into the area, or keep renting it out.

My wife paid $6,382.10 Fed, $3,671.65 SS, $858.69 Med, $1,933.57 State.

I hadn't plugged in any other numbers but already it was saying we would owe around 5k to the fed and 1,800 to the state.  This seems crazy but we had the same problem last year.

I realized I was stupidly claiming 1 allowance on my w4 so that's been corrected for 2018, I know that's probably the source of the problem but it still seems like we owe a ton for just one allowance on mine?  I haven't seen my wife's w4 but she says she always marks zero.

Should i seek a professional's help rather than filing on my own again?  Is the owed amount likely to be what Turbotax initially said?  We almost always use the standard deduction because we don't own a house and don't have a ton of things to deduct.  She gets a small amount from dividends off an old investment and pays a lot in student loans each year if that matters?  We also paid around 10k for our kid's daycare but I hadn't thought that was likely change things much since we didn't use a flex spending account or anything like that.

His uncle is bringing the money specifically for my SO and his brother (stated by the dad) physically from Vietnam. My SO's dad left 38k for them - 22k is first being brought over, then the leftover 16k later. My SO is in a dilemma on what to do with this money.


Here's a list of the current status of my SO and his household family:


-My 26 y/o SO, me (just recently moved), his mother, his 21 y/o brother, and a good friend living as a tenant are currently living in this house in the Bay area of CA.

-My SO has a good paying contract job (~30/hr) for now, but he only has a year left. He's not sure if the company will hire him full time in a year. I just started a salaried job (53k). His mom works min wage ($8/hr) with tips. His brother is not working and is still a student. He will be transferring to a uni and will most likely be covered for most.


-The house has a mortgage of $200k. The current monthly payments and interest rate I'm not sure about (I think 1-2k?), but the house will be paid off by 2040. It's in a comfortable spot right now. My SO co-signed the loan. He has amazing credit score right now.


-His mother is bad with money.

What should my SO do? Keep the money for him and his brother, or pay off some of the house to lessen the burden on his mom, or do both and split the money that way?

I will edit my post when I get information about the mortgage.

personalfinance,Should I focus on paying down loan principal or adding to savings?,"I am 26 years old &amp; currently paying back an informal loan from my parents for my grad school education. Currently, based on the agreement we made, the principal is at a little over $25,000 at a 5% interest rate per year, with 9 years left &amp; I have been paying $300 a month back to my parents. I feel very fortunate in that I have a good relationship with my parents, and this is the kind of situation where if anything terrible were to happen - say I was out of work for several months - they would allow me to temporarily pause payments until I was back on my feet.

I got a raise in January which increases my take-home pay by a little over $500 a month for achieving professional licensure.

Since the raise I have increased my monthly savings contributions. I now contribute $150 to a 401k at work (no matching), $150 to a Roth IRA, and $350 to personal savings. I currently have a 6 month emergency fund saved up in a personal savings account and I am also saving to pursue a pilots license.

I am trying to curb lifestyle creep, so after allowing for a slight increase in my discretionary spending budget, I now have about $100 extra in my budget every month. &amp; soon to be more as I expect an additional raise in July at my annual review.

My question is - **where does it make sense to put this extra money?** I could add it to my ""student"" loan payments to my parents, which all extra money they have said would be put towards the principal. This would allow me to pay back the loan within 6 years, instead of 9. Emotionally, I feel I would like to be debt-free faster, although the circumstances of this debt are a-typical. Alternatively, since 5% isn't a high interest rate, would I be better served contributing the money to retirement savings &amp; allowing it to grow? I do love my field &amp; people in it generally tend to work well-past typical retirement age - so optimistically I'd say I've got at least 50 more working years.

personalfinance,IRA vs. Roth IRA Comparison spot-check please,"TLDR - Looking to have my numbers checked for accuracy. Sheet at the bottom

Got into a conversation with a buddy the other night about the merits of contributing to an IRA or a Roth IRA. He had read an article touting the benefits of the IRA as being superior. I tossed this together off the cuff so I'm looking for a spot check to make sure my numbers make sense. I'll explained what my thought process was below.

Overview: My goal is to provide him with a time adjusted view of the merits on both sides

My view: I actually believe that both sources should be used in tandem. In most cased people have 401ks and most folks still call in the contribution ranges for a roth.

Sheet breakdown and assumptions

-Maxing out contribution annually (not factoring in cola increases to contribs though although I debated applying inflation to the contribution)

-Inflation rate - 2.25%

-Assumed return - 6%

-Tax Rate - Not really sure what to do here... tax bill from last year isn't permanent so if its not extended it will sunset eventually. Regardless adjusting for federal is easy, state is more difficult. 25% seems like a good average

-Future value - For this column I took a cumulative approach to the taxes and added in the inflation rate each year with the intent of indicating the value of that money down the road. This is probably one of the areas I'm most concerned with. For the IRA I flipped it to a negative value while contributing to illustrate the tax savings and then switched to positive flow at retirement since taxes would be due at that point.

personalfinance,Is there a secret to refinancing student loans?,"I graduated college in 2014 with about 50k in student loan debt. I got my first job making 60k in October 2014. Since then, I have upped my income to about 85-90k (it varies) and in 3 years gotten down to about 28k in student loans. 

My goal is to pay these off by the fall of 2020. I have been paying about a grand a month by tightening my budget elsewhere... but as it stands, I pay about 25% of my post-tax income to student loans, 25% to housing, 25% to savings/retirement (getting married this year), and I spend about 25% on car payment, utilities, food, etc. 

My student loans are an average of 6%. When I look to refinance, typically the interest rate is about 5%. I have seen success stories about people getting them down much lower to 3 or 4%. What's the trick? Is it a certain DTI? I've looked on the popular websites and gotten quotes, and it's never low.

personalfinance,"[US] Should I use my 13,000 USD in savings on my student loans or save it for retirement?","I am 25 years old. I still live with my parents. I have 13,000 USD in savings. 

I have 43,000 USD in debt in my name and 63,000 USD in parent plus loans that I agreed to pay off.

I used to make 90,000 a year on track to make over 100,000, but I lost my job due to downsizing. I now make 30,000 a year with 5,000 worth of bonus.

I lost my apartment, as a result of being out of work, and had to move back in with my parents. I want to remove my student debt to make my life easier and open up my cash flow.

However, I am also 25 years old. I want to save for retirement. I want to use this money I saved to get ready for the fact that social security is simply not enough to enjoy a quality standard of living anymore. 

What should I do? Even my 13,000 in savings can only wipe one of my higher interest loans.

Here are the loans I have with their principal and interest:

*(I just made a 5,000 USD payment on this one using my 2,500 first quarter bonus and my tax refund from the FED, still waiting on my state refund).

All loans are federal government loans. I work as a tax accountant. I plan on getting my CPA this year. I was scheduled to take the exams last year, but didn't when I was laid off due to overstaffing.

I make around 1,000 every two weeks. I have health insurance from my work. I don't pay for food, rent, or anything. The only real expense I have is gas and some comic I buy weekly. 

My current plan is to put about (not all of) 1 paycheck's worth of money to my loans monthly on top of my 1,300 USD/month minimum payments. 

My current work schedule is tight. Being a tax accountant, for 3 months (end of january to mid april) I work 60 hours per week (9 to 8 m-thr, 9 to 5 fri to sat). For the other 9 months, I work 9 to 4 m-fri. I feel, however, that the it could be hard to fit things into my current schedule for side gigs, though I do plan on getting a summer job and work nights for extra cash. 

What should I do?

Edit: To explain why my income went so low. I lost my job at KPMG. I was a tax accountant there. I was making around 90,000 a year working on hedge funds and mutual funds. They downsized the department and me and a lot of my co-workers were fired. I couldn't find work after that for well-over half a year. I applied to every position I could find. Eventually, I took the first offer I was actually accepted to: a tax accountant for a local firm making around 35,000 a year (40k after bonuses).",finance

Card 2: ~$5300 at 24.99, with a 0% intro rate that expires in June.

Right now I've got the $1300 on hand to pay Card 1 off, but I'm wondering if I should put it towards Card 2 since the interest rate is ever so slightly higher, and the balance is considerably higher. I'm trying to knock it down (and hopefully out) before the intro rate expires because I am not looking forward to that interest charge.

I ran some numbers and the answer I arrived at was that paying off Card 1 would save me ~$100 in interest over the lifetime of my payoff plan (I've got another card in the mix, but it's rate is considerably lower than either of those so it's going last), but my gut is telling me to take a bite out of the higher balance first. I want to make the most rational financial decision, and wanted to ask the community to see if there's anything I'm missing or if someone who is better with numbers can either confirm or refute my feeling.

I otherwise didn't research FIRE until I came across this subreddit 3 years ago and began monthly tracking again.

Over my 17 year career:

* I was paid 1480k + 56k in 401k matches, and had 506k in investment gains.
* I paid 427k in fed+state+FICA+health care contribution and spent 275K on living expenses.
* I saved 1354k and ended 2017 with 1330k (1115k investements, 215k home).

Here is a graph of it and my budget for the past 3 years, current, and next year budget. 

[Cummulative Earnings/Expenses/Savings Graph](https://i.imgur.com/bQkgcIe.png)

**Net Worth**

* Started 2001 at -$24k. (15k student loan, 9k auto loan).
* Leanfire goal was 900k @4% SWR. Reached in 2016Q1
* Desired goal was 1200k @4% SWR. Reached in 2017Q3
* Stretch goal was 1600k @3% SWR. I'm not going to make it.

I'm currently in the OMY phase and expect to stop early at 1.4M +/- whatever the SP500 does when my job is finished in a few months?

**Expenses**

I live in a M/LCOL area. My target was 12k/year which was pretty close to what I achieved. I spent on average 13.1k/year during the accumulation period 2005-2017 and 16.2k/year if 2001-2004 is included.

Some of my travel expenses are subsidized because I spend money for work on my personal CCs. I would expect my real expenses would be a few hundred higher without the perks.

**Employment**

I started out of college at 64k for company A for half a year in 2001 and was laid off due to the recession.


Hired a year later by company B at 72k, but wage was stagnent during the entire period I was there.


Currently with company C at 130k, but I doubt I will last past this year.

**401K**

Company B offered only actively managed high ER funds (1-3%) with additional hidden 0.25-0.5% administrative fees.

Contribution + match was 227k and grew to 275k when I left. Compared to my current company C's low fee SP500 index fund it would have been around 455k. So I got ripped off to the tune of $180k.

**House**

Paid off after first year. Maintanence was higher than I expected. Roof+Siding+Windows+Door+HVAC x2 = $2140/year over 12 years.

Housing cost ran ~$5.8k per year during my home ownership period. Prior to this I was renting a room for $4.8-5.4k per year with utilities included.

**Car**

Owned two vehicles over the time span, average of 9 years each, bought new each time. Average car expense of ~$3.2k per year.

My current vehicle was bought used. I have amortized the cost over 5 years vs just using annual depreciation. I plan to keep it for 10 years or whenever maintanence gets too high. I'm not a car person.

personalfinance,[Retirement] Please critique my retirement plans (29 year old),"Background: 29m federal employee. Gross income is ~110,000/yr. Live in HCOL area. Kicker: total housing cost including utilities is $650/mo due to living with a couple of roommates.

 

 

 

I’ve looked at several different scenarios based on how frugally I want to live UNTIL retirement, and how lavishly I want to live IN retirement. One constant is that I want to retire at *age 57* and plan on maxing my IRA’s every year until then. I also have my TSP and IRA allocations reflecting the S&amp;P500 as much as possible, in terms of C&amp;S funds with the TSP and index funds in the IRA’s.

 

 

 

I used compound interest calculators with 7% annual growth to the TSP and IRA’s to project the future. I’m also going to assume a 3% annual withdrawal rate from the TSP and IRAs in retirement. I’m also assuming for the sake of safety that social security won’t be around when I retire. The last thing to is that when I retire, I plan on moving to a LOCL city.

 

 

 

The first scenario is the *splurge now, retire frugally plan*. This plan would have me contributing only the matching amount to the TSP. It would give me a monthly net income of $5000. I could live very liberally, travel often and feel pretty good about my lifestyle. I’d be living it up like I never have before.

Drawing on FERS retirement, 3% WR from IRA’s and 3% WR from the TSP, my total income as a retiree would be ~ $86,000/yr. Barring any extreme health issues that I can’t foresee, living in a LCOL area, this is fine. I won’t be jet-setting around the world in retirement as much as some, or at least not in luxury.

 

 

 

The second scenario is *live-“frugally” now, retire lavishly plan*. I would (near) max the TSP giving me a monthly net income of ~ $4000. While this is hardly restrictive, it is definitely way fewer international trips or other random fun. I’ve lived on this salary before and it was fine, no complaints.

Drawing on FERS retirement, 3% WR from IRA’s and 3% WR from the TSP, my total income as a retiree would be ~ $104,000/yr. Barring any extreme health issues that I can’t foresee, living in a LCOL area, I’d be feeling like a baller. First-class on flights, frequent fun and travel etc.

 

 

 

Just to get out in front, yes I know that either of these situations is extremely lavish compared to a lot of people’s lifestyles and situations. I express gratitude every night before I go to sleep for this and all of the other many turns of luck I’ve had in my life. My only intent is to get some opinions on what sort of life I should live now and how to plan for retirement. I know a lot of people will say to max out every account I can, but if I can live fine off of a $86,000/yr income as a retiree and also live it up during my younger adulthood, why not do it? On the other hand, I could see the argument for “rewarding” myself with a super comfy retirement while also not neglecting to have fun in the meantime. There’s also of course the middle ground between the two approaches which is always an option.

 

 

Anyway, I’d love to get some different opinions on this.",finance

To give more information, the 2 student loans we are considering refinancing (both through ACS/Conduent) are the same. Both have $28,103 remaining with an interest rate of 6.79%. The combined monthly payment for these two are about $650. In total, we pay $1,340 a month in student loans. 

Combined, we bring in about $5,600 a month (post tax). After we finish paying for all our monthly bills, theres not much to save. We have been renting an apartment for the past 2.5 years while my wife went to school. She started working last June, so we want to buy a house, preferably this year (living in the northeast with dogs and cats as pets, renting is extremely difficult). We lucked out finding a place when we moved here, but now both of our jobs are pretty far away from our apartment and we're tired of paying for something that has no ultimate return. 

I know when you refinance, they do a hard pull on your credit. I know when you apply for a new credit card (for a balance transfer), they do a hard pull. Our credit is good (700+). Would it be worth it to focus on the student loans, credit cards, or do both at the same time?

personalfinance,Keep current house for future rental property?,"My Fiance and I are currently living in a house I bought before I met her. I have only owned it for a year and a couple months. We are realizing we only want to live in this house maybe for the next 5 years. and either buy a different house in same town or move to a different town Starting this year I only owe $82,000 on it. House is worth about $100,000 Minimum payment is $650/month. Have a 4.62% interest rate. 

I assume the best plan would be to pay extra each month as if we are trying to pay the house off in 15 years so we can have more equity in the home when we are ready to sell. Or would the better option be to pay very little extra each month and save up for next home and keep this house in the future and rent it out?",finance
BlockChain,Could Blockchain Be Used to Promote Positive Impact in Local Commerce?,"I see a lot of global uses of blockchain and cryptocurrency technology. I understand the power of decentralization, I hate the FED and all the other central banks as much as any woke individual, but does a cryptocurrency really do much different from the dollar if mining just depends on energy usage? And is it really decentralized if there are people/institutions out there with quantum level computing power, and who maybe aren't paying the standard cost of electricity?

I don't want to spend much time getting into the doom and gloom of a globalized world, nor argue about the positives and negatives of global market capitalism and transnational corporate supply chains. I'm not a socialist or anarchist, or maybe I'm both, I just care about people and the planet. I don't know if many of you here are familiar with localization movements like transition towns, but there's at least a thousand initiatives around the world that focus on revitalizing local economies and protecting community resources from global interests, many of them have developed their own currencies as part of that effort.

Are there any examples of blockchain currencies which are tied to real, physical work? In particular, work that is regenerative to land and community? What if small towns started a program where anyone could do work that benefits the public environmental, social and economic conditions for a digital currency which could then be used to purchase food, building materials and other local necessities that were also produced regeneratively? (If you're unfamiliar with the term regenerative, it's not just a placeholder for sustainable action. The problem with sustainability is that the state of most land and communities is considerably degraded to the extent that sustaining such a level of environmental/social condition is not actually good in the long run. [Check out this site](http://www.regenerativeagriculturedefinition.com) for some good information about regenerative agriculture.)

Better yet, why not have scales of currency that are local, regional, and statewide to protect resources at each appropriate level. I know the government hates the idea of giving up taxes, but it seems fairly obvious by now that they are not the best way to manage public interests. The point is to create a currency which can be instantly created by the hands of locals that do real regenerative work, so rather than using the US$ which is basically just debt to a private institution backed by oil and violence, communities could base their currency and commerce on actions that automatically improve the public conditions. 

If it's properly controlled, which is always the big IF, would a blockchain digital currency be a good fit for this kind of disruption? Would you want anonymity or some level of public transparency of who is engaged in each transaction/contract? Again, this is mainly for a small, rural town context where people know each other, and where it's become very difficult to employ people and resources to do any kind of work as the global economy becomes ever more present in our daily lives. The pressure is especially felt in local retail as the American middle class declines and the Chinese middle rises, capitalism is drifting east. The people are still here and want to work, the resources and equipment are still here, it always just seems like money is the problem and it just seems like a stupid obstacle to real rural prosperity.

personalfinance,Will refinancing auto loan lead to larger mortgage interest rates?,"I currently have a large auto loan, about 17k that has a 6.9% interest rate. Over the last 9ish months since I got the loan, I have paid extra on the principal to lower the loan amount to 9k as of today, but now I am thinking of refinancing to hopefully a 3.5% interest rate on the 9k in order to lower my minimum payment from like $330 to $150. Then pay the $150 a month and try to start saving for down payment money. 

My question is, if I refinance will that make my credit history show that I paid off 2 loans, one for 8k and one for 9k instead of paying off one big 17k loan. And those two smaller loans will be less impressive than having paid off one big loan of 17k. And if I stick with the big 17k loan I will have a better mortgage deal? 

I’m not sure if that’s true or not.",finance

personalfinance,Help! I'm 20 and I'm trying to plan for a well-fed retirement.,"I've got a 401k and Roth IRA set up for as much as I can afford while still putting 26% of my paycheck into a savings account each week. (currently living, fortunately, rent-free, go parents!!) Anyways, I'm trying to decide whether or not investing some extra cash into other index funds personally is a good idea. I'm currently on track to make 45k by end of 2019 and if all goes well and on track with most other people in my field, six figures by the time I'm 36. I want to be able to retire by 55 and even after reading and trying to understand all the wonderful advice given here, I'm just not sure if I should be doing MORE right NOW. And if I should, what and how. So far, from what I gathered, I could be investing into index funds personally? long-term stock trading? just straight saving as much as I can after 401k and roth? Am I even going down the right path at all?

Financial information:

I'm currently directly below management, but people move FAST in my company and I'm being trained along with another to take someones spot for whenever he moves on. Earliest I move up to 40-45k is september, latest being late 2019. I make an average $370-$400/wk right now. I'm putting $106/wk into roth, $15/wk into 401k (thats the most they will match) $30/wk for gas, roughly $50/wk for food, and the rest into savings.

Long story short, 2016-2017 were crazy years for me between graduating school, the loss of a parent, and moving across country for work. But, now that I’m doing well financially and managing things better, I’m only now getting around to filing my 2016 and 2017 taxes. 

I have all my info needed and began with 2016 using turbo tax. Got to the end but the e-filing service is closed (again I’m more than a year late so am not surprised) and printed out the return to mail in. I owe federal and should be receiving a refund from NY. My question is since I’m filing late I assume I will have penalties I need to pay. How does this work if I’m forced to mail in my return? Is it somehow possible to speak with the IRS on the phone to find out when my total will be and write one single check with the return? What about for NY / state taxes? If it turns out due to penalties I now owe NY I’d like to know ASAP and write a check before things get even worse. 

Second thing I wanted to bring up is do / should I wait until 2016 is handled before doing my 2017 taxes? Again, I wouldn’t want penalties or anything for 2017 too but also wouldn’t want 2016 to come back and mess up my 2017.

personalfinance,"Ok, I'll admit it. I haven't filed state taxes in 4 years. What do I do next?","Illinois 'resident', active duty military member stationed in Nevada. As far as I can remember, when tax time rolls around, I file everything real quick in order to get my federal refund, the state return is rejected, and I promptly forget about it for another year. Looking back this year, it appears that every year I've used TurboTax its been rejected, so that goes back to 2013, at least. Nobody knows, not my family / friends / wife, its something I kept putting off and getting scared about and would promptly forget.

I'm still considered an Illinois resident, but my wife lives and works in Nevada so we've considered her a 'Nevada resident'. It seems the rules have changed around a bit in the past, but my assumption was always that 1) I didn't get state taxed due to military status, and 2) she didnt get charged due to being Nevada resident. Anyhow, finally, this year it caught up to us- our entire federal refund was withheld, and while I haven't received an official word yet why, this is literally all I can imagine it being. 

So... what do I do here. I'm not trying to go to prison or elude paying my taxes- in fact, its actually kinda my honest opinion that we don't really owe any Illinois tax. But, I'm unsure where to turn. TurboTax doesn't give me a whole heck of a lot of info, and I don't want to blindly re-file everything with the state without knowing what our status is. I'm scared, financially and otherwise, and feel like I've got nobody to talk to.

Does IRS handle state taxes? Who do I contact? How do I find out what I owe... and do I pay that amount? Or do I file all my state returns first? How do I figure out which state returns I have successfully filed? I'm at such a loss, and don't know where to start, and I'm really freaking out about huge masses of debt or going to jail for forgetting to file- we don't even live in the state. And I don't exactly have a truckload of cash to go to a tax prep place- I've heard they can charge 100-200 each, and I've got at least 5-6 returns to re-file... we were expecting money back that we aren't getting, I definitely don't have an additional huge stack sitting around for this :(

CryptoCurrency,"The loser, or the millionaire? The thorny path to success.","All the famous and rich people had to go through a really hard way before their names became known to everybody, and the results of their hard work became an integral part of everyone's life. If inventors, scientists and just researchers listened to the crowd each time , then we would never have Apple, the delights from Hershey, we would never read  Stephen King ecstatically, and  even maybe America would not have been discovered yet. The success of one person, which will bring many benefits to millions in the future, is preceded by a lot  of trials in 99% of cases. And only those who are really strong and persistent, those who believe in themselves and their offspring, will come to the end, having overcome all obstacles,  and not listening to spiteful critics. Without difficulties, there is no success - it's a fact.
A lot has been said about Henry Ford and Bill Gates, but there are also those people who also made a significant contribution to our modern life, starting from scratch?
For example, Sir James Dyson, an English inventor, who spent 15 years to finally achieve the desired result. In the list of his inventions there is  not only hand dryer and cyclone vacuum cleaner G-Force, but also a digitally controlled motor, as well as a special vessel called the ""Sea Truck"".
Many people think that one must born rather than made an inventor , in fact, this is the result of enormous work and struggle with the unbelief of the society. Before presenting his vacuum cleaner with the technology of cyclone filtration, James Dyson created 5127 prototypes that were unsuccessful. His family was already on the verge of bankruptcy, when the inventor finally managed to assemble a working model. Now his fortune is more than 3, 000, 000, 000 $!

And who can imagine life without milk chocolate of Milton Hershey? The creator of the chocolate empire ""Hershey Chocolate"" has suffered many failures on the way to his success. Milton began his way from work in the printing house, but even then he was eager to bring people joy, creating the most delicious chocolate and the first chocolate factory in the USA. However, his first attempt at launching a factory was completely fiasco. His acquaintances discouraged him from engaging in such an unpromising business and unanimously insisted that this idea would not be no-go.
Hershey did not listen to them, and went to Denver, Colorado State, to study the secrets of making caramel technology there. After there was a second attempt to launch the factory in New York, and again it was a failure. Stubborn James did not lost hope  then, and returned to his parents' farm to continue searching for the perfect recipe  of chocolate, which, finally, will be loved by both children and adults for the whole century.
And his efforts, finally, were crowned with success! Milk chocolate of Hershey became a bestseller, and he was forced to open the factory, as the demand for his products grew by leaps and bounds. Now the factory not only brought him the status and name, but also gave the most delicious chocolate to millions. In addition, Milton Hershey founded  the hospital  the stadium and even the whole city that bears his name, on the money from the profits.
The way of Stephen King to recognition was also not easy. His novels were repeatedly rejected by publishers, for example, ""The Long Walk"" was published only 13 years after writing, and his first published book ""Carrie"" collected a lot of unflattering reviews at first. King did not even want to show it to publishers, because he believed that no one would want to read a novel about religious fanaticism and teenage cruelty. Stephen Tabith's wife Jane King persuaded him to finish writing ""Carrie"" and send the novel to the publishing house. After a time, this novel made a real sensation and allowed the writer to earn good money, leave  the teaching in school and completely immerse himself in writing. His novels are still read with ecstasy and his new publications are awaited eagerly. So faith in himself and support of his near of kin ones gave a wonderful writer to the world.

As luck would have it, even nowadays, we can observe persecution against those who move progress forward and inject their ideas into various aspects of human life. For example, Cold nuclear fusion. Until now, all researchers of this phenomenon are likely to be called ""alchemists"", and their experiments are called into question, on the occasion of those who have this discovery, like a bone in the throat. However, over the past year even those who used to shout that cold fusion is impossible, took the side of the LENR researchers and began actively supporting and financing these studies, let’s wonder, why? Perhaps, people realized that soon this discovery will really change the world, and they understood it thanks to the publication of the experiments processes by such people as Rossi, Bazhutov, Parkhomov and many others. Finally, cheap energy is found, people have learned to synthesize cheap elements into more valuable ones, and these processes are not costly and easy to perform. Of course, the scientific elite does not want to admit that all these 60 years they have worked in vain to obtain a result from the ""Tokamaks"" (who is interested, google it), because the “Tokamak” never gave cheap energy, but only devours it so as it devours the government  money allocated by the federals to this big and expensive toy. To recognize the existence of LENR for these people is like death, but, despite all the persecutions, researchers in the field of Cold Nuclear Fusion did not give up, and now, at last, one of hundreds companies headed by Karabanov is ready to open the world's first laboratory for studying Cold Nuclear Fusion and obtaining of platinum from low-valuable metals. Scientists from all over the world are waiting for the opening, as the laboratory will be fitted up with modern and unique equipment. People realized that  it is possible to wait for the government money another 50 years  for development the technology, and that  the government prefers to finance unprofitable projects. Like hundreds of other people in history, Synthestech decided to take fate in their own hands, and also to give opportunity to  earn money on opening for people from all over the world. It's better not to repeat the mistakes of Henry Ford, having entrusted the enterprise to the hands of one investor, do not give up and go to your goal. Hundreds of successful experiments,  conducted in recent years, are a direct confirmation that even those, who did not believe in you yesterday, will receive benefits of your developments tomorrow and tell ""Thank you"" to the inventors for not giving up.

personalfinance,Difficulty refinancing/consolidating debt due to unusual income situation.,"I've been having some difficulties with my financial situation and would be grateful for any advice you all are willing to offer.  Basically, I've got debts, some of which includes high-interest credit card debt.  Some of the how and why is down to bad decision making, and some of it is due to bad fortune, like unavoidable medical bills.  I am trying now to responsibly reduce these debts as quickly as possible; no one is more keenly aware than I am of how bad it is that I'm hemorrhaging half of my income to interest charges.  I know that my best options would be a balance transfer or a loan to refinance/consolidate my debt.  The trouble is that I'm having a hard time getting either of those things to happen.

My employment is a little unusual.  On paper, I don't make very much money.  My taxable income is only about $18,000 per year.  (It's an hourly wage, and my weekly hours fluctuate a bit, so that's an estimate.)  But the reason why it is so low is because my compensation also includes room, board, utilities, and health care.  Based on my location, I estimate the value of my apartment to about $20,000 per year.  (I have supplemented my income with freelance proofreading as well as consulting in the past, but I don't have any of that going on right now.)

My credit score is 650–675 right now and on the rise as I slowly reduce my debts.  My credit utilization is high, above 60%, which is why my score is not better.  But I have not missed a single payment on any account in my name for at least a decade.  I've been employed here for 10 years.  Because I don't pay rent, literally all of my income is available to make payments on my debts, and I am able to exceed the minimum payments on all of my debts every month.

But I cannot seem to acquire a loan.  In the past, when online credit card account pages have asked me about my income for the purposes of reconsidering my credit limit, I have sometimes combined my wages and my estimated apartment value for what I considered a more accurate picture of my financial ability.  But recently I have begun noticing that *taxable* income is specifically requested, in which case reporting that I make ~$38,000 or more would be false, right?  And now that I am trying to get loans to refinance, I find that these applications ask for both taxable income and what you pay on your mortgage or rent, so I am reporting accurately that I make $18,000 and pay $0 rent.

I've been rejected for loans from Credit Karma's recommended lenders like Best Egg and Upgrade, with whom CK says I have excellent approval odds.  I've also been rejected by my credit union.  They are currently promoting a ""knock-out"" loan for debt consolidation that I badly want in on, but I know they'll reject me unless I do something different with my approach.

Here's the crux: It's obvious that none of these lenders believes that my income is sufficient to handle payments on a loan.  Of course, *I* know that this isn't true because I'm making all of my payments on the very debts that I am trying to refinance; making those payments will only become easier if I can consolidate.  If only there was a way to get someone to look past my raw income and consider instead my perfect payment history.

So what do you think?  Of course I want to increase my income long-term to speed my debt reduction, but in the immediate what can I do to consolidate my debts under lower interest rates?  How can I get lenders to take me seriously?  Maybe if I asked multiple lenders for smaller loans instead of asking one lender for the amount I really want?

One idea that I had is to ask my employer to charge me rent and then add the amount of that rent to my pay (and automatically deduct it) so that my on-paper income is more accurate.  But, even assuming they would go for that (doubtful), it would probably be bad for me in terms of taxes.  I think?  Anyway, that's about the only idea that I have.

I'm new to this subreddit and hope that this meets the standards for a post.  I didn't see anything on the wiki that seemed specific enough to help me.  Thanks for your time.  I appreciate whatever help you can provide—or even just that you read this.",finance

Banking,"Domestic Wire Transfer has been held by OFAC for almost a month, what now?","Hello redditors, to make a long story short. On 2/6 i sent a wire transfer of $4000 to a business for a purchase. 100% not a scam, i have made legitimate purchases with them before. 

On 2/6 i sent them the wire transfer but the money was never received, even though the funds were taken out of my Bank of America account. The wire transfer team said there was likely an error, so we decided to cancel the wire, and sent another $4000 the next day, 2/7. 

The second transfer also did not go through so after further investigation, we found that it was being held for review by OFAC, due to a partial match of my name on their sanctioned list. The man on the list has my name, middle name and last name, but that is the only similarity. he was born in jalisco, mexico and in 1960 and has nothing to do with me. I’m a 20 year old american citizen clean record. The man is sanctioned for narco  trafficking. 

after about a week and half the transfer of $4000 was finally pulled through, so i was able to make the purchase with the company. However the original transfer of $4000 was never received nor returned into my account. i was told to give it more time to be reviewed, but it has been almost a month now. The beneficiary says that only $4000 of the $8000 taken out of my account was deposited into their Wells Fargo account. They h e no record of any extra money. The fund have been taken out of my account though. 

The banker has no idea what to do, and neither do i. He beneficiary has no record of receiving any more money. So my question is, where is my $4000? and who do i call or what do i do to find out where it is. neither my bank nor the beneficiary has it. 

i have Federal IMAD on both the transfer done on 2/6 and 2/7. But i don’t know what else to do. This is a lot of money to me, any advice is appreciated. Thank you.",finance
solar,Cheap ways to make use of solar panels on building without a battery?,"I’ve recently moved into a rental property which has solar panels feeding power into the building during the day. There’s no storage, so any excess is fed back to the grid, and my landlord receives a nice little payment every month. I pay for the energy I use outside daylight hours. There’s no gas supply to the property, so heating the rooms and water is all via electric.

I’m wondering if there are any (cheap) ways I can store the energy produced during the day to be used in the evenings, or make use of the energy to reduce my outgoings on the property. 

I'm already doing things like putting a timer on the washing machine &amp; dryer, using a slow-cooker for meals, heating the property during the day (which feels like a waste while I'm out of the property), but since I'm at work during daylight hours I figure most of my use is in the evenings (heating, cooking, TV, etc). I thought about getting a UPS, but most only act as a backup, not a primary source of power; I'd need something that could be told to use the battery until it reaches a certain level, then flip back to using mains power, and to only fill the battery between certain hours... I've not done any research, but I'm guessing those features would be rare.

* 3.86% - $752.32

Also, would it be beneficial for me to dip into my savings to immediately pay off some of the loans (such as the two 4.66% - $1123.47 ones)?

personalfinance,Car payment is stopping me from getting my own place. What should I do?,"So I have a $570 car payment every month. I live rent free with my uncle and all I have to pay is the electric bill. I want to get my own place as soon as possible but this car payment is really dragging me down. 

My dad and I co-signed on the car in the summer of 2017 because he said it was a good deal (he's a car salesman so go figure) and that it would help me build credit. Well since then I had to take another job that pays a lot less, along with taking on a few extra bills that I didn't expect to have. 

A few months ago I told him that I was having trouble making the payments and that I have had to dip into my savings on more than one occation and that kills me. I asked him if I could trade it in or sell it back and he said that I would end up owing just as much as I do now anyways. He told me that I should refinance my car with my SO because we both have better credit than he does. That way I would have about a hundred taken off the monthly payment.

We were about to do that about a week ago and dad calls me and says that he is going to file for bankrupsy soon and to take him off as co-owner asap so that it doesn't hurt my credit. 

Explaining this who debacle to my mother (they're seperated) she asks ""Why don't you just take your name off the car and leave your father's name on it. That way you can get rid of it and get a cheaper car"". Dad says I can't do that without having the car paid off first. 

The reason I've turned to r/personalfinance is because both of my parents aren't doing very well in life and since I don't know any better, every time they tell me I should do something, I usually believe them (they are very persuasive). So what should I do? Refinance the car and still pay around $400 a month for this car? Or should I try to get rid of it somehow?

Edit: I make about 20k a year (this will go up soon because I will start working full time after this semester) and my SO makes about 15k. The interest rate on the car right now is 12.69. And the principal balance on the car is $25,587.",finance

personalfinance,Haven't pulled an Annual Credit Report in years; pull one now or in a few months?,"The only reason I can think of to pull one now is because I've not done so since... 2016, perhaps earlier?

Reasons to wait a few months:

1. I just did a balance transfer from a Car Loan (at 14.99%) to an unsecured CC (at 0.99% until April 2019), as I was upside down on the car and want to pay that off at the lower interest rate while saving a month or two of payments.  Plus, the bank in question only allowed payments against the principal (above min payment) via mail which meant attempting to accelerate payments would have been too much of a PITA.  So, I'd want to at least have that properly listed in my report; waiting a month or two at least, I think?
2. In the last quarter, I paid off a huge percentage of debt, and hope to continue doing so over the next couple of quarters.  I'd be more interested in my CR in the next couple of quarters to see how that reflects.
3. CreditKarma is showing my credit score and nothing's alarming there, so I'm already monitoring my credit, after a fashion.
4. I don't intend to make any major purchases until either A) some event (accident, maintenance costs) forces me to replace my car B) I get debt down to the point where I can afford to save toward buying a house.

Is there any compelling reason to not wait a few more months/quarters before pulling an annual report, beyond ""haven't done it in a while""?",finance

investing,"Do stocks drop due to inflation fears? If so, why?","During the recent correction there were many articles titled similarly to this: ""U.S. stocks open lower as CPI underlines inflation fears""

My question is, why would inflation cause stocks to drop? Logically, **inflation should cause stock prices to nominally rise**.

Inflation (in this context) is the loss of real value of a currency, so it only makes sense one of the things that would become relatively more expensive is assets, such as stocks.

Inflation encourages spending, which is good for businesses bottom line. In addition, the it reduces real wages, which means capital can return higher amounts. It also reduces the value of any fixed interest rate debt held by the corporation and improves their balance sheet. In most cases margins are not squeezed that much. The extra is just passed to the consumer.

So, based on this, it seems like stocks would basically be neutral to inflation or only slightly negatively impacted. **Why would anyone sell off stocks for dollars when dollars are losing value?**

None of it makes sense. Please shed some light.

I have read a lot of analysis reports and speculation articles on what the new tax law means to crypto currencies, but  my questions are a bit more selfish in nature and maybe down to earth.

Questions:

1. Can any one find the verbiage of the new tax law passed December 20, 2017? If so please post a link. I must suck at searching with google. I would like to see the actual words.

2. How can I pay the minimum amount of tax? Pay now or pay later? I'm a pretty honest guy and will pay my taxes, but only the taxes I owe and not a penny more. If I can pay a small tax today and nothing in the future that would be great. I don't want to pay any taxes at all and just hide it, but people alway get burned in the long run doing that.

Thanks.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Refinanced the house!,"Thank you so much Reddit! 

So happy to finally get out of a FHA mortgage with PMI. Plus almost 1% less interest rate and went from a 30 year too a 15 year. Rolled the kitchen renovation into the new mortgage (was paying 8% on that loan) and the new monthly payment is less than the old mortgage plus the kitchen loan bill. 

I have you all to thank for this. Been wanting to do this for a while.

Next step with the extra monthly savings is I would like to invest. Currently have a TSP going maxed out but would like to do a bit more. 

Thinking the Acorn app to and maybe a DRIP (like 3M).",finance

gaming,Discussion about Deep Silver and their growing knack for releasing undercooked titles (for anyone who bought Kingdom Come and was disappointed this is for you),"Hey guys. 
I’m sure everyone has noticed this horrible trend of major companies releasing hyped titles to the public at a stage that would’ve been considered beta or even alpha in some instances. 

I’ve kinda come to expect it, but I’ve noticed some companies are worse than others. Ubisoft for instance gets a horrible rap for it, EA also gets shit on a lot...

But I’ve noticed 2K and Deep Silver are easily the worst about it as far as dropping games that are incomprehensibly unfinished. 

If anyone played mafia 3 they’ll know what I’m talking about. Even with the latest patch installed that game is catastrophically held together. It just freaks together like “kill...me...”

But recently I went and picked up Kingdom Come (after a lengthy search in my area I scored a copy...which raised some eyebrows. Like...huge game but no copies? Everyone was saying they only got like three or four copies) and I have to say...without being too critical or anything (I mean, I actually enjoyed homefront 2 for god sakes) this game is literally unplayable. 

Thats not me being hyperbolic. I mean literally I cannot go any further with anything because the game either crashes, gets stuck in a loading screen or I can’t interact with anyone or anything. 

The graphics are popping in. I can live with that. 
The characters glitch through stuff, I made it through all the stalkers...I can do this. 

By when every single system in the game collapses on itself or the game itself just doesn’t load at all...you know you’re playing an absolutely broken, over-rushed game. 

And again, homefront. Same publisher. And you can tell, just like this game, there is something great hidden under there but it’s so rushed and broken it becomes so frustrating you don’t even want to fix it. 

Which fuckin sucks because the world in this game is monumental, and immersive and period accurate. You call tell whoever researched everything LOVED their job.  But every system is so horrible to interact with it makes the game not worth playing...that is if they even work at all. 

To be honest there’s a difference between ghost recon widllands where there’s some goofy shit going on, and a game that can’t even load under the weight of its own incompleteness. 

At this point, I’m gonna go back to early 2010 releases and just play those fuckers for a minute because man...I’ve bought three games in the last two months and two of them weren’t even playable without patches...and afterwards they were beta at best. And to me that’s unacceptable  Especially when companies like 2K and Deep Silver are milking their customers for unfinished products. And looking back at Deep Silvers track record of games...yeesh. 90 percent of their titles are complete bombs haha. 

Main point. Anyone else fed up with unfinished titles? 
Other point. Did anyone else get their hands on the nightmare that is the PS4 version of kingdom come and were you as disappointed as I was? 

I’ve never quit a game because of technical complications on a console, but wow.",technology
personalfinance,Should I pay as much income tax as possible so that I get a return at the end of the year?,"My husband and I are college grads and we were advised that we should claim 1 for federal and claim 0 for state and out single( Virginia) so that we pay high tax and get refund at the end of the year.

personalfinance,Buying First Home,"So I am graduating in the Spring.  I will be making 48k, with a guaranteed increase in salary every year (government job).  After 5 years, I will be making 85k-90k.  My credit score is around 750.

I have 40k in student loans.  I have about 5k in savings.  I was thinking about taking out 13k more for student loans before I graduate to have an emergency fund.

I was wondering how long before I will be able to buy a home, and what price point I should look at.  I have heard 3x salary, but with my guarenteed salary increase I don't know how to calculate that.  

I was also wondering about down payment, as I have read that it may be better to have 6% down, rather than 20% down and invest the difference.  

I am looking at prices that I like in the area, and 350-450 is common.  I just don't feel I will ever be able to buy those.

Any advice on a timeline, pricepoint, downpayment, and interest rate to shoot for would be great!  Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,Is it a bad idea to have more than one brokrage accounts?,"Currently I have an account with Fidelity through my employer who offers a generous employee stock purchase program. I've enrolled and they automatically match my contributions, but the fidelity investment site is incredibly confusing. 

I am looking to invest a portion of my tax refund this year and im not sure if I should use Fidelity (considering I don't understand a lot of it, plus fees) or a more simplistic account through the robinhood app. From what I've understood robinhood has zero fees and the only cons are the lack of data/analytics offered by other places such as Fidelity. 

Is it better to keep only one account? If I'm not mistaken robinhood offers to transfer stocks to their platform fee free and cover the other platforms as well. Maybe I can transfer quarterly?

Right now I'm using stock market trading simulators and reading up to get a better grasp of everything. Originally I invested in Bitcoin and alt-coins and I'm fed up with it's risk and volatility.

Thanks for any help",finance

Ripple,Why I believe ripple is the best crypto to invest in!,"So many people don't understand that Ripple AND XRP are going to make it FAR FAR longer than Bitcoin will simply because XRP knows how to play ball. As much as people might LIKE the idea of a utopian currency that's separate from government reach, the reality of the situation is... Ripple works with banks, which are never going away and ripple works actively with governments, regulators and they CALL for regulation themselves as well. This is what the government wants and needs to hear. A lot of people are unaware that the federal reserve actually tested and approved Ripple as well. Ripple and XRP are going to be absolute monoliths in the coming years simply because there's a face to the company, that face is public, active and is ready to work with regulators, even BETTER is that most of the ripple boards members are former bankers and US regulators, so these people KNOW each other and are talking with banks around the world to secure partnerships. why do you think ripple has 3 new partnerships each WEEK!?

personalfinance,Can you pay a loan back in less time than the total term?,"I am looking to get my first loan. I am not concerned about my ability to pay it back, but because my credit score is low (not a lot of history), the interest rates are very high. I have looked at a wide variety of options, and they each have their term - sometimes up to 24 months. However, at this length I would be paying a lot of interest. Can you usually pay off the loan sooner if you are able? If I got a 12 month term, could I pay it off in 1-2 months (I am likely to have the money by then)?

- I'm not sure if it depends on the lender, but is this *usually* something you can do? (I would call each one when I narrow it down, but at this point I've seem 30+ offers, so that would take too long)?

- Any laws about this (US, Utah)?

- If you *can* pay it off early, are you still responsible for all the interest you would have payed anyway? Or if you fully pay off the principal, are you only responsible for the imterest/fees you've payed until that point?",finance

The reason I ask is I can not direct which loans the payments are applied to until I exceed the monthly payment value even though I am paid months ahead so nothing is due currently. When I call the loan service company, they say it is a federal regulation I can’t pay towards certain accounts until I exceed the monthly balcance even though nothing is due.

BlockChain,Call for Speakers for Chain-in an International Industrial &amp; Academic Conf. on Blockchain,"Chain-in: The International Industrial &amp; Academic Conference on Blockchain Technology
Porto, Portugal — April 27th &amp; 28th, 2018 (Same week of EuroSys'18)
http://www.chain-in.org/

#### WHY CHAIN-IN?
Industrial enthusiasts claim ""Blockchain is the next Internet Protocol"", Academics think ""this will collapse soon"", and Chain-in brings both to chain in and do real science.

#### SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES
Chain-in is a unique industrial and academic conference focused on Blockchain and Cryptocurrency technologies. In spite of all the hype behind the technology, the industry and academia are often following different approaches to build tamper-proof distributed ledgers (or databases). Experience shows that there is no pure black and white, and thus it is wise to have both rivals exchange knowledge and join forces. Chain-in aims at bringing researchers, developers, and enthusiasts from academia and industry to sit together on the same table and try converge to the best of the technology.

#### PRESENTATION MODEL
Given that blockchains hail from industry, Chain-in avoids the academic proceeding-based style, and rather adopts a more ""casual"" model through dedicating the event to presentations and interaction. The goal, and the hope, is to foster interaction and enrich the discussions.

#### TOPICS OF INTEREST
Chain-in gives the opportunity to any interesting talk related to blockchains or cryptocurrencies as long as it serves the above goals. In particular, the subjects covered include—but are not limited to:

* Blockchain Protocols (novel or not)
* Proof of ""Something"" methods.
* Byzantine Fault Consensus Protocols
* Byzantine-based distributed ledgers.
* Private, Federated, and Public Blockchains.
* Cryptocurrencies, Bitcoins, and Altcoins.
* Mining.
* Applications and Use Cases for blockchains.
* Smart contracts.
* Distributed Applications (DApps).
* Marketing in Blockchains.
* Initial Coin Offerings
* People and Blockchains.

#### SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
Submission is simplified to the abstract and biography of the speaker. All submitted through Easychair. Please have a look at more details: http://chain-in.org/speaker.php

#### REGISTRATION
- The registration of speakers is offered by Chain-in.
- Special offers to EuroSys'18 attendees.

#### IMPORTANT DATES
- Call for talks ends: March 23rd.
- Notifications to speakers: gradually, until March 30th.
- Conference: April 27th and 28th (same week of EuroSys).

#### GENERAL CHAIR
Ali Shoker, HASLab, INESC TEC &amp; Minho University, Portugal.

#### PROGRAM COMMITTEE CHAIRS
- Alysson Bessani. University of Lisbon, Portugal.
- Christian Decker, Blockstream, USA.
- Vincent Gramoli, University of Sydney, Australia.
- Ali Shoker, HASLab, INESC TEC &amp; Minho University, Portugal.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"I can get a much better mortgage rate if I apply for a loan myself, rather than with my fiancé as my co-borrower. What are the cons?","My fiancé and I are building our first home and we just met with the mortgage lender yesterday.  We qualified for 5% interest on a ~$350k loan.  Because they take the middle of three credit scores of the borrower that has the lowest total score, they are using my fiancé's credit score of 675 to calculate this rate.  If I am the only borrower on the loan, they would use my credit score of 778, which would result in about a 4.65% interest rate.

In addition to the interest rate reduction, if my credit score is used, our PMI monthly payment would drop from $404 to $113 per month.

Is this a no-brainer?  Obviously I would be solely on the hook for the loan.  Her name would still be on the title/deed of the house, she just wouldn't be on the loan.  What are the cons if we decide to go this route?",finance

personalfinance,Does it make sense for me to refinance my auto loan?,"**Background:** 29M, single, homeowner, earning about $88K before bonuses in LCOL area.


Longtime lurker and occasional contributor. I think my overall PF situation is pretty solid but I constantly review my standing and look for opportunities to save more. Barring an unexpected major expense, I expect to be saving at least 55% of my income for the rest of 2018, but I'd like to try and save even more. That brings me to my auto loan.


**About the loan:** I have two cars. One is paid off and the other has a 72 month loan that originated in August 2015 for $34,940 at 3.99%. That's $547.90/month. Today I owe $21,308.53. My credit score is 807-820 depending on the bureau. One of the credit unions by me is offering refinanced auto loans to people with good credit for nearly 2% and I'm thinking of stopping by to inquire. At this time I'm still unsure if I would extend the life of the new loan to lower my monthly payment even more or just accept the discounted interest rate and a similar term.


**The dilemma:** The problem is that every time I crunch the numbers I get this sense that I am missing something, hence why I'm posting here. Is this venture worth my time? Are there typically any closing costs on auto refinances like there are with refinanced mortgages?


**NOTE:** Because I know somebody will bring it up...Yes, I know that I don't *need* two cars for myself. This is my vice and at this time, selling one of the cars is not necessary for me to achieve my goals.",finance

personalfinance,Corporate Credit Card reimbursement killing my credit score currently,"I don't entirely know a lot about credit scores, so maybe someone can help me.

I make 55K a year and am looking into moving into buying a house.  I have 30K saved for a down payment and no 'personal debt' and I feel that I am financially ready for it.  However, I recently changed jobs and this new job requires me to spend a lot of money every month.  This is sometimes pushing 10K a month.  I decided it would be best to use a personal credit card and pay it off with reimbursements from work? Sounds cool right, well my credit score has fallen apart apparently.  I pay my bill before it's due but unfortunately I have a very shallow credit history as I am only 23.  I think I am somewhere around a 620 right now which I don't think is going to get an interest rate below 4% on a home.

Do I just need to wait?  Does anyone have experience with how long it could take my score to recover to something that will look more attractive to lenders?

personalfinance,Why isn't there a change on my federal withholding?,"Apologies if this is a really dumb question, but trying to get any response from our HR department is an exercise in madness. But anyway, I work at a public university, and was surprised to see that for my January and February paychecks (we get paid monthly and January gets paid two weeks early, so I thought that might have had something to do with it) there was no difference in in the percentage of what was withheld for for my federal and medicare taxes. I also got a raise from 47K to 57K in between the december and january paychecks, so is an increase in tax brackets just happening to keep the percentage that's being withheld in the exact same place, or is something else going on?",finance
personalfinance,Question on extra mortgage payments on two properties of different value/interest rates,"We own two properties. One is a long-term rental home in the Pacific NW. The other is our primary residence in the SW. 

Currently, I make an extra principal payment each month on both and due to the recent tax changes I'm getting extra in my take-home pay (and hope to also get a pay increase in the next few months) so I'd like to put that money to good use. I was thinking of increasing the additional principal payments. As I was getting ready to do so it dawned on me that due to the different values and different interest rates on each property that I might be better offer making a larger principal payment on one of the more expensive property. I'd like a logic check on this. 

Home in PNW was bought for $199k in 2015 with a full 20% down, no PMI. 
* Current balance: $146,720

* Interest rate: 3.75%

* I pay $1250/month which includes ~$260 in additional principal. 

* By my calculations, I'll save roughly $32k in interest and 13 years on the mortgage if I continue doing this. 

Our primary residence in the SW was bought in 2017 for $313k, and only 5% down

* Current balance is $294,000

* Interest rate: 4.625%

* I pay $2200 month which includes ~$210 in additional principal

* By my calculations, I'll save about $58k in interest and seven years on the mortgage if I continue doing this. 

If I decide to throw another $500/month at extra principle I think I would save more in interest if I put this toward the more expensive house and loan. Is that right?

If I leave as is I'll save 90k between the two. 

If I increase both payments to ~500/each I'll save ~$147k

If I leave the lower cost one as is and increase the other by $500 I'll save about ~$158k in interest. 

Finally - would it be in my best interest to submit this ""extra"" extra principal payment in a mid-month payment to effectively move to a twice-monthly payment?",finance

I checked to see if Credible could find me a lower rate, and they found an option with Nationwide at 4.5%.

I owe about 12.5k on it and when I got the loan I bought it new at %0.9 interest rate.  I'm upset that now I need to refinance and get a higher interest rate.  I'm trying to decide the best option for me.  

I have an adequate emergency fund I will not touch.  I have some extra cash above that ~5k, however I really prefer to use as little as possible because I have potential legal expenses coming up also a few small investment ideas for side incomes I want to look into this year.   

I have excellent credit and I'm toying with the idea of opening an Amex Every day balance transfer card  to help with this.  Their current offer is 0% APR on balance transfers for 15 months and no fees for balance transfers.   

My idea is to either refinance through Chase my current car lender  the entire amount of my loan for whatever interest rate they will provide me, I have no idea at this point, and balance transfer as much of that as I can.  Then work out my payments on the 2 separate loans so that I pay off the 0% before the 15 months is out and still make as much payment as I can above the minimum on the interest loan.  

My question is should I balance transfer first and refinance the smaller amount or refinance all of it first and balance transfer after?  I'm not sure which would likely be better for paying as little interest as possible. Also, would a shorter term auto loan likely get me a lower interest rate vs higher?  IE 12 months vs 36 months?

personalfinance,I work for a small company with no payroll system yet. How do I set myself up for success?,"I'm 24 and I live in Utah. I'm not very good at separating questions from backstory so bear with me.

I am working for a 3 man company (they are an official LLC) and I'm being paid, by check, every few weeks. I started at the company in January of 2018 so this is all about how to set myself up for success this upcoming year.

Currently I get a check every few weeks. I document it in a timecard, save it locally and in the cloud. I keep track of my hours in a google sheet as well. When I get paid, I take photos of the check after I deposit it, timestamp it and also save it both locally and on the cloud. I know exactly what I've been paid for (whether it was expenses for a trip or a paycheck for my hours) and when.

 I make $40/hr which should be about $80k/yr. I'm not working 40hr/weeks all the time so this is changing all the time. 

They've been talking about me being an independent contractor. I'm a little skeptical because I've never done it before. I've heard on the Planet Money Podcast that it may make sense for me to be an independent contractor because of the new tax bill being very favorable to companies. Is this correct?

The other two guys at the company are older and have not taken any money out of the business yet (except for some travel and food expenses). One of them is a sales guy so he just makes commission, no salary. The other guy is retired and has decided he's only with the company for 1 year before he goes back to being retired. He'll probably take a lump sum near the end of his time. Not quite sure. The point is that I can't really follow another employees lead. 

I have been paid about $7,500 so far this year. They are withholding nothing so far. 

I know that I'd be responsible for the entire 15% vs 7% of federal withholding if I were to be an independent contractor. I may be able to negotiate a raise to cover that amount if I go that route. 

The company may be getting acquired by a larger company in the next few months and I may be hired as an employee by this larger company. 

1. Would it make more sense for me to be independent or an employee?  
2. What are some things I should be paying attention to if they hire me? 

3. What should I negotiate for? 

They are based out of TX so any health care options they have would probably be out of network here in Utah. 

- (4.) Should I ask for a larger wage in order to get healthcare on my own?

- (5.) Should I stay under the table until we are bought out? 

- (6.) Should I be a 10-99 worker? Why?

- (7.) Should I insist to be a W2 worker? Why?

I have no debt, I'm trying to save up for a house, I'm getting married in the next 12-14 months (Separate issue, we may get married early if we can save a bunch of money on health insurance. She is a full time engineer with good health insurance at her company. I pay $233/mo for low quaility insurance.)

- (8.) If I stay under the table, what would a loan officer think when I tried to apply for a mortgage?

I think I need to talk with a CPA about how to set myself up for success but I don’t know what questions to ask. I found a local one here in Salt Lake that would charge $400 for entity setup.

 Is this a good idea and a good deal or is it worth it for me to do it myself?

Thanks!

personalfinance,Is it worth staying for grad school or move on and get appropriate pay?,"I want to get a Master's degree. I also want to get paid more: I believe I am 10k below average.

Background:

I was a lazy dummy in college, graduating with an Electrical Engineering degree. Now I work in software support engineering (tech support with some testing and little development). I've been learning web dev on my own and feel like I now have the discipline I should have had.

Currently, I am 2 years out of college making 64k (after two 3% pay raise). I believe I am worth between the 68k to mid 70s at least depending on the type of work (development, support, testing, etc.).

My company offers to pay for grad school and I got accepted to an online program that doesn't cost much ($700 a unit). If I get the company (my department) to pay for it, I will have to stay working at my rate for the length of the grad program + 2 years after getting the degree. I applied for a Graduate Certificate in Computer Systems Engineering (half a Masters) that can be applied to a Masters if I reapply. I can tell my boss wants me to go to school (he has lost a lot of good employees in the past, or so I've heard).


Potential options:

I could leave and get paid a fair amount but I don't want to make up excuses to myself to not go to grad school. I do want to learn other skills as well (really looking forward to a response for this position in Network Support Engineering I interviewed for). 

When interviewing, the response about salary is that I am asking a bit high. I've noticed that I give my salary price when asked when I should have asked if they budgeted for the market value range.

Any advice would be helpful. Would it be possible to pay for school out of pocket if I cutback more on expenses? I lowered my benefits costs for 2018 but it didn't seem to make a significant difference to be honest.
The only negative about leaving my current company is that it has great benefits and is very laidback (teleworking on Fridays, flexible hours). I've been able to exercise efficiently based on the flexible schedule.

My company has an ESPP program, so I should receive around *$12k* worth of shares in March 2018. This occurs every 6 months so I'll get *~$10-12k* worth of ESPP shares again in September 2018. I also have RSUs and I should receive around *$40k* worth of shares in September 2018. I filed my taxes for 2017 and got *~$9k* in tax refund. I currently only have *~$1k* in funds saved up though.


I feel like this is a silly question, but is it better to just pay off everything really quickly? Some people told me that having loans is actually a good thing as it's better for your credit score. Not sure how that helps me as I don't think I'll be making big purchases this year or next. Is it better to just squirrel away my money in investments and pay the minimum every month?",finance

personalfinance,"Medical Bill Went to Collections, Paid by Insurance after. How to proceed?","Hey all,

I had a medical bill that my insurance company was fully responsible for. They took forever to pay the bill and denied it multiple times. I had a lot of back and forth with the medical company and the insurance company before the insurance finally paid the bill, but by that time, the medical company sent the bill to collections.

The bill has now been paid, but the collections agency has been calling my house repeatedly asking for a collections fee.

I got on a three way call with insurance and the collections agency where insurance informed them the bill had been paid and they won't pay anymore (the insurance is federal govt insurance). The collections agency is saying they don't care and that the debt is on me, not the insurance agency.

The collections agency also told me on that call that after 6 months, the debt goes back to the medical service (is that even possible?) and at that point I won't have to deal with this anymore.

Is there a best path for moving forward? I'm not sure whether the debt will really go back to the medical company (i.e. it's paid and over). I don't see myself being responsible for this debt, but if I'm wrong, I don't want this hitting my credit.

investing,REITS and their ridiculous yields...,"There are REITS out there that do not perform too bad. They do not do great, but they're not very volatile and they are paying out ridiculous annual yields (they have to by law). What is the downside I am missing from owning some REITS that pay 15%+ annual dividends? You might do better from other stocks that appreciate in value, but that is only with the bull market we've had in the last few years. In the long term, are REITS as great of an investment as they seem, or are you better off putting your money somewhere else? Another question, how close are REITS to actual Real Estate investing as far as ""Equity invested to payout"" ratio? Thanks to anyone who takes the time to indulge my possibly dumb question.

This was on an AMA, I understand this perspective. I don't know if the government would ever support something that is so anonymous due to the reasons above. I guess the crypto currency could just stick to its own lane, but then the ideas  that these businesses (Ripple, for example) are dwarfed, because from the looks of it, they expect Ripple to be a common banking tool, which wouldn't work out due to the government not supporting the anonymity of it.

personalfinance,"Tax refund total is ~$3,000 less this year, with no significant changes.","Admittedly, I don't know much about taxes.. My wife and I file jointly, and have our taxes done by a family friend who's filed them for the past 8 years.

We take our W2, mortgage interest statement, bank (savings) interest statement, and the slip that shows what you took as a return from last years taxes. (I believe it counts towards taxable income) Then she does all the paperwork and lets us know what both the State and Federal refunds will be.

However, this year our refund is down ~45-50% and there haven't been any changes to our withholding.

Both my wife and I (no children) file ""Married, 1"" which hasn't changed.

There was a gross increase in income of $8,415 over last year for a total of $118,127, but that's still far from hitting the next tax bracket.

I'm just not sure where to start looking into this, as it doesn't make sense to me. There was an increase in income, but since we made zero changes to witholdings/healthcare/401k over last year I figured it would all balance and we'd see roughly the same as last year's numbers.

I recall last year our compounded property tax account came up short, and we had to pay something like $3,000 out of pocket.. but I've been wracking my brain and that's the ONLY difference I can think of in the past year.

I'm hoping for a direction to start looking in so this will make more sense to me. I don't really think they were filed incorrectly this year, I'd just like to know why.. I was told ""It's because we made more this year."" but that' doesn't explain it for me.",finance

I am the only one making payments, as per a deal I made with my parents (I have two younger brothers about to graduate college as well, so family money is tight).

I have a 4.0 GPA in Electrical Engineering, and have been working for the Federal Govt for the pathways internship program.

The program states that upon graduation, I will become be converted to a full time federal employee, and be paid 44k.  After 6 months, I will be paid 53k, another 6 months I will be paid 76k. 
 I this point I will have reached the promotion potential(GS12) and receive 3% increases every year.

When I think of my ideal budget per month, I would like to spend around:

750 for rent/utilities

125 for insurance

125 for gas

500 for roth IRA

500 for student loans(35k)

200 for food

300 for fun

1000 for parents

1000 for house

In total I believe that is around 4500 per month.  I take home about 65% after healthcare, taxes, fees, and 401k.  That means that I would need to be making 6885/month(83k/year) to be doing this plan.  This plan allows me to be close to buying a house after 5 years.  But obviously I cannot do this while staying with the govt.  I would need to push back this plan another 5 years to be making this work and not be able to help my parents or save towards a house.  My parents could really use money now, but I am out of state so I cannot live with them to help.  

I believe that the money is good when I reach GS12, but I feel that I may be short changing myself.  I am not a genius by any means, and my GPA strictly reflects the amount of effort, time, and sacrifices I have made during my college career.  

What are my chances at getting paid higher at a private industry job and being able to keep that job without being laid off?  Any other advice would be great too.  Maybe I am overlooking some numbers or opportunities.  If I stick with the govt, I would plan on working a part time as well (bartending maybe or tutoring).

I have a 403b from a previous employer that I'd like to withdraw and defer as much of the tax burden as possible. I'm 39 and financially secure. My retirement is set and that situation isn't expected to change. 

I know that if I withdraw now, it's subject to 10% penalty and taxes. This is fine. It's currently serviced by Fidelity. They've informed me that under the plan, I cannot defer the 10% penalty meaning I can't withdraw and pay it later. This is also fine.

But they've also told me they are required to withhold my tax penalty meaning I cannot withdraw the money and pay the tax penalty on my 2018 taxes. HOWEVER, I was advised by more than one of their representatives that I could rollover my 403b into a Traditional IRA and then withdraw the full amount while not paying taxes until I filed next year. I'm not finding any information about this on their website and for that matter, I can't find anything that stipulates they're required to withhold a minimum of 20% federal tax and an undisclosed % for state taxes (tbd when i withdraw) ""on my behalf.""

Bitcoin,“Mining” Bitcoin with HQ live. Any other programmers interested?,"The following idea is not intended to be used in actual gameplay as it violates HQ’s terms of service. However, I will point out that accounts using it would likely be at little to no risk of being known :)  

The goal is in theory to passively generate cryptocurrency using HQ Live by using machine learning and a “pool” of accounts. The concept would work as follows:



-A screen feed would be fed into a desktop display from an iphone (simply using a USB connection)

-A program would be designed to detect and scrape text from the screen feed as soon as it detects the question on the screen (tesseract?). 

-A data table would be generated by creating variables such as Wikipedia keyword search counts, google search keyword counts, etc. 

-Using these variables, a model would be trained to answer 3-question trivia questions, and output each answer a confidence score (a simple Machine learning binary classification model should work)

-A reinforcement learning bot (q-learning) would then assess these scores and allocate answers for a pool of accounts (if it is unsure, it could choose different answers on different accounts so that at least some will advance). It would be trained to maximize total payout at the end of the game. Answers would be chosen by the bot at timestamps of randomized variance :)

-at the end of the game, each account that won’s payout would automatically be converted into Bitcoin and divided equally between all accounts that were placed into the machine by sending to their designated wallet. 




Since the game begins daily at the same two times, a timer system could be used to passively run the program at the specified times. Any interest out there?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Should I use a loan or a credit card,"So, I’m in a bit of a financial pickle. I like to call it a pickle because pickle is a fun word for problems and in general it makes me less stressed. Also, I like pickles.

Anyway, I’m in my first year of graduate school and I’m leaving my PI. There are a lot of reasons for this but its happening. The way my program is set up, I’m guaranteed funding for my position however its become clear that, though there are options, I’m going to be in trouble if I don’t find another PI by the end of the semester.

 My contract with my current guy ends on May 15th.  I currently make 730.00 per pay check twice a month and I live with a roommate paying 645 a month in rent and my lease goes until July. My car insurance costs 135 per month though I bicycle most places, so I’ll probably decrease my coverage at the end of the term.

So, with this in mind, I have around 1500 dollars due to the school by the end of the year. I expect for a little bit back on my taxes, but it probably won’t be enough to cover school costs. I keep my grocery budget down to about 50 dollars a week so long as I don’t need to purchase non-foods. So usually I spend less than 200 per month in groceries. I also try to put as much as 100 dollars a month into savings but that hasn’t worked out well the last six months so I’m up to about 500 total savings-wise.

Overall, with the way I budget, I make 1400 per month and spend about 1300 a month, which varies according to school payments. I had some serious health problems over Christmas and I have not been able to pay more than about 400 toward the school. I also have some old medical bills that popped up that, while I intend to contest them, sets me back by about another 600 dollars. All in all, I don’t know that I can 100% make the school payments I need to make by the end of the semester when they’re due. Adding to this the extra two months that I may not have funding I’m stressing out pretty significantly.

What I’m contemplating, is taking out a personal loan. I have very good credit and, aside from medical bills, no other debt. I had come to the conclusion that I didn’t enjoy living on every other paycheck and had already contemplated taking out a loan earlier in the year, but I’ve put it off and budgeted more exhaustively, so I’m back to just paycheck to paycheck.

 Now my experience with personal loans is nil. I’ve never taken out a loan. I financed a new laptop last year on a 0% interest credit card and finished paying it off in December. The idea I toyed with was taking out a loan to cover the entirety of my school fees, medical bills, the remainder of my rent to July, and my car insurance (445 for another 3 months).  Which comes to about 6220.

From there I thought to make as big a payment as I could until May and then be assured a standard monthly payment through the summer. (presumably I’d have found TA/RAship by fall, if not I’m not sure what needs to happen but probably I’d have to withdraw from my program completely and that’s a whole separate bundle of bullshit that would likely result in me working at Walmart for a year and working to get into a different program.

So, in my calculations if I took out a 6500-dollar 5-year loan with a 7.99% interest rate, my monthly payments would be about 132.00 per month, and if I overpaid by 800 dollars through may, then made regular payments, I would have it paid off by May 2020, though presumably I’d make other overpayments once I had a consistent income again.

What concerns me with this path is that it adds essentially a 150 payment to my expenses every month plus the 100+ car insurance +rent wherever I go after July. (this will definitely be cheaper as I’m looking at much cheaper housing. I was in a desperate spot when I first moved here and didn’t have a lot of options.)

I’m also contemplating taking a smaller loan to cover just my school and housing for those last two months, and contemplating opening a new credit card with a 0% interest rate. (my bank is trying pretty hard to get me to use theirs with a 1.8% cashback and 200$ reward for spending 1000+ in the first three months.there’s also an 18 month 0% APR so it seems like a viable option) my concern with that is that I feel that carrying a balance like that, would have more detriment than benefit to my credit score and sanity. 

So, what should I do? Are there better options? I don’t want to take out a student loan because the interest rates and rules around them are almost definitely worse for me short term, and I don’t want to carry this debt or risk not paying it off in time on a credit card…. I’m very paranoid about debt and I’d like to keep this as short-lived as possible.",finance

personalfinance,Need help/suggestions to decide about saving for retirement vs stocks. And few questions about 529 plan.,"Hey guys, long time lurker finally posting to seek your wisdom. Please brace for a wall of text as I want to give you the complete picture.

This is my situation - Due to certain career challenges, my wife and I only recently (for the past 1.5 years) started earning better income. We currently earn $5300/month after taxes. Our expenses ($4500 - $5100) include groceries, supplies, gas, (credit card) - $1200 - $1800, rent and utilities ($1200),  2 Car payments ($500 for both), Daycare ($1100), Internet, insurance and phone ($350) and some medical costs, as its common with a family with kids ($150). We try to watch our expenses and not have a long discussion to know if we need it vs want it. At the moment, we are able to save $300 - $400/month. We have been able to save $12k in one savings account (for 529 plan) and another $2k for emergency repairs. We currently have $20k in checking account. We will be receiving tax refund of $4500 soon. 

1. 529 Plan - we plan to empty our $12K savings into the 529 plan and contribute $300 per month into that plan from now on. However, based on the calculations, it would only amount to $160K @ 8% interest rate. I am no expert at this, so I used an online calculator. My question is, are we better off doing this, or do we get better returns by taking a conservative approach when investing in the market? Which is a safer way to get more funds?

2. Along the same line of inquiry, I am conflicted between saving for retirement by contributing to my 403(b) vs investing some money in the market. Regarding my retirement, I currently have $9500 in my 403(b). I contribute 5% per paycheck (bi-monthly pay), my employer matches 2% of my paycheck and gives me an annual 5% contribution per year (One-time contribution in first quarter of next year). I could increase my contribution but we are planning to take a term-life policy, so that our daughter will have some funds in an unfortunate event. Instead of increasing the contribution to my retirement account, I would like to use that money for the life insurance. Is that a good idea?

3. We would like to invest in the market with some of our savings and tax refund ($10K). What would be the ideal way to achieve this? I am not financially a savvy person, and I have tried to read some of the posts and wiki and I want conservative options, to protect my investment. Is that a wrong approach ?

To give a bit more clarity, we have only been employed for the past 6 years - hourly jobs. So may be that will help why we have saved so little.

investing,US Consumer Debt Levels Downplay Monthly Burdens on Consumers - Here is Why,"**Warning, this is a long post, but it's segmented and sourced at least**

So a little while back, I created a [post discussing aggregate consumer debt](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/7nvlt0/aggregate_debt_is_anyone_concerned/), and how it might be something we should be worried about. There were some good discussions and good points brought up. The discussion was largely predicated on this graph seen here, which aggregates total consumer debt - https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc.html

**The Basic Issue With Our Current Debt...** Debts Rising &gt; Wages Rising = Bad, especially if that debt is higher than the time we went into a worldwide financial crisis due to debt. 

In 2008, the financial crisis was largely caused by a massive mortgage debt bubble. As a result of this, many people have been looking out for debt bubbles that hit across a singular sector. But my general thought is it doesn't really matter that much **where** the debt is coming from, it's a simple matter of the cumulative debt burden that is placed on each household that will cause issues in the economy. People have been trying to pin debt problems down to one sector, such as the auto loan bubble, or student loan bubble. But very few have mentioned that it's the aggregate debt that matters most, and small credit bubbles that occur across sectors can become very large when grouped together and added to other debts. 

I noticed that current consumer debt levels are past where they were pre-financial crisis and the pace is steepening. The real kicker is that this has been happening at a time where household wage growth has been relatively small, and only in the past 1-2 years rose past the average per-household level we saw in 2007-2008. The lack of wage growth is evident in the fact that the fed has been unsuccessfully trying to spur wage growth for years, since it would validate their inflation targets that they have had a very difficult time of meeting. 

**The General Question at Hand...**

Basic logic would dictate that if wages have only grown minimally while consumer debts have grown substantially, isn't this going down a path that doesn't end well? Also, while mortgage debts haven't grown past where they were in 2008, other types of consumer credit (student loan debt, credit card debt, and auto loan debt) have shot total consumer credit past the aggregate debt levels seen pre-crisis. The other issue here is that mortgage debt tends to be the easiest to service, since mortgages tend to feature the longest term structure on average along with generally low interest rates. So if we are increasing shorter term debt that generally has a higher interest rate, this would probably put even more strain on the consumer, wouldn't it?

**Was There any Data That Validated These Issues?**

Beyond the basic theory crafting here, it seems like there have been some real issues showing up in consumer reports in the past year or so. Auto Loan defaults are beyond where they were before the financial crisis. Student loan defaults are above 11% and have been rising for a while. Credit card delinquencies have been rising. This all has taken place at a time where the [consumer savings rate has been dropping near an all time low](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT), and [consumer credit card debt hit an all time high after a huge spike in November](https://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/up-g19-federal-reserve-credit-debt-01082018.php). 

But corporate earnings are great, so the economy must be good, right? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ . The counter-argument to this of course could be that credit expansion has caused corporate earnings to look great. 

Who knows, this may not be the case, and that's somewhat of a separate discussion altogether so I don't want to side track the point of this post. 

Now, there are some reasonable arguments to be made that credit growth is due to consumers being more confident in the future of the economy, but consumer confidence frequently been a contrarian indicator that leads recessions, so I'm not sure this would make me feel better. Also, if this were consumers simply being more confident, why are we seeing the credit issues with student loans and auto loans?

**The Debt Servicing Problem**

So all the information that was previously mentioned looks like it checks out... The theory makes sense, the debt levels are real, and there are some issues showing up in consumers' ability to meet their debt obligations, so what is the problem? 

So in the previous post, there was a very interesting statistic brought up in that discussion by u/enginerd03 and a few others that seemed to refute everything that I brought up above. That stat was FED data on debt servicing, which basically shows consumers' ability to meet their debt payment obligations, which if you look at the data, looks quite rosy. You can see some fed data on debt servicing here:  

* [Home Payment Debt Servicing](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TDSP)
* [Consumer Debt Servicing](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CDSP)

This threw me through a loop. Something in the logic completely doesn't add up here. How could debt servicing be so good here, while credit was expanding, some issues meeting obligations are starting to show up, all in a rising rate environment? My initial reaction was to literally say wtf... I assumed the data was right and there was something I was either missing completely, or I was simply wrong. 

**The Missing Piece, and Why I think We May Be Underestimating Consumer Strain**

Recently, I *think* I found the missing piece. The devil is in the details here. If you look at the two above links, you'll notice that the top home payment debt servicing exclusively shows servicing for mortgages. The consumer debt servicing looks a good bit worse as it has been rising since 2012, possibly due to rising non-mortgage credit. With that said, neither of these look like they tell that great of a story considering that according to the second link, consumer debt servicing was worse before the 2001 tech crash than during and after the great recession. 

Regardless, it's relevant to understand how consumer debt is accounted by the fed. The fed charts here account for consumer debt by adding up mortgage debt, credit card debt, auto loan debt, and other small loans and revolving credit issued to consumers. Together, all of these debts account for a large majority of the fixed expenses that people pay on a monthly basis. With that said, they do not include one really important expense.... RENT.

**A Brief Rundown on How Rent Has Changed Things**

Rent as we all know, is a major fixed expense. In this regard, it's not all that different from a mortgage payment, with the exception that in the event of non-payment, the renter is not liable for the rest of the money owed, and will instead get evicted. I'll touch back on this in a short bit.

So as everyone knows, the housing bubble busted, many people lost their homes, many speculators lost a ton of money, and the real estate market went bottom up. This resulted in the Dodd-Frank act passing, and much tighter lending conditions being enacted on people. The aforementioned factors led to a significant shift in how Americans pay for their housing. Instead of burdening themselves with excess liabilities, especially in the face of tighter lending conditions, Americans increasingly have decided to rent. 

There are other factors at play as well. Young Americans have had more and more difficulty mustering up the 20% downpayment that is generally needed to make a mortgage significantly more affordable. This can be attributed to many factors, but student loan debt and lack of wage growth in the middle class likely play in here (see how this is related?). 

Average rental price has grown significantly, going from around $1050 in 2007 to $1359 in 2017 (according to [RentCafe](https://www.rentcafe.com/blog/rental-market/apartment-rent-report/year-end-2017-national-apartment-market-report/) ). This represents a 30% increase in monthly costs for rent. More importantly, the *volume* of renters has increased greatly since the financial crisis as a result of the factors mentioned above. **Rentals as a percentage of households increased from 31% in 2006 to over 36% currently** - [see pew research article for more info](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/07/19/more-u-s-households-are-renting-than-at-any-point-in-50-years/). 

So while we have not seen the huge growth in debt in the housing sector of consumer debt, this is because it's being offset by enormous growth in renters. And the reason renters are renting more and buying less may be partially due to being squeezed in other areas of consumer debt, which makes it extremely tough to save enough $ for a home down payment. 

**Rent vs. Mortgage Payments, not Apples to Oranges**

Yes, I know, rent is not the same as paying for a mortgage. You can't go bankrupt if you don't pay rent. With that said, rent is essentially a fixed cost for the majority of consumers that is essentially a basic requirement of living, so you can't just count it out of the equation of consumer cost burdens. 

Also, while rent is accounted for in consumer debt measurements by the FED or many other data researchers, it's highly relevant to state that the rent being paid by rentees goes to a landlord, who DOES pay a mortgage. This means that the debt burden is simply being passed from consumer debt to commercial debt in the statistics, which tends to skew things. And make no mistake, renters not being able to pay their rent will lead to landlords defaulting on their mortgages (although there is likely a bit more cushion here). I have seen mentions of a commercial debt bubble in the United States before, which could be related, but I haven't done much reading or delving into this topic to be able to comment on it.

**Revising the Data**

So what we really want to see is how consumers are being squeezed from a fixed cost perspective, which results in increased credit growth and increased inability to make payments. 

So what I did was take the data provided by the fed (total mortgage debt outstanding) and divided that by the amount of households in the United States. This provides us with an average of how much outstanding debt on average each household owes. I calculated households by taking US population and dividing it by the average person per household (generally around 2.6, but it has decreased a little bit since 2007). *Naturally, average mortgage payment includes households that do not pay for mortgages at all, so it will look a little bit low in the chart below.* 

Since I couldn't find data on this, I had to go with a very rough estimate on average monthly mortgage payment. So I took the average outstanding mortgage debt per household and put it into an amortization table estimating an average of 20 years left and a 4.5% interest rate. Clearly this isn't going to be perfect from a data perspective, but it is at least uniform throughout each year, and should provide a good snapshot comparison of the REAL costs of paying for a home are from 2007 to 2017. 

I then took the average rent payment (which I mentioned above) and averaged that out on a per-household basis, so that similar to mortgages, it accounted for the entire population of households and not just people who are renting. 

From there, I added the two together to get more of a REAL look into the average cost of paying for housing. It turns out that housing costs didn't drop nearly as much as we thought after the financial crisis, the costs just shifted more from mortgage expenses to rental expenses. 

**edit:** See the link below for the data I crunched. (anyone know how to format something as a table? would be nice to show it in the post)

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12CcrXh28zjfORDl5ENKIlVQXX-R1oid7Ak3JM4O1pxs/edit?usp=sharing


**Re-evaluating earlier data with new information**

So with the knowledge that more Americans are renting, and rental costs are increasing, if consumers are being squeezed, we should see more evictions, right? Well [this turns out to be true](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/12/americas-eviction-epidemic-matthew-desmond-housing-crisis) [and the obvious reasons why are also backed up with stats](https://www.forbes.com/sites/troymcmullen/2016/12/12/why-more-americans-are-facing-eviction/#7f6becb81617). 

Also, lets revisit that debt servicing chart from earlier (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CDSP). It turns out that it's not so strange after all, we are getting pretty close to the range that we were in right before the markets crashed in both 2000/2001 as well as 2007/2008. And notice the dip in that chart after the great recession from around 2011 to 2015? That correlates strongly with the data in the table above, where housing payments were down slightly in that time frame. And similarly, the time frame from 2011 to 2015 which featured the lowest housing payment costs correlates well with an [increase in personal savings rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT), which is as of 2017/2018 near an all time low.

personalfinance,More information about Refinancing and Consolidation loans,"Hi all, Reading through the wiki I'm not finding much covering refinancing and consolidation loans. Its very possible I'm just over looking it or theres a different term... Or is it because they're just generally a bad idea? haha


Heres my situation and questions:
I currently have 10k$ balance on my motorcycle loan @ 10.49%, an outstanding credit card balance of 6.5k at 20.24%, and a mortgage of 192k @ 4.25%. Previously I've had two other cards under 3k that have both been paid to 0 and now cover very small bills (netflix and insurance) which are immediately paid off. My credit score has slowly risen to 700.


I've been told by friends that the 10.49% for the motorcycle is high, and i'd assume thats because its a long term signature loan via Suntrust bank. My first question, could/should I shop for a lower rate loan against the bike that might also be enough to pay down my higher interest credit card debt? or, alternative, should I bother shopping for a lower rate signature loan or consolidation loan? As far as I know, the biggest disadvantage is that this would 'reset' the age of the loan and start a new 60 month (or however long) timer.


Alternative to this, is there any value in looking into refinancing my mortgage? my assumption being that the house has risen in value with the market, the interest rates still seem comparable to my current rate and obviously the mortgage has a much lower rate than the other two credit lines... What I'm not sure of here is how much refinancing costs... as well as just about everything else about refinancing, haha.

personalfinance,Imputed income on W2 (For getting medical insurance for domestic partner thru my employer),"I just got a shock while filing taxes for 2017.

I did not how ever just blow the money, i actually invested way more into myself over the year, a new truck, trailer, tools, and organization to increase my output vs time on jobs, to increase my profits. 

    So my grand new life plan.

All of the quarterly unemployment, state, and federal tax returns with  have to be amended for the time you have been here, which is August, through the end of 2017.  They charge $200 per return to amend them and $45 for the W2 to be corrected.  That means the third and fourth quarter unemployment, state and federal tax returns @ $200 a piece will be $1,200.  The W2 will be $45.  The total cost will be $1,245.00.  It will take 4 to 6 weeks for these corrections to be made.  Let me know if you want the $1,245.00 deducted from one paycheck or if you would rather spread it out over a two or three paychecks.""

Is it my employer's right to charge me for this? I also am pretty sure I've filled out HR paperwork since my actual hire that DID have my correct SSN on it... but regardless, can this still fall on me? I suppose I'm still in the heavy panic stage of all this, as this is a huge sum of money for me to potentially lose. Any advice or thoughts on how to move forward are greatly appreciated - thank you!",finance

Interest Rate is the annualized rate applied to the principal balance of the account each day in order to determine the amount of interest that has accrued on that day’s principal balance. Annual Percentage Yield (APY) reflects the effect of compounding frequency (Personal Savings accounts are compounded daily) on the interest rate over a 365-day period.

personalfinance,Credit card debt: continue avalanche method or get a personal loan?,"Hey, guys. 

I recently got out of grad school and I'm finally making enough money that I can make some pretty big monthly payments on my credit card debt. Due to some idiocy after getting divorced and being dumb enough to put tuition on a card, here's what I've got:

CC #1 - $7329 balance, 21.05% APR (variable), min payment $214.
CC #2 - $6804 balance, 15.49% APR, min payment $158.

While I was still in school I was making equal payments on both of these - anywhere from $250 to $300. Once I graduated and got a better paying job, those payments went up to about $350-$400 each every month. Lately (just in the last 2 months), I've adopted the avalanche method, in which I'm paying $600-$650 on CC #1 and $200-$250 on CC #2. I never use either card anymore, and I haven't for months.

Here's my question: Should I continue with this avalanche method where I'm attacking CC #1 and paying just slightly over minimum on CC #2, OR, should I opt for a personal loan with an interest rate of about 16% on which I could make monthly payments between $800 and $900?

Seems to me the personal loan is the better option, but I'm not financially savvy and I'd like some advice from those with more experience! Thanks in advance.",finance

It's a small house (about 750 SF), so it doesn't fit the bank's ""conventional"" status, thus we're getting higher interest rates and possibly an ARM once the construction is complete.

We have a sizable amount saved up (about $40k) to put down, but to me, this almost seems worse. Since we will be needing two loans for during and after construction, that's two closing costs. For a $110k house, putting down $40k, I'm estimating that closing costs will hover around $20k.

Paying $20k just to borrow $70k ($110k minus $40k down) seems absurd to me, and feels like I'm making a hugely stupid move financially. I have good credit, solid savings, and thought I was being sensible by going for a smaller house.

Am I going about this the wrong way? Is there another way? I've tried farm credit unions, but the house plans don't fit any definition they can cover. Also, my parents have the money, but aren't willing to help out even after drafting a contract where I'd pay it off in 5 years (Not that I'm being an entitled shit and expect the money).",finance

I go to college in NY and have a part time job here where I made just under 5k over the past year. Over the summer I worked in Rhode Island and made just under 6k. However, I still claim residency in the state of Massachusetts (as well as being claimed as dependent by my parents) where I have made no money over the course of the last year. Just to make matters more complicated, I also have about $1500 in short term capital gains from cryptocurrency.

 Because I'm a dependent, it seems that in the states of Rhode Island and New York, my personal deduction is only 3,100 so I still have to file taxes there for wages earned in each state. I've also filled out my federal taxes where I claimed my total wages,short term capital gains, and some minimal amount of dividends. However, turbotax is telling me that Massachusetts wants to tax my income again (which was already taxed in New York and Rhode Island). From some brief research, it seems that Massachusetts only wants to tax on gross income over 8,000 made in the state (which means technically I wouldn't have to file), but I feel like I'm missing some nuance here. I don't know if that number is lower because I'm claimed as a dependent or if I still get taxed anyway because I'm a resident. 

Does anyway know Massachusetts residency tax law? Do I even need to file there? And are my short term capital gains considered wages made in Massachusetts because I'm resident there, even though it's all digital?

personalfinance,Should I liquify my mutual funds into savings?,"Hello,

I inherited 50k which is being held in mutual funds. I am thinking of liquifying them to cash, either partially or fully. I could discuss this with my advisor but he obviously wouldn't suggest it. I have 9k in school debt I want to pay off, and about 6k in credit card debt I want to pay off. 

My problem is that because it's in mutual funds I have been too scared to touch them because I hate having to go through my financial advisor for these decisions. When I told him I wanted to pay off my credit card with the money he pretty much told me to do it slowly with dividends or I'd have to start selling which he didn't want to do. But I am paying high-interest rates and wasting my cash by not paying it off completely.

I really want to go to school, but I am afraid to touch that money. And that's why I haven't just done it. I need to pay this 9k to get my transcripts so I can transfer.

I guess I am just tired of having my money in someone else's hands. It's been good because I am not touching it, but it's bad because I am not doing things that are beneficial to me. I am good with money (okay, I racked up some debt from traveling for a couple years, but I don't plan to do that again, I'm otherwise very frugal) and I don't plan to use it for anything but essentials such as my education. 

Is it a good idea to just keep it in savings? I feel like savings are meant for practical things. I'm not necessarily trying to invest right now. I don't have an interest in stocks so I feel very disconnected from my money in general. I wish I could make my own decisions about them, but I'm uneducated on the whole thing.

I also have anxiety about the market and would rather have cash than to potentially lose everything one day. My advisor told me it went up 15% last year? But to me, that sort of volatility turns me off. I don't want to deal with it when it goes down. 

Another question is taxes. What sort of capital gain tax am I looking at by selling? How will this affect filing my taxes next year?

As I am trying to minimize the hit to my credit score I want to have a solid list to apply to all at once. In my research I'm finding a lot of these refinancers are serviced by a few larger entities. Ie: Navy Federal is serviced by LendKey. I actually called LendKey and they told me they can only keep one application open at a time and suggested I would have better service with my credit union at least than direct with them - so that's answered. Another example: Earnest is serviced by Navient who has a non-compete with Sallie Mae (the holder of the loans I want refinanced) so that knocks Earnest out of the running. 


Now looking at my other potentials, I am wondering how much extra research I gotta do, and if y'all knowledgeable ladies and gents might be able to help me get a hold of: 

1) If it is better to apply to the larger parent servicer, or through the smaller entities. 

2) LendKey aside, does it make sense to apply to more than one company / bank that is under the same servicer if they allow it to try to get the best rate?

4) What in your opinion is a good list of loan servicers to rate shop refinancing my loans with.

However, back in my private university days, I completed a Bachelors degree in History, German Language and Religion, graduating Summa Cum Laude with a variety of honors, achievements, experience, etc.

personalfinance,Student Loan (and Parent Plus) Repayment and Financial Stability,"I am 26 years old. For my undergrad, I took out a boat load of student loans in order to cover the costs. In addition to loans in my name, I also required financial assistance in the form of Parent Plus Loans. Roughly $31,000 in Fed Sub/UnSub loans and roughly $30,000 in PP loans. When the PP loans were applied for it was understood that I would be responsible for repayment, not my parents. That saddled me with $61,000 upon graduation in December of 2013. My parent's refi'd the PP loan last year in order to reduce the interest rate and made me a cosigner and resulting in payments of $186/month. I have been on Income Driven Repayment plans for my Fed Sub/Unsub loans with a required monthly payment of $89.00 which obviously doesn’t even cover interest as fast as it accrues. 

Prior to mid-2017 I was earning roughly $30k a year. Now that I am making more, I am ineligible for Income Driven Repayment plans through my loan servicer. My loans are about to go from about $89/mo. (which wasn't even covering interest) to $355/mo. I should note that every few months I would throw a good chunk of my sales commission toward this loan in addition to the required payment in hopes of not drowning. I now work as a sales rep in an industry which has big potential, however at this time I am still very green. Base salary is roughly $2200/month gross-$1600/month net; $100 of which goes to my recently started Roth IRA. Sales cycles are typically very long and commissions vary and unpredictable as I am still new to the industry.

So to recap, I am about to go from paying $275/month to $544/month and panic is setting in. Had I known what “drowning in student loan debt” felt like when I decided to go to college, I would have done things differently, however it is now coming up on 8 years since I made that decision and it is now time for me to lay in the bed. I made it after all. I have not refinanced because my interest rates vary from 3.15 to 6.55% and I know that I will not be able to obtain a lower average interest rate. From what I understand, my loan servicer does not recognize my Parent Plus Loan as a student loan expense due to the fact that it is obviously in my parent’s name and not mine. Therefore does not take it into account when determining my monthly repayment. I have researched and it seems like there is no way to transfer the PP Loan into my name, regardless of having sole financial responsibility. Mind you, I have no qualms with my responsibility. I would just like my responsibility to be reflected toward my credit score and repayment plan eligibility. 

I live fairly frugally and do not have many unnecessary expenses. (No cable, I drive a 12 year old econo-box car that is paid for, cut my own hair, and avoid eating out etc.) I live with my fiancé in a house that she bought last year. I do not pay rent, but I cover all utilities and should a major repair need to be done, it is usually my responsibility. Just our way of me contributing toward the expenses of homeownership. I do have about $11k in savings, and no debt outside of my student loans. The majority of the savings account has been saved in order to pay for my wedding this coming August as well as a safety net should things go south.

personalfinance,TurboTax import missed a form and cost me some avoidable fees,"Hey y'all - just want to provide a quick warning to the ladies and gents of PF.

For my 2016 tax return, I used TurboTax. TurboTax has a feature that will import all of your 1099s from various brokerages and bank accounts, so that you don't have to manual input the data.

I logged into my Fidelity account through TurboTax and imorted my consolidated 1099 for my brokerage account and my 1099-R for my IRA. TurboTax had a little pop-up that said that it had imported all documents from Fidelity and that I could be on my way. 


Unfortunately, TurboTax did not import my 1099-R from NetBenefits, which is the employee benefit's site for my work, which is managed by Fidelity.


This additional income was then not reported, which turned on a bunch of work of having to file amendments for state and federal tax returns. This unreported income put me over the IRS limits for Roth IRA contributions. This wouldn't be a bad thing if I found this earlier and could re-characterize to traditional and roll-over as a backdoor Roth, but I found the mistake too late. This means I have to pay a 6% penalty on my Roth contribution as well remove the excess Roth contribution (all of it) and any pro-rata earnings.


On top of all this, there will be interest for the tax not paid and possibly a penalty (unless the IRS lets it slide because I amended the return before they asked for the tax I owe).

This was estimated off the free TurboTax app which has been pretty accurate for us in the past. We used to have more difficult taxes and have an accountant submit them (we'd rather pay a few extra dollars and have less stress on us if we'd competed it correctly).  So we'll have an accountant look at 2017 as well.

Past two years we've owed so at the beginning of 2016 we double checked our withholdings, both of us at 0 for 2017. My husband even requested to withdrawal extra for 2017.

Last year, we made $106,000. But only $11,000 was taken out for federal, roughly just 10%. At first I just thought, well damn, guess we need to take out more for 2018. 

Then today we received his first full paycheck (15 days) from new employer. Claimed 0 on withholding. And 28% of his paycheck went to federal (new salary $125,000). 

So, now we are going back to 2017 pay stubs and making sure the W-2 is correct, which states 0 claims. 

We are just so confused as to how this happened. I don't understand why 0 claims at one company would take 10% for federal (which seems low) vs 28%. Are we missing something?

The advice on the sidebar seems a bit conflicted on this. If I don't, I'll just be dumping this all in Vanguard mutual funds at whatever split they suggest to me based on my risk tolerances.

The other lingering question is if I should buy a house...for important context, I live in one of the most expensive places in the US (silicon valley) where a small house is gonna be ~1.2-1.5M.  I'd wait ~6 months before doing this. Also not sure if I should buy it all in cash, or still get a mortgage and use my financial security to secure low-interest rate (the logic being I can make more investing the money than I'd lose to interest on a loan).

Would love anyone's perspective on this! Got some mixed advice on past threads on whether hiring wealth management is good in this situation or not. I've also lived relatively cheaply, grew up a saver, and have a little bit of experience managing my savings in vanguard so I might be fine going this alone?",finance
personalfinance,Can both working spouse claim son as dependant,"So the new w4 forms are out, and we both work, and have one son, who is 15 months.

I have always wondered, can we both claim him as a dependent on our forms, or only 1 of us can?

I ran through the w4 form, and did the ""Two-Earners/Multiple Jobs Worksheet"" and it asked to put ""0"" for line 5, page 1, since  1 is less than line 2.

And I ran through the table, and ended up estimating our additional withholding per pay check needed.

Do this mean, my wife should be claiming 0 for the federal allowances too, going forward?",finance

personalfinance,"Pay off my leased car, student loans or save for a house?","I have several questions here.

I believe I made a mistake in leasing my Jeep because I didn't want to commit to it at the time. However, it turns out I love the vehicle. I am currently 6 months in to a 39 month lease. So I have 33 payments left. I pay $359 a month for a new Jeep Renegade which is steep but this car is my baby and I enjoy it for the time being.
This comes out to a total of $14,028 at the end of my lease with the buyout set to $12,229.00.

I also have a student loan remainder of $31,000 with the highest interest rate at 5% the rest 3.8-4%.

I am 26 and currently live at home and plan to for the next year. I make $51,750 a year. This month I just started saving $1,000 a month and would like to increase that to $1,500 leaving me at $18,000 in my savings before I leave home.

What should I do with this money? 

Option 1: Should I buy out my Jeep and try to negotiate a cheaper price depending on the worth of the vehicle at the time? I was thinking $11,000 would be the most I would pay for it at the end of the three year lease. The car would only have 30,000 miles on it and would still be fairly new. I do not want to buy a car I would have to do frequent repairs on and I want to stick to a 4x4 vehicle that handles well in the snow. Leaving me with a bit of emergency money in my savings still.

However, I am not sure what I would be required to pay out the lease if it was a year early leaving 21 months of remaining payments. I'm sure it would be much higher than the buyout at the end of the lease because I still owe money on it.

Option 2: I pay off $18,000 of my student loan debt leaving me with no savings at all. Leaving me with $10,648 on the loan at lower interest rates. Currently I pay $196 a month which is manageable for me.

Option 3: I take this money and put it for a down payment on a house. I would like to move out after a year as my current living situation with my mother is emotionally toxic to me. Rent also seems like a bit of a waste of money to me and the price of rent out here is about $800-900 a month without utilities for a one bedroom on the modest side. HOWEVER, I have not actually ever lived on my own. I would prefer to not have roommates if I can swing it. I'm an only child and like my privacy.

Any input would be appreciated. Thank You!",finance
personalfinance,W-2 from previous employer seems odd,"Hello so I received my W-2 from a previous employer for the 2017 year but it says I made almost half a thousand dollars through wages in tips. However they accepted my resignation on 1/1/2017 and I did not work another day for them. It's not possible that i had made the money in tips as I had stopped receiving any kind of tips by then, and I was being paid slightly over the federal minimum wage at 7.50 an hour. What should I do?",finance
personalfinance,Company withheld less than noted on W-4; Who is liable for my owed taxes?,"Here is the situation I am in;

Back in may of 2017 I had recently graduated from college and join the company that I currently work at making $55k/year. I had previously interned at the company making $15/h, but failed to withhold the proper amount (of my own fault). The avoid this issue, when I was hired I asked to refile the W-4 and put down that I was single, taking no allowances, and that I wanted the minimum required amount withheld plus an additional $25 to ensure I was paying an adequate amount to the federal government. The HR/Finances department of my company failed to input this properly into their payroll software, making it so only $25 was withheld from every paycheck for federal income tax. Fast forward to February of 2018 when I am filing my taxes; I have only paid about $425 to $450 in federal income tax, and as a result now owe between $2500 and $3500 to the federal government after all my deductions. Seeing how this was my first year filing with my new income in a new tax bracket, I had not caught the error until it was time to file for my return. I approached my employer about the owed amount and they agreed to help me find a solution. Today I was approached by them saying they would loan me the owed amount at 0% interest with a 24 month repayment period.

Here are my questions;

* Is asking questions about my situation against the rules of the sub?

* Who is liable for the owed taxes? According to some verbiage on the 4670 form (Request for relief of payment of certain withholding taxes) it appear the payor (my company) is liable for the owed amount. If I can get references for where it says who (the payor or the payee) is liable that would be appreciated.

* Is this loan legal? Can my company simply loan me money if I sign a contract with them, or are there issues with doing such?

* Should I take the loan or should I talk to a lawyer/accountant? Alternatively, is there another more proper way to settle the owed taxes through the IRS or another agency?

* If I do not take the loan and they pay the full amount of owed taxes, can they garnish my wages for the payment they made?",finance
