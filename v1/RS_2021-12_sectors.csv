economy,High inflation + High interest rates means for home prices,"Economic gurus, 
I have a simple question when interest rates go up and inflation is at 7%+ what will the affect of this be on home prices (increase, decrease, or stay flat)? 

I know in past history high interest rates in the 20% and high inflation in the 70s mean relatively low home prices. If the economy is trending that way will home price indexes have to correct and come down to still generate demand for home buying? My prediction is that they need to correct and come down especially if those homes are in a high property tax burden state. However, I am not sure what I am missing for the scenario where home prices keep going up or stay at these high prices if interest goes up and inflation keeps running high.

CryptoCurrency,"Breaking down 'too good to be true' Defi rates – where's the money from, is it sustainable, and what's the catch?","Money doesn't just grow on ~~trees~~ blockchains, not even *magic internet money*. And yet some defi applications are offering astronomical rates. For this post, I'll break down three common types of protocols and answer the following questions: *where's the money from? Is it sustainable? And what's the catch?*

# Lending and Borrowing

Examples; Aave, Anchor, Geist, Solend

Typical rates: Less than 10% net

**Where's the money from?** Similar to a bank, users deposit money into the protocol, which is then used by borrowers. To borrow money, users have to pay an interest rate and also deposit collateral into the protocol. The main source of revenue is sourced from the interest borrowers have to pay. Some protocols also stake the collateral that users deposit and earn extra income from that.

**Is it sustainable?** Most lending rates aren't actually that high (2% to 20%) since they are usually balanced out by the borrowing rates at an equivalent rate. So the main question here is, *why are people lending/borrowing?*

Beyond earning deposit fees, people lend because the majority of defi requires users to hold assets that they would otherwise not want to hold.  If a user wanted to use defi while holding the assets that they prefer to hold like BTC and ETH, they would deposit their assets as collateral and borrow against it.

People borrow because they can earn a yield higher than the rate they're paying to borrow. You could for example, borrow a stablecoin at a 10% borrow rate and then deposit the borrowed funds into a stablecoin liquidity pool that earns you 20%. You keep the extra 10%.

**What's the catch?** If you're not borrowing, the rates are oftentimes very low and you're likely better off staking an asset than lending or even using Cefi. For example, the largest lending/borrowing dapps are Aave, Compound, or Cream and they only offer **&lt;3%** for ETH whereas ETH Cefi rates are **\~6%**.

If you are borrowing, there's no bank to hold your hand and no bailouts. If your collateral falls below a certain amount, the protocols deems you ineligible to pay off your loan and you get liquidated. This can happen if the market falls and you're not watching your funds. However, there are protocols that now allow for liquidity-free lending/borrow.

# Liquidity Pools (LPs)

Examples: Uniswap, Curve, Serum, Raydium, TraderJoe, SpookySwap, Quickswap

Typical rates: 20% to 40% net (for stablecoins, BTC, and ETH)

**Where's the money from?** When you use decentralize exchanges (dexes), there are liquidity provider fees that typically charge 0.25% of trades. The trading fee is the main source of income for LPs.

**Is it sustainable?** At its current state, most LPs are not sustainable. While the demand for LPs like ETH-DAI is pretty straightforward, demand for LPs with, sometimes obscure, protocol or farm tokens are not as clear. Oftentimes, they rely on circular dependencies, ie *finance for the sake of finance.*

As an example, let's take a look at how degen yield farming typically happens:

1. Protocols offer a 1,000% rate for FARM-DAI LP providers
2. Higher rates mean higher inflation, which means the value of the FARM token tend to decrease
3. But the high rate creates demand for the FARM token as users have to buy FARM to join the LP
4. The high demand pumps the price of the FARM token and offsets the high inflation
5. But as the LP participants grow, the rates decrease
6. Lower rates cause lower demand, which means prices are no longer getting pumped
7. At some point, the farm reaches a stage where both prices and rates are going down
8. And when that happens, degens who are merely looking for quick money, tend to leave
9. More and more people leaving and selling the token causes the price to drop

For most farms, specifically ""degen farms"", prices spike early making the LP seem more profitable than it actually is and then high inflation does its thing to prices slowly but surely fall. Most users enter and leave farms within 3 days to capture the parabolic price action and high rewards.

Protocols can avoid this by providing a legitimate use case for the FARM token beyond just earning a high yield. For pure LP protocols, the use cases are typically governance, which is not very appealing for retail who couldn't care any less about how some protocols are governed.

**What's the catch?** Even if the LP rates are very high, a drastic enough drop in price can offset the gains earned from the reward rate. This is especially true for users who were late and were not able to accumulate the rewards. This is why it's often recommended to look into the price action and avoid making decisions based off of rates alone.

LPs, specifically low liquidity ones, are also especially vulnerable to whales who can often cause spikes–both in the upside, when buying, and the downside, when selling. And large spikes can cause a domino effect of mass selling and whoever is left holding the bag gets rekt.

Beyond this, impermanent loss (IP) is the most obvious catch. Participating in LPs typically requires you to split your assets meaning you may be exposed to undesired price action. But there are several ways to avoid or mitigate IP such as participating in stablecoin LPs or LPs with relatively low volatility, ie BTC or ETH. In addition, there's a lot of work going into new protocols to limit the impact of impermanent loss.

# Reserve Currencies

Examples: Olympus DAO, Wonderland, KlimaDAO

Typical rates: 6,000% to 8,000% (current)

**Where's the money from?** Reserve currencies are brought at a premium that's worth several magnitudes (8-10x) more than the intrinsic value of the token. New tokens are minted at an extremely high rate and then distributed as a reward to stakers. A combination of selling at a high premium and minting at a high rate leads to the high APYs.

But, similar to how LPs work, high distribution –&gt; high inflation –&gt; lower prices. At the same time, high rates –&gt; high participation –&gt; lower rates. The expectation is for both rewards to slowly decrease to a target rate of 1,000%. The goal is to accumulate long-term participants because long time horizons would ensure that staking rewards eventually offsets price action.

**Is it sustainable?** Under the hood, the economics are designed similar to LPs. But LPs are often subject to the notion of *finance for the sake of finance* because the only product is often the high yields offered. Reserve currencies have a secondary revenue generating product: bonds, which are means for protocols to accumulate their own liquidity. So the question to be asked here is *why is there a demand for bonds?*

Bonds allow for protocol-owned liquidity, seeking to address the aforementioned issues that often make LPs unsustainable. Instead of protocols renting liquidity to mercenary users who come and go looking for the highest yields, bonding allows protocols to own their own liquidity and provide a sense of stability. This reduces the need for protocols to constantly offer unsustainably high rates in order to incentivize users to participate in their LP. In addition, it allows protocols to earn their own LP fees, which can give them another source of revenue.

**What's the catch?** LP protocols actually incur some costs in exchange for partnering with the bonding program of a reserve currency protocol. And while reserve protocols offer users with more incentives to become long-term participants, they can still always exit and sell the LPs. This may the case during volatile swings.

On the user end, buying bonds usually isn't worth it primarily because reserve protocols typically requires users to wait a certain interval (3-7 days, etc.) while holding the LPs. This presents some risks because the LPs can drop in value and, thus, offset the discounts. Additionally, if users buy the reserve currency token directly, they can immediately maximize the staking yields, which are also often higher than the discounts.

Overall, the long-term utility of the reserve protocol hinges on the demand for bonds. Most reserve currencies are still very new so only time will tell moving forward. Beyond questioning the bonds, reserve currencies are still vulnerable to bank runs, however these risks are designed to be mitigated with how the protocol works.

personalfinance,How important is secured vs unsecured credit history?,"2 years ago I bought my first new (to me) car. Being young and without much credit history, I was approved for financing but at a pretty high interest rate; after talking with a family member about it, they offered to buy the car outright, and then just have me make monthly payments to them until I have paid it all off to avoid that high interest rate. I took that deal and that has been working out well for me so far.

My parents recently told me that it probably would have been better for my credit to finance the car through an actual institution where it could be part of my credit history. I have student loans and credit cards which I use and pay for responsibly, so I do have credit history and a good score based on those, but those are not ""secured"" credit, and they were saying that unsecured credit history is not as valuable as secured credit.

 This has me thinking, because I do want to have the best credit history possible for when it comes to eventually buying a new car or a house or some other large purchase; is the difference between secured and unsecured credit large enough to warrant me doing something about this? I still owe about $4000 on the car so I could try to get that amount actually financed somewhere it could be on my credit, or possibly sell it (I can likely get 8-9k for it) and actually finance a newer one for myself. Just want to get some opinions on this, thank you all!",finance

personalfinance,Tax benefits of marriage,"My SO and I very recently became engaged after living together for many years.  We were tentatively planning to get married sometime late next year, but I just learned that eligibility for joint filing is determined by marriage status at end of year, which has led us to consider whether it might be advantageous to tie the legal knot within 2021. SO had an anomalous year earnings wise so we'd like to preserve as much of those earnings as possible.

In 2021 I will earn \~$150k and SO will earn \~$330k, all of which was reported as W2 wages.  Just eyeballing the federal tax brackets it looks like filing jointly would net us \~$5k savings due to a portion of SO's earnings that would otherwise be taxed at 35% instead being spread across the 24% and 32% brackets. Where I'm completely oblivious is whether there are any additional tax benefits (or deterrents) to marriage that I have overlooked?   We are not homeowners, do not have any children, and live in California.

Given the short notice it is looking tricky to get a marriage license within 2021 I am leaving the country next week and won't return until 2022. If the savings are substantial I could potentially cancel or reschedule, but would love to hear any thoughts before taking decisive action. Thank you!",finance
personalfinance,401k down payment and mortgage. Oh my,"A bit of background.
I'm 29. Credit score is over 800. Fico and vantage score.
I always use credit cards and pay off same month for cash back. Never missed a payment. Paid off college loans about 6 years ahead of schedule. Paid off new car 1 year ahead of schedule.
I've always been a stickler for killing interest and paying stuff off early and in full.

Looking to get a house. Price range is 180-250k. I live in Arkansas so I get a lot for a little.

I have enough for about 20k down payment.

Now I have about 40k in my 401k and I built that up in about 7 years.

Question 1: is it worth taking SOME of that 401k (20k or so) for extra down payment + cushioning? I have never and would never take out for ANYTHING else.

I'm not doing this to get a bigger house. I'm sticking to my same price range, but I would strictly be doing this to lower interest and monthly payments to pay off the house faster so I can build the 401k right back up.

I'm planning on doing a 15 year mortgage with minimum interest rate due to my credit score. Already spoke to a bank about rates.

Question 2: is it worth doing a 15 year mortgage, or doing a longer one the just adding extra money per month? I know there's an argument for 30-year fixed being good when it comes to inflation.

I'm trying to get rid of as much interest as possible and pay everything off early, as I have with credit cards, college loans. And car loans.

I know the general consensus is DO NOT touch the 401k, but I feel I have a pretty good handle on my past and future finances and planning. With the prestated info, is it still stupid to touch the 401k?",finance

personalfinance,Should I pay off all student debt right now or hold off?,"I graduated college in 2018 with 30k in student debt. I currently work in NYC making 75k a year salary and have very minimal expenses. Although federal student loans are in forbearance until end of January 2022, I’ve been making regular payments. I currently owe a little over $11k and was planning on paying it off in full before the loan would start incurring interest so that would be roughly 9 weekly payments of $1,300.

My alternative would be paying it all off right now as a lump sum. I initially did not want to do this because it would set me back a bit in my savings goals. I recently hit the 100k threshold in savings/checkings/investments combined and wanted to keep that as a new baseline for myself. So if I paid off the $11k now I’d be temporarily below that mark.

I have been slowly paying down all of my student loans (even through COVID) and I plan on being debt free by December 2022. That will boost my account age by 1 year on all accounts. The problem is all 4 of my oldest accounts will drop off when I pay them off, suddenly going from 4yr, 6mo average to 3yr, 7mo and I will only have 2 open accounts instead of 6. I don't have a car payment nor do I own home. 

Everything I read says that I will have a significant drop in score when those accounts get paid off from losing that credit history. I would like to mitigate this as much as possible because I am saving to invest in property within the next 3 years. To secure a good home loan, I want my score to be as high as possible. 

Should I wait to pay off those accounts until after I secure a home loan?  
Should I open new credit accounts now to help raise my limit and start gaining more history?   
Should I just pay off my student loans, take the hit, and possibly risk a higher interest rate on my home loan? 

I am not sure how I should be handling this situation.

CryptoCurrency,NEXO vs. BNB. Not what is sounds like.,"For the short version of this, skip to the second paragraph.  


So after that post a few days ago where somebody asked what it would take to consistently earn $500 a month off of crypto, I realized that I was probably making a good bit more than that from my interest payments on binance (combined with the other services I use, I was probably making over $1k a month on interest). Unfortunately, as an American, I can no longer use binance - not even with a VPN - and, as such, I've been transitioning to other things. One of those things is Nexo. Now while their interest rates are not nearly as good as the non-US binance (nobody else seems to be able to match them either though), I'm kind of limited in my options. But one of the... I guess you could say ""interesting"" things is that Nexo ups their interest payouts based on how much of your portfolio is their NEXO token. Unfortunately, it seems like the interest bump is pretty minor - in order to get a 1% bump, at least 10% of your portfolio - and the only position I have that I would even consider exchanging for that large a quantity of NEXO would be a portion of my BNB holdings. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is this: hypothetically, if you had around 107 BNB, would you exchange... let's say 10 BNB for an equivalent value of NEXO in order to get a 1% interest bump on cryptos held in nexo? I don't really know much about nexo - the platform or the coin - so I'm kind of at a crossroads here and not sure what to do. I don't care about any other coins here, and I'm only really interested in hearing about another platform if it's offering more than 5% interest on a given token. But yeah, I feel like I highlighted all the variables here. I might make like 4 or 5 edits here later though. Tough to say.",cryptocurrency

# Market Insight

The market was primed for a bullish day until Fed Reserve Chair Powell announced the Fed will begin adopting policy changes to battle current inflation problems. The news pulled the struggling stock market down -1% and Bitcoin -1.70% in an hour. 

The tapering could have large implications for stocks and crypto markets as both have benefited from a loose monetary policy. The current policies would have likely continued but inflation is becoming hard to ignore, reported to be at a 30 year high of 6.2% in October. [This report covers the latest inflation numbers](https://medium.com/@TraderGabi/crypto-market-update-and-trading-digest-11-9-27940a93d95c). Don’t expect any drastic tapering measures as the economy is still recovering from the COVID crisis but small policies changes will come. Growing concerns of new variants are contributing to sentiment the economy still has a long way to recover. These reports will continue to monitor the policy changes. Crypto is considered risk-assets because of their high volatility. Risk-assets historically suffer the worst during market selloffs and bear markets that may be triggered by monetary policy adjustments.

# DOT Crowdloans: ASTAR NETWORK, the future of web 3.0 

ASTAR NETWORK

Astar Network is the multi-chain Polkadot DApp Hub that supports Etheruem, WebAssembly, Dapp Staking and Layer-2 solutions. It additionally supports Defi and NFTs. It’s a chain focused on interoperability and primed for the future. Astar is posing to be the next Parachain winner which ends tomorrow. 

The Now

Ethereum is where a majority of smart contract money and developers reside. To siphon some of these resources, interoperable chains must attract and incentivize these developers to build on their network. Being Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible means that Ethereum Developers can build on your chain or fork protocols that already exist. Aster and Moonbeam are the Polkadot chains that will support EVM. EVM compatibility blockchains can thrive in the current crypto environment by using already existing resources such as developers.  

The Future

Polkadot (DOT) aims to facilitate innovation. Astar Network is set to be one of the major vehicles to accelerate this purpose. Being that Astar not only supports EVM and many other chains (the now), it also supports WebAssembly (WASM) a major tool in taking Website development into a new era. Astar will eventually support faster protocols, user friendly lay-outs and evermore interactive webpages. It will further support the innovation which will help lead Polkadot and crypto into web 3.0. This is the future web which will integrate all the utility of blockchain (privacy, data ownership, payments, NFTs, defi etc..) into a user-friendly web. 

Astar has everything going for it as a protocol. Big funding, a lot of development, strong outlook and it will soon have a Parachain. The tokenomics are an engineering mystery but they appear to be self-balancing to reward all the players accordingly. This is one of the top projects on Polkadot and will play a huge role in the future of blockchain and internet integration. For these reasons I am personally investing into Astar Nework. Remember, always DYOR before investing into any project. [Here is a link to ASTAR’s webpage](https://astar.network/).

# NOOBIES: What is Web 3.0? pt.1

Web 3.0 is considered the next step in the internet’s evolution. It wouldn’t be fair to condense to a couple of paragraphs, so instead I’ll unfairly condense it to an outline. To understand web 3.0 you must understand web 1.0.

# Web 1.0

* · The early days of the internet 
* · Users visited static webpages on a server
* · First web browsers  
* · Very little interaction from websites back to users

# Web 2.0

* · Currently in this stage 
* · Also known as participative web or social web
* · Allows collection of user data for customized user experience
* · User-Friendly experience 
* · The emergence of social media, video/image sharing, blogs, podcast and Virtual Communities
* · Allows integration of documents into the web. (Adobe) 
* · Companies profit off user data, allowing the growth of giant conglomerates (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon) 

# Web 3.0 

* · Web 3.0 is more of a set of ideas of what the future web may look like
* · Internet returned to users
* · According to the Web3 foundation, it will integrate blockchain technology to give the users ownership of their data
* · A move towards decentralization 
* · Will allow for the better integration of DAOs.
* · Will integrate user-friendly models for currently complex blockchain interactions 
* · 3D graphics 
* · Artificial intelligence 

Now that we have a basic idea of what web 3.0 may look like, tomorrow we’ll dig a little deeper into the subject and learn about the web3 foundation and Dr. Gavin Wood.

87. Charles dropped a new AMA where he mentioned very briefly that they are actually going to look into read-only UTxOs. If it’s possible to have these types of UTxOs while preserving determinism, it would be a big change since transactions must currently consume inputs.

97. Charles drops a video on the eToro user limitations. It sounds like IOHK knew nothing about this. Interacting with exchanges falls in the Cardano Foundation’s wheelhouse. It’s unclear whether the CF knew anything. He also pointed out it’s very interesting that an old line exchange like Bitstamp has decided to LIST Cardano during this same period. Charles also mentioned that they haven’t seen any regulatory activity on IOHK’s end. eToro is a relatively small source of liquidity for Cardano and there shouldn’t be much of an impact.

retirement,Where to go?,"I am 63 and will have a federal pension (about 18% of my salary) and a wife wo a pension. We have about $1.9M of mostly inherited $ and a fully paid off house worth about $550k, maybe more. We live in a very expensive north nj suburb where I often see Bentleys and Lambourginis. Our taxes are about $10k. I have about 3 years until retirement.We live frugally. Our house has a bunch of outdoor seating areas, but requires a huge amount of maint which I will eventually not be able to do.

In prep for the next stage of life we moved down to northern DE for about 6 months, since my wife got a job down there. We found Northern DE to be lacking in what we consider amenities (decent supermarkets, starbucks. Etc). We lived in a nice spot with a great view, but felt it was not a good place for us. North DE is a place with lots of poor people and crime. We have visited Harrisburg  PA and liked that and I also read that Bethlehem PA is a decent place to retire. 

I am an outdoors guy who works out of my house and spends every free minute when it is not too cold outdoors with my dog. As such I'd like to move to a warmer place to extend my outdoor time. But it's got to be a place with sophisticated amenities and easy to walk to shopping. Our daughter is freshman in a 4 year phd program in NJ and lives near her campus but comes home often on weekends when not studying. She is learning medicinal chemistry and NJ is one of the strongest pharma areas in the country. But honestly she could end up in Cambridge or Silicon Valley or San Diego. Wherever her skills are most in demand. Her boyfriend lives in N NJ, near our house so that might be pretty good motivation for her to stay up here. Btw, we live in a snow zone, where NJ gets moutainous.

Any recommendations on places to consider moving to in prep for retirement.",finance
personalfinance,is it possible for me (f61 widow) to retire by 67?,"*^(Posting on behalf of my mother -)* ***^(Thank you in advance for your help.)***

*^(Based on what I've previously seen in posts asking for this type of help is lack of details, hopefully my mom provided enough of those - if she failed to mention critical information, please tell &amp; I will promptly reply.)*

My husband unexpectedly died at the age of 61 two years ago. Shame on us, we never really took time to understand our own investments or the products we were sold many years ago. The accounts were set up &amp; that was that... This has now left me lost and scurrying to understand all things personal finance and retirement hoping I am not to late.

For the past two years my son has been slowly attempting to help sort out my personal finances and help me understand the various investment accounts I currently have. That being said, I am now trying to make a financial plan to see if it will possible for me to comfortably retire within the next 6 years (Age 67 in late 2027) or get an estimation of when I eventually will be able to.

My son has me using You Need A Budget (YNAB) for the past 8 months to help me understand where my money needs to be and where it's going &amp; plan for any true upcoming expenses. This has been helpful to track all my accounts.

I have no dependents and below is an overview of my finances as of this month (12/2021).

Banking,"Need help finding a financial institution please ( Ive done research, still empty handed and looking for advice)","Helllo Banking!
This is going to be a long one, so buckle in, grab a coffee, an energy drink, your favorite stuff animal... your real animal... your pajamas and dive rght in! 
I come to you not without doing my due dilligence, or so I would think so anyway, Ill spare you the finite details but I'm on my fifth financial institution in the last ten years or so I currently have two of them and I one of them is a very famous online only bank and I've been with them for two years lots of capital( By my personal standards a few hundred K) cycles through my account and I'm I have just like seems like every day I'm having another problem with them but uh I'm looking for a bank or credit union with solid customer service. I totally get that of interest rates and stuff like that a bank or credit union it's not going be where I invest to get returns on my money .I just want a  place they will hold my money and give me quality customer service and i can't seem to find that anywhere.. I don't think I'm high enough income wise too be in Bank of America's inner circle. At the same time I'm not on disability( nothing against those folks at all, I feel for them immesenly just making a point from the bank stand point)... . To give you an idea in the last six months I've had two disputes with my bank one was for a blatantly obvious double charge for a hotel room like super obvious they're right next to each other like is no doubt that it was a double charge just a complete accident. Several calls, private messages, and emails and before I got a provisionary credit which took more than six weeks to grant.. Well, at the same time, I was also charged a$250 smoking fee from my room and I don't smoke this is a echo tell in a decent sized city they run and they run it on a total skeleton crew and they were booked completely out that night this is a big building with nine floors of rooms and I was at the end of the hall and there's about five rooms at the end of the hall at this corner and every room of mine was partying that night simple misake,I understand but for whatever reason the hotel had it out for me I can't wrap my mind around it because this hotel was  always having problems and I always felt like I was being really patient with them anyway I apologize that's off topic and ranty I would just love more than anything to have a bank or credit union that is customer service oriented. All I would want to be happy is if I'm with them for six months a year plus that the one dispute I make every 12 to 24 months for 100 or $200 that I'm given the benefit of the doubt on you know . Instead of treating me like a criminal who's trying to pull one over on the  merchant even though I cycle 8,000-$12,000 through my bank account every month. My bank is  legitimately entertaining the idea( WIth zero history of this) that I'm trying to scam them with this uh debit card dispute the $250 smoking fee ended up taking almost three months to get refunded.. Many other issues but the third and final straw was I deposited a check into my bank this is a business check from a subdivision of a very large insurance company in the United states. I am insurance agent I have been for over 10 years all of my income is from insurance companies uhm although they're mostly direct deposit I deposit this check and my bank puts an 8 day hold on it.... Eight entire days and they cite the reason for it frequent overdrafts. admittedly I've had a few too many overdrafts this year it's been a rough couple years for me but they're usually $510 overdrafts and they're not overdrafted for more than 244-8 hours at most and I pay it right back. And I 100% agree I shouldn't be doing that I have been trying to clean up my act and get better on track but I at the same time do not agree that they should hold $10,000 from me over some petty overdraft charges.. To make matters worse my bank just recently did away with overdraft charges and before they did that I paid plenty of overdraft charges amounting to a lot of money for my bank. I recieved  no credit for that at all they only saw the last month or two since they've implemented this policy and the few overdrafts I've had I mean I could see if my income was $800 a month and I was overdrafting by 400 every month and sticking them with 200 but no they put a eight day hold on this check and to make matters worse after the eight days was up I attempted to spend part of the funds and I go to spend part of the funds and 20 minutes later I am tried accessing my account. nope,im  locked out from my bank, my entire account is frozen locked solid I can't log in for my PC myself my debit card doesn't work I reach out to them and they say there's absolutely nothing I can do about it that I need to call in the morning when that department gets in I did call fraud and they said everything looked perfectly good on their end so I call in again talk to some manager and I she couldn't do anything 'cause it was quite late at night she took a whole bunch of nodes or or said she did gave me a confirmation number and gave me a number to call back at their fraud department in the morning so I do this and at this point I had no idea it was the check that was the problem I mean I figured an 8 day hold on this check was more than enough to uh them to verify it make sure it was good especially since the business that sent me the check had verified that the funds had indeed left their account days prior well they apparently didn't attempt to verify this check at all until after the entire 8 days had passed and I when they did go to verify it they contacted the issuing bank and didn't get somewhere immediately within 5 seconds so they froze all my assets without saying a word to me so that was brand new news to me and super infuriating uhm I gave my contact at the business that I was doing business with and let them know that my bank is trying to verify the funds on this check and they need to speak to someone to verify it so they can freeze all my assets and let me have access to my bank again and dumb it was very nice of them they kindly obliged and the first person I spoke to actually even though I spoke to them for 30 minutes they never even called up the business because I followed up with the business about 45 minutes later and said they hadn't heard a peep even though the lady I was talking to said then as soon as we hang up she was gonna call them to verify this check so I call in again wait on hold for another get put on hold and get connected with the lady and at this time the confirmation that I got from just the previous lady this confirmation did work and from the lady I spoke to about an hour and a half ago and she was able to get up to speed much quicker and I'm we I gave her my contact the businesses information we hung up she called the the person at the business and all she asked her my contact was did you write slammer jacks this uhm check and I was it for the amount of X amount OK and you do intend to honor this check yes and that was it that was all they wanted to know they didn't even wanna talk to accounting or nothing that was the whole reason that they froze all of my assets every dollar of them... This went on for over 48 hours of business days.... So after an 8 day hold and then them without notice without reaching out to me sending an email text nothing 100% freezing my assets top to bottom because they failed to verify the check that they put 3 1/2 seconds of effort into and where would I verify it by talking to a random associate in the business that sent me the check that has nothing to do with accounting and as it is no way high level CEO or CFO position just a random marketing Rep was all they needed to verify it... 
Anyway I have more business that I plan to do with this company ( The company the held the check for 8 days and then decided after 8 days to do the laziest verification whie simultaneiously freezing all my assets with no notification or information/ heads up as to why. If I deposit this check in my current bank and they informed me its probably even larger checks and at my bank has uh informed me that this quote unquote yeah repeated overdraft penalty that I have is going to continue to be a problem until April of next year and even though I just went through everything that I did if I deposit another substantial check it's going to be the same thing except probably worse because this next check is going to be substantially larger than the first one....

Kiev I'm so sick of this, before my current bank I had  Simple bankd which was swalllowed up by BBVA and simple it started out as simple that went to **** as BB VA was taking them over Simple couldn't care less every day that the acquisition got closer and then the same thing happened BBVA. They gave less and less of a shit the closer they got to the PNC acquisition and between that and my current bank I've just had nothing but problems and I just want like the most basic level of  customer service you know. So if/when something goes wrong I just want some legitimate help... And my current bank has 24 hour phone access and 24 hour chat access but really they don't. Every single one of those individuals has absolutely zero power they can't do anything they can't fix anything they can't see anything it's just their following conversation... "" I understand your situation Sir and I'm so sorry you're having to deal with this unfortunately there's nothing I could do to help you from my end as nobody including my superiors are able to assist you since it's after hours. You'll have to call back during the daytime, the represenative had   taken extensive notes ( or so they say) and I'm sorry but there's nothing I can do to help at this point I I definitely understand your situation Sir I know how important it is believe me it's it's very tough being in that situation and I'm so sorry but then fortunately there's nothing that I can do""- this conversataion rinse and repeat for eternity...
I'm so sorry for the long ranty post... 
TO clarify: I have no history of depositing bad checks, I'm at almost 24 month with my current bank, and have cycled around 240k throughmy checking account in the last 24 months... 

ANd Simple / BBVA was much worse than my current bank... I'm hesitant to bother with PNC ( the company that just aquired BBVA, and BBVA aquired simple).. I've called PNC just a couple of times and it's always just astronomical wait times like 20 to 50 minutes and I get some international customer service representative who is less than helpful and oftentimes just argumentative like insulting my intelligence and I I like don't say that lightly like I literally called them because I I forgot my pin, it been a real stressful weekend This was not my day and I got locked out from trying my pin to me lot too many times and the gentleman on the phone uhm decided it was a good opportunity to lecture me on how he couldn't fathom how I could be so like out of touch with reality how it could be so like clueless as to forget my pin at the same time while not resetting my pin or helping me reset my pin it was glorious..

I can imagine this post sounds like I'm in unpeasable curmudgeon that's  just gonna be unhappy no matter where I go and I promise you that's not the case not concerned about interest rates I'm not concerned about like any of that stuff I just want I just want some halfway decent customer service and the maybe maybe once a year on average that I do have a minor dispute did they give me the benefit of the doubt at least somewhat especially if I can prove you know due diligence on my end that like I've worked like exhausted all efforts with the merchant to resolve this before contacting them you know just basic banking customer service I'd really appreciate I'm so unhappy with my current banks...

I have a $30,000 check coming from a a second  deal I'm doing with that same business that my current bank  held onto the $10,000 check for 8 days and on the 9th day attempted the most lack luster, lazy check verification without doing the slightest out reach and freezing all my assets old= that I posited a few weeks back and I I'd rather cash that at Walmart and take 3% off then deposited into my bank and have them sit on it for three centuries only to call the local gas station to try to verify it and come up short so they freeze my assets for an eternity I'm just not OK with that at all

To give you an idea of the few needs I have out of a bank: their online banking system used to be somewhat up to date you know I would appreciate being able to send and receive wire transfers see my debits and credits be able to turn my debit card on and off uhm and good customer service that's all Id ask for and be perfectly happy with. Oh one other minor thing, I  live in the sticks and nothing is up here it would be nice to have even just a small benefit to reimburse me for ATM fees I can honestly live without this but even if it was like 10 bucks a month to reimburse me for ATM fees that would mean a lot to me and I'd super appreciate that benefit but it's certainly not a requirement I'd give that up for quality customer service in a second

Thank you so much for taking the time out of your busy schedules to read my long ranty post...  Here's some information you may find usefull

I reside in WA state USA. I am open to online or far away banks. Reminder- $200,000 roughly moves through that account a year, I seldom bother customer service unless its a big deal 

If any of you could point me in the direction of an alternative financial institution, I would be so greatful!
PS: the first response to posts similar to mine is  ""find a local credit union"" try that the biggest local credit union here in my county I was with for over 10 years and I had to part way with them eventually just became they were so untolerable for me because they they had way too many clients and not enough properly trained staff to to handle it.  I've spoke to several friends/ family that did bank or even current;y still do bank with this CU and its not just me with this opinion lots have left this credit union. I even have close frieneds they make into the low six figures have perfect credit and the CU could just scoff at them when they try to get any financing like even just a few $1000 loan that week he wants or the credit union wants to slap them with like 15 to 20% interest it's absurd.. This is a Unionized Blue Collar worker making 100-175k a year, with his own home... and This credit Union has a melt down like they're asking for a 30% interest cash advance on their credit card to go to the casino...

If you made it this far, thank you so much for your time. I would like any recommendations. guidance, critism even... I am an independent Insurance Agent by career have been for over a decade. 

again thank you all SOOO much! 
PS: I have heavily persued the company im doing business with to just send me a wire transfer instead of a paper check... they're OLD school stuck in the 1990s... and just wont do it, so thats out...

Where would you guys recommend for atleast semi decent customer service... and wont have a melt down if I try to deposit a business check from a company that directly works in my field of business?

gaming,As someone who is fed up with BF2042. Going to BFV is an amazing and refreshing experience.,"My last Battlefield experience was at the height of Battlefield 1. I loved Battlefield 1 and its passion to be a WW1 shooter. The guns were great, the maps were fantastic and it seemed to work fairly well as a setting in a Battlefield game. 

I decided to hold off initially on what I had thought was just a clone of Battlefield 1, Battlefield V.  To my understanding Battlefield V was a mediocre game with issues (not as bad as 2042) and not much else going for it besides the same old look but with some new polish and a different but familiar war. This is where I was wrong. 

After trying my best to enjoy 2042 I had concluded that 2042 was fun until it wasn't. I had missed the feel of Battlefield 4 and eagerly awaited the return to a modern/semi-futuristic world setting. New weapons, vehicles, and maps to explode and explore. But something felt off. It felt like I was put in a world where things didn't belong and which had no meaning. There wasn't any way to get my bearings, nothing felt familiar and nothing made sense. 

If you look past the misgivings of all of the bugs and issues which hopefully will be fixed by early next year. You end up with a washed-up experience of a Battlefield game. There is no sake of adventure or feeling of being with a team of players pushing into an objective it just instead becomes a game with too little to do and too much of everything around it. Too many vehicles, too many pointless buildings, too many players and way too much space. 

This is when I started to ask questions about Battlefield V, the game I had passed on. I wondered what that game was like, surely EA and Dice didn't lose their way back then and another thought was how did the previous Battlefield game look and feel? Where and how did they go wrong with 2042? So, to quench my thirst for knowledge I bought Battlefield V and I gave it my undivided attention. I had after many hours discovered that I loved it! It could have been simply the feeling of not having something immediately going wrong with matchmaking, EA's servers or a countless number of other things. The greatest thing was that it was just simply finished. That's it! I pretty much couldn't care less if it was half the size of 2042 and even if it had only 1 map it still would have been leagues better than 2042 in so many ways! 

The immediate feeling I got from playing Battlefield V was that I knew what was going on. I had a setting that made sense, I knew who was fighting who and WHY they were doing what they were doing. I knew that tanks didn't move at over 100 mph, that helicopters weren't going to stun lock me to death and that hovercraft weren't soaring through the skies like fighter planes. I felt grounded in an experience.

I took a good look and noticed that the detail in the maps was amazing. There was no vastly large area with nothing but sand, snow or grass between me and the opposition. The fields were filled with gold wheat, bales of hay, rock formations, old tanks and barricades. It felt surreal. It felt like I was there and that I was crawling under that stone bridge through the mud and peaking over those sandbags checking to see where the enemy tank went and to see if it was about to roll up on my squad and rain fire. The buildings made sense, they weren't randomly placed without anything else in them but 4 walls and a fan. One was a grain silo with a moving water wheel, the others were large buildings of government, important landmarks and subway stations. It just made sense. The breathtaking world settings weren't the only thing that hooked me. It was the sheer number of things removed in 2042 that made the game so much better in Battlefield V. To save you some time I won't go into the major quality of life change differences between the games because that list is dumbfounding. So I will just say that it's a lot and it's horrifying in the least.

Instead, all I ask is that if you haven't yet tried Battlefield V and you've had it for now with 2042 is that you give it a try. I would say that even if you have played it maybe you'll be more forgiving and appreciative and truly understand what is missing from 2042 by taking the step back to an older game and realizing what a marvel Battlefield V turned out to be.

But the most important thing is that it doesn't matter what game you play as long as you're having fun. I'm just simply proving an alternative solution to those of us who maybe need a break from 2042 until a few more updates have been released.

For now, stay happy and blessed this Holiday season!

TL;DR: Play what you enjoy. Right now that's BFV over 2042 for me.",technology

Banks make a tonne of money off of our money and custom. It’s well known that banks manipulate the money supply and interest rates. They have the ability to increase and decrease the money supply, resulting in major economic changes.  They make money from interest loans, account usage, applications, ATM charges, credit card charges, deposits, withdrawals (depending on which account you have). 

A central bank’s actions also have an effect on imports, exports, and overseas investment &amp; Central banks use a network of banks to distribute money in an economic system . The problem with the structure described above is that it places far too much trust and responsibility on the decisions of a central agency.

Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin solves a few issues. No double spending, it’s algorithmic construct is decentralised, streamlined process to produce and distribute the currency.

On top of that, let’s say if you had £1,000 and put it into USDC — which is a stable coin - that would be $1,331.76. You can stake that for 9.35% APR which could be $10.28 (£7.72) estimated monthly earning &amp; $130.56 yearly. The monthly amount is a 77100% increase from the £0.01 my bank paid which they calculated on around £2,000


Or, coins like Gala are up 216K%, a £100 investment into would be £216,426.9 — but obviously statements like that are easy to say in hindsight. But what I’m saying is, crypto is a great investment if you do your due diligence. 

We need to make our money work for us just like banks do, and cryptocurrency enables us to do so. Don’t spend money of big brands buy their stock. Don’t buy big chains (jewellery), buy physical gold/silver. Don’t rely on banks, gain control of your finances and do crypto 📈❤️

I am in a bit of a situation: interest rates are negative (government bonds at at -0.2% on the 10years, cash is at -0.75%). For completeness, inflation is very low.

How would you protect you savings? I already have a significant portion invested in passive ETFs (SCHB, SCHF, some REET) and I am happy with that. Quite a significant amount in company unvested stocks (vesting over three years). Another investment in Fundsmith.

I don't really like to invest even more in the same ETFs (too many eggs in the same basket) but at the same time the cash sitting there is not just a missed opportunity anymore, it's literally costing money. 

Gold? Some bonds? Just pay the rate and accept the loss (at the end it's the same as inflation, it's just a bit more apparent).

investing,Are we in a bubble? - Comparing the current stock market rally to the dot-com bubble!,"Lately, there has been growing chatter around whether the current rally that we are experiencing over the past one and half years is mainly driven by speculation and if we are in one of the largest investment bubbles ever.

Even professional investors whom I consider level-headed and not indulging in sensationalization are calling the current rally unsustainable.

&gt;This Will Not Last - [Nick Maggiulli](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/this-will-not-last/)

Adding to all of this, we can see that the [Shiller PE Ratio is now climbing close to the 2000 dot-com bubble level.](https://preview.redd.it/095t1dtniq281.png?width=899&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7db181ad101f44183162eae205bcdb5fb857e01f)

While it’s easy to say that it’s all a bubble and we should be liquidating all our investments based on the current trend, I feel that we might be missing the other side of the story. The 2020s are wildly different times compared to the 2000s and we should not be looking at both scenarios through the same lens. There is an immense difference in the available capital, interest rates, and ability of the retail crowd to invest in stocks now compared to 20 years back \[1\].

So what I wanted to analyze is: **Should we really be worried about the current trends or is this the ‘new normal’ given the drastically different situation we find ourselves in?** Finally, this would give us an insight into how to manage our current portfolio and future investments! \[2\]

**The Warning Signs**

Let’s first look at the dive into the various concerning trends that we are observing in the current market. (Spoiler alert — there are a lot of them!)

**PE /Shiller PE (CAPE)**

The price to earnings ratio has been historically used to understand if the market/company is overvalued when compared to historical trends. Shiller PE is adjusted for the cyclical nature of earnings when compared to normal PE.

The current concern is that as of Nov’21, the Shiller PE for the S&amp;P 500 crossed 40, which is **the highest reading in the last two decades**. The last time the Shiller PE crossed 40 was during the 2000 dot com bubble (The value reached only a max of 27 before the 2007 financial crisis).

The red flag here is that those who invested when the CAPE was above 40 last time (1999-’00) had to wait another 7 years to break even for a brief period of time (just before the 2007 housing market crash) and then wait another 5 more years before the market consistently settled above their buy-in price.

**Money Supply Growth (Aka ‘Money printer go brrr’)**

[1/5th of all U.S Currency in circulation was printed in 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/fzax1ecriq281.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b59bc4f2bfde765ffab5deb3376ddae53b5fe4c3) While it might be argued that there are structural reasons why this was required, there is no denying that only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. One can argue that even the stimulus has been increasingly trapped within the financial markets and fueled speculation.

**Increasing use of leverage**

There are two ways of using leverage while investing. The first method is borrowing money to invest in the markets and the other is using options. Both of these have seen a dramatic rise in the past 2 years.

[This survey conducted by Magnifymoney](https://www.magnifymoney.com/blog/news/debt-to-invest-survey/) for almost 1,000 investors shows staggering results. 80% of Gen Z and 60% of Millennial investors have borrowed money to invest in the market. More than 50% of the surveyed population borrowed more than $5k or more for investing. While leverage works great in a bull market, it can destroy your portfolio during downturns. \[3\]

[Research by Goldman Sachs](https://preview.redd.it/kkx1cfjtiq281.png?width=854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8af5f2398c5273fc770ba1f6a265ad3ffcf1a7b) shows an even more concerning trend. Retail brokers alone are now trading more options than ***the entire market used to do in 2019***. While this can be attributed to the democratization of complicated investment instruments by platforms such as Robinhood, Fidelity, E-Trade, etc., it’s highly unlikely that all the retail traders who are using options completely understand the instrument and the inherent risks while using it.

**Rise of new issues and speculative assets**

More than $600 Billion have been raised by IPO’s this year. This is the highest number of deals in the last decade or so and has even left the 2007 record in the dust. The cherry on top was [the Rivian IPO](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/rivian-ipo) where the company is now valued at more than $100 Billion with zero revenue and less than $50 Million in pre-order deposits.

SPACs \[4\] also witnessed incredible growth with the number of SPACs jumping from a mere 59 in 2019 to 248 in 2020 and then a massive 559 in 2021 (As of Nov ’21). The staggering rise in IPOs and SPACs showcases the availability of cheap capital and investors’ desire to hold assets. This is very similar to the dot-com bubble where there was a [large spike in IPO’s just before the crash.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/270290/number-of-ipos-in-the-us-since-1999/)

This is without even getting into the speculative world of Crypto where [NFTs are being sold](https://www.cnet.com/news/this-cryptopunk-nft-just-sold-for-530-million-kind-of/#:~:text=CryptoPunk%20%239998%2C%20part%20of%20a,for%20%24530%20million%20on%20Thursday.&amp;text=It's%20the%20most%20expensive%20NFT,ethereum%20%2D%2D%20about%20%24532%20million.) for more than half a billion dollars, a coin that started as a literal joke has a market cap of $27 Billion and there are now more ICOs than anyone can keep track of!

**Investor expectations**

More than the P/E ratio, **i**[nvestor expectations seem to be the highest in recent history.](https://preview.redd.it/qnfuyiqwiq281.png?width=1125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb279b8dae3bd9803be4b8f7bf26c1984f7a87b8) The price-to-sales ratio shows how much the market values every dollar of the company's sales. As we can see on the chart below, more than double the companies are trading above 10x their sales when compared to the 2000 dot com bubble.

If you consider a [four-year time period](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/this-will-not-last/), stocks that had a very high P/S ratio have underperformed those having low P/S ratio since most companies don’t grow as per expectations.

Now that’s a lot of bad news for anyone to digest! But,

**Are we certain it’s a bubble?**

There are multiple factors that can be attributed to the current rally. Just because we are in an impressive rally, it does not mean the only eventual outcome is a bubble and subsequent crash. Let’s look at the key factors that are driving up the stock prices over the last few years.

**Low-interest rates**

This is one of the key aspects that many miss while comparing the current rally to the 2000s dot-com bubble. Between 1997 and 2000, the fed rate varied from 5 - 6% compared to the [historically low 0.25% that we have now](https://preview.redd.it/x1408niziq281.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee123520c9b2ea0d2f9b10b59d6b2fd181fac446). This means that the capital available now is much cheaper (to prop up the economy after Covid) than it ever was. This is bound to have a positive impact on the stock market with investors moving their money from bonds and other lower returning funds to the stock market in search of better returns.

**New Investors**

It’s no secret that we all hate Robinhood. [But the data they put out during their IPO filing](https://preview.redd.it/lpojhko0jq281.png?width=935&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ede81940da2355edc282ba1feca54bad415c4b0) shows that there has been a staggering growth in new investors/traders coming to the market. All of these new investors would bring fresh capital into the market triggering another bull run which we are experiencing now.

**401(k) and Index funds**

As I have highlighted in [one of my previous article](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/piyri4/the_index_fund_bubble_should_you_be_worried/)s, the amount of inflow US index funds receive is massive (more than $50 Billion fund inflow is expected to occur to just the Vanguard 500 index fund this year) and index funds are expected to make up [more than 50% of the fund market](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/the-autopilot-economy/618497/). According to [this report](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/19/401k-balances-hit-a-new-all-time-high-fidelity-says-.html) from Fidelity, the average 401(k) account now has a balance of $129K and 12% of workers increased their contribution.

The key point being: all this new capital that is being allocated into the index funds is expected to cause a rise in the overall valuation of the stock market \[5\].

**What’s the implication?**

As long as the above factors remain as is (Fed maintaining its rate and a steady supply of fresh capital) we might see the party go on much longer than expected.

**Conclusion**

The market of 2021 is significantly different when compared to the 2000s. As we can see there are more investors, cheaper capital, and even more passive funds that are flowing into the market than ever before. So I feel that looking at the current market and comparing it directly to the dot-com bubble is a tad wrong.

But, that’s not to say that all is well. Almost all the fundamental indicators are flashing red and even the experts are predicting a significant drawdown in the near future.

The expected annual return by investors [above inflation is a whopping 17.5%](https://preview.redd.it/b4vspq13jq281.png?width=928&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa81e2478da9eb80ba1b001e0a2c6b29d9313b97)(which is 161% more than what is realistic) — This is a testament to the euphoria we are seeing in the market now where a yearly double-digit return is the norm.

Even if we are in a dot-com bubble-like scenario, [this thread from Corry Wang](https://twitter.com/corry_wang/status/1345192541545766915) perfectly summarizes the issues with making money calling a bubble in the middle of the bubble.

Basically, even though everyone knew it was a bubble back in 2000 (Investment firms did entire conferences comparing the internet companies to Tulip mania as early as ‘98), **making money using that information was hard!** There were a few investors such as Mark Cuban and John Templeton who successfully shorted the stocks at the peak of the bubble and made a killing when the market crashed, but there were many others who lost their entire investment shorting an overvalued market which went on for longer than anyone could have expected.

It makes perfect sense to be apprehensive about investing in the current market. But, pundits have been calling a [crash from as far back as 2017](https://fortune.com/2017/08/10/stock-market-crash-today-down-bubble-2017/). Right now based on fundamentals, the chances do look far higher. It does make sense to not make significant one-time investments in the market now. But, changing your portfolio significantly based on recent trends might not be the best long-term strategy!

stocks,Are we in a bubble? - Comparing the current stock market rally to the dot-com bubble!,"Lately, there has been growing chatter around whether the current rally that we are experiencing over the past one and half years is mainly driven by speculation and if we are in one of the largest investment bubbles ever.

&gt;Why the Stock Market is in a bubble? - [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-bubble-when-will-it-pop-powell-fed-stifel-2021-11)Investors are overestimating earnings growth far more than they did during the dot-com bubble - [Bank of America](https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-crash-bank-of-america-warning-sign-shows-drop-2021-11)

Even professional investors whom I consider level-headed and not indulging in sensationalization are calling the current rally unsustainable.

&gt;This Will Not Last - [Nick Maggiulli](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/this-will-not-last/)

Adding to all of this, we can see that the [Shiller PE Ratio is now climbing close to the 2000 dot-com bubble level.](https://preview.redd.it/095t1dtniq281.png?width=899&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7db181ad101f44183162eae205bcdb5fb857e01f)

While it’s easy to say that it’s all a bubble and we should be liquidating all our investments based on the current trend, I feel that we might be missing the other side of the story. The 2020s are wildly different times compared to the 2000s and we should not be looking at both scenarios through the same lens. There is an immense difference in the available capital, interest rates, and ability of the retail crowd to invest in stocks now compared to 20 years back \[1\].

So what I wanted to analyze is: **Should we really be worried about the current trends or is this the ‘new normal’ given the drastically different situation we find ourselves in?** Finally, this would give us an insight into how to manage our current portfolio and future investments! \[2\]

**The Warning Signs**

Let’s first look at the dive into the various concerning trends that we are observing in the current market. (Spoiler alert — there are a lot of them!)

**PE /Shiller PE (CAPE)**

The price to earnings ratio has been historically used to understand if the market/company is overvalued when compared to historical trends. Shiller PE is adjusted for the cyclical nature of earnings when compared to normal PE.

The current concern is that as of Nov’21, the Shiller PE for the S&amp;P 500 crossed 40, which is **the highest reading in the last two decades**. The last time the Shiller PE crossed 40 was during the 2000 dot com bubble (The value reached only a max of 27 before the 2007 financial crisis).

The red flag here is that those who invested when the CAPE was above 40 last time (1999-’00) had to wait another 7 years to break even for a brief period of time (just before the 2007 housing market crash) and then wait another 5 more years before the market consistently settled above their buy-in price.

**Money Supply Growth (Aka ‘Money printer go brrr’)**

[1/5th of all U.S Currency in circulation was printed in 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/fzax1ecriq281.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b59bc4f2bfde765ffab5deb3376ddae53b5fe4c3) While it might be argued that there are structural reasons why this was required, there is no denying that only a small portion went into the actual paychecks that people received and a vast majority was used for keeping companies afloat. One can argue that even the stimulus has been increasingly trapped within the financial markets and fueled speculation.

**Increasing use of leverage**

There are two ways of using leverage while investing. The first method is borrowing money to invest in the markets and the other is using options. Both of these have seen a dramatic rise in the past 2 years.

[This survey conducted by Magnifymoney](https://www.magnifymoney.com/blog/news/debt-to-invest-survey/) for almost 1,000 investors shows staggering results. 80% of Gen Z and 60% of Millennial investors have borrowed money to invest in the market. More than 50% of the surveyed population borrowed more than $5k or more for investing. While leverage works great in a bull market, it can destroy your portfolio during downturns. \[3\]

[Research by Goldman Sachs](https://preview.redd.it/kkx1cfjtiq281.png?width=854&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8af5f2398c5273fc770ba1f6a265ad3ffcf1a7b) shows an even more concerning trend. Retail brokers alone are now trading more options than ***the entire market used to do in 2019***. While this can be attributed to the democratization of complicated investment instruments by platforms such as Robinhood, Fidelity, E-Trade, etc., it’s highly unlikely that all the retail traders who are using options completely understand the instrument and the inherent risks while using it.

**Rise of new issues and speculative assets**

More than $600 Billion have been raised by IPO’s this year. This is the highest number of deals in the last decade or so and has even left the 2007 record in the dust. The cherry on top was [the Rivian IPO](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/rivian-ipo) where the company is now valued at more than $100 Billion with zero revenue and less than $50 Million in pre-order deposits.

SPACs \[4\] also witnessed incredible growth with the number of SPACs jumping from a mere 59 in 2019 to 248 in 2020 and then a massive 559 in 2021 (As of Nov ’21). The staggering rise in IPOs and SPACs showcases the availability of cheap capital and investors’ desire to hold assets. This is very similar to the dot-com bubble where there was a [large spike in IPO’s just before the crash.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/270290/number-of-ipos-in-the-us-since-1999/)

This is without even getting into the speculative world of Crypto where [NFTs are being sold](https://www.cnet.com/news/this-cryptopunk-nft-just-sold-for-530-million-kind-of/#:~:text=CryptoPunk%20%239998%2C%20part%20of%20a,for%20%24530%20million%20on%20Thursday.&amp;text=It's%20the%20most%20expensive%20NFT,ethereum%20%2D%2D%20about%20%24532%20million.) for more than half a billion dollars, a coin that started as a literal joke has a market cap of $27 Billion and there are now more ICOs than anyone can keep track of!

**Investor expectations**

More than the P/E ratio, **i**[nvestor expectations seem to be the highest in recent history.](https://preview.redd.it/qnfuyiqwiq281.png?width=1125&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fb279b8dae3bd9803be4b8f7bf26c1984f7a87b8) The price-to-sales ratio shows how much the market values every dollar of the company's sales. As we can see on the chart below, more than double the companies are trading above 10x their sales when compared to the 2000 dot com bubble.

If you consider a [four-year time period](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/this-will-not-last/), stocks that had a very high P/S ratio have underperformed those having low P/S ratio since most companies don’t grow as per expectations.

Now that’s a lot of bad news for anyone to digest! But,

**Are we certain it’s a bubble?**

There are multiple factors that can be attributed to the current rally. Just because we are in an impressive rally, it does not mean the only eventual outcome is a bubble and subsequent crash. Let’s look at the key factors that are driving up the stock prices over the last few years.

**Low-interest rates**

This is one of the key aspects that many miss while comparing the current rally to the 2000s dot-com bubble. Between 1997 and 2000, the fed rate varied from 5 - 6% compared to the [historically low 0.25% that we have now](https://preview.redd.it/x1408niziq281.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee123520c9b2ea0d2f9b10b59d6b2fd181fac446). This means that the capital available now is much cheaper (to prop up the economy after Covid) than it ever was. This is bound to have a positive impact on the stock market with investors moving their money from bonds and other lower returning funds to the stock market in search of better returns.

**New Investors**

It’s no secret that we all hate Robinhood. [But the data they put out during their IPO filing](https://preview.redd.it/lpojhko0jq281.png?width=935&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ede81940da2355edc282ba1feca54bad415c4b0) shows that there has been a staggering growth in new investors/traders coming to the market. All of these new investors would bring fresh capital into the market triggering another bull run which we are experiencing now.

**401(k) and Index funds**

As I have highlighted in [one of my previous article](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/piyri4/the_index_fund_bubble_should_you_be_worried/)s, the amount of inflow US index funds receive is massive (more than $50 Billion fund inflow is expected to occur to just the Vanguard 500 index fund this year) and index funds are expected to make up [more than 50% of the fund market](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/the-autopilot-economy/618497/). According to [this report](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/19/401k-balances-hit-a-new-all-time-high-fidelity-says-.html) from Fidelity, the average 401(k) account now has a balance of $129K and 12% of workers increased their contribution.

The key point being: all this new capital that is being allocated into the index funds is expected to cause a rise in the overall valuation of the stock market \[5\].

# [Stock futures jump ahead of first trading day of December after omicron fears dent markets](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/30/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were higher in early trading Wednesday, as companies that benefit from the economic reopening gained along with big energy and pharma.
*****
&gt; Dow futures rose 305 points. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 1.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1.4%.
*****
&gt; The gains follow a Tuesday sell-off on Wall Street over fears about the new omicron Covid variant and the Federal Reserve mulling a quicker-than-planned exit from its easy monetary policy.
*****
&gt; Treasury yields also moved notably higher, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note most recently back near 1.5% after falling 8 basis points Tuesday to 1.45% on fears that the pandemic would stifle economic growth.
*****
&gt; Merck led gainers on the S&amp;P 500, rising 4% in premarket trading a day after its Covid treatment pill received approval from the Food and Drug Administration, though by a narrow 13-10 margin.
*****
&gt; Energy shares also posted sharp gains, with Occidental Petroleum up 3.4% as West Texas Intermediate prices climbed more than 4% to nearly $69 a barrel.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere in early trading, stocks associated with the economic reopening also posted strong gains. Carnival was up 2.9%, Wynn Resorts gained 2.6% and Hilton Worldwide saw a 2.8% gain.
*****
&gt; The moves came a day after the Dow lost more than 650 points, the S&amp;P 500 shed 1.9% and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite dipped 1.6%. The small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 tumbled 1.9% as cyclical names dragged on the markets.
*****
&gt; “Our sense is that the recent selloff is a longer-term buying opportunity. However, investors that want to avoid a potential big drawdown (while giving up some potential upside) may want to wait until the [Fed’s] Dec. 15 meeting,” Wolfe Research strategist Chris Senyek said in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell jolted markets after he said the central bank is expected to discuss speeding up the taper of its minimum $120 billion a month bond-buying program. Despite the potential disruption of omicron, the Fed chief said he thinks reducing the pace of monthly bond buys can move quicker than the $15 billion-a-month schedule announced earlier this month.
*****
&gt; “At this point, the economy is very strong and inflationary pressures are higher, and it is therefore appropriate in my view to consider wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases ... perhaps a few months sooner,” Powell said. “I expect that we will discuss that at our upcoming meeting.”
*****
&gt; Goldman Sachs said it projects the Fed will double the pace to $30 billion a month and enact its first rate hike of the pandemic era in June.
*****
&gt; The major averages have seen several volatile sessions, starting last Friday when the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced its worst day since October 2020. Stocks rebounded on Monday, only to turn downward again on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Wednesday marks the first trading day of the final month of 2021.
*****
&gt; Expediting the removal of the Fed’s easy policies tells investors that the central bank is focusing on addressing inflation, instead of new threats from the pandemic.
*****
&gt; “Markets appear to be having trouble digesting the combo of elevated uncertainty around the impact of the Omicron variant and a hawkish Fed pivot in the context of persistently elevated inflation,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.
*****
&gt; The new Covid variant, first detected in South Africa, has now been identified in more than a dozen countries, causing many to restrict travel. Denting sentiment on Tuesday, the Moderna CEO told the Financial Times that he expects existing vaccines to be less effective against the new variant.
*****
&gt; Stocks wrapped up a volatile month of trading on Tuesday. The Dow lost 3.7% for its second month of losses in three. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.25% in November. The Russell 2000 shed 4.3% in November, its worst month since March 2020.
*****
&gt; Still, the major averages are up solidly for the year. The Dow is up 12.7% and the S&amp;P 500 is up 21.6% in 2021. The Nasdaq Composite is up an impressive 20.6% this year.
*****
&gt; ADP’s private payroll data for November showed 534,000 jobs added in November, above expectations of 506,000
*****
&gt; On Wednesday, investors will be evaluating updates on the omicron variant, as well as some key economic reports. November’s Manufacturing PMI, ISM Manufacturing print and October’s construction spending are set to release on Wednesday morning.

CryptoCurrency,I hold XRP out of respect because they're taking it for the team...,"XRP Ripple is slugging it out in court, they could have settled to the EVIL EMPIRE (THE USA) but they didn't. They held their ground because the FEDs were being bullies and really haven't established a firm definition on crypto and seemed to use definitions on a whim. 

Ripple is a real-time macro settlement system, currency exchange and remittance network created by Ripple Labs Inc., a US-based technology company. Released in 2012, Ripple is built upon a distributed open source protocol, and supports tokens representing fiat currency, cryptocurrency, commodities, or other units of value such as frequent flier miles or mobile minutes. Ripple purports to enable ""secure, instantly and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks."" The ledger employs the native cryptocurrency known as XRP.

In December 2020, Ripple Labs and two of its executives were sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for selling XRP tokens, which the SEC classified as unregistered securities.

However, it was evident in the trial that XRP told Ripple earlier (court document revealed) that they weren't a security.

I am baffled why the judge has not thrown out this case. However, there are rumours that XRP might settle.

The devil is in the details. XRP Ripple has signaled that they wil be hiring several hundreds of people. A JP Morgan report sent to investors earlier this month put XRP and the SEC v. Ripple lawsuit under the spotlight and concluded that a win would put the crypto asset on the road to mainstream adoption. More on that, here.

Coinbase, which was mentioned as a key player for XRP adoption, announced it will participate in the forum and will be represented by CEO Brian Armstrong and Lead Independent Director Fred Wilson. 

Ripple has successfully accelerated its global expansion this year despite fears that the lawsuit could cause hesitancy among institutional partners. Now it seems that the blockchain firm will be hiring a few hundreds in 2022 as they prepare the launch of the upcoming Liquidity Hub.

On top of that, the XRP Ledger has just had a “game-changer” upgrade that took a year to come into effect and it’s likely to strengthen its appeal. Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz said it was “awesome news”.

So, in conclusion, where RIPPLE goes so goes the industry as they say.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Bought our first home a year ago. Mortgage is $650/mo and we’ve been giving an extra $200. Family says to just pay the $650 and put the $200 in a savings for when we refinance.,"So my husband (29) and I (29) purchased our first home last year! We were excited as it is a new build and getting to pick the lot and seeing our house go from nothing to our home was fun! So we got a 30-year loan and gave a down payment and basically, our mortgage is $648 a month but we pay an extra $200 every month because we think this will lower our loan amount. I told my mom and she said that was fine but as someone who owns multiple homes, she told me to just give the $648 a month and out the extra $200 in a savings for when we refinance. I spoke to one of my uncles (also a multiple homeowner) and he told me the same thing. I wanted to ask you guys your thoughts on this! Should we keep giving the extra money or move that to a savings?

CryptoCurrency,"ETH is bad, Part 2: Manipulation Boogaloo","This is the follow up to my previous [post](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qw2e32/eth_is_bad_and_i_am_tired_of_pretending_its_not/) about how ETH is a bad crypto currency controlled by a very few privileged individuals. Since the last post caught so much traction and a lot of people actually learned new things on that post, I wanted to delve deeper on the main issues, centralization and trust. I ended up finding things that were even new to me and made me be even more sure of what is happening.

Having to trust people has no place in crypto. This space has slowly been encroached on by investors and speculators but I like to think some still remember the fundamentals.

And if you do have to trust people, decentralization is paramount.

The Ethereum blockchain is neither decentralized, nor trustworthy.

# Why you can’t trust the protocol:

The first thing we need to analyse here is the protocol itself. For a successful protocol to exist, the rules need to be set from the beginning and changes in rules need a governance system that lets the network, generally nodes, voice their opinion on any of said changes. This means that unless there is agreement (and you can argue to if this should be on or off chain), no rules can be changed.

With that in mind, surprise changes should be impossible right? There should be no way that a dev could push a change that would create a hard fork without any input from the community.

Well, with ETH, that happened in 2020. Infura (remember that name), the biggest ETH service provider, had an outage that knocked out most of exchanges APIs.

To reiterate: a dev pushed a changed to the protocol, without consent, by “mistake”, that was enough to change the rules so that no one else could play. This is not about the change itself. This is about the fact that the power to do this IS THERE.

This is possible due to the incredible centralization that Infura provides. They host nodes for clients, they host most of the nodes on ETH as a whole.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/au81a2g09y281.jpg?width=1135&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e26949b7a442900f0feb7ab723441d47ec8a12bd

The nodes provide the continuity of a chain. If you control the nodes, you control the network. The users are not in control.

The conclusion to this is very simple, you can’t trust the protocol because it can be changed on you in an instant.

# You can’t trust the Leaders:

So, if you can’t trust the protocol, you need to be able to trust the people in charge of it.

The biggest players here are, without a doubt, ConsenSys and Vitallik.

So let’s have a look at what they have been doing.

Remember Infura? The company that is basically the AWS of ETH? Well, ConsenSys thought it would be a great idea for decentralization to acquire Infura.

This means, a part of a for profit company that holds a major stake on ETH has acquire the infrastructure that runs most of the blockchain. This is clearly a major problem due to the conflict of interest. It’s the same problem we have with the banking system encroaching into politics. There is no checks and balances when you control the money flow and the rules at the same time.

You know what ConsenSys also owns? A little extention called METAMASK. Metamask is by far the most used browser wallet users use to interact with the ETH ecosystem.

So ConsenSys owned the door, and now they own the police too.

Furthermore, recently JPMorgan has said that ETH is better than BTC. This is a surprise following the group’s past attitude towards cryptocurrency in general. But everything becomes clear when you realise that JPM holds a significant part of ConsenSys since earlier this year!

What you are seeing it just another TradFi moving to control a huge part of today’s DeFi ecosystem.

Which brings me to Vitalik.

First of all I would like to address something that doesn’t seem to be very well known: Vitalik didn’t code ETH. The true programmer behind ETH is Gavin Wood. Someone that has left the project a long time ago and essential disavowed the protocol due to where it was headed.

So what did Vitalik do? He is the writer of the white paper and he has been the face of the project.

And optics matter, so this does give him a tremendous amount of influence.

One of the most important parts he KNEW from the beginning that ETH would never be scalable, but they just needed to push something out to make money.

I am not going to go over the moral core of Vitalik any further because I think morals are subjective as a whole and there is room for everyone to form their opinions on the man, so I will link all the resources I found and let you decide for yourselves, but for me, someone that has been involved in a scam regarding quantum mining and has actively tried to destabilize ETC out of spite by using his connections is not deserving of my trust.

Here you have the album.

In conclusion, if you have an institution with this amount of power over an ecosystem that is not trustless, and that institution is actively seeking to further it’s goals by removing even more of the freedom you thought you had, they are not to be trusted.

# You can’t trust the monetary policy:

Since you can’t trust the protocol and can’t trust the leaders, you have a last line of defence: the monetary policy.

If the protocol is bad and the leaders are self-serving, the monetary policy being fair and consistent would be the key to keep any users on the network. So is it fair and consistent?

No, and it has never been.

I have spoken a little about the London Upgrade on my last post, so I will just summarize it here.

Fees being burned absolutly only benefit the rich and stakers will screwing over all users. This is bad now, and will be even worse if ETH moves to PoS. With PoS there is no upkeep cost for the powers that be, making it extremely easy for the top to stay on top. This is fiat system vibes right there.

But the problems and manipulations have been there since the beginning.

From the pre-sale ETH was being controlled behind the scenes by insiders.

Analysis from the pre-sale influx of BTC indicates insider trading from the get go. These insiders are mostly unknown except for their wallets.

However, tracking these wallets shows perfect price manipulation in order to cash out. And of course that would be the case when they own so much of the supply. Don’t forget that over 70% of ETH was premined for ICOs and pre-sales.

So if you believe on humans being self serving, the monetary policy of the Foundation will never align with the small fish, but with the sharks. The users are there to fill the pockets of the whales and not much else.

# Conclusion:

To me it is pretty obvious that every step that has been taken so far has served the same goal: giving the big players power and profit at the expense of the user.

This means slowly walking into a fiat-like system.

This means ETH will be no different than Wall Street.

To me, there is a fundamental divide between the ideals of cryptocurrency and what ETH is and has been doing.

Even small investors will miss the forest for the trees while they are making money. Some people also made money on every banking collapse. But you better be sure you are on that short list.

Don’t trust, verify.

personalfinance,Is it smart to buy a condo to accumulate equity to eventually buy a house?,"I (25m) just got married (24f). We have both discussed our goal is to buy a single family home so we can begin raising a family when we are ready.

I make 73,300/yr, she makes 40,000/yr. We have saved up roughly 25,000 dollars over the past 2 years while working and paying rent.

I recently brought up the idea of us buying a condo on a 15 year mortgage that would hopefully end up being less than we pay in rent currently, and would allow us to grow our equity instead of going to rent we’ll never get back.

I’ve been running scenarios in an excel sheet with various condo prices in our area, different down payments, etc. and from what I’m seeing this looks like a no-brainer.

An example:

Condo price: 92,500
Down: 20,000
Interest rate ~2.7% for 15 years 

This leads to a principal and interest payment of 491 (then add on taxes, insurance, HOA, should still be less than what we pay in rent)

If I keep 5,000 of savings at the time of purchase, and add to my savings 500 dollars a month, even if the condo doesn’t appreciate any value, I’m calculating that after 5 years our savings + resale of the condo would put us at 75,536. Make it 7 years and this value becomes 96,778.

This to me seems like a great opportunity to build our net worth and use this equity and savings gain over the next 5-7 years to put a down payment on a single family home we could build our lives together in.

Does this make sense to anyone? Is this a wise financial decision? Are my numbers totally off? Give me your opinions.

EDIT: it’s relevant to mention that I’m contributing a lot to my 401k and savings right now and would like to keep it that way. About 22% of my paycheck goes to 401k and I put 400 dollars in savings per paycheck as well. I mention this because this is not something we want to stop doing, so going ahead and getting a SFH at the price we’re interested in would force us to cut back on contributing to these accounts. That’s why we see a condo as an opportunity to build equity and still keep a low monthly expense.",finance

investing,Comparing macro trends from 08 to 21,"https://www.theancienteconomist.com/post/a-tale-of-two-americas-inflation-in-2008-compared-to-2021

As we all know, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said on Tuesday that inflation may keep rising as we head into 2022. Growing fears over this rise in the annual inflation rate are justifiable, as this number was at 4.4% in September 2021 and now is at 6.2% after October 2021. As a result, many investors and businessmen are nervous that we might be approaching a recession in the near future. We will attempt to look at various indicators and data from 2008, right before the Great Recession, to compare and contrast to the present day.
	First, how can we even define a recessionary period? Recessions generally arise from weakness in demand; however, issues with supply can also trigger economic dismay. Recessions come from a period of time where economic activity has become severely reduced, which can be statistically identified by falls in GDP in two consecutive quarters. Real GDP has increased by 6.7% in Q2 and 2.1% in Q3, indicating no worries of a recession at this moment (Bureau of Economic Analysis). However, there are some signs that we may be approaching this economic collapse very soon. 
	We should look to aggregate supply and demand to attempt to diagnose the future of the American economy. As we have seen in 2021, the economy has had no problem reacting to increases in aggregate demand: Congress just passed their $1.2 billion Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, and consumers have more than enough money as a result of increased salaries, stimulus checks, and unemployment insurance. However, supply chain problems have sprung up as a result of almost too much demand, and companies have had a hard time keeping up. Nearly 40% of small businesses have supply chain delays as a result of the pandemic, and there has been a 14% increase in supply chain disruptions between 2019 and 2020 (Zippia). Clearly, there are issues with the aggregate supply that could worsen in the near future, with rising inflation allowing for a negative output gap between the availability of supply-side producers to deliver for demand-side consumers.",finance
personalfinance,How do I make my case for a raise when management includes OT and bonuses in salary?,"Tl;dr I make 68k base. Market rate for my position is about 80k. I'm doing more now than originally hired so want to ask for a raise. BUT management includes OT and bonuses when considering raises. I'll be over 80k this year in that case. Advice?

I plan to ask for a raise for the first time in 3.5 years since working at my current place. Now, this wouldn't be the first time I've gotten a raise. The usual 3% a couple of times, my manager advocated for a ~10% bump once without me asking. I also got another ~10% raise as a ""please don't quit"" gesture when we were (more) understaffed at the beginning of this year. But I feel now is the best/only time for me to directly ask for a raise (I plan to be gone this time next year). 

Some numbers/info:

EE at small (&lt;50) consulting firm

68k base, hourly so 1.5x OT

Bonuses are above industry standard, given out quarterly and during normal times are ~10% of salary annual when combined.

OT during normal workload is minimal, 1-1.5 hrs per week when averaged. This year is heavily skewed due to being understaffed for 6 months, so this year's averages out like 3-3.5 hrs per week.

The market is hot. Ever since I got a certification I've had recruiters hitting me up. I'm not interested in moving at the moment, but I now have enough information to know the going market rate is about 80k, +/- 5k. 

So my initial plan was to ask for a 12% raise, knowing they'd probably give me 6-9%. But I sought advice from a coworker who asked for a raise last year and found out that management adds in your OT and bonuses to your overall salary when considering raises. I can understand the OT, as you don't want to give raises to super inefficient 60+ hour people. But the bonuses? Really? It's right there in the name! Bonus!

With OT and bonuses I'm going to be somewhere around 82-85k this year. The math is not in my favor.

I'm definitely doing more now than when I was originally hired (and more since previous mentioned raises). I'm regularly training new employees this year. In fleeting moments of ""spare"" time I've also been working to improve some company standards. I feel my more typical OT also shows I'm efficient. I also got a certification this year that shows I'm on track for bigger and better things, so I feel that reflects well on the company.  It shows I'm willing to put in more effort, you know, that sort of fluffy stuff.

With that info from my coworker I'm wondering if I even have a shot at a 6% raise? Do I just make my (what I feel is very valid) case and hope that outweighs the pure math? Play stupid that I don't know about how they calculate raises? Or am I totally off base? Thanks in advance.",finance

stocks,"$BGRY - Robotics Company Riding the Huge Wave of Warehouse Staff Shortage and E-grocery Boom and yes, Omicron Variant","**BGRY is the only warehouse robotics company listed and have been hammered by the market.**

Analyzing it the tailwinds and headwinds.

Silverline:

**$BGRY - Berkshire Greyis is making the robots and the AI sofware for Walmart, Target, Fedex and others to keep up with the boom in e-commerce and the supply chain bottle necks.**

**There are almost 19,000 warehouse facilities in the United States, and it is these facilities that represent a critical link in the commerce supply chain. Over 80% of them rely on human work only with no automation, 15% us seom automation, while 5% are automated.**

**There is a huge shortage of staff in the warehouse industry is US. The warehouse and transportation industry had a record 490,000 openings in July 2021, a gap that experts predicted will widen in coming months.**

**All this 3 factors are creating a market that is screaming for help.**

**How BGRY is helping ?**

BGRY robots are making all kind of tasks from piking, sorting, packing or smart shelf replenish in regular retail shops. They have a flexible suit of solutions and AI based sofware that can replicate ""robot work experience"" and can import skills as needed. Walmart $WMT, Fedex $FDX, Target $TGT, Bells, Atos and others are starting to use their solutions.

**Why BGRY is the main protagonist in this market?**

a.**Is the only pure play stock in warehouse logistics. The means faster access to capital generaying faster growth.**

b. **Has the best list of customers that are switching to automatisation to keep up with the new realities: Walmart, Fedx, Target, Bells, Atos etc.**

**c. Has one of the best teams to ride this wave with 2 names that you should remember:**

**CEO Tom Wagner is the former CTO from IROBOT l**eading the tech efforts in the critical years of growth that made IRBT the company that is today (and also made some investors very happy).

**Chief Scientist - Matt Mason - former director of the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon** where he supervised all the activities of the Robotics Institute and the National Robotics Engineering Consortium (NREC). Supervised R&amp;D projects for Walmart, ABB, Kuka, etc., and US technology organizations such as the Army, DARPA, the National Science Foundation, and the Office of Naval Research.

**d.** **The AI Entreprise Software is a much ore tasty cookie in all this mix. While selling robots is a good busines to be now, the AI cloud with integrated skils for robots will be a market of its own. BGRY as pioneer in this field is building right now years of robot training and skills ready to deploy anywhere in the world.**

**Why BGRY is so cheap right now?**

**Problem**: The sophistication of Berkshire Grey’s system means that right now only the big companies can access those technologies.

**Solution**: While the workforce is getting more expensive and harder to find, warehouse robotics will be adopted by more and more companies while he pioneers in automatisation will speed up the transformation.

**Problem**: BGRY orders are relatively small for the moment

**Solution**: The industry is changing but the speed up has just started. The orders are increasing at an impressive speed and most of them as reccuring orders (like that 25 M order from a [36 M order in October 2021.](https://www.berkshiregrey.com/resources/press-release/berkshire-grey-secures-36-million-in-new-orders/) Last earnings has shown a revenue of $18.8 million in the third quarter of 2021, an increase of $16.6 million or 750% from the third quarter of 2020 and an increase of $14.3 million or 317% from the second quarter of 2021.

**Total backlog (as nov 2021) was 113M in total (de be delivered some in 2021 and some 2022), a 20+% increase from the last quarter only.**

Revenue growth is set 99% CAGR and judging by the numbers recorded this year, this doesn't seem so difficult.

**Problem:** BGRY is not profitable and an rate hike will make them pay more for the capital needed for growth.

**Solution:** The brake even if projected for next year - pretty much when the interest rate hike is expected by the most howkish at the Fed. Also they had some 200M + in cash in NOv. 2021&gt; So cash wise they are pretty much safe and able to grow.

**Why not waiting until BGRY will prove itself and have meaningful EBITDA ?**

The initial valuation of 2B this summer was not that attractive as they had to show some numbers first. Now, after very promising earnings and new contracts ad partnerships, we have a 1.2B EV on the table.

Current EV/E2025EBITDA gives us a 5.2 result. With a conservative 12 EV/EBITDA multiplier Berkshire Grey's EV would be \~ 2.77B or $13.8/share, more than double from current price. 

**Brooks Automation, Inc. (BRKS)** an established robotics &amp; automation company for example, a ev/ebitda over 100 right now.

The growth projected by BGRY didn't factor in 3 important cathlysts: The wage increase in many sectors (warehouses included), the staff shortage and the supply chain bottle necks. The market might speed up to automatisation a lot sooner than expected any spark can get BGRY for a rally.

E-grocery and e-comerce has not slowed significantly during the re-opening and the growth trend is here to stay for years to come.

Fed gov has money and the political will to finance solutions for fixing the supply chain. Automation maight just be one of those solutions.

Amazon already bought Kinva (2012) and Canvas (2019) robotic and automation companies. Amazon is a trend setter and big players outhere might just put a bid on the table for BGRY and the price will fly an never comeback.

Finally - we might have noticed in the news that some countries are closing borders and there is a new spike in infectins across the globe. The winter ahead wil make all the cathalysts mentioned above even more critical. If the new variant(s) prove to be just as deadly as Delta, all e-grocery/e-commerce and robotics will see a renewed interest.

personalfinance,Using Upstart as a step out of the CC hole I’ve dug?,"As the title says, I’m considering using Upstart to consolidate and eliminate my CC debt. I just finished getting my Bachelor’s for nursing which I got by taking an accelerated program that ate through my savings, caused me to have to reduce work hours, and made me rely on the cards too much. The rest is from living beyond my means I’ll admit. I make ~80k currently, and that will increase likely 10-15k within the year, so I’m not worried about income except for student loans coming due. But the debt is there already so there’s nothing else to do about it anyway but pay it off the best I can.

I currently have just shy of 35k between 7 cards ranging from 18-28%. All cards are close to maxed out and while I can pay everything, obviously the interest is killing my hopes of ever paying them off and the balance ratios have tanked my credit for a traditional loan or doing balance transfers. 

I’m done with Credit Cards and just want to get back on track. Im thinking if I can use the upstart loan at 19.01% (I know), it’ll “eliminate” the CC debt, greatly improve my credit score because of that and also reduce my monthly payment by several hundred dollars. Without the utilization tanking my scores, I can then refinance that loan through my credit union at a more reasonable interest rate.

I immediately contacted my bank and cancelled my card and they suggested I file a police report which I did. Was my info stolen from online database of some sort? Because I found it extremely odd that someone made these purchases, and I received an email about it, along with a huge influx of subscriptions to various gov websites and stuff. Since I discovered this I have been refunded but I’m extremely paranoid and concerned about further damage. Even today I got an email from fed ex thanking me for making an account. This leads me to believe someone tried tracking the package they fraudulently ordered from my account. The email had my user ID which was created by someone else.. and I changed the password and tried to see what info was there. When I chanted the password and reviewed the profile it in fact had my name, email address, phone numbers, and a previous address I lived at.

In the past I just played using guides for taking quickly what I wanted without really enjoyimg quest, plus I never have forged or enchanted, so my experience was quite limited (I always loved the game but I knew I could have more).

Now I'm doing a run similar to a blind one (I don't have a very good memory so I can quite do it) but with some mods about leveling and gameplay experience. I always found leveling in skyrim a but too long, i always used the level up the lvl up code but both code and original leveling were boring to me so ai downloaded a mod that would upgrade lvl up speed to 10x. Then I notifed that i didn't like resetting a skill tree, so I inistalled the lvl uncapper (this one, I discovered then, give bonus when leveling a skill till it gets lvl199, so other then make the player avoid to make a skill legendary it gives more bonus).

I always liked to be a powerfull warrior that can use powerfull spells and is able to move throught the shadow... but it would take very long to get more perks for having such a build, so I'm thinking about installing a retroactive mod that make a single lvl up give you more perks.

So the question is: what would you think of someone playing a character that basically have everything?

Basically I like to roleplay characters like diablo (how to not summon a demon lord) or anos voldigoad (misfit of demon king academy) since skyrim offers such a freedom on building your character

Not that you're gonna influence my opinion, I'm just curious and see different povs: there are lot of people that doesn't like to be too strong cause they want a challenging experience, people that want to reach objectives like mine legit, ecc. 

I still haven't decided if do it or not but I'm just curious to see what other people would think about someone doing such a thing",technology

Whipsaw session today in the market. After opening higher in the morning stocks slid steeply downwards as market participants digested new remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell and new concerns surrounding the coronavirus ‘Omicron’ variant, with the US detecting its first case in California earlier today. 

**Notable Numbers Today**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -1.10%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -1.7%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -1.29%
* Meta (FB): -4.27%
* Tesla (TSLA): -4.35%
* SPY Airline ETF: -3.27%
* VIX: +3.77%
* Alibaba (BABA): -4.10%

At around 1 p.m. ET, the Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) reported that it identified the first confirmed case of the new coronavirus Omicron variant in the United States. Dr. Anthony Fauci told reporters the person was a traveler who returned from South Africa on Nov. 22 and tested positive on Nov. 29. Fauci said the person was vaccinated but had not received a booster shot and was experiencing “mild symptoms.” On November 26, [President Biden’s administration announced it was instituting a travel ban on South Africa ](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/11/26/a-proclamation-on-suspension-of-entry-as-immigrants-and-nonimmigrants-of-certain-additional-persons-who-pose-a-risk-of-transmitting-coronavirus-disease-2019/)and other African nations in an effort to curb the spread. The US now joins about two dozen countries that have detected the coronavirus Omicron virus. The Omicron variant was first detected in South Africa on November 24.

vaccine makers released new, less optimistic commentary regarding how effective existing vaccines are against the new Omicron variant. Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said their current vaccine would likely see a “material drop” in effectiveness against the Omicron variant. 

He said, “There is no world, I think, where \[the effectiveness\] is the same level we had with \[the\] Delta \[variant\]. I think it’s going to be a material drop. I just don’t know how much because we need to wait for the data. But all the scientists I’ve talked to . . . are like, ‘This is not going to be good’.”

[https://www.ft.com/content/27def1b9-b9c8-47a5-8e06-72e432e0838f](https://www.ft.com/content/27def1b9-b9c8-47a5-8e06-72e432e0838f)

Both Pfizer and Moderna have said they were collecting data on the Omicron variant and that more definitive information would be available in the coming weeks. Researchers have not yet determined whether the new variant is more easily transmitted, or responsible for more severe illness, than previous versions of the virus.

J. Pow’s latest remarks before the Senate Banking Committee spooked the markets, after he said he would back off from using the word “transitory” to describe rising inflation. This is very notable because the Central bank has been using the T-word since the beginning of the year, when it warned that steep differences in year-over-year comparisons and supply-chain bottlenecks would lead to elevated inflation. 

Powell said, ““We tend to use \[the word transitory\] to mean that it won’t leave a permanent mark in the form of higher inflation. I think it’s probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean.”

Moreover, Powell suggested the Central Bank was considering completing its asset purchase taper “a few months sooner” than previously telegraphed. Market participants expected a more supportive stance, especially with the new COVID variant, but instead Powell suggested his priority was now on curbing higher than expected inflation. 

Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment, said “Chairman Powell’s commentary course-corrected the view on inflation and the potential need for quicker policy adjustment. The reality is hotter inflation coupled with a strong economic backdrop could end the Fed’s bond buying program as early as the first quarter of next year. Ultimately, the transitory view on inflation has officially come to an end as Powell’s comments reinforced the notion that elevated prices are likely to persist well into next year. With potential changes in policy on the horizon, market participants should expect additional market volatility in this uncharted territory.""

stocks,Gravy train is ending soon,"As the title suggests, I believe the stock gravy train is ending by the completion of this year. 

What do I mean by this? I mean, we won’t be seeing an ‘everything rally’ like we have seen the last two years especially. Already, we have seen those mid-cap tech stocks bleed as investors flock to the FAANG stocks. 

If you look at the charts for the past two years or so, you’ll see huge gains for practically every stock. Those gains happened because of liquidity and zero interest rates. The Fed is going to raise interest rates next year. This is normal but because of the huge gains already, we won’t see that repeat itself. That’s what I mean by the end of the gravy train. 

How much will rates go up and how quickly? No one knows. But it could have a huge effect on values. We have seen stocks just because of this Covid variant. Rates will shock the system and you’ll have panic selling. 

I’m going to keep buying into my SPY and QQQ ETFs, and with stocks I’m sticking to tried and true - Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and Nvidia. We are heading towards a future where these companies will continue to dominate and innovate.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Here's how I deal with poor impulse control. What are your strategies? I don't believe anyone is born with diamond hands.,"Something I do that really helps with impulsivity is divide my holdings into two groups - long term and swing trading. Long Term is where about 90% of my fiat investment goes and the specific choices are based on utility, partnerships, marketing,  basically hard metrics and lots of research. This is hopefully retirement money. New investments come from a pre-alloted portion of my monthly paycheck. The DCA amount never changes.

The remaining 10% is fed in inconsistent amounts by a set portion (25-50%) of my paycheck money that had been planned as ""spending money"" and is left over at the end of each month. I put this Swing fund into meme coins, trending coins, flavour of the week. Basically whatever all the chads here are talking about. Sometimes I'm late or the market tanks mid pump and I take an L, but usually I can double a small amount of cash, take out the initial investment before I get too greedy and move the rest into a stablecoin during pump, but before an ath and sell off. The profit goes into investments from the long term group or I let it ride, or I withdraw it and treat myself to something nice. Doesn't make much difference really as the long term group is already getting the DCA treatment.

I do this because otherwise I have no impulse control. It's like a steam valve for my desire to go big on something like, I don't know, SHIB. Or that token that tried to buy the US constitution. Could have been great, could have been the end of my career. Better not. This all keeps both the FOMO wolf fed and the FUD monster under the bed at bay.

It also follows the old poker adage that you should never gamble with more than 5-10% of your ""stack"", your total holdings, in any one game.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Is Inflation Really the Reason to Be Bullish on Crypto?,"With all the money printing and historically low interest rates, concerns about hyper inflation and crypto as the ultimate hedge are logical conclusions to come to. But what if deflation is the actual long term economic path that we are on and it is a future global deflationary crash that is the reason to be bullish on crypto? I say long term because even though we are likely to see price increases due to fiscal policies in the short term, we all know it's not sustainable Just like how a drug addict can never feel the same type of high after years of abuse without resorting to a fatal dose level, the Fed has gotten to the point where more QE measures will not produce the same high aka low interest fueled economic growth that the addict aka the whole financial system has come to depend on. The fact that a figure like one trillion is now thrown around liberally  just shows how dependent on inflationary policies we have become. 

Going back to the point about deflation, if the Fed realizes that the can can't be kicked down the road any longer and that aggressive QE policies no longer have their desired effect, you get the potential for a deflationary environment, which we already kind of see with the news about future tapering. It doesn't take someone with a degree from the London School of Economics to understand that once you cut off the access to artificially low interest rates, all the institutional lenders and investors that had come to depend on that for their financing are in pretty deep shit, especially if they made risky decisions they otherwise wouldn't have made without expecting a bailout from the Fed. In the short run, this would obviously be catastrophic for crypto because high risk markets crash in these types of scenarios. But in the long run, this could be the ultimate bullish reason for crypto because a deflationary crash of the modern financial system would finally prove that government  fiat money backed by nothing does not work and the Fed cannot bail institutions forever. I would highly recommend a book called The Price of Tomorrow: Why Deflation is the Key to an Abundant Future by Jeff Booth to understand more about a future deflationary environment and how the path that we're on cannot be sustained.

CryptoCurrency,Real Time Strategy: Crypto ain't no (single) game,"It's no secret that gaming is HUGE for crypto.  As far as crypto goes this is surely that 'killer app', the gateway drug that will onboard millions, if not billions, of new users.  And everyone wants a piece of the action, driving any (and it seems all) games up to spectacular, and already bloated valuations.  While I cannot claim to be immune to this hype cycle (I FOMO'd into a little indie game I am almost certain I have no intention of playing before I'd even had time to reflect upon all this) I have subsequently been thinking about all this noise, and the other big thematic running the market presently, the metaverse, to try and find an angle.  


So rather than investing in a single game, or even a Gaming Studio, or getting me a big old fat bag of MANA or SAND and buying the top after these have surely pumped, what's your average and reasonably broke investor to do? (its been a long bull run and I don't know about you guys but I'm fast running out of dry powder!)  Throw it all into one project, and hope its the next Axie?

No, no and no.  Seems to me that one should be strategic about this.  And, please remember, dear reader, that none of the following is to be construed as financial advice, please always do your own research before making any investment decisions...  that being said I do have the following thoughts to offer on how I am playing the RTS game called crypto at this point in the market cycle.

&amp;#x200B;

**TIMING**:  Most of what follows centers around my macro view point as it stands in light of recent events.  While I believe those espousing a 'lengthening' cycle are right, and this bull run still has a way to go before the curtain falls, we hit the matador's spear and collapse into a bloody bear market, this run is getting, like this sentence, a little long in the tooth.  Many influencers on both YouTube and Twitter are looking for signs of a 'blow off' top, or confirmation that we are indeed experiencing the mythological ""Super Cycle"", the run to end all runs.  And while they may be right recent events ***outside*** of crypto have given me cause to pause and evaluate where in the cycle we might be.  Here, I am going to be preaching caution (please send all hate to our customer service team on 1-800- GET HELP) but please do hear me out, I have my reasons.  A quick summary of recent events that have me concerned that a bear market may be hitting us earlier than most expect include: the Chairmen of several Feds selling their holdings on 'ethical' (!!??) grounds, hawkish rhetoric from Uncle Jerome as inflation begins to spiral out of control, massive amounts of insider selling among the mega-corps (Musk and Cook and their subordinates to name but a few), an ongoing global logistical clusterf@#k that shows no sign of letting up, and seismic tremors from China's real estate sector (sending out waves of defaults, and the questions that really have me worried: how much Chinese commercial paper is Tether calling collateral? *AND* what happens when those debt instruments are finally marked to market?).  While it is true that time **IN** the market beats timing the market, with many small projects in crypto already at absurd valuations thoughtlessly FOMOing into the next game that launches promising mass adoption and five hundred new worlds to explore is, IMHO, a fast track to getting turbo-rekt.

With all this in mind my own approach is manifold, but first and foremost is about being patient.  Beyond that I think now is always a good time to become more ***strategic*** about how I invest, and to begin to think about which kinds of projects are likely to survive the next bear market, if it indeed should occur.  So rather than single games or gaming platforms what I am looking for and researching at present are those projects building out the ***infrastructure*** that will be necessary for gaming and the metaverse to become mainstream.... when it comes to that fast track I would rather bet on the rails, than any single train destined to travel along them.

**HYPE CYCLES; 'LAYER 2' SEASON?**

***If*** we are to see another hype cycle this late in the bull run I am of the firm belief this will occur among projects building out solutions to Ethereum's diabolical and hugely expensive scaling issues.  Alternative Layer Ones have done very well this run, and I think have very little steam left.  But what is of real interest to me are the so called Layer2 projects.  Ethereum, lets face it, is where things are at, as I asserted in my previous post it is only those chains that differentiate themselves from ETH by targeting a different demographic that I believe will have a serious long term future in these markets.  Most layer 1 projects are very much 'me too"" projects and once the hype goes out of the market could face a fate similar to that of ADA (although to their credit most seem to, unlike Cardano, have a working product, so I could be wrong, and Solana in particular is going after gaming hard: Bitspawn is a little project on SOL that has caught my eye).  But layer 2s have me excited and I am actively investing in them.  Rather than mentioning a single coin I will merely mention a few projects I am looking at or holding: Large cap: Polygon Matic; Mid cap: Loopring, Immutable X; Small Cap: Metis. And please, please, please guys, do research the space before apeing in, there are too many projects to list here and my listing or not listing them is no guide of how to best take advantage of this nascent space.  If you have any picks you are looking into or invested in please add them to the comments.

Why are layer 2s destined to grow?  Simply put, no gamer is going to be able to afford over a hundred dollars in fees to buy an NFT that takes the shape of an in game item or skin or what have you.  ***Micro-transactions such as those enabled by layer 2 ('roll up') solutions will be necessary for the entire gaming industry,*** *or at least those games, workshops and platforms that launch on Ethereum****.***

With all that being said other projects I see having massive utility in the payments space are indeed protocols that bridge different chains, in that regard I have my eye on both Rubic and Synapse.

**THE RENDER NETWORK:**

All these games and metaverse projects are going to require an unprecedented amount of GPU power, one that local and even cloud solutions are likely going to struggle to meet.  To that end I think that the Render Network (RNDR) is another key piece of infrastructure for the future of gaming and VR and thus of crypto, and still has plenty of room to grow.  Simply put this project is a network on Ethereum that is creating a vast decentralised pool of GPU power to facilitate ""the process of rendering and streaming intricate virtual works"" (*source: Render Token Whitepaper*) and a marketplace for 3D assets and tools.  I highly recommend having a read of this white paper, IMHO this project has the potential to become huge.  

**FINAL THOUGHTS:**

This is getting over long so I want to bring it to a close. If there are two notions I hope readers take away from this little post its one, do look outside of crypto now and then to the state of the markets and economy in general to better time your entries (there are bound to be more buying opportunities in time so never rush in), and two, think beyond specifics to the big themes that are going to drive the growth of crypto going forward, and look for those projects building the ***infrastructure*** that is going to be necessary to realising this vast potential market.  And a final word to those who have followed me, thanks for your patience, but I will post only when I have something I think is compelling and thought out to say, I am trying for quality over quantity with this little side project of mine.  Any and all feedback is appreciated, as are ups for visibility.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Curious how many of you are still holding/buying stocks after finding Crypto?,"I like to stay diverse, but crypto often seems to have so much more future (and fun) than stocks do. While most good stocks are a safe bet, I like a little risk in the pot that crypto gives. But anyway, do you guys still hold any stocks? Do you still buy or are you just buying crypto now? I still just own some stocks of companies that I like and use their products often. But I kinda know that in 5-10 years I can see a 10-50% price increase(if they go up at all), nothing exciting like crypto.

investing,"With tax season coming up, how do investment taxes work?","This year was my first year investing my money so I have no idea how taxes work when it comes to this.

Are there any pitfalls or other things I should know about before tax season hits?

If it helps with info at all, I've invested using Robinhood (I know, I know) and Binance.

**Edit**: Thank you for being so helpful with the info! The first couple responses I got were pretty toxic and condescending, but I'm glad to see that those comments were absolutely downvoted and that the community is more supportive than what those first few comments suggested. 

Based on some responses I've seen, I'm getting the idea that this community is against hiring tax professionals (at least for simpler things like this). Is that the case or am I misunderstanding?",finance

personalfinance,Mistakes were made TSP withdrawal..,"So I planned on withdrawing my TSP once I moved to my new state that doesn’t do state income tax.  I already have my acceptance letter for going to the state, but I haven’t moved yet and waiting my military orders.  I’ll be on the road moving in a matter of days.  I setup the withdrawal to be ready for when I got there.  Well, I had to have a notarized document saying my spouse was okay with it, apparently when that got sent in they automatically started the withdrawal today instead of waiting for me to hit submit on the website..

I can see they took 20% for federal tax, at the end of the year will I get to file that I was in the new state for this amount to avoid state tax?

Also I was told I wouldn’t get hit with early withdrawal fees since I was going on activation orders this month for over 180 days.  Problem is they paid me a week before I planned..  Will I just owe that amount at the end of the year, or were they supposed to already take it when they did the payment?

How do clean up this mess the best way possible?  Halp..

Edit: I do have a military document I signed today stating my legal state I claim is the new state.  But I don’t know if it was fired by HR today.

Bitcoin,Doing my final presentation on bitcoin. Any tips?,"I am required to put together a 20 minute presentation for my technology and society final on a technology that has or will have a large impact on society. I figured bitcoin would be perfect, but I am far from an expert and pretty new to the space. The rough outline of my presentation is below. Is anyone willing to give advice on important point that I should add? Or any points that I might not need? Keep in mind that this presentation is to a class that has no knowledge on Bitcoin.

1) What is money? Go over the 5 properties of money (Durability, Recognizability, Scarcity, Portability and Divisibility) and talk about previous forms of money and why they have failed

2) Talk about gold as a currency, the Fed printing money and why other countries dollars have and will continue to collapse (prompting everyone to question why we have a middle man in the first place) 

3) Introduce the idea of bitcoin and give a dumbed down explanation of transaction hashes and how blocks are verified on the blockchain. Hopefully explaining how btc is completely decentralized. Then move on to explain the hard cap of supply and other technical components like the long transaction times for security, SHA256 and that 100% of btc is intrinsic value (ideal for a currency) Whereas gold carries some industrial value. 

4) Now that the idea of this perfect currency is out there explain why nothing will overtake btc because money is a winner takes all kind of deal due to liquidity. 

5) Introduce the lighting network and how it can help reduce fees and speed up transactions making everyday use easier. 

6) Answer any common FUD related to price volatility, energy use, no backing value, the parabolic price increase that we have seen so far, governments and countries bans and regulations. ect.

Forex,I desperately need help with how Leverage and Margin works.,"I have read over 100 different pages from at least 30 different sources in regards to leverage. There are so many different ways of them saying that you may take ""losses"", ""more losses using leverage"", ""be careful"", ""leverage is double edged sword"", ""you can lose all your money"". But not one single place explains how your leverage is calculated it you have no trades open. All of these examples also always show that the person somehow lost like 800pips or some insane number like that. Like who, how?????  


I would like to give you an example with my current trades.  


I have $3,000 in my account with a 50:1 leverage

  
I made a couple trades, some wins some losses. I unfortunately miss-clicked right after closing a positive position, and entered a position with no stoploss and no target, and before I could close out, I lost $12.45 of my original $3000

  
I no longer have any positions open. 

Now here, I am really really confused. My Margin used is showing $0.00 and I have a margin available of $2,987.55.

If margin is an actual loan, like some websites/people claim, then I have should have used $12.45 at 50:1. My margin should show a loss of $622.5, or about 21% of my total margin. 

Instead I have a margin use of 0.00%, and a usable margin of $2987.55. 

If this is the case, then that would mean that the other websites/people I have read are correct (about 2 paragraphs out of everything I have read) like 0.02% say that leverage in Forex is just a number with no real backing in currency. (in those exact words)

Every single other website/person just shows me that I can lose all my trading account using leverage, but every single example is when you already have positions open. 

&amp;#x200B;

To put it another way, $3,000 dollars at 50:1 leverage is $150k, in other words, if I lost my entire account through small trades one at a time, the brokerage would have lost $150k, that of course would fall to me to pay.

Hence why I am here to ask the question.

\#1 Is Forex leverage backed by actual currency? (I am not talking about the margin set aside from my account during a trade)

\#2 Or is it just an arbitrary number which allows you to increase the gain/loss of your account per pip?

\#3 If #2 is True, then why is my required leverage not tied to my stop loss?;                                                   

If the only money a brokerage risks, is if your balance (we will us my acct of $3k) goes below $3k. Then my usable margin should be = to risk or Stoploss=/=Margin.

\#4 If answer to #1 is ""yes, you are taking an actual loan out"", then why does my account not show that I have used 21% of my margin after losing the equivalent of $622.5?;

 This would also mean that I can lose a total of $60 dollars in trades before I have hit my margin limit. 60x50= $3000. Or 60 standard lots.

This would also mean, that I am currently holding onto a loan of $622.5, but interest rate is not listed anywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

\#Please don't tell me that my leverage is backed by my money in form of margin. I get that part.#

 I need to know what the brokerage is actually covering. Did I really just lose $622.5 with one miss-click?

&amp;#x200B;

stocks,Visa and Mastercard,"Tickers: **VISA,** **MA**

They are both down 20%+ from their highs this year, improving the margin of safety. They still have a huge moat (each of these companies maintain operations in 200+ countries).

Both have a small dividend. Visa authorized an increase in theirs last week, with Mastercard doing the same yesterday. Mastercard has also approved a new $8B share repurchase program.

**Visa and Amazon Dispute**

For Amazon in the U.K, Visa cards only account for 7% of transactions, the smallest share of all card purchases. Amazon U.K primarily uses Mastercard for payments. For Amazon in the US, Visa is the dominant card.

They have specifically targeted the country that would impact them the least. Visa has also faced much more impactful restrictions from companies such as Walmart and Kroger and they ended up settling those disputes privately. It's clearly just a negotiation tactic from Amazon.

**Interest Rate Risk**

These companies derive revenue from client services, data processing, cross-border transactions, and value-added services, such as licensing fees. Meaning they have less exposure to interest-rate risk as they neither earn revenue from or bear any risk tied to the interest or fees paid by cardholders.",finance
personalfinance,Where does one keep non retirement savings?,"EDITED: Updated some numbers, and some context based on questions.

TL/DR: Where to place non retirement savings? Retirement accounts are good, no debt (other than mortgage).. I have 150k sitting in my savings, but the savings returns percentage is a pittance. 


Financial situation:(Just for background on what I already have set up)
Late thirties, single parent of a young child. 
Income is 90k-95K (depends on bonuses) 
I max out my 401k and Roth IRA contributions yearly. 
Roughly have 750k in retirement accounts (401k and IRA)
Debts I have left are just my mortgage. I owe 281k . I have about 14 years left on 2.25% mortgage (refinanced to a 15 year loan in 2020 when the rates were historically low). Home value is about 600k. I have a 529 for the kiddo (thanks for those who mentioned it though!)

When do you need this? I don't need this cash right away. At most I'd keep like some of it liquid but want the rest to grow (or at least keep up with inflation). I am frugal and good with budgeting but I don’t know diddly squat about the market or how to invest. I worry that letting it sit will just devalue the amount. I haven’t seen any savings account offer a decent % though. I considered real estate but prices are ridiculous. So what do I do with it?

Edit edit: I am getting lots of comments/questions about how I've accomplished this. Without going into too many details. 
Opened IRA and 401k in 2005ish. I didn't max it out back then. I first focused on paying down student loans with the goal of 0 debt. I don't remember when I started to max out my accounts.
Current income + expenses and savings:
Conservatively with a 90k income: - 25k retirement - 30k mortgage - 15k taxes (fed/state guesstimate)  leaves 20k for expenses 1600 a month. With random bonuses I am now making closer to 95k. My only debt is my mortgage. 100k of those savings came from company stock that vested I did not save 100k with that income.",finance

**TL;DR:**

Doge isn't sunk, but I'd say best case there is a 50/50 chance of a breakout up or down, either way.  I don't personally like those odds.  If you want to buy more, that's cool.  I'm still not going to beat the drum for everyone to buy right now, but averaging down is a valid strategy if you can stay liquid for a another year.  If you can't buy more and are freaking out because you bought at $0.50 or above, I feel your pain and I've been there.  I personally wouldn't sell at this level, but it's your life and your money, and this shizz is not a game for most of us.  Do what you need to do, to keep doing good everyday for you and yours, and you're welcome back anytime.

Here is my strongest opinion that I'll give you in this post: stop looking at intra-day, hourly, or (especially) even shorter time frames.  Anything less than the daily candle chart isn't going to do anything but stress you out, or worse make you panic sell.  Short time frames have too much noise for a human to interpret much of anything, and a lot of the minute to minute price movement is algorithmic trading anyway.

**Here are my full thoughts:**

I buy and trade more than one type of equity and I wanted to share what I've learned over the past few years.  I scribbled lines all over the chart image above on Nov. 11 (the white dotted line), when doge was still following a shorter term channel upward (the two yellow lines).  After I marked up this chart, it continued to follow that for several days.

Then two things happened: it dipped below the lower line (upward trend) and on the same day, crossed below the 20-day Exponential Moving Avg. (blue line).  These are both technically bearish signals, that would prompt most short term traders to sell pretty quickly.  However, it took doge over a week to work its way down to the longer term uptrend (long green line) so there was still optimism even though it had broken out (downward, but still a breakout) of the short term upward channel.  Had doge continued upward along the short term uptrend and broken above the longer term downtrend (red line) this post might have a very different tone.

Doge has continued to flirt with the broader uptrend line, even crossing above on three days in a row, but closing the daily candle below again.  This isn't a good sign but a line on a chart is sometimes just a line on a chart.  The bad news is that often when something breaks below the support in a sustained way, then the old support becomes the new upward resistance area.  Support could be interpreted as either of two numbers: the green uptrend line that I drew on the chart, or the previous level that doge bounced from after the last dip, which is where my short term and long term uptrend lines intersect: $0.195.  Although the price has remained below the long term uptrend, it hasn't yet broken downward past the $0.195 support and stayed below.

Now here's the part a lot of this sub won't like...  compare the price movement of DOGE to ETH.  The latter has recovered nearly all of its recent losses, while DOGE is still toying with it's most recent support level.  Why?  Now look at a BTC chart.  **That's right , I said it.**  They look much closer together.  Because DOGE is ratio traded directly against BTC versus ETH or LTC or most any other cryptos, the prices follow each other much more closely.  What this means, IMHO is that any breakout of DOGE to the upside will be predicated on BTC moving toward its all-time-high pricing once again.  But it has been struggling to do this recently, as BTC is now very much a financial instrument of the US, EU, and world economies, meaning that inflation fears and the US Federal Reserve changing their monetary policies now has a greater-than-zero effect (transitively) onto the price of DOGE.

To make matters worse, on Coinbase, DOGE is only traded against BTC, USDT, and a few fiat currencies.  On Binance.US, it's ONLY USD and USDT.  No one wants to pay double the fees to trade DOGE against ETH or Cardano by exchanging for fiat every single time, so pretty much no one does.  I don't use Robinhood, so I'm not sure what trading pairs are available but I'd say it's a safe bet that there aren't that many.  $HOOD is mostly interested in you exchanging ALL your fiat for DOGE, not trading into DOGE from other crypto, because stacking more fiat looks better on their balance sheets to potential investors after their somewhat questionable IPO.

There is a bright spot on the MACD section of the chart.  For the uninitiated, the Moving Average Convergence/Divergence plots two moving averages against each other using different time frames, and when the blue line crosses up above the red line, technical traders regard that as a buy signal.  If you'll notice, the lines are currently about to touch, and if they cross (which is not a sure thing, by any means) then a move higher in the **short term** is likely.  They don't always cross over when they get close.  Look at the same chart, early September, when the blue line bounced off the red and down again, on the big dip day from $0.35 down to $0.20 and back to $0.255, so don't bank on a upward move from a single indicator like the MACD by itself.  Comparing to the BTC chart on the same time frame, its MACD looks nearly identical which (no matter how much you roll your eyes about BTC) is actually a good sign for doge to move up again.

I know enough about technical analysis to not shoot myself in the foot (mostly), but please don't do anything crazy because you read this post.  If you can average down, that is a valid strategy, **but** only so long as it stays within your risk tolerance **and** personal liquidity over the next 12 months.  Don't buy on margin, don't buy on credit.  If you're long DOGE but not flush with cash, that's ok too.  I'm not either, so I'm going to wait it out.

Stay frosty.",cryptocurrency

Charles also mentioned that they haven’t seen any regulatory activity on IOHK’s end. eToro is a relatively small source of liquidity for Cardano and there shouldn’t be much of an impact.

CryptoCurrency,Decoupling of Crypto from Stocks | 12.1 Crypto Market Update and Investing Report,"OVERVIEW

* Market Insight: Decoupling
* Market update (BTC, SOL, LUNA, EGLD)
* Major Market News ( CRO, CTK, FTT, 1INCH)
* Notable Events (CRO, ASTAR, KASH)
* NOOBIES: Dr. Gavin Wood

# Market Insight: Decoupling

Crypto markets continue to chug along while the stock market struggles. The S&amp;P 500 is down -5.06% since hitting new highs on Nov 22nd. Stocks have been hit hard with news of monetary policy change and Omnicron, the newest Covid variant. A 5% decrease in stocks is considered a significant drop. Volume is increasing significantly during the selloff which adds to the intensity of the drop. The volatility index (VIX) is up to 31.13 in a 9-month high.

In the same period TOTAL (Total crypto market) has remained flat. Some major Altcoins have been strong in the past week. (LUNA +50%, ALGO +5.6, ETH +5.4%, MATIC +12.6%).

&amp;#x200B;

[S&amp;P 500 1D chart](https://preview.redd.it/o5fz2v9zy2381.png?width=705&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d1fe815b061ba9327f45b471027cac1f561ccd4)

Breaking from historic fashion, the crypto market is continuing to show strength despite stock market lulls. It may be too early to talk about decoupling of the stock market and crypto, but the past week has added a lot of promise to the proposition. There is growing evidence that some investors are seeking alternate investment vehicles due to stock market fears and other markets such as real estate are reaching extreme valuations. It’s early but the signs are promising. If more investors start entering the space, prices and volatility could increase quickly. Below is the SPY vs TOTAL chart (total crypto market), which will be an interesting chart to keep an eye on for the upcoming weeks. The downtrend on this chart began in Mar 2020, showing crypto as a better investment since that point. A break in this trend could help signal when a crypto bull market is over.

&amp;#x200B;

# Market Update

* · Bitcoin (BTC) continues to fluctuate between the 59k resistance and a well-tested trendline that currently sits around the 56k area. BTC currently at 56.8k
* · Ethereum (ETH) is showing signs of being oversold on the daily charts after a 15% run-up in 5 days. A lot of news has been coming out of ETH recently and volume seems to be increasing. ETH has high potential of reaching new highs if the strong market continues. Expect a possible retest of the trendline at 4.2k in the short term
* · Solana (SOL) is up 27% since Friday and is testing the $220 resistance. Stochastics is in the oversold area on the 4H charts. Just like ETH, a retest of the trendline could be in its short-term future

* · TOTAL3 (TOTAL – ETH/BTC) is flat today showing more funds are moving into altcoins vs BTC
* · Elrond (EGLD) is showing a strong breakout of a downtrend on the 4H charts but the stochastic is reaching oversold area. EGLD has gone down 31% since Nov 22nd after a large runup due to the release of the Maiar Exchange. This could create an entry opportunity.

# NOOBIES: Dr. Gavin Wood

Dr. Gavin James Wood is a British computer engineer and the co-founder of Ethereum alongside Vitalik Buterin. He laid the first stone in smart contracts through the creation of Solidity, which to this day, is the most widely used language in crypto. He described Ethereum as “one computer for the entire planet.” It was rumored he engineered Ethereum in a matter of weeks.

His recent work in crypto includes the creation of Polkadot and founding the Web3 Foundation. Polkadot, which has recently gone live, is described as an interconnected internet of blockchains which will facilitate the exchange of information in a trustless manner. Wood designed Polkadot after seeing the flaws in Ethereum. [This past report goes deeper into Polkadot](https://medium.com/p/ef1f6ea1833b/edit).

Web3 was created to redefine the structure between blockchain and the web. It aims to work towards decentralizing web architecture and returning the internet back to the users. Grants are awarded to projects that facilitate the grounds to a decentralized web through the Web3 foundation. Web3 foundation with the aid of Polkadot is positioned to bring on a new future with the integration of blockchain technology and the web.

Wood remains of the most influential personas in crypto and one that I recommend our community follows. If you would like to learn more about Dr. Wood, check out his self-written [Zoolander-like webpage](https://gavwood.com/). After a good laugh, check out his some of his insightful speeches on Youtube.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I want to remind everyone that I am not here to shill any coins or projects. I wish they paid me good money to shill legit projects but that is not the case. I am going to have preferences but this in no way means these projects will outperform others, I merely mention them to bring them to your attention in hopes that you do deeper research.

Don’t forget to share what you find and help add value to our community.

stocks,Dow futures swing higher as markets grapple with omicron and interest-rate uncertainty,"U.S. stock futures pointed to a stronger start Thursday, in what’s becoming an increasingly volatile market due to uncertainty over the spread of coronavirus and the direction of interest rates.

**What’s happening**

* Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average YM00, +0.93% rose 327 points, or 1%, to 34329
* Futures on the S&amp;P 500 ES00, +0.73% gained 0.8%, or 37 points, to 4546
* Futures on the Nasdaq 100 NQ00, +0.40% rose 0.7%, or 105 points, to 15974

In an incredibly volatile session on Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.34% ended 1.3%, or 462 points, lower to 34022.04, as the Nasdaq Composite slumped COMP, -1.83% 1.8%, or 284 points, to 15254.05. The S&amp;P 500 SPX, -1.18% fell 1.2% to 4513.04, and the small-cap Russell 2000 RUT, -2.34% slumped 2.3%, or 51 points, to 2147.42.

**What’s driving markets**

Market sentiment soured Wednesday after the confirmation of the first U.S. omicron variant case, which sent the S&amp;P 500 below its 50-day moving average for the first time since Oct. 13. “It seems that investors’ main concern remains the uncertainty surrounding the omicron coronavirus variant and the implications any new restrictions could have to the global economy,” said Charalambos Pissouros, head of research at JFD Group.

It also came as Fed Chair Jerome Powell, for a second day, brought up the prospect of a quicker taper, which in turn sets the stage for more, and faster, interest-rate hikes. 

“It is not about covid; it is about the Fed and what they plan to do. This selling will grow much worse; this will become about how much pain the Fed can endure,” said Michael Kramer, chief executive of Mott Capital Management.

What’s clear is that once tranquil markets are now increasingly volatile. Analysts at Bespoke Investment Group found 17 instances since 1928 in which there were three drops of at least 1%, and one gain of at least 1%, in the four days preceding a close below the 50-day average. The median gain in a year’s time was 16%, though there were drops of 40% in 2007 and 23% in 1934.

Four Fed officials are due to speak Thursday, as the latest jobless claims report gets released. The OPEC+ grouping also will be debating production policy in response to the virus.

personalfinance,Trad vs. Roth 403b Advice,"Hello! 

I’m looking for some advice on my retirement contributions. 
My employer gives us both a traditional or Roth option on the 403b plan with 5% match. I have been contributing roughly 15% per paycheck to the plan with a distribution of 5% pretax (for the match) and 10% Roth as per a TIAA consultant’s advice. 

Starting 2022, I plan on saving for retirement more aggressively and will contribute enough to max the 20.5k limit. I currently make a gross income of 70k/yr (so in the 22% fed tax bracket) with a 3-4% raise coming in a few months, have no kids, and file single (subject to change). I also contribute the max amount to my HSA and personal Roth IRA annually, and have already established an emergency fund of ~6 months of expenses. Given my current circumstances, is it advisable to contribute to a traditional instead moving forward ?

CryptoCurrency,My Dutch bank is introducing new ‘negative interest’ rates for wealthy clients.,[removed],cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,My Dutch bank is introducing new ‘negative interest’ rates for wealthy clients.,"Since 1 July 2021, an ABN AMRO client pays negative interest if the balance of all of their current and savings accounts totals more than €150,000.     

As of 1 January 2022, they will be lowering the threshold above which you will pay negative interest to ‘only’ €100,000.        

From that date, clients whose total balance on ABN AMRO accounts exceeds this figure will start paying **0.50% negative interest** on the amount in excess of the threshold. The change applies to both retail and business clients.         

Quick Maths: 
-0.50% of €275,000 is €-1,375 on an annual basis. €-1,375 / 365 days is €-3.77 interest on a daily basis.        

*”All banks are required to hold a percentage of these savings with the European Central Bank (ECB), for which banks currently pay negative interest. As clients are holding larger sums in their accounts, banks are parking more money with the ECB on top of the mandatory reserve. As a result, we are paying more interest to the ECB, which we are partly passing on to clients by charging negative interest rates. The 100,000-euro threshold means roughly 95% of clients won't have to pay negative interest. A transitional arrangement is in place for investment clients”*.

# [Dow futures rise 100 points as travel stocks get boost following omicron sell-off](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Dow futures rose in early trading Thursday despite the arrival of the latest Covid variant on U.S. shores and as the White House tightened travel restrictions.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 120 points. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.4%.
*****
&gt; The Biden administration reacted to the news that an omicron case had been reported in California by asking businesses to proceed with vaccination requirements, even though the administration’s mandate was halted in courts pending review. The White House also tightened travel rules, requiring inbound passengers to be tested within 24 hours prior to departure.
*****
&gt; Airline, casino and energy stocks led the gainers in premarket trading.
*****
&gt; Dow component Boeing’s shares jumped 3.6%, cruise line Royal Caribbean was up 3.6% while MGM Resorts International moved 2.7% higher, with Covid-sensitive companies benefitting amid early evidence showing the new strain may be less severe than earlier versions.
*****
&gt; “We remain cautious on S&amp;P 500 amid a hawkish Fed tightening into an overvalued market,” said Savita Subramanian, Bank of America Securities head of U.S. equity &amp; quantitative strategy.
*****
&gt; Still, Bank of America noted that December has historically been the strongest month for the S&amp;P 500, with the average gaining 2.3% on average since 1936 and positive 79% of the time. However, December has not always been immune to sell-offs, Subramanian added.
*****
&gt; “Another risk is an inflation-led consumption hit, especially as fiscal/monetary stimulus run out. Fed Chair Powell’s comments on accelerated tapering and retiring the word ‘transitory’ indicate that the Fed’s focus is now inflation rather than employment.
*****
&gt; During regular trading on Wednesday, stocks posted strong gains earlier in the session, but fell on news that the first omicron case had been reported in California. The Dow fell about 460 points, after the 30-stock benchmark had advanced 521 points. The S&amp;P dipped 1.18%, giving back an earlier gain of about 1.9%. The Nasdaq Composite slid 1.83%, after earlier trading 1.8% higher.
*****
&gt; “Investors are increasingly cautious about the Omicron variant as well as the likelihood of faster tapering,” TD Securities said in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; Wednesday’s whipsaw continues a highly volatile streak for stocks as the market digests what the new variant means.
*****
&gt; “We’ve seen this movie before and Wall Street will likely remain COVID-variant headline driven until a clear assessment over this wave can be made,” said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. “The next couple of weeks will likely see risk appetite take a cue from incremental Omicron updates, supply chain issues, and every inflation reading,” he added.
*****
&gt; On the data front, weekly initial jobless claims numbers will be released Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists are expecting a print of 240,000, according to estimates from Dow Jones. The prior reading showed 199,000 first-time filers, which was the lowest since November 1969. The November jobs report will be released on Friday.
*****
&gt; Thursday’s reading follows a better-than-expected ADP report on Wednesday. Private payrolls increased by 534,000 in November, ahead of the expected 506,000.

wallstreet,This junior gold miner has potentially massive gold reserves with a float of around 6M shares. Trading at less than half of a recently issued price target. NASDAQ $USAU,"**A just released feasibility study indicates huge potential gold reserves.**

Good day everyone,

**U.S. Gold Corp. (NASDAQ: USAU)** is a gold exploration and development company.

Current price $10.76/share (at market close 11-30-21)

It’s been a while since we talked about a junior gold miner. We’ve talked about USAU before, but it was in January of this year. I wanted to talk about them now to update you about events at the company and because turmoil in the economy can impact gold prices, driving them higher. Higher gold prices usually improve the value of gold miners at all levels.

**Some considerations for USAU:**

38% off 52-week high  
Copper &amp; gold prices are strong  
Tiny share structure  
Analysts indicate 68% to 150% potential upside  
Fresh PFS with great results

I want to note that [USAU shares](https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui?s=USAU) have just broken through their 20 SMA, 50 SMA and 200 SMA of $10.24, $10.19, and $10.54 respectively. With a 52-week high of $17.40/share, a near term breakout may be indicated.

Gold is a traditional haven for investors that are uncertain of the near-term fortunes of the economy. I talked to you earlier about moves that the Fed is contemplating to tamp down inflation. Potentially discontinuing the purchase of treasuries and mortgage-backed securities along with the other weapon in the Fed arsenal, raising interest rates. These kinds of Fed actions are designed to slow the economy and may drive investors to increase their gold positions. That is good news for USAU.

The current price of gold is $1,787/ounce and the 2021 range has been $1,684 - $1,951/ounce.

USAU presents with a tiny share structure with only 7.09M shares outstanding and 6.76M shares in the float. Insiders hold 13.32% of the outstanding shares and institutions hold 11.79% which seems significant for a development stage company.

The company has a FYE of April 30th, so they are operating in their Q3 right now. At the end of Q1 (July 31) the company reported cash of $10.7M

8/20/2021 HC Wainwright Reiterated Rating Buy $15.50  
4/8/2021 Alliance Global Lower Price Target Buy $20.00  
The consensus price target level from the analysts above is $17.75 indicating a possible upside of 65%.

Today I want to outline the company’s flagship property, the CK Gold Project located in Wyoming, just west of Cheyenne. The property comprises about 1,120 acres and is **100% owned by U.S. Gold Corp.** Here’s a link to a [short video](https://www.usgoldcorp.gold/properties/ck-gold-project/overview) about the project.

12-1-21: USAU [just released news](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-gold-corp-announces-positive-141500367.html) that it has completed the prefeasibility study (PFS) for the Company's CK Gold Project and has published its SK-1300 Technical Report Summary. A pre-feasibility study determines whether a probable mineral reserve is economically viable and determines whether the reserve can be economically mined. Here are the highlights:

I will do the math. At today’s gold price, the projected gold equivalent reserves at the CK project could be worth as much as $2.6 Billion. Not bad for a company whose market value is only $78M.

Ed Karr, the company CEO said, ""Considering the findings of the PFS study in the context of today's metal prices, we seem to be on the precipice of realizing exceptional value from a project whose time has come. We also are intrigued by the upside potential the CK Gold Project holds as we look at the potential value of the aggregate the project can produce at a time when development in the vicinity of the project is increasing.""

Make no mistake, this is a huge development that may result in a major catalyst for the company’s value. Stay tuned for our full report on USAU as we expand on the significance of this new development.

Bitcoin,“40% of all money today was printed in the last 18 months” - Breedlove,"Robert Breedlove has said this on a few podcasts.  I shared with a friend who was skeptical.  He dug in and found that this stat comes from the fed website.  Per my skeptical friend this is misleading.  

He says that “printed” does not mean “created.”  He says that printed more accurately means converting non physical cash into physical cash.  

Further, some economists say this is a sign of a strengthening economy bc banks are responding to patrons desire for more cash to spend.  

This last part seems highly debatable and dubious.  But I’d love some feedback on what Breedlove was actually saying.  Does “printed” mean “created” or only converted?

CryptoCurrency,Lessons learned from a noob,"Hi all, I'm new to the crypto scene and thought I'd share a few important lessons learned for other new investors. From using credit cards to investing in LRC at its ATH - yes, I've made a lot of mistakes in a short timeframe :)

First a tiny bit of backstory. Most of my savings are in precious metals. While I am now investing in crypto, I'm still a firm believer in PM: as a security base since they are a hard assets, and out of principle since by congressional law the USD *is* 3/4 oz of silver (it's worth is not measured in dollars, its intrinsic worth *is the dollar*). Govt issued paper silver certificates like we had in the 50s and fiat like we have today is arguably unconstitutional - but that's another topic.  Unfortunately the PM market is monopolized by banks who are empowered by the Fed and manipulate it to the downside with paper contracts that exceed supply. When that sharade ends, you could make a lot of money on the upside. But until then, it sure feels like a money pit.  


* LESSON 1. Don't touch credit cards.  
That being said, I decided to dabble in crypto to make some short term money. Except most of my cash was already spent on PM, so I  took out a couple cash advances on my credit card to the amount of $5000 plus a few thousand I had lying around.  MISTAKE. Don't invest money in crypto that you can't afford to lose. I saw tons of coins going up by 10% or even 50% in a day and I thought it would be easy to catch a wave. Turns out I invested mostly at the peak right before the crash. Having this money from debt made the huge downside a few weeks ago (after the China crypto ban) EXTREMELY hard to bear. Many times I thought about cutting my losses, selling all.
* LESSON 2. Ignore the FOMO emotions.  
This applies not only to buying as coins are going up, but buying small dips instead of bigger dips for fear of missing the turnaround, and then seeing things dip further.  
Try to think like a whale. Pretend you already have millions and millions. What would a whale do?  
1. A whale would not follow the school of fish chasing some coin just because it has gone up 10% in a day. By the time you get the notification it has gone up, it is *too late* to grab any short term gains from that. A whale already has what it needs. It is a predator, not prey.  
2. Looking for short term gains, on a dip, a whale would pick a buy price that makes sense for their profit goals based on where the coin will most likely bounce back to. They would not panic if it doesn't dip that far and is never executed, they would move onto other short term investments or put more money into other long term investments.
* LESSON 3. Separate your long and short term strategies.  
Long term is easy - research, buy, hold. IMO most of your longterm should be in the big market cap coins BTC and ETH being the biggest. If you buy at the peak and then there's a crash, you can just continue to hold - you're measuring profits over months or years not weeks - so don't worry.  
Short term investing is harder. But having the funds and goals separated makes it less stressful.
* LESSON 5. Use a tool that has an order book and depth chart. ESPECIALLY if you plan on any short term buying &amp; selling for profit.   
I started out on [coinbase.com](https://coinbase.com) and went all in on LRC at the moment of its ATH. On [coinbase.com](https://coinbase.com) all you see is a line chart going straight up. On [pro.coinbase.com](https://pro.coinbase.com) I would have likely seen that everyone was about to sell off (not to mention lower transaction fees). It took me a long time to make back that money!!  
An order book allows you to place buy &amp; sell commands at a limit (or target) price. You can place your orders &amp; go to sleep or got to work without worry about having to check things constantly.  
A depth chart is a measure of all these limit orders on the books, and allows you to see at what price point others are planning to buy or sell. Example below:  


[A possible sell wall approaching](https://preview.redd.it/27ico0x9w4381.jpg?width=564&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d8176862ed85402afd06a8b4e1533cb7a804e69b)

In the example above, you can see in red a wall of sell orders approaching when the price reaches a certain point. This is not an end all be all, as it does not account for immediate market buy/sell orders that can come out of nowhere. The price structure can also fluctuate rapidly depending on the coin &amp; its history etc. This is merely a tool that can help prevent you from going all in right before a sell off, and also help you to time your limit sells &amp; buys right before the whales, so that they are executed *before* things plummet in one direction or another.

* LESSON 6. Beware the whales. Remember this market is not just retail investors. Even though much of the excitement of crypto has to do with theoretical independence from fiat - don't forget that the fiat factories themselves (banks, hedge funds etc) are in here too. They will not hesitate to sell off when they need liquidity because they are over leveraged. Don't panic and liquidate your long-term investments out of fear. However, don't be afraid to take profit either. If there's a dip, you can always re-invest that profit, or you can hold it as cash in a stable coin to get an APY, or put it back in your bank account to help bless your family. Life is short - do good things, bless other people, forgive, be happy, enjoy the little things of life.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,on Establishing the Line Between DYOR and Project Transparency….,"We’ve all been there before and I find myself there again now. I bought a shitcoin. The launch didn’t go well and now I’m trying to get updates on the project. I’m a big boy. I DMOR and I have a realistic expectation that updates are not going to be spoon-fed to me. 

However, between the app-whack-a-mole that is the Reddit-discord-telegram-Twitter rotation, the update I needed was not easily discernible. The launch was an utter failure and there were multiple issues. Sure, everyone is a handholding, kum bay yah community until something goes wrong, then it’s lord of the flies. I scraped the discord chat looking for my answer and it wasn’t in the announcements. Ultimately, I was shamed because the answer I was looking for appeared in a “TG VC”, which I have now learned is a telegram voice chat. 

So… where’s the line? What is my responsibility to find the answer? What’s the projects responsibility to post relevant updates where they are easy to find? It was said I should have all apps and check them all frequently for updates. Do you agree?

I’m a firm believer in support mapping marketing. If you market to Twitter, Reddit, telegram, even MySpace with instructions on how to buy a launch, you should make sure you post relevant updates in that same medium. It’s a bit bait and switchy to aggressively market via one medium and then criticize people who wish to continue using that medium for support.",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,Future of Bitcoin in the prism of Meta-Microsoft-whatever-verse,"Greetings,
First of all, this post is clearly my view and its point is to objectively examine the possible outcomes that a new VR universe will have on Bitcoin. I will write it in present tense so we can see this more realistically as if it has happened today.
 
Metaverse is the new internet , the new way of social interaction. In this world are able to:
Be present in virtual places anytime and anywhere we want.
Chat as if we are next to each other.
Date (Tinder suck my virtual...)
Work from distance (in a more appealing way than Zoom)
Travel through places that don't exist in real life.
Game. Gaming is huge. If you like WoW imagine hanging out with a lvl 30 troll and drinking beer in a medieval pub.
Attend social,art events
Trade and sell art
Trade and sell virtual real estate

And many many other things that haven't even been discovered yet or I fail to remember.
Ok so everything is great.
Metaverse is said to be decentralized (!). All apps and cool things are going to be built on blockchain platforms and d-apps.
But what about the crypto currency that will be used in there ? Nothing is going to be free of charge in there for sure.
Well, Facebook or Microsoft or any vr-verse is going to create their own coin.There is a chance that we'll have multiple vr - verses, like from Microsoft. iOS and Android. BMW and Mercedes.Why can't they ? There is no true decentralization as such as Bitcoin's.
Metaverse is going to introduce the new crypto age. The age in which people will convert their money to Meta-coin in order to live this new exciting for many experience. Crypto is a global thing nowadays. Everyone has heard about it.
Metaverse will create an eco system in which you can only trade centralized digital currency. Theirs.
They can and they will. Why should they accept bitcoin when they can make a new coin and new altcoins and get richer.
New companies,already existing big and small will want to have a slice of the centralized pie.

PEOPLE ARE STUPID AND THEY DON'T CARE WHAT DO THEY PUT THEIR MONEY ON.
They sacrifice their privacy already and by then the thing is going to be out of control.
Bitcoin will continue existing of course and may have a high price but it won't have the impact that you guys expect.
There is the possibility that they will accept bitcoin but is in not that profitable compared to controlling a super - coin and its altcoin.
Don't tell me more about inflation I am bored with it. Realise that stagnant-inflation that exists today is not dangerous. There were times when inflation was 10x shittier than now. The face of hyper-inflation will not appear and the bitcoin will magically save us. ECB and FED won't let it happen. Bitcoin can't have a global adoption as a coin. Bitcoin will not be as profitable as the frenzy around alt coins and meta coins.
Sad truth is that bitcoin is viewed from the majority as a means to get a lambo in 10 years if you hodling like a monk.
Virtual reality is going to make altcoins constantly explode and nobody will give a damn about bitcoin.
Metaverse is going to create a whole new universe and it has the opportunity to exclude bitcoin from this new universe where there is no Satoshi Nakamoto and his moral code.

Generations will become dumber and dumber as they will sacrifice their freedom for a guy that invites them on a virtual date and they will pay 10 meta-coins for the dessert.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Cryptocurrency mass adoption and the future of money,"First off, I apologize in advance for any formatting or spelling or grammatical errors. I'm in a very boring meeting at work writing on my phone. 

If you are just in crypto to make money really none of this is relevant. This is really only a directed discussion at the crypto diehards who believe in crypto as the future of money itself. This is more to facilitate discussion than something specific. 

What does mass adoption look like to you?

If a crypto overtakes the dollar as the primary trading currency, what does the military look like across the globe? 

Who pays the military? Are we returning to private militaries a la monarchy? Why would a government invest in defense of a decentralized market? Do you convert your crytpo to pay taxes into the local currency and they use that to pay for military? Why? Do they just pay service members in crypto? What crypto would a government use? What incentive do troops have to be loyal? I would encourage those who are curious about this to read about military history and private militaries in particular and the intersection between private militaries and fiscal policy and printing. For instance, absolutism in revolutionary France is a very good analogue. 

This is just the beginning of the issues going on with the viewpoint that crypto will ever become some sort of world currency. 

The series ""what is money"" by Robert Breedlove and Michael Saylor is a good series exploring some of these issues but for some reason they come to the complete opposite conclusion that all historical precedent has set--that is some version of private tyranny and decentralized governments that existed before modern democracy. 

Take a look back, study the history of why governments exist, then contrast that with crypto (good readings in this appear under the ""philosophy of law"", if you haven't read Hobbes Leviathan I really suggest you understand that as well as any other eminent democratic works that inspired the modern financial and governmental system--because they are ""foundational"" in that any modern works assume you know those intimately) It seems the utopian viewpoint of a mass adopted world currency is just Machiavellian (literally, as in when he lived and wrote his works). How would a mass world adopted crypto that overtakes the dollar result in a world unlike that of the famous houses and merchant guilds of renaissance Venice? Was that functionally different from mass adoption? Or is the system the same and you just changed the currency that provides the power? Private armies, private laws, and private dominance.

It's interesting because when Hilary Clinton did her speech recently about crypto it was pretty on the nose about this scenario of the USD being replaced by a crypto--that there is far more at stake than some sort of financial freedom under the boot of a government. You trade the government for a private person, is that any better? Given historical precedent, why is this different?

Furthermore, if a crypto ever does get that level of adoption, what's to stop people from just adopting a different one? You could say investment in the system, taking a loss, etc, but isn't that literally the same situation as eschewing the financial system now to return to one we had previous, except it's crypto instead of gold or land rights? Those left out of mass adoption, what incentives would they have to adopt? Why not just create their own?  Are you banking on the nebulous idea that they won't be able to? Always believe in the ingenuity of humans in conflict.

I've been in Bitcoin since 2012 and mined some of the very first blocks. I never would have imagined the space could evolve to what it is now, but over this time it's becoming more and more clear that crypto does not solve almost any of the problems it purports to solve. After all, if Bitcoin did even one tenth of what it supposedly could do, why are there so many valid competitors? For mass adoption to ever occur, there needs to be LESS competition, not more. Do you expect the general population to know and understand the nuance between the increasingly staggering number of cryptos? Or will they just pick the one they are told to pick? This is why the digital Chinese currency is such a big deal and threat to crypto and modern monetary policy. 

I am just writing this as food for thought for those of you who are really into crypto and are thinking of this sort of future. I implore you to really seriously research the philosophies behind money and governance because this is so immutably complex it will take a lifetime to barely scratch the surface of what is going on in this space. You need to have a very critical eye to separate the bullshit from the reality in this space.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Cash out refi vs bridge loan,"My husband and I are looking to buy a new primary residence, which will be new construction. We have a good chunk of equity in our current home (around $300k), but we aren't in a position to take on two mortgages. We've got some liquid cash available, but not enough to get a 20%+ downpayment to contract with the builder.

So, we're researching the concept of A) and bridge loan or B) a cash-out refinance to come up with the bulk of the downpayment. Note, I've looked into home equity loans and HELOCs but I'm too risk averse for anything with a variable rate and the loans seem to have significantly higher interest rates. Another note, if relevant: homes in our neighborhood have been snapped up within a month of listing often at \~5% over list, so we're confident we could sell relatively quickly, but for the same reason the builder won't be interested in a contingency clause.

personalfinance,Unexpected Career Success... How do I catch up now that I'm not broke?,"Throwaway because I don't want friends and family to know the details of my finances. Long-time lurker, first-time poster, etc. Not sure where to start but here it goes. I know success stories are not allowed but bear with me, I'm here for advice just want to paint you a picture of what got me to where I am and why I'm a bit clueless.

 I come from a lower-income background. That's not to say we were poor, my parents worked and supported us the best they could but I don't think their combined income ever exceeded maybe $70k a year, and layoffs impacted that a couple of times growing up so we had some rough spots. Also, I grew up with a step-parent and money was always somewhat of a sore issue (zero financial support beyond 3 square meals and a room), maybe it was that lack of support (attended college for a bit, worked part-time without enough cash to even feed myself), lack of understanding of how student loans work, or some laziness/depression on my part, but whatever the case I never finished my degree. I was kicked out at 23, but my grandmother on my other parent's side became too ill to live in her paid-off townhome alone, so I took over.

 I kind of cruised through my 20s taking call center jobs and climbing the corporate ladder, by the time I was 30 I had made it to $45k a year (closer to $13/hr for the majority of that time)  as a manager. The house was a huge boon in my life as I didn't have to pay rent, but the lack of income, and having to handle the home insurance, taxes, and upkeep (the house was very old and it seemed everything was breaking) There were points in my life where my utilities were disconnected, I didn't have a working fridge or dryer for over a year, and other general inconveniences of having a house I couldn't afford to maintain. I'm sharing all this to say, I often didn't have 2 pennies to rub together, and even spent a few years with no bank account because I was overdrawn, on payday loans, and perpetually unable to get my money in order.  I didn't have any savings to speak of, let alone a retirement account. I was living paycheck to paycheck for a long time.

Then I discovered programming. It started by wanting to learn how to use an Arduino to set up an automated garden and maybe grow some weed on the side, but I quickly realized I was good at it, and it was fun. I convinced my mother (living outside of the country and the actual owner of the house) to sign me on as an owner of the house, took out a$75k loan against its equity (the smallest loan the bank would give me), and made some home repairs, but when I was down to the last $20k or so, I decided to quit my job at 30, and attend a programming bootcamp. That was probably the best decision I ever made in my life.

Fast forward a few years and that investment in myself has paid dividends. It was a little dicey at first, I have some missed payments on the mortgage that are holding back my credit score (which I have steadily grown from the 500s to around 730) and had to borrow from friends to keep my phone on so I could answer calls from prospective employers, but after 5 months I found a job at $50k a year, which turned to $65k, and after 2 years I found a company willing to pay me $100k, which grew to $130k, and as of yesterday I've been promoted to $150k base pay, plus a 15% yearly bonus, plus a $50k golden handcuffs bonus, $25k paid out next month, the other half paid out a year from then.

I've shared all this to say, wtf do I do with all this money? Right now I don't ve much of a budget, but I've been able to save $13k in a 401k (the company matches the first 2% with double my contribution, so an additional 4%), I have about $12k in crypto, $15k in various stocks (mostly VOO), I owe $68k on the house at a 4% interest rate, and I have $30k sitting in my savings account. My car is paid off, and I haven't changed my lifestyle much (okay I spent $5k on a gaming rig/monitor/chair, etc) but there's still so much I'm unsure of. 

Where do I invest first? do I max out my 401k? Should I open an IRA? Are bonds/CDs a good idea? I have a girlfriend of 3 years who I'd like to marry and get a larger home to have children in with, how do I pull that off without losing a bunch of money? Should I pay off the mortgage first (my mother is against selling the house so I feel trapped, paying it off might help me get out of my obligations in some way)? I feel incredibly blessed by my total income of $222,500/yr, it's something I never expected, but I'm at a loss on how to put it to good use. Part of me wants to go out and buy a BMW, party at fancy clubs, and take expensive vacations, but the frugal, terrified of being broke side of me can only see one goal, financial independence. 

I tried reading some of the guides on this sub's sidebar, but I don't understand with my age and income what the right amounts/percentages should be for each of the goals above. How do I catch up to the investment amounts that will serve me best in later years, and how can I balance that with enjoying the fruits of my labor in the immediate term? Is there some reading that you can suggest, some primer that can explain how money should be used when you have a couple thousand left over at the end of a pay period instead of just a few bucks (or a negative balance)? What sort of scams or pitfalls should I avoid?

personalfinance,"WWYD? Emergency Fund, Roth, or Debt Payoff","So I am trying to decide between three options of what to do with some cash I have and I'm having a difficult time making the decision.

**Background**
Mid 30s, married, 3 kids, low COL area

Income:
Me - ~$90k
Spouse - ~$90k (technically not until late January - about to graduate college and has already accepted a job offer)

Debts:
Mortgage - $1k monthly w/o taxes and HOI @ 2.85% no PMI (put 20% down)
Car - $450 monthly will be paid off in September 
CCs - Minimal... about $7k on 0% promo apr. Rest gets paid monthly
Student Loans - I have about $12k. Spouse will have about $80k, but will be able to apply for a grant to pay off $50k upfront this summer. Goal is to use about $2.5k per month to pay the remainder off in about a year.

Savings and Retirement:
About $25k to $30k cash on hand. Should be getting about $6k back in fed refund.
Me - Pension program. Decent looking at $5k to $7k monthly before tax if I start drawing benefits at the 25 year service minimum. More if I end up making more and have more service years.
Spouse - $15k in 401k. New job will match 6% so we plan to max that out at a minimum.

I am working on a new budget spreadsheet since we will have more income in the coming year and I am working on a retirement budget adjusted for inflation and then backing out what investment balance we need at retirement age to supplement my pension, etc.

The question is should I,
A) Keep all my cash liquid for an emergency fund
B) Pay off Student Loan Debt
C) Open a Roth IRA

I really want to get started on additional retirement investment and get in before the end of the year. I'd like my tax advantages to be diversified. But I also know paying off the debt (interest around 6%) is guaranteed and I am also concerned about not having enough emergency funds.

CryptoCurrency,Why you should be HODL and Staking your crypto versus using say a normal bank,"Most of us like money.  Sure some people here are just for the tech (liars).  We all want to earn some money if not at some point buy a lambo.

Crypto is providing the opportunity for the ordinary guys and gals to increase their overall wealth if they think long term and are smart with their investments.  

I use the word, investment, because if one just tosses money into everything they read about and do not do real research they are gambling at that point.  Is there anything wrong with this? Not if you are ok with gambling with your money.  

**So let's talk Staking.  What is it?** ((Short answer below this longer one))

Blockchains are “decentralized,” meaning there’s no middleman — such as a bank — to validate new activity and make sure it comports with a historic record maintained by computers across the network. Instead, users collate “blocks” of recent transactions and submit them for inclusion into an immutable historic record. Users whose blocks are accepted get a transaction fee paid in cryptocurrency.

Staking is a way of preventing fraud and errors in this process. Users proposing a new block — or voting to accept a proposed block — put some of their own cryptocurrency on the line, which incentivizes playing by the rules.

Investors who participate in staking can earn yields exceeding what’s available from a typical savings account.  This can be done through pools or through exchanges or even if you get set up as a validator (though this requires massive $$ upfront to setup equipment).

((easy answer)) - You put your crypto in the hands of the pool or exchange for a period of time (you cannot sell it or move it) and get interest for doing this.  It is in your crypto wallet but be aware you cannot sell it during this time.

**Why might one stake crypto versus leaving money in the bank? **

While banks provide 'safer' protection of your money (yes yes a bank could go under, something rare could happen) and the odds of losing your money is slim, you can gain a little bit of interest for putting it in the bank.  Typically banks offer .5%-2.5% depending on the amount in the bank.  Some may offer higher interest rates but one would have to have a considerable amount of money in the bank for a higher interest rate.

Now investing in crypto is risky.  We could argue that there are lots of ways to lose money but if one sticks to well-known coins the amount of risk should be lowered.  You  could invest in bitcoin, Ethereum as well as a few other well known ones and feel safe that the coin ""should"" (yes bear vs bulls, prices go up and down) gain money over time vs lose money on the price of the coin.   

The advantage of staking and forgetting is that when one looks at the consistent data of these major coin prices over the years they continue to rise.  By staking them and allowing them to continue to grow in value over the next few years you gain 5-17% interest off this investment **on top of** the coin growth as well.

An example:

You stake 1 Bitcoin.  I know most people don't have this amount but it works easier for the example.

Currently that one coin is worth $56,000.  IF you staked it for 1 year with a variety of different groups you could earn $2000+ in staking rewards for the year.  **IF** you also factor in that most believe BTC will be worth $100,000+ in a year you would generate **$46,000 ** in 1 year staking BTC.

If you did the exact same amount with BNB ($56,000 in BNB coins) you would earn $7,553 in one year for the staking rewards only.  Estimating how much BNB will grow is not something I will guess but as the coin goes up so would your overall investment amount.

**This is a HUGE difference in potential earned income versus leaving money in the bank**

Say you are a little guy, and maybe only have $10,000

BTC - $378 in interest &amp; $7,857 in BTC value increase
BNB - $1349.38 in interest alone 

Again those are amazing numbers!!

**So who should you use to stake with?**

This answer is a lot harder.  I CANNOT speak for every one and I personally use Crypto.com and have all my coins staked in CRO (their coin).  I like the %

Do your research but here are a few:

crypto.com
finance
coinbase
finance
bitfinex
simplefx

There are a few others out there but from the research, I have done these are ones I would recommend. 

Know that each one offers different rates and has different terms.  You may find an exchange that works best for the coins you have or you may find it worth trading coins you have and investing them in that exchanges coins (like BNB, CRO, or others)

Some staking exchanges also have other perks.  I get free Netflix and Spotify with my cro but again find what works best for you and choose based off that.  

Remember it is always good to have some money in banks for emergencies.  Also remember I am not your financial advisor so talk to one, pay them and listen to their advice.

I'll gladly answer any questions I can but my wife, my children and myself have enjoyed seeing our savings grow in crypto vs just sitting in a bank doing nothing!",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Should I keep my money in a Principal IRA or request a rollover to a different IRA?,"I recently switched jobs, and the money from my 401k got moved to a Principal bank account. I have until the 17th to decide if I want to roll it over into an IRA of my choice or let it automatically rollover to a Principal Roth IRA.

My question is; would it be easy enough to find an IRA that's better than a Principal IRA, or is there a long application process with each bank in order to find out if I can even open an account with them? I feel like I should just leave it, because honestly I don't see what the difference is, and I don't have the time to apply to another bank. But, on the other hand, it might be just as easy to roll it over to an account with a much higher interest rate. 

I could also have them send me a check that I can then deposit into another account later, but that's assuming that I can get an account with a higher interest rate. Is this my best option? Thanks for reading lol",finance

It took 2 years to straighten it out due to Covid delays. Federal and state taxes were about $20,000. His unpaid credit cards were about $10,000. Simple estate with one bank account, no personal property, investments or real estate he was 98.

personalfinance,[ADVICE]: Can I save taxes using Municipal bonds investment?,"Hello Everyone,

I am here to get valuable advice from you all. Whatever I am going to talk about today is risky, and I am aware about that, so I would appreciate if you don't tell me that and instead inform me whether it is possible to do or not. 

From next year, my tax bracket would be more than 25%. To save some of that tax, I was thinking to invest 100% of my after tax salary in municipal bonds ETF and hold them forever. I will be using an Individual brokerage account for this. To pay off for my expenses, I was planning to withdraw margin at the rate of 1.6%. Every month, I will invest all of my Salary to buy bonds and transfer similar amount of margin back to my checking account. This margin would be used to pay off my expenses and also save for emergencies and other stuffs.

Technically, my net worth should be 0 since I used all of my money to buy municipal bonds and took out a marginal loan to pay off my expenses. So theoretically I should get back all of my Federal and State tax refund at the end of the year. In addition to that, municipal bonds investment is tax-exempt, so technically I won't have to pay any taxes on the return that I earn from my municipal bonds investment.

So my question is, is this possible or am I missing something?",finance

# Market Update

· Bitcoin (BTC) continues to range between 56k and 59k as it inches closer to the major trendline. Friday marks a derivates expiration that could aid BTC in breaking out of the highly tested 59k resistance. 

· Cardano (ADA) is rebounding off its major bull trendline with moderate volume, up +11%. ADA has been in a strong downtrend since its release of Smart Contracts. ADA is down -53% since Sept 3rd.

# Market Insight 

The overall crypto market is quiet today, likely in the anticipation of Friday’s BTC derivatives expiration. There is large interest in derivatives and the coming expiration is no different with 194k in open interest. The Put/Call Ratio is 1.01 which implies a balanced expiration. This likely spells less volatility for price. The MAX PAIN currently sits at 57k. The MAX PAIN is the area where the most leveraged traders will lose money on expiration. As noted in this [past report](https://medium.com/@TraderGabi/when-can-we-start-buying-again-c3ffc2a1cd3b), price tends to fluctuate to MAX PAIN during expiration. As a reminder, the most important expirations are the third Friday of each month.

  On a small note, BTC inflow to exchanges had a large spike on Nov 30th. This past year, strong spikes in inflow helped mark short-term tops and bottoms in the markets. Chart below

BTC whale ratio has considerably gone down after a significant spike in recent days. Whales are relocating funds from exchanges back into their wallets. The large spike on Nov 13 was to likely sell off positions.

It’s important to stay vigilant in this zone in the market. Metrics are still leaning bullish but a strong break in trend downwards this Weekend could cause a scramble in action on Monday. My belief is we are still in good accumulation area and that market fears of Omnicron and Fed policy change are not as paramount as their presentation.

# Metaverse Gem: Netvrk (NTVRK)

https://preview.redd.it/fzqd7ng1s8381.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5f820a30337ff3c53dfc2fb6a9ca1bba35c393c

The metaverse has been the hottest subject in crypto since Facebook/Meta name change announcement on October 23rd. It’s marking a large transition in who we interact with on the web and can transform work environments, video games, social-media and countless other aspects of people’s lives. 

Current topics also sparked a race between centralized (Facebook, Microsoft, Nvidia) and the idea of decentralized on the blockchain. Metaverse projects in crypto have greatly benefited from this trend. 

Price gains since Oct 23

Sandbox (SAND)   +803%

Decentraland (MANA) +467%

Enjin (ENJ) +91%

Wilder World (WILD) +168%

&amp;#x200B;

With recent market drawdowns metaverse tokens have begun to break from their recent uptrends and many are reaching **large levels of valuation**. The potential for large profits in the short-term is beginning to subdue. 

Market Caps

SAND $8.9 billion

MANA $5.8 billion

ENJIN $3.2 billion

WILD $435 million

   
  In the recent week I noticed there is one metaverse project that ignored recent fear and its buying pressure has remained strong. This could be evidence of under-valuation. The name of that project is NetVRk (NTVRK). NetVRk is a Play-2-Earn VR metaverse that will offer similar attributes as other major metaverses such as buying assets, buying land, buying ad space, generating NFTs and staking. NetVRk has a unique in-game system for building, where the users will be able to build with their own hands-on VR. 

NetVRk has been busy and has teamed up with over 80 crypto projects and will eventually be available on most major blockchains. The list of investors contains some important names. 

&amp;#x200B;

The most attractive aspect of NetVRk is the valuation. It currently sits at a modest **$219 million market cap**. Other metaverse projects have unbeneficial tokenomics with inflations as high as 100% a year. NTVRK on the other hand has an estimated 30% of its tokens in circulation. 

All these aspects have caught my attention, but I still want to investigate the long-term potential of NetVRk. NetVRk is a possible gem for small-scale investments and a candidate for an hours-long deep dive. I recommend you take the time to look deeper into NetVRk.

# NOOBIES: When there is hype, there is a good chance you’re late

I want to use today’s NOOBIE section as a reminder to not follow the hype when investing into crypto. I often see new investors following the hyped subject of the moment. In 2020, Dogecoin had an incredible run-up and those fortunate enough to enter early, benefited greatly. A majority of Dogecoin investors were late to the game and are still sitting on positions that are down from a year ago. This is how the people that made millions were able to reach this feat. The few benefited from the many who lost. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some signs of HYPE:

· Coin is all over social media: Instagram, TikTok, Facebook

· Large amounts of new people to the space are investing

· Projects are being hyped as the next great thing

· Wild price predictions. Shiba Inu will never reach $1.00

· Celebrities are becoming involved 

· Market Cap is reaching exuberant valuations

· Price has already increased more than 100% in a matter of weeks

· News of new no-name billionaires

&amp;#x200B;

Learn to follow important fundamentals instead, such as:

· Important use cases (layer-ones/twos, new techs, oracles) 

· Large developer base

· Number of users of the protocol 

· Great tokenomics

· Large venture Firm investments

&amp;#x200B;

The truth is finding a 100x gem is near impossible and thinking you’ll hear about it on social media is even lower. It’s best to place most of your investments into solid projects that meet some of the criteria listed above. 

Ask yourself. What is the hype right now? And if most of your investments are there, you should reconsider your choices. Hype, like emotion, is only temporary and the talented traders take advantage of those emotions. Stop following hype and this market will reward you greatly in the long run. 

&amp;#x200B;

personalfinance,Looking for suggestions on my personal situation after reviewing the flow chart. Any recommendations are welcomed and appreciated!,"I've studied the flow chart but feel like I'm in a slightly different position where my employer pays 15% of salary without any match and have a few more questions. That being said, wondering if I should continue to contribute to Roth 401k (no employer match) or start saving for a down payment (no set amount on down payment but some time in roughly 5 years)? Start an HSA? What would you recommend I do with my down-payment saving if that's the route I should go? Should I allocate a portion of my emergency fund in bonds or other inflation-favorable options? Something with low risk and adverse to inflation. Feel free to share your thoughts. Here is my financial breakdown:

Income 70k
No high/moderate interest rate.
6 months emergency fund in cash.
2021 Roth IRA account maxed (single).
1k in Roth 401k. 
7.5k in cash.

personalfinance,Am I in a good spot? (401K and Roth IRA),"Hello all! Been a lurker in this subreddit for awhile now and I have seen a lot of advice to start 401K and Roth IRA early. 

So a little bit of background context about me… 24 male working for 90k a year before tax in PA.

Graduated with a MS a little over a year ago and immediately started work (so basically only worked a little over a year). I have a 401K set up which I only contribute 10% of my salary to. My company only matches 50% of what I put in up to 10% of my salary (so a 5% contribution). I been only putting in 10% and nothing more just to get the free money. 

I do have a Roth IRA set up through a financial advisor. Currently have 10k in there at the moment and still have until April(?) of next year to put in another 2k in (since 6k is max yearly if I recall correctly). I do plan on maxing that out every year. 

Debts: No student debt except for my wife’s which is about 7k. We are thinking of just paying it off entirely by using my emergency funds (which is about 13k). Reason being is that we dont want to stress over it and have it in the back of our minds. Obviously I will have to do my best to rebuild that up to 15-20k but thatll take time. I do have a very strong family support behind me through my parents who said they can assist in case we ever get to the point where our emergency funds arent enough for whatever reason. 

No rent but do have a mortgage. Mortgage is 1.4k a month but I decided to try and pay it off early (again to have less stress on my mind). Mortgage interest rate is 2.65% over 30 years. At the rate we are paying, it seems that we can pay it off fully in another 7 years. 

The rest is spending for life style and credit cards. Wife dont currently work at the moment but will eventually be. 

So my question is that if I decide to maintain contributing 10% of my salary to 401k and maxing my roth ira yearly, am I in a good spot for a decent retirement? 

Do you think I can be more effective/efficient about this or am I in a good position with what Im doing now? 

Note: I do understand that i can pay the bare minimum if my mortgage and invest the rest. However for the purpose of our mental health, we rather pay it off early.",finance

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**:

In conclusion, risk analysis of DeFi protocols is a very complex process as the areas of risk exposure are very different and often interfere with each other. For example, a protocol that allows more freedom in governance will attract investors who want to make the most out of being able to cast their votes on a wide variety of factors, but it will also be subject to more volatility in changes and be undesirable to another group of investors who want to hold the tokens for stability in asset value. Thus, we have to be clear of our purpose first, and then make the relevant analysis and comparison across protocols.

# General Conclusion

Risk is one of the most prominent issues in traditional financial markets. In particular, risk helps investors to quantify a specific number representing an asset value, in order to assess whether that level of risk is acceptable.

In DeFi, however, risk is often undervalued as the majority of participants do not fully appreciate it. Several lending/borrowing protocols are at the forefront of this field when it comes to assessing the risk of an asset. In other protocols we rarely see full consideration of risk.

In this article, we will introduce the concept of systematic risk (generalised) from traditional markets to DeFi.

# What Is Systematic Risk?

Assuming you invest in a single asset, what is the source of risk for this ""portfolio""?

We can say that there are two common sources of uncertainty:

1. Risks arise from overall economic conditions, such as business cycles, inflation, interest rates and exchange rates. These economic factors are difficult to predict with certainty and all affect the return on assets.
2. Risk comes from the asset itself (specificity). For example, is the government controlling the asset or is their direct demand for it, etc. These factors affect one asset but do not affect other assets.

Now we look at the ""portfolio"" of even more assets (a diversification strategy), asking the same question, what about portfolio risk?

Diversifying multiple asset classes spreads the risk of the entire portfolio. The ability to decrease the value of one asset provides the ability to increase the value of another asset. These effects will offset and stabilise the return on the entire portfolio and portfolio volatility will continue to decrease.

However, even if we hold a certain amount of assets (e.g. &gt;1000 assets), we still cannot avoid risk completely, because almost all assets are affected by factors such as general macro factors. For example, if all assets held are affected by the business cycle, then we cannot avoid business cycle risk no matter how many assets we hold.

&gt;This risk that persists even after diversification is called market risk, which is associated with sources of market-wide risk. Such risk is also known as systematic risk, or non-diversifiable risk.

*Note: Risk that can be eliminated by diversification is called unique risk, nonsystematic risk, or diversifiable risk.*",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,CNN Business: Why Inflation can actually be good for everyday Americans and bad for rich peopple.,"I'm curious whether people buy this shit. Inflation is good for the poor but bad for the rich, lmao. Who writes this nonsense. “You see, you broke already; it doesn’t matter if you more broke now, it’s a double negative and shit when you multiply two negatives it becomes positive. If you are rich, it’s a positive, and since inflation is negative when you multiply, it becomes a negative. So you see, it’s basic mathinomics, and if you question it, you prolly just stupid. Respectfully.”

Being in debt before the hit of inflation works to your advantage because technically, you now owe less money. Financially educated, wealthy people know how to use debt to their advantage. Broke people use debt to get into more debt. The rich can borrow against their own money and skip taxes; they can also pay back fast, so no need to pay the interest rates. Broke people pay the minimum, not realizing that their interest rate compounds against them. That's how you get those videos on YouTube of students crying because they have been paying their student loans for three years and end up owing more than what they started with, lol.",cryptocurrency

61. Looks like Cardano is seeing a huge amount of on-chain activity. The crazy part is this is all pre-PAB. Just wait until dApps can actually launch! Unsurprisingly, some supporters of other chains were shocked to realize they didn’t understand the difference between exchange trading volume and actual blockchain use volume. [https://twitter.com/cardano\_daily/status/1460238659098005504](https://twitter.com/cardano_daily/status/1460238659098005504) [https://messari.io/screener/most-active-chains-DB01F96B](https://messari.io/screener/most-active-chains-DB01F96B)

74. Charles dropped a new AMA where he mentioned very briefly that they are actually going to look into read-only UTxOs. If it’s possible to have these types of UTxOs while preserving determinism, it would be a big change since transactions must currently consume inputs.

84. Charles drops a video on the eToro user limitations. It sounds like IOHK knew nothing about this. Interacting with exchanges falls in the Cardano Foundation’s wheelhouse. It’s unclear whether the CF knew anything. He also pointed out it’s very interesting that an old line exchange like Bitstamp has decided to LIST Cardano during this same period. Charles also mentioned that they haven’t seen any regulatory activity on IOHK’s end. eToro is a relatively small source of liquidity for Cardano and there shouldn’t be much of an impact.

CryptoCurrency,Stable coin and Crypto loans through exchanges - What's the catch?,"Whats the catch when you loan your crypto/stable coins through exchanges such as Gemini?

They offer fairly high interest rates (ie; 8% on USDC) relative to fiat, however it is not without its caveats.  I went through the fine print of Gemini's agreement and here are some important parts

"" All lending by you through our Program will be on an unsecured basis. We will not collect or hold collateral from Borrowers, nor maintain any collateral account for your benefit. ""

"" We may, but are not required to, maintain a ""liquidity reserve"" on your behalf of up to thirty percent (30%) of your Available Digital Assets (""Reserve"") in order to more quickly fund your Loan callback and withdrawal requests. ""

"" Borrowers are your sole counterparty in our Program. You authorize us, upon your instruction through our Program user interface, to effect Loans with any Borrower with whom you have acknowledged and entered into a Loan Agreement. We shall not be responsible for any statements, representations, warranties, or covenants made by any Borrower in connection with any Loan or for any Borrower's performance of or failure to perform the terms of any Loan under the applicable Loan Agreement or any related agreement, including the failure to return any borrowed Digital Assets to you or to make any required payments to you. ""

""You authorize us to share with Borrowers your Gemini account information and personally identifying information hereunder solely for the purposes of facilitating Loans and paying Loan Fees to you. ""

I read through the two agreements and they say that these are unsecured loans.  That means they are not backed by collateral.  I am not sure who the borrowers are (the capital is made available to an entity called Genesis Global Capital that specializes in loaning out digital assets, I would not be surprised if they are only a different company by name to keep an arms length to remove liability). The rest of the fine print basically say that if the borrower defaults, you the lender bears the entire risk. You are also giving up your information to the borrower.

That seems like a grossly asymmetric bet. Genesis Global is making unsecured loans on your behalf, but have no obligation to verify the borrower has the capacity to pay it back.  Since Genesis Global has no skin in the game on these assets, they have little incentive to do any due diligence. They are in fact, incentivized to make the riskiest loans they can (so they can get the highest interest profit after paying you your interest).

Sure, you will probably be fine putting a few hundred or thousand into it.  I would be cautious about putting a house deposit into it.  People seem to think of these as risk free investments, however there is a nonnegligible risk of a blank swan event, but I would think twice as to whether it is worth a 9% return.

also: FYI: unsecured loans earn way more than a 9% return. Just consider the typical credit card interest rate - which is a form of unsecured debt.

edit: this is not an 'Anti Gemini' post - im sure that other agreements with exchanges say similar things, i just haven't read through them (nor have access to them).",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Really basic bond market questions,"I have very basic questions about the bond market in general:

1. Are US Treasury Notes/Bills/Bonds always sold at face value? Like, the 10 year is 1.427% today. Does that mean I'd pay $1000 for a $1000 face value with annual payment of $14.27? Or do I pay more or less than $1000 initially? 
2. Are corporate bonds generally sold the same way (sold at face value and auctioned for its rate)?
3. At what increments can I buy treasuries? is it in even increments, or can I buy a $333.33 note?
4. I see that the US 1 year treasury note is .27% today. The I-Bond, which is tied to inflation, is a whopping 7.1% (yes I know there's a $10k/year limit). Why... is there such a big difference? I thought that treasuries were low interest because the government pretends inflation is really low, but if it acknowledges inflation for I-bonds, shouldn't it be higher? (maybe this isn't a basic question?)
5. If I have, say, a $1000 face value 10 year note that I bought in 2019 with a 3% interest rate, how do I figure out it's value if I sold it on the secondary market right now?
6. Where can I find what bonds companies (interested in both domestic and foreign) are offering today?",finance

#[Stock futures little changed ahead of November jobs report as omicron concerns loom](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/02/stock-futures-market-open-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were mostly flat in early trading Friday ahead of the November jobs report as the market nears the end of a roller-coaster week driven by Covid omicron variant developments.
*****
&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 12 points. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 also were barely in negative territory.
*****
&gt; Stocks tied closely to the virus have led the market on its week-long seesaw, and that continued Friday. Companies that benefit from the economic expansion, such as hotels and airlines, led losers, while vaccine leader Moderna was among the biggest gainers, with its shares rising 3.4% in premarket trading.
*****
&gt; Hilton Worldwide was off 1.4% and Delta Air Lines fell 1.2% premarket.
*****
&gt; The omicron variant has now been detected in five U.S. states, with symptoms so far reported as mild.
*****
&gt; The November jobs report is set for release Friday morning. Investors expect to see solid job growth last month, with economists surveyed by Dow Jones predicting 573,000 jobs added in November and the unemployment rate slipping to 4.5%.
*****
&gt; The three major indexes rebounded in Thursday’s regular trading session. The Dow gained 617 points. The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.4% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.8%.
*****
&gt; Thursday’s gains continues a highly volatile streak for stocks as the market digests what the new variant means. The Dow is down 0.7% for the week. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have lost nearly 0.4% and 0.7% since Monday, respectively.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere in markets, Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi announced during Asia trading hours on Friday that it will start delisting from the New York Stock Exchange and make plans to list in Hong Kong instead. Shares fell 4% in premarket trading.
*****
&gt; On the data front Thursday, initial jobless claims totaled 222,000 for the week ended Nov. 27, lower than economists expected.
*****
&gt; Despite Thursday’s rally, the averages are on pace for a losing week. The Dow and the Nasdaq Composite are each about 0.7% lower on the week, while the S&amp;P 500 is down 0.4%.
*****
&gt; “With rising cases of the virus, a less accommodative Fed, and tougher growth comps in the year ahead, the uncertainties around the outlook may simply be building — resulting in a more volatile environment for price discovery,” Goldman Sachs’ Chris Hussey said in a note.

So roughly 79k total miles. It's very clean and well maintained. However I'm coming into some money in the new year. What I'm struggling with is options for the vehicle. Because it's getting higher in mileage I'm unsure if I want to keep it and pay off the loan early (about $11,800 USD left as of posting with quite a high interest rate) or if I want to sell it as the listing for it with the miles is about $11-12k USD. And get a new SUV style vehicle with less miles, or suck it up and keep the car but pay it off. Any options or advice? This is my first car and while I love it, I want to make the smartest decision for me and this car.",finance
Forex,"Interview with Brent Donnelly: FX trader and author of ""Alpha Trader"" and ""AM/FX""","Sorry that I have not posted on here for a while but I hope you enjoy this interview which I conducted recently. Brent has had a storied career in FX trading, working at banks like HSBC, Citi as well as a macro hedge fund. In my view he's one of very few successful traders who is also good at explaining and writing. There's plenty in here to reflect upon.

# Interview with Brent Donnelly

FX trader and author of ""Alpha Trader"" and ""AM/FX""

*Brent Donnelly is President of Spectra Markets. He has been trading currencies since 1995 and writing about macro since 2004. Brent is the author of ""Alpha Trader"" (2021) and “The Art of Currency Trading"" (Wiley, 2019). He writes a widely-read and highly-respected macro and FX daily called AM/FX. Over the course of his career, he has been a market maker, trader, and senior manager at some of the top banks in foreign exchange.*

*Brent has extensive experience trading currencies, FX options, stock index futures, NASDAQ stocks, and commodities. He is a respected macro thinker with the unique perspective of a senior risk taker. He has been quoted by or featured in the Economist, Real Vision, Epsilon Theory, the Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, Bloomberg, and CNBC.*

*Before joining Spectra, Brent was a senior FX trader at HSBC, head of G10 Spot Trading at Citi New York and global head of G10 FX Trading at Nomura New York. He was also a portfolio manager at a major hedge fund in Connecticut for three years. He created and wrote a cartoon called ‘‘Daft Planet,’’ which aired on TV in Canada, and he dreams of one day winning the Man Booker Prize.*

## You have observed that the success rate for people starting out at banks is very different (~50%) to the success rate for individual traders (~5%). Can you elaborate?

Well, part of it is that there’s a highly selective filtering process at a bank. The people who get in at banks are generally pretty smart and motivated to begin with.

At a bank you also get some structured on the job training from people who have been doing this professionally and that is clearly an advantage. A good manager can help spot problems and force you to adapt and address some of your blindspots. Especially at the start of your career, when you perhaps don’t know yourself and your own personality type so well, this can be a big help.

However, I think the biggest factor is probably the runway you get at a bank. As a junior bank trader you can add value in other ways, not just making money on prop trades. For example you can help clients execute large orders or produce market commentary that other teams can use. 

This runway means you get to ‘stay alive’ for long enough to learn the lessons and evolve into a decent trader. Honestly, everyone starting out makes more or less the same mistakes wherever they are. If you’re operating with a personal account with, say, $30k in it, you’ll just find it that much harder to come back from those initial mistakes.

## 

## You have also talked about transaction costs and made an interesting observation: a lot of traders are gross positive but lose money when you factor in transaction costs.

Yeah. Part of the fun of writing the book was going into detail and systematically evaluating hunches that I’d had for some time but never investigated deeply. I learned quite a bit. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Data from Alpha Trader \(p279\), analysis produced by Brent Donnelly.](https://preview.redd.it/i5vkh4746c381.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91e4b9bf28ec9724eb8b40194c129e6a2a58b941)

When I ran the simulations I was thinking “wow”. I was at HSBC at the time and I’d be in and out of 30mio EURUSD twelve times a day. Even there I’m still paying 0.5-1 pips a time in spread. You add it up and I’m paying north of $20,000 in slippage. That’s insane.

Trading for no reason has always been my kryptonite. Look, it can be a strength sometimes: I’m always happy to take risk so, in fast markets, I can get the trade on when others might not. 

However, if you start to think about transaction costs seriously then you really have to justify each trade you do. It has to have a positive expected value. You cannot just trade because you want some action because the transaction costs will kill you.

When I was trading stocks independently I had a multi-month period where my PNL dropped several hundred thousand dollars from its high watermark; yet I was consistently gross positive on my trades throughout. That is interesting if you think about it. My trades were winning on a gross basis but the transaction fees ate it all up and more.Don’t be fooled by ‘no commission’ trading. You are still paying to trade: it is in the spread.

## 

## A lot of people have got into trading recently and probably done well out of meme stocks. The question is whether that’ll continue or they’ll need to adapt. Can you talk a bit about regime change from your own experience?

Back when I was 26-27 I was trading stocks and regime change really wasn’t on my radar. I had a strategy that was working great and I just kept doing more of what worked. 

Essentially I had this S&amp;P squawk box which broadcast what was going on in the trading pits. You could get a pretty good feel for how the S&amp;P would move: partly from the price action but also from the electricity in the pit, what people were saying and so on. Then I’d have 6-7 stocks in a grid, all overlaid with the S&amp;P. You had to pick stocks with a wide bid-ask spread.

When you sensed S&amp;P was going higher you sat on the bid in the stocks. As soon as someone sells to you, immediately you place an offer. Someone would see the S&amp;P move and lift your offer and you’d have locked in the spread. Sometimes you could do that four times and make $1,200 in a few minutes. That’s not bad as a young guy when it is money in your own pocket!

Anyway, I would find these stocks by using a scanner and printing out the results. I needed high nominal value stocks because those would have the biggest tick size and therefore the wide spread that I needed for this strategy. When I started there’d be maybe four pages of potential stocks each morning. 

In 2002 when I printed it out there were maybe four stocks in total. That is *obviously* a regime change in hindsight. However, back then I kept trying to do the same thing that had worked for me in the past. Of course that didn’t work out. The market had changed but I had not adapted.

If something like that happened to me now I’d know that’s a regime change and update how and what I’m trading. For example, if USDJPY suddenly goes from trading in a 50-pip range to a 200-pip range, you have to adjust your position size and where you leave your stops. Now I’m hyper aware of regime changes. Things don’t last forever. Even the basics: Is volatility high or low? Are we ranging or in a trend?

## 

## You use a technique you describe as ‘surfing the narrative’? What is that?

That is probably my biggest edge. Having a good understanding of the layers of the current market narrative; seeing when a narrative is turning; then having a good understanding of the current dynamic between price and narrative.

Let me explain what I mean by ‘surfing the narrative’. Think of the market price as the sum all of the information that’s known by the market today. Often you see the price is dominated by one particular narrative - say Covid -  and then there are all these competing sub-narratives bubbling below the surface. If you think that each narrative is on something like a wave, and you know where we are on each wave, you can try to spot changing points. 

Part of my edge  comes from having built up a big network. Today I was saying something about USDCAD and literally everyone on my list was telling me that I was wrong. That response provides a lot of value as it helps me understand what the rest of the market expects and is pricing in. If I’m right, I know they’re all going to have to follow because none of them have it on already.

I wouldn’t prescribe this style of trading for everyone. It works for me because I’m naturally curious and enjoy constantly reading and learning. One thing that really doesn’t work is someone trying to just come in and copy what someone else does, without trying to find something that suits their personality. That never works in my experience.

&amp;#x200B;

## So do you view this as a Keynesian beauty parade? Meaning that it is not about which narrative you personally think is right but you’re looking for the narrative that the market is going to embrace, even if you personally disagree with it.

Yes. That is so important. Look at the central banks.

So many hedge fund and bank guys I know say things like “This is bullshit. They shouldn’t be doing this.” I think to myself, well, okay but you should just trade this thing based on what you think they *will* do, not what they *should* do.

It comes back to that old question: Do you want to be right or do you want to make money? As a trader, I want to make money.

&amp;#x200B;

## You make a related point in your book. IQ or intelligence generally is only important up to a point. What matters for trading success is what you call RQ or rationality.

Intelligent people still have all sorts of irrational, compulsive behavioural biases. Smart people do stupid things. 

Having worked with and trained tens upon tens of traders, I find rationality a better predictor of trading success than raw intelligence.

There’s a minimum bar of intelligence, in my view. Not just anyone can do it. I think having good intuition for basic math helps. The ability to absorb and process new information quickly is important, too.

However, once you get to a basic level of understanding of markets, the battles become mostly internal. Look at what we just discussed for example on the central bank policies: trading what you think they will do rather than what you’d like them to do.

The particular challenge is different for everyone. For me, over-trading or taking too much risk are typically the biases I have to guard against. For many people, the opposite is true: they talk all day but feel uncomfortable taking risk.

If you are purely rational then you should just follow a system. You define how much risk you should be taking for a given scenario and the trick is to just be a robot and follow system you've designed, regardless of what you feel internally.

&amp;#x200B;

## Going back to the price and narrative point. If the narrative is shifting, how come the price does not adjust immediately? You are suggesting you are surfing it and there’s some kind of lead-lag effect.

Well, narrative does drive price … but price can also drive narrative. Many people get more bullish the higher the price goes, for example.

Going back to the question, though, as a trader you have to get over the idea that the market price is always efficient and the price is always right. At times it is clearly wrong and adjusts. If it was always right you’d not make any money.

Some of the best trades I ever had were calling bullshit on the market. Especially if you can explain clearly and compellingly why other participants are getting wrong. You’ve seen something you’re confident they’ve just interpreted incorrectly or missed.

The problem is that doing this is psychologically hard. You have to bet against the crowd and most people don’t feel comfortable doing that.

&amp;#x200B;

[Brent argues in his book \(Alpha Trader; p165\) that traders often place too much faith in simple indicators. Would you rather be long or short these assets? How strong is your view? You might be surprised to find that these charts were randomly generated in Excel. It is hard - but important - not to get sucked in by a pretty chart.](https://preview.redd.it/4i4p64g86c381.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b8ffb413043cee9a0e243f6534de5664ffaae34d)

&amp;#x200B;

## A lot of retail traders use technical analysis for trade signals. How do you use it?

The more time you spend in markets, the more you realise that it isn’t as easy as the dream of just drawing lines on a chart and trading around those.

There have been a bunch of studies and technical analysis does not work as a forecasting tool. The various patterns like head and shoulders have no predictive power. However, there’s also an interesting result that traders who use technical analysis seem to do better than ones who don’t. So what gives?

To me it intuitively makes sense. The ones using technical analysis are probably using it for risk management. They have a price at which they know they should reassess and get out. The disciplined risk management is the edge.

I like really simple stuff like horizontal lines for resistance and support. As a market maker you get to see why that works. There’s maybe just some huge client buying order at a given price.  Whenever the price goes down there, the order kicks in and the price bounces a little.

I do like using technical analysis and the charts for picking my stop levels and risk management purposes. However, I’m never entering a trade purely because some indicator pops up. 

You’ve always got to think about the context. Imagine some indicator is showing up crazy overbought in equities but the Fed just announced QE. You obviously don’t want to fade that move - the buying is not going to stop.

&amp;#x200B;

## In the book you talk about Turnaround Tuesday. This is a nice example of a small edge you've collected. What is it?

There’s a pattern in which stocks tend to rip higher on Tuesday if they sold off the Friday and Monday before. You can see why it happens. 

When the news is bad, traders get nervous into the weekend and sell some of their holdings on Friday. On Monday they read more about the big scary thing and that scares them into selling more. Other players are drawn in due to the downward momentum. Then on Tuesday there’s no one left to sell and weak-hand shorts get squeezed.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If you build a systematic strategy, the high Sharpe often comes from a combined portfolio of simple strategies that are individually quite low Sharpe. That is pretty similar to what I try to do.

There are lots of little inputs that in aggregate add up. It goes back to my technical analysis approach. I’ll never just go long because of a chart but it might be a supporting input. I’m looking for a number of things to line up:

* Fundamental catalyst e.g. news or economic event
* New narrative established
* Cross-market analysis is supportive
* Positioning looks reasonable
* Defined entry/exit points on the charts

Well, if the chart just broke through an all-time high, I guess I would like it even more. If it fits with the turnaround Tuesday pattern then even better. All these micro edges add up.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[Here is an example of a cross-market chart \(not from Brent\). We can see GBPUSD overlaid with the interest rate differential between UK and US 2-year bonds. When related markets have started to move but your traded market has not, this might lend weight to a trading thesis.](https://preview.redd.it/iwxwe9xc6c381.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=061e7887a96395154a4a1fc2f4f55767122f78b9)

&amp;#x200B;

## You are big on understanding your own personality and building systems to help keep you rational. Can you give an example?

If you know you are prone to over-trading then an example would be to add some friction. Maybe you have to fill out a trade diary before putting risk on. Anything that adds some friction.

When I worked at Citi they had a mobile trading app. Back then, that was unusual. You normally had to log into Bloomberg or call someone to trade when it was out of hours. Unsurprisingly I ended up trading way more overnight than I had anywhere else. Once I realised what was happening I deleted the app from my phone.

&amp;#x200B;

## You are also an advocate of adjusting PNL stops based on your personal state of mind?

At a bank you learn this early on. Say you go out the night before Non Farm Payrolls then you tend to be a bit sloppy the next day. That affects performance.

On my morning checklist I have a mood meter,  just 1-10. If I’m below five I tend not to take much risk. I think you can accurately rate your own mood at the start of the day.

Imagine a situation when a family number is really ill. You aren’t going to be able to concentrate with something so existential going on. The PNL numbers on the screen just won’t mean as much and you’ll get sloppy and be less focused.

&amp;#x200B;

##  How long do you typically hold risk for?

The range is pretty wide but let’s say 12 hours to three days. That would cover most trades. People often find this surprising because the themes I talk and write about are so macro and big picture.

However, I might take the same position four times in a row. So I actually could end up being core long or short something over a longer time horizon. 

&amp;#x200B;

## You talk about the right level of risk seeking for a successful trader. How do you view that?

Sure. You need to be risk-seeking enough to seize opportunities and place trades. However, not so risk-seeking that you are behaving like a gambler chasing a thrill.

On a scale of 1-10, where traders self-evaluate their risk seeking nature, I've found that that the best traders often score themselves 7.5-8.

As a manager I always found people who were too risk-seeking easier to manage. In that situation you can just set limits. You cannot lose more than $200k a day or $500k a week. If they don’t respect those they just won’t last. People who are risk-averse are harder to manage.

There are two types of risk averse traders: one just won’t put the risk on ; the other one puts it on but is always looking for excuses to cut the risk near immediately. Here I would use rules again. Minimum trade amounts and then some defined prices for when you can close the position. 

In my view all good risk management practices are transparent and rules-based. You don’t want your traders having to second-guess where their PNL stop is.

&amp;#x200B;

## You had a nice anecdote in the book about a guy using post-it notes to keep himself on the right track.

Yeah that was cool to see. It was a really big macro hedge fund guy. A bunch of regulatory rules in the equity markets had changed recently: no mark-to-market, changes to shorting and so on. 

He told me the conditions are now such that anyone who tries to go short will get killed. I know in my heart and in my mind this is true for the next few years. To save myself the pain I’m just never going short in the next two years.

Anyway, he stuck a post-it with “Long or flat” on his monitor to ensure he avoided the temptation to sell in what he felt could only be a bull market. Turned out to be a great call.

&amp;#x200B;

## You are an advocate of trading plans but in particular post hoc reviews of your performance. Do you still do it?

The hard thing is that you can be fooled by randomness. Maybe you notice you never make money in USDJPY but then the reason is simply that it hasn’t moved in ages.

However, I’ve noticed some amazing stuff from reviewing my performance. A lot of the time it tells you things you already know deep down. However, seeing the hard data really makes it hit home.

Maybe you make money in the mornings and give it back in the afternoons. That’s a simple thing to test and you can make a simple change to fix it. If you then see in the data that the difference between doing it or not is $2 million a year in PNL, you are going to make that change and become a better trader.

&amp;#x200B;

## What would be your advice to a new independent trader?

If you boil down all the mistakes I’ve made and which I’ve seen other people make then it is probably this: be adaptable and be humble.

It is really hard to survive as a trader over the long-run. You have to adapt and be humble enough to learn and recognise when something has changed and you’re wrong.",finance

personalfinance,HELOC or save? Decent at investments but not return of investment on property.,"So  here's my situation... I'm on the cusp of closing on a HELOC which is about 82% of my equity for my house.  The HELOC interest rate and APR are the same rate because of no fees at  5.5%. I got the house in a foreclosure for 60,000 and only owe about 27,000 on the remainder of the mortgage. My interest rate on my mortgage is a fixed 3.25% and I've been paying almost $600 more on my principal every month so about $1,000 every month.  I have a car payment that I'll finish up with in 6 months and plan to roll over the money I was using to spend on that every month into my mortgage. I'll end up putting about $1,500 a month towards my house to accelerate the payments. My plan is to have it paid off in the next 3 years but here's where my predicament is. The house needs a lot of work. I need a new roof which I'm actually in talks with a contractor right now. It's about 13,000 for the whole thing. I need new siding, windows, carpet, cabinets among other small things that need fixed. Would it make more sense to get the roof fixed immediately, pay off the rest of the house,  and then start saving up for the repairs and cosmetic fixes or would it make more sense to close on the line of credit and just pay both of them? In parallel. I feel like the higher interest rate would cut into my overall investment. I have no plans of moving anytime soon so that's not a factor. Any input would be appreciated.

TLDR :  not sure if I should pick between a HELOC or saving money up. Very little debt and nothing in need of immediate repair. Higher interest rate on HELOC compared to mortgage which will be paid off very soon. What should I do?",finance
personalfinance,Student Loans - Weird Scenario,"I see there have been a ton of posts regarding student loans and how to pay them off properly. I’ve failed to find a scenario that is similar to mine, so I figured I’d ask for advice:

* Loan B: $5,238 - 4.290% Interest;
* Loan C: $2,116 - 4.290% Interest;
* Loan D: $5,206 - 3.760% Interest;
* Loan E: $7,010 - 3.760% Interest;
* Loan F: $27,203 - 6.080% Interest;

personalfinance,"Better to aggro-payoff student loans to fast-track becoming debt-free, or gradually payoff to aggro-invest?","**TL;DR - Is now a smart time to aggro-payoff student loans to potentially wipe them out before turning 30?**

Hey y'all - I popped this into the weekly question thread yesterday, but just wanted to see if I could get a greater round of opinions.

I'm 28(M) who's been working in the entertainment industry with a solid full-time gig since moving to NYC 6 years ago. Just got a recent promotion/raise that puts my income at an $85k salary in addition to a usual 10-15% bonus every year, putting my total compensation roughly at $95k + benefits.

Currently have $33k in my individual Fidelity portfolio as well as $35k in my 401k, plus another $10k in a restricted stock plan through my job.

I have $26k in my savings, which is about $6k in excess of my ""do not go below this line in case of emergency"" number which accounts for the potential of being out-of-work for a year. In the past couple of years, I've made an effort to take $10k out of my savings whenever it's been in excess to toss into stocks just to flesh out my portfolio.

My main question: By the end of this year, I will have $20k remaining in private student loans, which I've been paying off monthly at a fairly aggressive $560 per month since refinancing for a 5.25% interest rate. I've recently been torn between just continuing on with monthly payments, or if it might make more sense to throw $10k at them at the top of the year rather than throwing it in the market so as to make my goal of paying off all student loans before I turn 30.

30's a relatively arbitrary number for a goal, but since I have some late-20s-adult-thoughts looming (the likelihood of marrying my longterm partner, wanting to own a home, etc.), I just wonder if paying off the rest of my loans in a couple more lump sums (and letting my portfolio sit for a while) will make more sense than gradually paying them off but still engaging in the market.

CryptoCurrency,Macro Market DD for you Smooth Brains,"(Disclaimer: This is not financial advice and is all my own personal opinion…so I may be wrong lol)

If you’re wondering what’s going on with crypto right now, I’ll tell you what’s happening!

Everything else is bring us down!

To start, 3 days ago, US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell announced that during the upcoming December Fed meeting, the Fed will be discussing speeding up Quantitative Easing tapering and to face the reality that the inflation that we are seeing may not actually be transitory. All of this basically means that there is a good chance that we will see interest rates increase sooner than originally projected, which will be bad for risk-on assets (i.e. Tech stocks and crypto).

At around the same time, news of the Omicron variant started to takeover the media, further shaking up the markets. The new variant basically increases economic uncertainty and is a possible factor to limit economic growth if countries begin to reinstate Covid restrictions. Smooth brain investors have begun selling investments fearing another Covid crash and are instead putting this money into dumb stuff like fiat savings accounts that earn less than inflation or boomer Gold.

To end it, the main reason why we’re dropping today specifically, is mostly due to the US job growth report that was released about an hour ago at the time of this post. Many politicians and analysts were optimistic about the upcoming report and were only let down to see the numbers miss projections. Another possible indicator that overall economic growth is stalling. (Tip: In the mid to long term it’ll be smart to watch growth and inflation closely. If we see slow growth, coupled with high inflation, we’ll be in a stagflation which is probably the worst case scenario for the economy.)

All in all, everything affecting crypto are all outside factors. None of these changing the value proposition of why crypto is fundamentally a great asset to be invested in. It is and will continue to be the fastest growing asset class for at least the next 5-10 years. Don’t listen to some of the people here, if you are invested in crypto today, YOU ARE EARLY!

Just be weary of the Stagflation Boogey Man that’s lurking in the shadows in the next 1-2 years.

solar,"Going solar and asking for advice, NY state mid-Hudson area","Hello,

We just bought a 2,700 sq ft newly constructed house in the mid-Hudson area in New York state.  Central Hudson is our energy provider and we are getting sticker shock on how much electricity costs (moved from Manhattan where cost is much lower).  I'm exploring the technology and the financing options and hoping I can get some advice and pointers here.

**Vendors**

I started out by reaching out to SunPower and one of our neighbors is going through a 3rd party installer (PlugPV for those that are interested) and I have a quote from them as well.  SunPower has their own panels and PlugPV sells the Q-Cells.

**Tech/capacity**

Since we only moved in 5 months ago there is no 12 months period to get an accurate utilization, but it looks like we're looking for a 10k kW capacity.  CenHud does have 1:1 net metering but I would like to keep the capacity closer to what we are using but would like to hear some thoughts around that.

**Financing**

This is the part where I feel like I am all over the place.  I understand that the cash option will take the dealer fees out of the equation.  Is that the common consensus for someone that is looking to finance the panels?  We are looking at financing as ""compare our monthly loan payments vs CenHud bill"" perspective so we're not looking to pay off the panel ASAP, especially if the rate is attractive.  We keep getting the ""0.99%"" loan rate but I am starting to figure out that option always include the hidden dealer fees built in and I think I will want to avoid that.  One of the vendors is putting their cash proposal together with an EFS loan.  What are thoughts around that, or should I explore more HELOC-type loans with local credit union?

**ITC**

As I understand it, there are three pieces of the benefits: state (5k), federal (26%), and a NYSERDA federal grant.  Regarding the state/federal tax credits, is there a maximum cap I receive per year?  Or do I get the credits back and can have that applied directly against the loan or is it a lot more complicated than that?

personalfinance,Does anyone have experience mailing physical share certificates?,"I have - unfortunately - found myself holding physical share certificates for a major blue chip stock.

My brokerage has finally figured out how to convert it to electronic form and has asked me to post the certificate, unendorsed and along with some forms to their processing center.  However, I have been led to believe that an unendorsed certificate is a negotiable instrument, which is essentially equivalent to cash or an unsigned check, and therefore no major mail carrier will accept it.

Does anyone have experience with this?  Is the brokerage right that this is a reasonable thing to do, or are UPS/FedEx right that this is something that cannot be mailed?  I've had valuable packages lost/destroyed with UPS before, so the idea of sending something that might be akin to cash through the mail is incredibly unappealing.

personalfinance,Paying Canadian Taxes in Canada on Foreign Income from another country (Spousal Support),"Was wondering if any Canadians here have had any experience getting spousal support from another country? Or just any experience with taxable foreign income I suppose.

My scenario is that my Canadian ex-husband will continue to live and work in the US and the US funds will be deposited into my US account, in the US. I may be returning to Canada (I am also Canadian) but I may travel and continue to be homeless for awhile.

I am hoping not to transfer any of that money to Canada and keep it all in the US and earn my own money again Canada but that might take awhile and I may have to - but as far as foreign income tax reporting is concerned I don't know that it makes a difference anyway... think it needs to be reported whether the money leaves the US or not.

I called the Canada Revenue Agency and they escalated it to get the info. for me because the agent couldn't find it and said they'd get back to me in 3-5 business days.

I also didn't do my taxes in the US this year because my husband always filed jointly and several accountants in California told me I had no income to report (spousal support is not taxable)... my dad was sick and I left the country for awhile, so that was the only thing on my mind but then he unexpectedly died. So, I have time to focus on figuring all of this out now. It's federally not deductible for him or reportable for me, but apparently it is in California and now I'm extra confused because I spoke to several accountants in California around tax time who told me I didn't have to file because I had no income.

I'm not sure who to even consult about this when CRA couldn't even help me.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, December 3, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, December 3, 2021**

Stocks sank today to end the week lower, with technology and growth stocks cratering as market participants digested further updates regarding the Omicron variant and recent marks made by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, alongside the Labor Department’s November jobs report. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the week -1.2% lower, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) slid -2.6% and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell -1.83%. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed the week a whopping -5.24% lower. 

**Notable Numbers Today**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -0.87%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -1.74%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.11%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -2.05%
* VIX: +8.71%
* NVIDIA: -4.46%
* Tesla (TSLA): -6.42%
* DocuSign (DOCU): -42.22%
* Asana (ASAN): -26.40%
* Marvell Tech (MRVL): +17.70%

Development surrounding the new Omicron variant remains front and center of the market’s attention. So far, at least five US states have reported at least one case of the variant and over three dozen countries globally. A new report by the World Health Organization (WHO) has so far seen “a suggestion that there is increased transmissibility” of the Omicron variant. However, the report notes that it is still too soon and not enough data is available to make any conclusions yet. 

Vaccine makers released new, less optimistic commentary regarding how effective existing vaccines are against the new Omicron variant. Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said their current vaccine would likely see a “material drop” in effectiveness against the Omicron variant. 

He said, “There is no world, I think, where \[the effectiveness\] is the same level we had with \[the\] Delta \[variant\]. I think it’s going to be a material drop. I just don’t know how much because we need to wait for the data. But all the scientists I’ve talked to . . . are like, ‘This is not going to be good’.”

[https://www.ft.com/content/27def1b9-b9c8-47a5-8e06-72e432e0838f](https://www.ft.com/content/27def1b9-b9c8-47a5-8e06-72e432e0838f)

Moreover, the market move today coincides with the release of the Labor Department’s November job report, which showed a disappointing hiring rate even as the unemployment rate fell to a fresh pandemic-era low. Here are the numbers

* Payroll Gains: +210,000 vs +550,000 expected
* Unemployment Rate: 4.2% vs 4.6% in October

Jim Smiegiel, Chief Investment Officer at SEI Investments, said “The markets ... have been pricing in, really, a worst-case scenario. I think the market is now switching gears a little bit and perhaps lessening the intensity of the potential for negative outcomes. The big issue still remains more about the world government's reaction to the variant and what that means from a lockdown perspective. And that's what the market is still kind of struggling with at this stage."" 

J. Pow’s latest remarks before the Senate Banking Committee further spooked the markets, after he said he would back off from using the word “transitory” to describe rising inflation. This is very notable because the Central bank has been using the T-word since the beginning of the year, when it warned that steep differences in year-over-year comparisons and supply-chain bottlenecks would lead to elevated inflation. 

Powell said, ““We tend to use \[the word transitory\] to mean that it won’t leave a permanent mark in the form of higher inflation. I think it’s probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean.”

Moreover, Powell suggested the Central Bank was considering completing its asset purchase taper “a few months sooner” than previously telegraphed. Market participants expected a more supportive stance, especially with the new COVID variant, but instead Powell suggested his priority was now on curbing higher than expected inflation. 

Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment, said “Chairman Powell’s commentary course-corrected the view on inflation and the potential need for quicker policy adjustment. The reality is hotter inflation coupled with a strong economic backdrop could end the Fed’s bond-buying program as early as the first quarter of next year. Ultimately, the transitory view on inflation has officially come to an end as Powell’s comments reinforced the notion that elevated prices are likely to persist well into next year. With potential changes in policy on the horizon, market participants should expect additional market volatility in this uncharted territory."" 

On a personal note, I am taking this opportunity to do some very small dip-buying (no more than ¼ position). As usual, I believe the market is overreacting (as it tends to do). While it is important to acknowledge the risks present in the market and be prepared to act if they arise, I personally believe Omicron fears are overblown (I remember we had the same song and dance when Delta was first discovered). More concerning is the Fed’s change in attitude towards inflation. That said, the only thing discussed so far has been accelerating the timeline for tapering asset purchases. As I have said for months at this point, I am not worried about tapering. If/when the Fed begins discussing raising interest rates, then I will step back and reassess. 

**Highlights**

* Shares of DocuSign (DOCU) cratered more than 40% after posting disappointing earnings and lowering guidance. Like Zoom (ZM), Teladoc (TDOC), and Peloton (PTON) before, this is the latest COVID stock to crater in value. 
* Shares of Chinese ride-hailing company DIDI gapped down once again after announcing plans to delist from the New York Stock Exchange amid regulatory pressures from the Chinese government. This is one of the most spectacular IPO failures I have ever seen and probably just the beginning. I’m glad I divested all my shares in Chinese companies, I wouldn’t trust a single dollar of mine in that environment. At this point, I’m expecting Alibaba (BABA) to delist at some point. 
* As a reminder, a lot of times, when you buy Chinese stock, you aren’t really buying a share of the company, usually you are being what is called an American Depositary Receipt, which is basically just a contract representing a number of shares, not an actual piece of the company
* The Federal Trade Commission sued NVIDIA (NDA) to block the proposed $40 billion acquisition of Arm. Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like the deal will go through given all the regulatory backlash in both the US, UK and EU. Sad for me, NVIDIA is my favorite stock in the market. 
* Ford Motor (F) expects to be the world's second largest electric vehicle manufacturer within two years, with annual production capacity of nearly 600,000, according to Lisa Drake, the Chief Operating Officer. 
* Shares of sport-betting company DraftKings (DKNG) sank to 52-week lows, losing more than 50% of its value in the last three months. Penn National Gaming (PENN) is following a similar trend. 
* Cathie Wood’s flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) hit a 52-week low today, after falling 25% in the month amid the broad tech-selloff. 
* Shares of Grab (GRAB), the largest ride-hailing and digital payment solution in Southeast Asia, failed spectacularly in its first day of trading following the largest ever merger, which valued the company at over $40 billion. Has not been a good week for foreign stocks.  
* Qualcomm (QCOM) on Wednesday released a new chip designed for gaming-specific handheld devices offering 5G connectivity, a potential new mobile platform for video gamers offering more flexibility to play streaming games on the go. QCOM said it partnered with hardware company Razer to create an initial test device for gamers.

personalfinance,Thinking about taking a loan but I have no clue how it works,"Hi, I'm gonna be brief in introduction and get to the point asap.
What you should know about me is I'm 21 and just got my first job. My wage is about 1k a month or  cca.12k anually (which is a respectable wage wherever I live at).

Now I'm starting to think about taking a loan and buying an appartment of my own. The amount I'd be able to get is about 43-49k (depending on bank that is). The interest rate is about 2% +/- 0.2% depending on whether I take a fixed loan (interest rate stays the same thruought the duration of loan but i get less money upfront) or I take a variable loan which does not have a fixed interest rate.

I did the maths allbeit really rough and the monthly fee of paying off the debt would be very similar to the rent that im paying off now. We're talking about 50€ possibly even less.

The main thing I'm here for however, is an advice. In your oppinion is it better to take a loan and buy an apartment or not take a loan and dont buy it. With the prices skyrocketing in recent years I think it would be a good idea. But then again i have slightly less than zero experience in money management, especially long term. 

Lastly, I'd like to thank all of you for any advice as it does mean a lot to me. I hope I wasn't too formal...thanks again :)",finance
CryptoCurrency,I’m not the brightest nor a Crypto expert but I’m a Economics Student and two things are about to happen…,"The two scenarios part on the worst case Omicron is here to fuck us ALL. There’s already PLENTY of lockdowns in Europe, Middle East and South Africa. There’s already Omicron cases in the US, and depending on how it develops (meaning total of ICUs needed again) we could see another lockdown soon.

1st is market plummets, inflation is at an ATH, all we need for everything to crash is one lockdown in the US and it all goes to shit,if that happens we are fucked and we could see BTC down to the 8K-10K range just like last year.


2nd scenario is it all plummets, we need lockdowns and with all this inflation and federal crisis people start seeing the real value in Crypto (mainly in BTC), imagine against a worldwide crisis we all agree the best way to protect our assets is Bitcoin, shit could go wild.

Me personally I think the first is more likely and I’m almost 100% sure going to happen, I took 75% of my portfolio and I’m holding in my bank account waiting for the next big crash, no I’m not a bear, but I think right now the risk is greater than the opportunity, btc won’t reach more than 75k EOY, that’s like 20% I might miss, but you’re looking at a possible 30-70% loss that’s more likely at the moment than 75k 

I want to hear your opinions, as I said I’m not an expert or nothing like that, but me personally this is way over my risk tolerance I see a greater opportunity pulling out, but that’s me, what about yourselves I wanna know!

CryptoCurrency,Beginner assistance - long-term crypto investing,"I'm planning to invest a small amount ($200 - $500) each month in crypto to hold for a long-term investment. I'll probably do some kind of split between BitCoin and Ethereum initially. I reviewed a lot of things, but there's so much information out there and I have some questions.

**My risk tolerance is fairly low - is a crypto interest account right for me?** 

I'm considering crypto interest accounts with BlockFi, Celsius, or Ledn. I see concerns with all of them: legal issues, lowering interest rates, withdrawal difficulty, and that Ledn is not US-based. 4-7% interest is pretty tempting, but I don't know if it's worth the risk for long-term holding. 

**For those using crypto interest accounts, do you buy on other exchanges like Binance and then transfer to your interest account?**

I'm concerned about the purchase spread on platforms like BlockFi, but I don't know if it's worth the transfer fees to buy on a different platform. 

**For those who can't tolerate the risk of interest accounts, what's the best place to store crypto long-term?**

I've seen a lot of recommendations that cold storage is the ""safest,"" but I don't know how practical that is for someone investing a small amount each month, at least initially. Do a lot of people just store their crypto on places like CoinBase? Is there a difference in risk between storing crypto on CoinBase vs other exchanges like Binance? 

**How do you buy and sell things with crypto?**

Can you only do this with a ""hot wallet?"" So the process would be you withdraw from your exchange account to your digital ""hot wallet,"" use the hot wallet to send or receive crypto, and then transfer back to your exchange account to hold or sell for USD, right?",cryptocurrency

# Crypto Market Insight: Don’t fall for FUD  

It’s a sea of red on the charts but hope remains in the form of strong buying at resistance levels. The Bitcoin bull market trendline has been broken with today’s candles close at 53k. This event will mark the first close below this important trendline. Price is coming down to test a strong resistance level between 52.5k and 54K indicated on the chart below. 

&amp;#x200B;

[BTC\/USD 1D](https://preview.redd.it/akw0kwpbmf381.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=383787bf4d8fbff0c54a975962df5f1199fedb1a)

There are three possibilities that may occur here. 

1. Over the weekend price may rebound quickly enough to jump back into trend. 

2. Price could begin testing this resistance various times over the next week/s, setting bitcoin in a range. 

3. Prices break below the resistance to go test the next level at 50k. 

Today’s volume isn’t indicating a lot of strength which will favor a rebound off the resistance. The pin-bar candle noted on the 4-hour chart is reaffirming the strength of the resistance. 

&amp;#x200B;

Funding rates are telling us that a cascade of selloffs will not occur due to liquidations in the derivatives. Volatility is increasing with this move and the consolidation we hoped for didn’t occur today. The down move is due to current macro climate. (Omnicron and FED-tapering news) 

**Stock Market**

Volume continues to be strong in stock market sell-off and yesterday’s rebound was short-lived. The topic of decoupling from stocks will have to be saved for another day. This market is dragging crypto with it. Stock market funds are moving into bonds out of fear. The VIX (Volatility Index) and fear gauge hit a new high of 35.32. Monday will tell us a lot about if this sell-off will continue in stocks. 

**Wrap-up**

Macroeconomic FUD is brining prices down, which is an emotional rection of the market. The current sentiment can dissipate quickly, and this would turn things around. There is little evidence of a major sell-off in crypto, so it’s recommended that you keep on hodling, watch the weekend prices and hope FUD dies down on Monday.

# NEWBIES’ lesson of the day

**Controlling the fear during sell offs**

Cryptocurrencies are very volatile in nature and watching your money go down 10% in one day can be a scary event. You must remember that you can’t have 300% gains in a market without occasional 30-75% drawdowns. The price you pay for those gains is paid in resilience and patience. The last thing you want to do is to panic and sell to the traders that take advantage of fear in the markets. 

You must do your due diligence and research the projects you are putting your money into. If you truly believe in the technology and project, then holding on to losing positions is a lot easier. This is another reason not to invest heavily into meme coins. Read the news and see how much money is being invested into this market daily and see the hundreds of companies and banks maneuvering to get a piece of the pie. Crypto is here to stay. 

Get in the habit of selling when everyone is euphoric, which is incredibly hard. And buying when everyone else is fearful. Use the tools around you to help give you an edge. This is a large-scale game where others are trying to buy your investments at a lower price than you paid for it, don’t let have it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Have a great weekend everyone and remember to stack those sats!

CryptoCurrency,"Crypto , Fed fund rate and risk assets","I am not sure where the idea of crypto is inflation hedge comes from but here is great post on it :

https://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2021/11/10/bitcoin-and-inflation/


I agree with it , I get idea behind crypto is hedge but I am not convinced , biggest runs of btc were during loose monetary policy and easy money which  might be coming to the end with Fed saying they might consider withdrawal of bond buying faster to fight inflation 

As the result of Fed comment growth stocks and over all market been completely killed with some hot stocks down as much as 75%!( Zillow, peloton etc ) , it’s a serious carnage 

Marco funds and crypto : everyone loves saying “ can’t wait for mass adoption and institutional investors” well they are in now , not geeks in basement buying pizza , and macro funds see crypto as risk on asset no matter what ppl on internet claim about “ store of value “ bla bla , stores of value don’t go down 10% in 24 hr . You wanted institutional investors , accept that it’s more correlated with markets and macro trends 

Fed is between rock and hard place , on one hand you have obviously new variants risk and no data yet how bad it can be , on other CPI readings screaming get stimulus out of system we overheating , we shall see how they will react 

My personal thoughts :

Raising Fed fund rate to fight inflation lowers valuation of assets Because now money has a price , it always hits high valuation stocks and in my opinion alt coins ( they area crypto growth stocks , networks with future use and users paying gas fees etc ) Because future growth has to be discounted by selling n DCF models 

My plans :

Crypto is around 7% I think of my portfolio, will still buy monthly and keep allocation under 10%, it’s exciting but risky , there is zero guarantee any bull cases will work out how people in this sub claim and upvote , BTC can go sideways for years , ETH 2.0 can never come or fail , you can overpay for any project and even if it will deliver price of token might stay same , keep this risks in mind and try to have a balance in your financial plan , diversification is only free lunch in investing",cryptocurrency

I have an unsecured line of credit from TD bank. I was thinking about applying for a secured one (and use my condo as collateral) to save on interest rate.

Anyone knows if the interest rate is actually worth doing this?

Right now my interest rate plus premium is around 9.5% ( with unsecured line of credit).

investing,any flaws in this plan? loan on my 401k,"recently learned A. i could take loans on 401k, and B. discovered waht I bonds are

I bonds = protects buying power by providing an interest rate based on the last 6 months inflation, the current rate on i-bonds is 7.12% and get adjusted every 6 months, i understand the number could go down on me but with how things are going i dont think its likely inflation is going to slow down in the next bit, and even if it does i wont actually lose money unless the rate becomes sub .5% which isn't going to happen. maximum amount you can own is 10k (more if you get paper bonds through your tax return but that's another discussion)

my 401k is through fidelity, i can take out loan with a 5.25% interest rate for 12 to 60 months and from what I understand the interest paid actually goes into my 401k, so its technically not really a fee just mandatory additional deposit into my savings, they DO mention a 50 dollar setup fee when I use their loan calculator though.

plan:

1. take out loan on 401k for 12 months
2. invest the loan into a 12 month ibond
3. pay the bi-monthly loan payments, reimburse myself when the I-bond matures in 12 months

Expected results (Using current I-bond rate):

$712 total earnings from I-bond

$525 of that will be put into the 401k (the interest paid on the loan)

\-$50 dollar loan fee

summary: extra $525 invested into my 401k, $137 in pocket. Total profit of $662 with 0% risk (i will easily cover the loans monthly bill)

I understand this isn't much but I like to maximize my financial opportunities

Questions:

1. how does paying loans early work? could I do the max timeframe on the 401k loan (60 months) but pay it in full at the 12 month mark when the I-bond matures? I'd like to minimize the monthly payments as much as possible but I don't know if this has a downside or can even be done
2. am i right that the 5.25% interest on the fidelity loan goes into my 401k and thus is really just more savings for me as im not actually losing money by paying it?",finance

CryptoCurrency,"My take on this dip is that we are seeing a classic case of ""self unfulfilling prophecy"".","People have been going on about this magic 100k by December ever since February and now that we are in December and nowhere near it, the hype turns into anxiety and holders become skittish.

I think our very slow November, paired with the odd curveball (Omicron, Evergrande, FED shenanigans, etc...) helped create a selling mood just waiting for a match to ignite a sell-off. I truly believe that our market runs on hype and the problem with this is that the 100k-by-december narrative just wasn't flying anymore, so it is completely understandable that people got insecure about their projections for bitcoin at this time of the year.

Even though I believe in lengthening cycle theory I did not expect it such a significant red candle. Hopefully we'll bounce back fast, but let that be a reminder that there is dark side to hype and moonshot predictions that is always worth considering: When they don't happen as predicted, they can be catastrophic.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,A Comprehensive Technical Analysis of the Economy and the Stock Market,"First, I want to say this relates to crypto in general because if assets really take a hit, assets across the board will have the same direction. It doesn't mean sell everything, it simply means start being more cautious, and have a decent cash:invested ratio.

Here's waht I have to say:

Hi everyone.

I wanted to make this post due to the obscene amount of ""buy the dip,"" ""what do i buy,"" and ""here's a list of what to buy "" posts; the greed in the air is absurd. The comments on every post, green or red day, have the current form: ""hmmmmm what are we buying? what's a good long-term buy?"" Few comments I see realize what's ahead. Pullbacks in the market are directly attributed to news as being a CAUSE not a CATALYST.

So, I would like to comment on the overall state of the market, where it's heading, and perhaps on the amount of different perspectives about the market sharply decreasing. It may be a lengthy post, but I heavily recommend you consider this point of view. Here, I present you with many charts supporting the fact that a major crash (not a pullback) is coming, and that ""buying the dips"" too early will erase the profits you obtained these past couple years.

I want to start off by showing you the [VIX chart](https://imgur.com/gB23ZTa) since the covid crash, it's a 30-day running volatility index. It's breaking out of the pattern that has formed since pandemic has begun. Now take a look at the zoomed out [VIX chart](https://imgur.com/uIwnFos), it'll give you an idea of what you would see on this chart in case the market gets into dangerous territory.

Moving onto the stock market, I'd like to show you some short and long-term patterns developing on indices, individual stocks, and the market as a whole.

First, here's the [SPY trend](https://imgur.com/xDRCcQv) that has developed since the pandemic begun. This pattern has not broken yet, but the momentum looks like it's moving into the dangerous sell area (below 0). I only show you this unbroken pattern so that you can carefully watch the development of the market. Now [zoom out](https://imgur.com/r3cu35o) to see the entirety of SPY's price action. The highlights and ratios are Fibonacci retracement ratios, they're simply mathematical ratios (developed from the Fibonacci sequence) that appear with a strangely-high frequency in nature, price movements of assets, and other areas of life. Anyway, I want to point out that the major major support that SPY has is at the price level of the 2000 and 2008 highs (somewhere around the $160ish area, a 65% pullback. That mark is the best case end-scenario for a market ""pullback""/""crash"" that we are looking at here, in my opinion. A smaller drop off sets the charts up for a larger drop later on, and a more violent drop (simply a retest of the 1994-2008 lows of SPY, i.e. $80ish) would still fit a ""very long term bullish american economy"" type of scenario (and is a very real possibility if fear overtakes folks enough).

Let's switch our attention to QQQ, the tech trust. Here's the entire price history of [QQQ](https://imgur.com/ylxodYD), in one chart. The case 1 support I have drawn up in the chart is very very likely not going to be the final bottom of the crash, but could very well be the relief area once things do start crashing. As you can see though, QQQ is in a parabolic state right now -- here the gains you miss out on by exiting early are the greatest, but the so is the risk of you staying in each one of those trades. As uncertainty grows, the investing and the gambling games start seeming more and more the same. Here's the [chart of TQQQ](https://imgur.com/VJGVdro). For those who do not know, it aims to reflect the daily returns on QQQ threefold. I saw many posts and comments saying they buy TQQQ on dips, and that TQQQ is up 20000% in a decade, so why wouldn't someone just buy TQQQ and wait. Please look up leveraged ETFs and try to understand that losses are amplified SIGNIFICANTLY in any of those types of ETFs, and they WILL get brought down painfully low during the incoming crash/pullback/whatever you want to call it.

It's very important to understand that price action is like the motion of a pendulum, it oscillates around a ""fair value/price"" (which also moves in a longer-term cycle); it's important to remember that the pendulum always eventually swings back to that ""fair"" value that noone technically knows for sure. What's also important is that swings do not ever stop at the actual fair value, they swing past with momentum, and the more violent the swing one way (regardless of whether it's up or down), the more violent the swing back will be.

Anyway, we can also go ahead and look at individual stocks. Let's take one of the strongest of them all, [GOOGL](https://imgur.com/uGlmzWr). Even this stock has had parabolic price action since becoming public. As you can see, even this strong stock has some room to drop off (perhaps the chart does imply this is one of those tickers that would do slightly better than the market in cases of a crash). The momentum on this has STARTED to slow down, but has not gone to the sale side of price action just yet, implying that we are starting to find the top, and slow down in the price discovery.

There's a point I also wanted to make about banking and financial institution stock tickers, as I hear the general way of reasoning here be something along the lines of ""interest rates will be going up, that directly benefits these institutions/companies."" While that line may be true, it's not the factor that most importantly decides which way the stock ticker will move. In the case of a crash/pullback, everything gets entangled. Specifically, we can look at [Bank of America](https://imgur.com/VWpn7Sq) as a good example here. This is one of the ""strong stock"" charts with the most concerning volume development, in my opinion. The absurd divergence has lasted well over a decade, and while BAC hasn't found it's very clear top/peak, we can see that that peak in price is nearby (if it hasn't already happened ofcourse, but I doubt it for this chart). I also am very weary of these types of banking stocks being around the peak prices of 1999-2008 era, combined with the volume divergence I was talking about, as well as the growing greed of everyday investors.

Alright, now I'd like to take a moment and direct your attention to the [DXY chart](https://imgur.com/oQs4R6W); this is the dollar currency index, it's basically the value of the US dollar, measured against a basket of other world currencies. The break above 93.5 on this chart is where we first saw the market pull back slightly more than was expected by the average trader. Long term, I see [two cases](https://imgur.com/QgglDU1) related to what happens to the US dollar. I won't comment on what would cause either of the cases; however, from the viewpoint of technical analysis, a major move is expected on this DXY chart in the coming years/decade. The FED has been printing money for almost a full year now, here's a [chart](https://imgur.com/ihobATQ) quantifying that printed amount. To add, here's a [picture](https://imgur.com/D7wT86L) of annual inflation reports each month, showing obviously-dangerous levels of inflation. I don't have much comment to make here, but do be aware of this information please.

As my final couple points, I want to emphasize that I see everyone's points and strategies getting more and more similar; it's incredibly dangerous to blindly buy the dip or follow the general public, consider revising the possible perspectives on this issue. As you see people's emotions swinging more and more wildly side to side, you should be getting more and more cautious about the state of the current markets.

PLEASE CONSIDER READING THIS: there's a book called ""a random walk down wall street."" In the first chapter, it outlines the major bubbles in the past couple centuries. It's worth a read. Highly recommend.

Edit: Please please please stop buying the current dip. And please remember to zoom out, and not follow the heard, but rather study it. I'd also like to add that if you REALLY zoom out, zoom out 300-400 years ago, this is the chart you will see.

[HERE](https://imgur.com/blUB5we) is a great chart that Robert Prechter put together (the guy behind Elliott Wave Theory). There is a video out there where he talks about what a Fibonacci pattern he notices in the market. Look it up if you are interested, I am not allowed to give you the link here.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: This is the time to be CAUTIOUS in the market, regardless of which market you are talking about. If you have unrealized profits on the table, consider securing a portion (perhaps a majority) of those profits. If you are facing a negative return on any position, do not close your phone or uninstall your app to simply wait for a year; you MUST reevaluate your positions, and adjust accordingly. Do not panic, but remember to stay weary of the ""heard"" mentality about markets -- the market always finds a way to humble its investors.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,USD Flash Surges Against Bitcoin.,"USD investors reacted strangely today, in a wild shake-up of investment strategy. This after the US Federal reserve conceded that the current inflation of the USD is non-transitory and will remain high for the coming year(s), with no options for fear of negative ramifications on the global Economy. 

To compound the strange overreaction of the USD investors, is that BTC is completely unaffected by the new Covid variant, and historical trends suggest an even greater adoption of BTC, and other cryptos preforming during pandemic recovery periods. 

Post analysis 🧐 of the USD surge shows that the USD was over bought, and likely will continue to devalue against BTC as the USD continues to inflate and is destabilized by international conditions such as the Omicron Covid Variant, and global military tensions with Russia and China.

Whales will try anything legal or illegal to make money off you. if you believe in the future of crypto keep DCAing and holding. There is no legitimate news that undermines cryptocurrencies and this dip is just a scare tactic to make you sell.

Now about what happend with the banks, 

[UBS, Barclays, RBS and HSBC](https://www.express.co.uk/finance/city/1530381/EU-fine-banks-barclays-hsbc-foreign-exchange-trading-cartel) were given a total fine of €261m (£222.01m) after deciding to settle the case while Credit Suisse was fined €83m (£70.6m). The European Commission's investigation revealed that some traders at the banks, involved in trading G10 currencies, had exchanged sensitive information and trading plans with each other. Using an online chatroom called **Sterling Lads,** they had also occasionally coordinated their trading strategies.  The sharing of information enabled them to make more informed decisions about when to buy or sell currencies and reduce risk compared to if they were operating alone. 

 It also allowed for collaboration on occasion such as the practice of standing down where one trader would hold off making a trade to avoid interfering with another trader. 

These colluding  happened between 2007 and 2013. But to the retail trader the message is clear, its not just enough that the big guys have nearly unlimited money they get at 0% interest rates, they will try any thing to make fools out of the small guy.

If this is happened with the big banks, it certainly happens with the big crypto traders. The advantages of such a cartel is far too lucrative to pass up.

CryptoCurrency,Now this is a dip!,"Yes finally a 25% dip, this is what we were waiting for! I will personally load up on some Bitcoin but first I want to give my 2 cents about the situation. 
Mr. Powell changed his mind about the inflation being transitory and adopted a more hawk-ish stance saying that he will increase the interest rates sooner. I feel like a lot of people used Bitcoin as a store of value and hedge against inflation as it’s supposed to be used and now people not fearing inflation that much need liquidity to either protect themselves against a market crash and a eventual margin call on their investments. 
Guys look at the FINRA statistics https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/advanced-investing/margin-statistics we are almost 1 Trillion dollars over leveraged! People will get liquidated left right and centre. There is a chance that a huge deleveraging is happening and we need to be prepared mentally for a possible even bigger crash maybe 40-50%. 
I can see people panicking already and for good reason. I have no idea how the markets are goin to react to this. But do I think that the bull run is over and we are headed for a bear market? Not until we break every support line. I feel like probably 39k is a huge mental support line, it is where we held last time and if we don’t well as some people are saying crypto is cancelled and we have to accept the fact that the bull run might be over and a bear market might take over but that doesn’t mean that we stop buying the dip!

personalfinance,Is it worth it to buy a house as a rental property and only break even?,"Hello!

This is simply a question for the future that I am curious about, not something I can expect to do anytime soon.

My questions is simply what my title says. Is it beneficial to buy a home as a rental property if you’re not going to make any profit and simply break even? 

For example buying a home for $400,000 here in SoCal will likely get you a monthly payment ange where from $1500 to $2000 depending on the down payment and interest rate of course. And then include other costs like HOA you can reasonably expect to pay around the same much monthly as you would charge to rent the place out. 

I’m 21 now and it’s very likely I’ll be in a position to do this in a couple years (if things go accordingly) and I wonder if it makes sense to go the buying house route to build equity or just have a very padded savings account. 

I don’t know much about this stuff right now so I appreciate any knowledge and insight.

Forex,Indices Report For The Week,"So due to quite a few requests I've decided do a brief breakdown of what's going on the indices market (nothing too serious and everything I discuss will be pretty surface level). I'll be discussing some technicals, some fundamentals, and just my general thoughts on the movements and various sectors which make up the 3 different indices that we go through today.

**What happened this week**

The beginning of this week was quite hectic since the markets was heavily driven by news events. So let's break it down day by day.

Monday: The markets were moving up after the initial shock factor of the Omicron variant had started to subside a bit

Tuesday: The CEO of Moderna came out and stated that the Moderna vaccine probably wouldn't be effective in combating against the Omicron variant. This led to some panic selling in the Dow and S&amp;P but the NASDAQ was able to stand it's ground since the tech sector has proven to be fairly resilient against the pandemic.

Later in the day Powell came out and said that the FED would potentially be looking to speed up tapering which caused the markets to sell off again.

Wednesday: First Omicron variant is confirmed to have been detected in the US causing a sell off in the back half of the NY session.

Thursday: Not much happened and we started pushing up again after the multiple drops we had in the week

Friday: NFP and unemployment numbers came out. NFP missed its mark again however we had better than expected unemployment numbers. There wasn't really a direct impact on the market however the good unemployment numbers act as an indicator for the FED to pull support which is also what was stated by FED's Bullard which caused the S&amp;P and NASDAQ to have a pretty big drop during the NY session due to Financials and Tech sectors while the Dow Jones remained fairly resilient as the Consumer Cyclical and Healthcare sectors remained fairly firm.

**US30**

[Daily](https://preview.redd.it/rzk5gnafvh381.png?width=1813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a087b1764b9db30fd30b05a61f7ba2e436ffd77)

Looking at the chart above you can see that we a very beautiful trend channel that's been in the making since around March. Before the selloff in US30 started we hit the top of the channel and bounced straight down. We took a pretty nice bounce off the bottom of the channel and this is where buyers may come in start a potential end of year rally. The point where buyers started to push up had aligned up with our 200 Day EMA as well so that's some extra confluence to remain bullish.

From the previous ATH we pulled back about 7.2% and right now I think that's going to be extent of this pullback and we won't see an actual correction this year. Next week will be the deciding factor in direction for the maybe next couple months. If buyers step in and are able to push the market up then we should see a new ATH in the coming weeks. If sellers step in next week and push the market below that October 1st low then an actual correction in US30 is a very likely possibility.

If you want to be long on the Dow Jones then it looks like you're going to have some very good opportunities coming in the next couple of days.

**NASDAQ 100**

Looking at our more tech heavy Nasdaq chart we can see that there's a pretty long channel in play that's been holding since about last November. Unlike our US30 chart we can see that the Nasdaq hasn't exactly found a solid bottom yet which could be an indication that there might be a bit of a rotation going on the stock markets where investors are starting to pull their money away from the tech sector and moving it to other areas. I believe that Nasdaq has a bit more downside to it and we may see buyers stepping in around the bottom of the trend channel. There's also the possibility that buyers could start stepping in around that 125 Day EMA since that Nasdaq has been taking support on it multiple times this year. Since the bottom of the trend channel and 125 Day EMA are so close together there's a very likely possibility that we'll come down and test them both before making our move to the upside.

It's hard to recommend being a buyer on this just yet as there isn't exactly enough evidence to suggest that we'll make a bounce here so I would recommend sitting on the sidelines for a bit longer. until we get enough confluence to start buying.

**S&amp;P 500**

Looking at the S&amp;P 500 we got another trend channel in play and it looks like we have a very clear intersection between the bottom of the channel and the 125 Day EMA which could act as a very good area to act as support if sellers want to keep bringing the market down a bit more. There's still a bit of downside left in my opinion but we should start to see buyers taking the market again fairly soon and pushing to new ATHs.

**Fear and Greed**

Looking at the Fear &amp; Greed index we can see that there's a lot of fear in the markets however that's a pretty good thing for those who want to buy into the markets since there's no better time to buy into the markets than when there's a lot of fear in the markets. The initial shock of the Omicron variant will start to subside over and we'll start to see fear wane from the markets which will help the markets begin their next leg up.

**Conclusion**

Yes, we did have a fairly red week in the markets last week but I don't think that it's any cause for any major concern since most of the drop were caused by news that came out throughout the week. Some people appear to think that we're going to have some sort of giant market crash but that probably won't come to fruition.

Omicron isn't a serious cause for concern yet since we don't have the data to suggest it's more serious in effect than other variants. Once we start getting the results of tests being performed then we can have a better understanding of just how worried about it we should be. Unless Omicron is extremely fatal then I highly doubt the US will go into another lockdown since that could actually end up severely crippling the economy since the FED would have to pick between either letting the markets drop hard or causing a giant surge of hyperinflation. Neither of the scenarios will end well so I think we'll try to avoid a lockdown at all costs.

The next big day on everybody's calendars is December 15th since we have two pretty big things on that day. We have the deadline for the debt ceiling and we have the FOMC statement. I'm fairly confident that we'll see a resolution to the debt ceiling right before that December 15th deadline so I'm not too worried about that impacting the markets too negatively. The FOMC meeting will be the wild card here since we've heard Powell say that he wants to continue supporting the economy but almost a day later he discusses speeding up the taper so we got some pretty mixed signals from him. He discussed speeding up the taper in front of a US Senate Committee so it's very possible he said that to play the political game or he might've actually meant. Either way December 15th is definitely a day that should be on everybody's radar.",finance
CryptoCurrency,This dip/crash is why we’re all in crypto,"Everyone in crypto is here in part, if not completely, for the gains.

We chose crypto because of the potential to make huge gains in a relatively short space of time compared to more traditional stocks and shares or banking interest rates.

We all naturally cheer when a coin moons 100% in a day. That’s what we’re here for. 

With that kind of positive jump we should expect equal or sometimes greater losses and that is also what we’re here for.

If you are new and just learning, learn the lesson quickly that things can change dramatically in an hour.

CryptoCurrency,"Most likely I’m wrong, but was institutionalized investing + major whales responsible for this correction?","Let me preface this by saying I don’t know jack shit about cryptocurrency and I’m a horrible investor given that my portfolio is very red at the moment. However this week, has been informative for me in learning about defi 2.0 - OlympusDao and TIME wonderland. Same thing with me opening a position with UST on Anchor Protocol 20% apy Earn.

While thinking about how Bitcoin broke the 21 week EMA and dropped below 52k, then shot down to 42k to only find legs at 48k a random thought popped up into my head. Why ?

The most surprising part of the crash was that it didn’t happen during normal business hours (when does it ever)
in America. It didn’t happen as US stocks have been going down during open/ after hours for the last 2-3 weeks. It didn’t happen as leaders of the crypto community like Sam Bankman Fried (founder of FTX/ Alameda Research) are going to meet with government regulatory board to m discuss stablecoins this month. Sure Crypto has been going down since November 9th but how did it lose 9-15 thousand dollars in a matter of hours/2 days?

 I’m just gonna throw this out there, I believe this was a deliberate sell off by institutionalized investors + major whales. The sell wall at 69k was too great for BTc to continue to run without government oversight. In my opinion, a short retest of 40k was bound to happen after JPowell mentioned the possibility of raising interest rates, Evergrande Fud, Charlie Munger Fud, inflation disarray, stablecoin regulation, and of course our deadly foes delta+OMi. 

One thing i know is BTc and eth will hit new highs come 2022. Strap yourself in boys, it’s gonna be a bumpy ride but there’s no denying blockchains are here to stay.

CryptoCurrency,I now understand a little better what these crashes are all about...margin calls and short liquidations.,"I know someone that got lquidated last night cause he thought a coin had hit the bottom and bought with margins. But the price kept on dropping and he lost it all.   That is the game, the market lures as much peope/money in as possible with gains and euphoria for weeks and months.  Fatten all the fish(that's us) up with margins, loans, and all, making most of us believe or forget that the price would ever go down to previous lows again.   And then when all the fish are stuffed as fuck as possible, the whales and sharks drops their nets, some get caught right away on the first swoop, and some a little further down cause they thought it was safe not believing or forgetting how far and deep the nets can go.  And the nets keep dropping down for more sweeps, catching the unexpecting fish. Then it's rinse and repeat.  It's the hodlers that bring up the value of the coins year to year.  It's the traders using margins and short callers that cause these massive drops.   Then it's rinse and repeat.  As more hodlers increase, the whales just play with higher prices, which hardly matters at all, it's all about percentages.

It kind of reminds me of this like a game I use to play often at Chuck E Cheeses - I forget the name but it was just a thin plastic ball in a tube suspended by blowing air that the player controls.  You make it go up in the tube  by giving it more air and lower the ball by reducing the air. The limitation was with how quick you can move the ball, it falls at the speed of gravity and goes up with the limited air pressure.    The idea was to keep the ball between a moving range. If you get out of range you lose.  So the player was to anticipate the move of the range with limited controls.   It starts off easy, but as the player succeeds further and further in time, the range begins to move faster and more erratic until it catches you.   I loved that game cause I was able to make it to the end more often than most people.  That game reminds me of the game traders play here.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,An old timer's perspective,"I just want to say that these hundreds of Youtube channels with some 20 year old doing their technical analysis charts on various cryptos have had me laughing my ass off for the past year. They're trying to apply the same TA parameter rules of an asset class that has been around for a hundred years+ (stocks) to an asset class that is really still in its infancy (crypto). 

I've been around for stock market crashes like 2002, 2008 and previous crypto crashes. Bought BTC in 2017 and then saw it go down to about $3000).

A couple of things to remember.

In the stock market you're lucky if you double your money in 10 years, in crypto you can 10x your money in a few days. (I've done it myself with LRC) So you need to realize that the reverse is also true and not bet the farm with money that you can't afford to lose.

Next, When the sh\*t hits the fan, EVERYTHING IS CORRELATED. For example, If the stock market takes a major sh\*t because of Covid fears or out of control interest rates, you can be 99% sure that BTC and ETH will follow, and in turn every alt coin will follow those two. Are you in for the long term? With real projects with a use case, not Santa Claus coin/cute doggie coin that serves no purpose? Then this is just noise. In the long term there will be a recovery and in increase from the previous ATH's

&amp;#x200B;

My current portfolio is BTC, ETH and a few alts that I feel are legit projects (ADA, XLM, LRC) What am I doing today?  I'm looking to dip my toe in on some of the lower cap alts that I don't have and felt I'd missed out on. Some of these are down like 20-25% today and I feel the bounce back in a recovery could be (percentage wise) better than that of the two big guys, BTC and ETH.  I grabbed some ALGO and AVAX, and increased my position in ADA. 

Good luck to all and keep your wits about you.",cryptocurrency

Income: ~180k (100k me, 80k her). This may increase to about ~200k by July, and I would feel comfortable saying that we’ll be at 225-250 within the next few years.    
Savings: ~150k. Almost entirely mine, and essentially just saving for a down payment.   
Debt: ~45k. Split between my car note at 0.9%, her student loans.  
Retirement savings: 45k (all mine). I’m not super worried about retirement savings since I will have a pension starting at 57 that should be enough for both of us to live off of, at the expense of lower take-home pay now. 

I guess the question is… how much house can we afford, and is a ‘starter home’ worth it while we’re building a family/still have young kids? Townhouses in the area we’d be looking at (to keep both our commutes &amp;lt;50 mins) start around 550k, SFH around 700k. 

We also have to consider things like hypothetical future childcare, which is almost 2k/mo/kid here, which might push us towards ‘starter home’ territory. It’s kind of f-ed up, but it seems almost impossible to have a couple of kids and a house even making 200k a year in our 20s. Just trying to figure out the best approach to our situation.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Fed December 15th Meeting Can Trigger The Depression... Trade Accordingly,"Powell hinted this week that an acceleration of tapering is possible due to inflation. The Fed is in a quiet period until their meeting on December 15th. On this day a press release will be released to indicate if an acceleration of tapering will happen. 

If the December 15th press release indicates accelerated tapering will occur, you will immediately see red in the market, and unfortunately the deleveraging process will accelerate and pop the market. We are in the end of a long term debt cycle (~100 year cycle) for the macro environment and anyone following this knows it's just a matter of time. 

If the December 15th meeting states tapering will not be accelerated, then the markets live on a bit longer.

However, Powell was recently renominated and no longer owes any allegiance to Biden. He went against Biden this week during a hearing and hinted at accelerated tapering. Powell was nominated first by Trump. The Republicans do not want more inflation. And now that Powell knows his renomination is behind him, I think he will indeed taper on the 15th. This will trigger the end of easy money until they reverse course and print the next more massive round of stimulus. 

It's in the interest of Republicans to make the economy look bad around now, which is perfect timing for critical mid-term campaigns for US Congressmen. 

Why is this the straw that breaks the camel's back? (1) Markets will immediately price in higher probabilities of interest rates increases in 2022+ due to risk of hyper inflation. This will have a cascading effect on the market that is over leveraged from excessive access to easy money. (2) Real productivity in the world is down due to the pandemic. These two key factors combined are enough to trigger the unwinding of leverage in the system. The end of more money... chasing less productivity... is a recipe for disaster... as it necessitates a correction. 

I would short crypto on the 15th if accelerated tapering is announced. Don't hesitate just sell on such news. The bottom will reverse once the government gets ready for its next bigger round of stimulus. Prepare your mind for volatility, be patient, trade well, good luck everyone. Load up on high quality projects during the biggest dips.

CryptoCurrency,This Is What Happened and This Is Why I Bought the Dip,"It's been a crazy past few days in both the stock and crypto markets and in my opinion, this is what’s been happening:

1 - Stock market corrected due to overall extension of valuations + Powell comments on inflation no longer transitory, faster tapering, and rise in interest rates. This especially hurts high growth stocks in particular which saw the steepest declines

2- The above plus omicron spooked investors and created uncertainty (which investors HATE) due to countries shutting down travel which slows down economic recovery and exacerbates supply chain 

3- Crypto markets were doing just fine until earlier today where everything started to tank. Crypto markets are still tied to macroeconomic effects in my view and so the effects of the stock market bled into crypto 

4- As a result crypto started to fall, and I don’t have access to the data but in the past what has happened is funds that were over leveraged get liquidated once prices fall and that happens exponentially as prices fall more which is why i think crypto instantly fell 20% across the board 

5 - As a result I think this liquidation provides a good discount in the crypto markets and I’ve personally added to my positions (SOL, LUNA, ATOM, AVAX)

gaming,Gamers are missing the forest for the trees when it comes to modern AAA multiplayer games,"I think that the frustration gamers are experiencing with AAA games, especially multiplayer games, has to do with a fundamental, inexorable shift in how games are produced, and part of this shift is actually a symptom of both the production size and distribution method of games, as well as the relationship fans have to their games today.

Gaming companies used to release a game, even a multiplayer game, and that was it. You pay $60, and they give you every map, skin, and weapon. If there were issues with balance, too bad. There were no patches that nerfed or buffed weapons, they just hosted servers for players. I still have dreams of knifing whole teams with the tac knife in COD MW 2 from ten feet away, and no one came to save them.

If you wanted more, say, multiplayer maps, the company would sell you another expansion and the player base would split in two overnight. Basically, the budget went like this: for a game that costs X amount of dollars to produce, we need to sell X units. To pay for the production of more content, we have to sell X amount of expansion units. But as games got bigger and more complex, the price of making the game went up even as the sale price stayed the same. In fact, as technology made it possible for developers to push updates and maintain the community through post launch support, the cost of a game ballooned past ‘just the launch.’ 

If a modern AAA FPS wanted to sell a game that had everything in it, including all post launch content, it would cost much more, well over $100. Which is, coincidentally, about the same price as some of these ultimate edition games that include season content that no one wants to buy.

Not to mention you start to run into a player population problem, where releasing paid map packs segments the player base into haves and have nots. So how do you keep all of your gamers happy and connected and still afford to make content for a game? 

The solution the industry is trying right now is that everything is free, except game passes and fancy costumes. Even paid games like yearly COD minus Warzone have microtransactions because development on the game never stops. All those people coding and balancing and creating art for the game still have to get paid, therefore they push the actual price of the full game onto a smaller subset of gamers willing to spend lots of money on cosmetics. 

Now, there are a ton of ethical issues with loot boxes and player skins, especially when it comes to preying on young gamers, but on paper, the idea that we all get constant content essentially for free while being supported by a small population of gamers who buy microtransactions seems like a win-win.

The problem comes in two flavors: legit and bullshit. 

The legitimate problem is that developers are being forced to release broken and unfinished games. The publisher recognizes that the game is a live service, so they can fix whatever is broken while pulling in additional money once it launches. So they use the early launch (and preorder sales) to recoup production costs. Probably because shareholders blah blah blah, doesn't matter. This is bad. This is killing games. Battlefield, my love, I’m looking squarely at you. 

But the other flavor, bullshit, is about FOMO. Companies need players to invest into the metagame: content that feels like it has value, while actually having none. They need gamers to want to dress up their little GI Joe in fancy expensive armor because that’s what funds all the other parts of the game. Yes, you used to be able to earn a flaming head in Halo. But the price of that flaming head used to be included in the price tag, and the next five years of content and balance and community events that you’ll get for free from Halo: Infinite would have just been pushed to the sequel, at which point you would have been asked to pay another sixty bucks.

Here’s a hot take that I shouldn’t add, but Battlefield 2042’s Santa Skin is more the fault of gamer pressure than it is devs misunderstanding their game. The skins have to stand out, but not break the game. Look exclusive, but not actually be advantageous. You can put out a ton of milsim outfits with different numbers of tactical pockets on them, but no one is going to buy that shit. And they need people to buy those skins to fund the game. Screwed if you do, screwed if you don’t, and this is an issue that gets more complicated the more thought you put into it. 

Of course, other issues crop up. Devs want to maintain player engagement, and gamers want devs to give them  a reason to grind, which in turn forces devs to try and stretch rewards so that they can’t be completed in a weekend (hey, Halo Infinite, I see you).

Games now come with a daily and weekly checklist, and while it gives you an incentive to play, once you accomplish those goals, why play the game anymore? Such a strange psychological split from playing a game to enjoy it vs checking off a list. I don’t think I would classify this as good or bad, but it does something to the incentive structure of playing a game that I’m not sure I’m comfortable with. 

All that being said, I think that game-as-service is here to stay, and many of the complaints about “we used to earn cosmetics” or ""devs are being greedy"" are outdated. Are there better ways for companies to provide value so that gamers, regardless of their financial investment, feel that the system is fair? Maybe. I think that’s a much more interesting conversation than complaining about what used to be.

investing,Bitcoin is not a safe haven or digital gold. It's a risk-on asset.,"No matter whether you like like crypto's or not, recent days have made it clear again Bitcoin is not a ""safe haven"" or ""digital gold"" which some claim it to be.

In the past week when equity markets sold off because of Fed tapering fears and lower then expected nonfarm payrolls, bitcoin also went down almost 20%.

I'm not judging those that want to speculate on cryptos, just don't call it a safe haven. If anything it's a risk-on asset which follows more the sentiment in stocks.

If you want a safe haven right now **consider 5-10% gold in portfolio.** Most probably hold an ETF like $GLD for that. Gold futures went up more than a percent on friday.

For those that will point out gold didn't go up in the past 10 years, that's because the Fed kept printing money which has helped bloating the stock market. Fed already announed they will finally taper off this QE and might even want to do it faster. **Over longer periods of time like the past 20 and 30 years gold has even outperformed the S&amp;P500.**

Concerning holding **bonds** as safe haven keep in mind those can be hit hard if Fed speeds up its QE tapering and starts raising interest rates which will happen eventually.",finance

Some really interesting prices here. Some still seem overvalued, others now seem close to being cheap. Keep in mind Nasdaq has traditionally had a P/S ratio of around 3, and SPY is currently at 3 p/s (though will probably improve significantly in 2022 due to reopening/travel recovery). 

**Peloton** in particular is now at the same P/S ratio it had in March 2020 and yet has tripled its subscriber base over that duration (ie - juicy, recurring revenue). This is **before** all of the Q/E and money printing we had, as well as higher interest rates before March 2020.

Same for **Roku** - it is now at March 2020 sales valuations, but over that duration it has grown it's revenue from $1.13b to $2.8b (taking in q4 revenues for 2021), a growth of 147% over 2 years, and doubled it's ARPU.

**PINS** could have very strong upside as well when sentiment in the stock market improves. Just at a glance it's profit margins are really good and they are very close to achieving profitability. I think a lot of these social media stocks could be a bargain once they navigate through the Iphone Ad Apocalypse©️. 

I think **Zillow** could be worth taking a look as well. I mean yeah, the business fucked up, but Cathie Wood's selloff means it probably got oversold based on it's current financials and future prospects. The loss they took from their fuckup was not that big

I am worried about **PLTR** as it still has 25x sales even after the selloff, and with the stock dilution there's a good chance big money might be waiting for further selloff before becoming interested in it again. It's a good company, but there's just so many better looking valuations in the market right now especially after the massive growth stock selloff.

Ii have invested in FAANGS far too long 
NVDA post split @$2.5
AAPL post spli $10
FB missed good opportunity at 17 and finally started buying at 120 onwards.
Google - missed opportunity at $80 and wait until $1000 to start adding positions. Traded on Amazon, Netflix, msft several times for smaller profits.
My last holdings are nvda, aapl, fb.  Recently sold my google position.

While the FAAGS are good  growth companies, not necessarily a good investment at these prices  if the government hike the tax rate, the top management will start dumping their positions. We have already seen some. Omicron although more virulent, may not be more lethal which may turn the Covid into regular flu. Interest rates end up going up from here from fed policy. While there is no crystal ball here, there is a case to build against the tech stocks. So I am thinking this is the right time to think about the stocks that can grow for the decades to come.  I am trying to look for companies that can grow when they potentially hit mass market. I am not worried about dilution as long as they meaningfully grow.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Are There Thousands of Unregulated Realcoins?,"I've  been hypothesizing something lately, there exists that popular Crypto called Tether, which is popular with banks.  This coin is backed by real  USD, and banks are using it as a quick and cheap means of buying USD, and shifting assets around.  Tether is also calling its long term debt and  risky assets their ""USD backing"", its not even actually backed by USD, they can shift all of their crappy debt into these coins and gain pure USD back from selling this to banks; who are then now calling crappy debt their USD reserve.

So I'm wondering, if its possible, that there could be thousands of these things in existence right now, and this is just the only openly  public one that we know about?

The  entire thing is unregulated, banks are stupid, and a rich hedge fund could have single-handedly created thousands of these things, like they did with CDO's before the housing collapse.  Its a copy and paste of the code, throw in some bad debt calling it cash reserves, I could even see it being used for tax avoidance and not declaring assets.

So if Tether exists then others should exist as well, could this actually create a huge risk to our credit markets?  Is this why the Fed seems to  have such a fascination with Crypto these days?  Could there theoretically exist a secret underground debt bubble, on par with the housing bubble?",cryptocurrency

I'm about $30k in the hole right now, but for the time being this debt is not accruing any interest due to the U.S. suspense on federal student loans.

personalfinance,Advice on new income,"So I just recently got a career change with a significant income increase. Previously earning less than 40k, now close to 3x that (over 100k). 

Some info: 

* early 30's
* ~2k monthly expenses
* ~10k in savings, 
* ~15k in retirements savings (minimal contributions)
* ~4k HSA
* ~18k student loans (mix of federal sub/unsubsidized loans with 3.86 - 4.66% interest)

With new salary + bonuses, my monthly net has been ~8k. Should expect that for the 1st 6 mo, then should reduce to ~6k. Although with RSUs starting to vest around then, I should remain about the same yearly compensation. So thats anywhere of 4-6k extra monthly income. What's the best way to utilize this new income? 

I'm thinking of getting aggressive on retirements since I'm behind. I already increased my contribution to at least 15%, and probably will start maxing 401k contributions next year. Should I think about getting an IRA as well? I also want to start maxing HSA and switching it to investing. 

I've also already used some of the extra income to pay off some student loans, although not sure if I should be focusing on that right now.

Another thing I'm considering is getting 10k in I-Bonds, so that in 1 year I could essentially switch that to be my emergency and invest the 10k in savings somewhere else. Or continue buying more bonds to use as a home down-payment in 5+ years.",finance

personalfinance,Keep new-ish car or get an older car to save money?,"Hi all. So a bit of some backstory. I am 20 years old, live in Massachusetts - and just got a 2 BR apartment with a roommate and we are splitting expenses down the middle. 

Last year, I got my first car, a 2009 Honda Civic with 160k miles on it. I bought it for way too much at a dealer and the transmission went out on me 6 months into ownership. I decided to stay away from something with that high miles and go for something a bit newer. 

I got a 2018 Honda Civic with 11k miles on it for around $17k. After taxes and everything else, the total came out to around $22k. After getting a loan for a high interest rate, I refinanced in a year when my credit score was tremendously better and got a much better rate (2%). I now pay $240/month for the car and about the same, a month, for insurance for it. 

I have a good job for someone my age and I can AFFORD the car and the insurance. I guess I am writing this because it feels wrong to have a car like this for someone at my age. I feel like if the transmission did not go out in my old car, I would still be driving it. I very much enjoyed not having a car payment every month and paying cheaper car insurance. Plus, an extra $240 a month for me would be pretty big. It would put my net savings above $1000 a month. Not to mention any additional savings from the cheaper insurance rate.

So my question is - should I try and get rid of this current car and get a used Toyota, Lexus, or Honda, that is reasonably priced off of Facebook Marketplace, or should I stick to what I have? I’ve heard of people getting these vehicles with 100k miles on them and driving them for another 100k - which is certainly something I would do.

The car itself has not given me a lick of an issue. Reliability is important to me and I’d hate to get rid of a car that hasn’t given me an issue for something that will be like my former car. It is sitting at 24k miles now and I do drive a ton (put 13k miles on it in 8 months). It gets excellent fuel economy, averaging 40mpg and the most expensive it has ever been to fill up was $32 and that is with the crazy high gas prices in Massachusetts right now. I love the car but can’t help but cringe when I go over a large pothole or feel like I’m “breaking” this super nice car that I feel like I don’t deserve to have. 

I guess with my old car, it was so old and rundown that I really didn’t care about the imperfections on the outside as long as it was mechanically sound. Plus, I know for a fact I couldn’t spend $240/ month in gas on my old car even if I tried. There is something very freeing about not having a car payment and looking at a car as a utility that gets you from A to B.

My question is if I’m unsure about being in this house the next 15 years how does that impact the refi decision?

My understanding is that you’re adding 7k in closing costs so if you refi it should be done if you’re planning to stay through the mortgage bc if I moved in a year I just paid an extra $7k in closing costs and only got 1 year of the lower interest rate which would be less than 7k of savings.

Bitcoin,Market sentiment,"Market sentiment has already dropped off substantially in just a few days. Fear and greed is at 18, which we haven’t seen since July.

Should be a fun little twist to the end of the year.. yay. I really do think we could chop sideways for some time or simply just bounce around in a range until the macro economic landscape changes (also I have 0 idea so don’t listen to me)

What I do know is that what Bitcoin does in the short-mid term will depend on the fed’s decision, tone and stance on tapering and how the broader market reacts to this. Everyone should be paying attention to this, yes it’s great to “buy the dip” and not worry about anything. Yes this is a good long term strategy but you should always be aware of major economic events like this. It impacts all of us drastically and by doing this you can make sure you take advantage of pivotal moments to better your financial life. 

Consider that the stock market hasn’t seen one correction this year (a drop of 10-20% from highs). Yes the NASDAQ saw a 10% correction earlier this year but not all major markets. This is a statistical certainty it will happen just a matter of when. Don’t be naive and just disregard this because Bitcoin is a risk-on asset so it’ll be one of the first ones to go (in the short term of course)

We’re getting literally like 5x the amount of bad news all at once. Fed tapering earlier than expected, CPI being released next week (which is almost certainly going to be a higher reading than last month, which will just further push the fed to taper, more covid, end of year rebalancing and wash-sale shenanigans, horrible payroll numbers, and then China being China. 

I think the sheer speed of Friday’s drop is not to be scoffed at. I mean yes we’ve seen much worse drops but a nearly 20% drop in like 2 hours is not nothing. A 15% drop in 10 minutes is crazy, especially considering the market we’re at now compared to the past. Yes I know it was liquidation cascade and stop loss hunting to clear out the high order book bids. Overall it was necessary, we had far too much leverage and optimism for way too long. Definitely a positive going forward. 

That being said I’m loving seeing the sentiment swing from hype to extremely negative. Not on here of course since most of us actually know what we own and have done our own research. I’ve been seeing a ton of, “We’re now in a bear market for the next 3 years”, “I’m selling it all before it’s too late”. The more and more people start to say things like this the more I’ll begin doubling down. Once a large majority is bearish that’s when I want to be balls deep. Remember the past 3-4 months when everyone was guaranteeing that we were going to be at 100k by the end of the year no questions. It never plays out how you think it will. Also we knew for months that the leverage was never flushed out. It was bound to happen. I could still feel myself feeding off the hopium and I know it. When this happens just show some caution. Try to be neutral in the short term. Just keep your head on your shoulders and think rationally.  Continue to buy the dip and if you believe in Bitcoin average in with more on these amazing discounts. 

Fight the urge to follow the herd.

personalfinance,Military retirement on the horizon - I want to invest and prepare better,"Throwaway since my main is easily identifiable.

39M, United States, married, no kids, single income currently.

Active Duty Military. Retirement eligible in 2022 (will have 20 years). Intend to retire at 25 years in 2027. Estimated pension depending on promote/non-promote $60-71K before taxes. Start collecting immediately upon retirement (45 y/o). VA disability are too unpredicatable.

Annual take home ~$105K

Mortgage $310K. Min monthly payment $1.5K.

Monthly bills/spending ~$2K

Monthly savings deposit of ~$3-5K.

Savings ~$155K (only 0.01% interest…I know that’s terrible). I started about 10 years ago, and I dip into this very rarely for down payments.(Military life, so buying a home every 3 to 4 years when I get orders).

Two reliable paid off vehicles less than 10 years old

No debt other than mortgage

No investments.

I intend to work after I retire from the military; likely another Federal job. Or I may finally use my MGIB for the first few years out and finally finish up college.

No big goals. We may sell and move to a lower COL area, so I’d want to use a chunk of the savings for a down payment, or at least to pay down the VA loan points. Only big expenditure (pre-COVID) was an annual trip abroad (Maybe $5-8K total?) that we’d like continue to do if/when things get better. I feel dumping my money into a low yield savings account was/is a waste. But, I also like having access to it in case of emergency. I’m thinking I would be comfortable with not having immediate access to at least $100K.

I honestly haven’t thought about it a whole lot, but with my (first) retirement on the horizon, I’d like to at least start making some smarter choices. I’m pretty risk averse, so I’m thinking a high yield savings, or CDs may be more my speed. I'm not fond of being penalized for withdrawling early. I'm also thinking I should start making max contributions to an IRA (not sure which yet).

personalfinance,Help me leverage the most out of my current financial situation (23 year old),"Hi r/PersonalFinance,

Posting on a throwaway for obvious reasons. I'm currently a 23 year old working in NYC, and I am trying to see what else I can do with my money to best set myself up for the future.



Current situation:

- $90k/year pre-tax and pre-deduction income (expecting $100-$110k next year)

- ~$100K net worth ($10k 401K + $20k roth IRA + $50k brokerage account + $20K cash all in various high-yield bank accounts)

- No debt; own no home or car or any other substantial assets

- $2500/month spending ($1.8k for rent/utilities, rest is food + daily needs; very little splurging)

- 5% 401K matching, but I put in 10-15% of my salary. Also am putting in $6k a year in my Roth IRA.



Future goals:

- Possibly may attend a masters/MBA in the next few years (unsure if out of pocket or firm-sponsored yet)

- Want to either buy a condo/co-op or move out into NJ to buy a place in the next couple years.

- Trying to absolutely maximize my tax-saving strategies.



In order to meet those goals, here's what I'm planning to do:

- Start a 529 account for myself; take the $5k state tax deduction from NY, and use it either for my MBA or transfer the 529 to my child(s) when I have kids in the next 5-10 years.

- Invest in my brokerage account on margin (VOO + tech); I've been offered a sub-2% margin rate, and I intend to take out the margin amount equivalent to the excess cash in my bank accounts. Wouldn't this, over long term, be free money? Especially against the current inflation rates? 

- Max out my HSA account ($3500 I believe?)

- Am intending to put down 5% or so to buy a ~$700K condo in the next few years. Things are very fluid at the moment, but my parents may be willing to bankroll most/all of the mortgage and rent it out to me ""at-cost."" This way all of the real estate appreciation stays within the family.
- Open credit cards for the sign up bonuses (""churning""); I have no worries about credit card debt or temptations as that's just not something I do. I live very below my means as you can tell by my spending and income levels.


Are there any other tax-deductible accounts or methods that I can take advantage of now? I think that some of your biggest questions regarding my current strategy is investing on margin. 



My current thought process about margin is:

- I'm happy to invest my cash, but the bank account interest rate is higher than my margin rate. As such, taking out margin equivalent to the spare cash, and pocketing the difference between my interest rate received and margin rate paid is superior to investing my cash directly. In the unlikely event I get a margin call or the margin rate increases, I will just deposit the spare cash I have, and it will become just like investing my spare cash.



I'd be forever grateful if you all could point out any potential flaws with my strategies, and if there is anything else I could be doing to take advantage of my current situation.



I'm also happy to answer any questions or add additional details if helpful.



Thanks PF!",finance
personalfinance,I don’t know if this merits a correction but do you think it’s possible to have this taken off my credit report?,"I had several student loans outstanding with MyFedLoan since I graduated in 2013. Something like 4 or 5. They were all tied to a single email address and at one point I had them in deferment. Fast forward 6 months to a year where I changed email addresses, the loans came off deferment I missed the emails and defaulted on all of them for two months before I realized. 

As soon as I realized I consolidated them all into a single loan. All told we’re only looking at 21-22k. Now I haven’t missed a payment in well over a year. It’s on auto pay and unless my bank account gets shut down I won’t miss any more payments.

personalfinance,I'm a 30 year old n00b and have some financial questions I'm too afraid to ask in person,"Background: I'm in tech and it's only now that I'm a candidate for the higher paying jobs (&gt;250k/yr).

I will be turning 30 in 1 month and have some questions about loans, finances and stuff that I'm too afraid to ask people in person. Can someone help me understand some basic finance concepts?

1. I was looking into home prices as I'd like to buy one in the next few years, I saw that the monthly difference between 15 and 30 year loans on houses was only a few hundred dollars and the rates for 30 year loans was higher! I asked my friend about it and he said 30 year loans are still the better choice as you can invest the monthly difference and earn more money than you'd save with the lower interest rate.
On the face of it makes sense but I did not grow up in a financially well off household and the one advice that was constantly drilled into me was ""Don't play with money you can't afford to lose"", what if my investments don't pan out and I lose money in the long run? Isn't the amount you invest in your house also an investment? That you can potentially rent out and downsize later? Won't owning your home outright make that process easier? (I don't know if it will this is just my gut intuition)

2. Are ARM loans just scams? I don't know if I will live where I currently do forever, but I don't know if I won't either. Does anyone who buys a home really know whether they will be where they are forever? Also is a 5 year duration enough to decide that? Are there any legit situations where ARM loans make sense?
3. If I take out a housing loan won't my network take a ginormous hit? I personally want to put down &gt;20% of the loan as a down payment as I don't feel comfortable going to into astronomical amounts of debt, am I just being an idiot? Is this a normal thing to do?
4. What happens when you move? Will the finance company agree to buy back the portion of the house you paid for during the duration you lived there adjusted to the new price of the house? Do most people just buy a new house wherever they moved to? 

I apologize in advance if these questions are stupid or easily answered by Googling, I don't even know how to search for the answers to the questions I have or how to word them on Google so that I get the right answers.",finance

Here's our expenses:

* Mortgage: $1,400
* Utilities/ Internet: Averages $200/ month
* Car Insurance, we save $80/ month
* We allocate about $200 for groceries and $200 for eating out per paycheck ($400 total)

* Software: $40/ month
* Phone bill: $150/ month (paying off her new phone, will switch to prepaid once that's paid)

* About $100/ month for haircut/ nail appointments etc
* Aiming to add to our emergency savings by about $500/ month
* I have 20k of student loans that we are paying $500/ month
* Saving for a new car as both of ours are older (2009 &amp; 2010): $200/ month
* Home decorating/ repair (bought our house back in June, needs some improvements): $600/ month 
* We each get about $400/ month of discretionary spending that we can do what we like with. So $800 total 

All of this totals to about $5.5k/ month which means theoretically we should have a buffer of about 1.5k/ month of extra.

The extra that is left over is either going to go into savings/ investments, or maybe used to pad our emergency fund until it gets to about 15k.

I currently live with my mom and dad. I'm 22.

I was doing this work from home job for about $20 an hour and making really good money for a good while, trying to save up to eventually get a new car and apartment. For the record, this wasn't a regular W-2 job; it was a ""gig"", one of those jobs where you have to pay your own taxes and you aren't technically considered employed. Anyway, Right around when I started working, my dad decides to quit his job out of nowhere. Apparently he was fed up with how his boss treated him for the last several years and just wanted a break from working in general. I honestly didn't blame him at first as I know times are really tough and bosses can be such assholes and it can all just make you feel trapped, so I agreed to help out with the bills until he found a new job.

The thing is, I didn't think it'd be an entire 9 months before he even decided to start trying to search for one.

My mom also started getting her hours cut at her job by about half, so I had to start chipping in more. There were certain situations where I basically couldn't say no; for example, they were about to be overdue on their electricity bill and Internet bill. Not paying them would have caused me to not be able to perform my worm from home job or attend my online classes. There was also this situation where our stove broke down and I had to buy a new one or else we basically wouldn't be able to cook anything.

It started getting to the point where I was losing more money than I earned per week. Now, I have some credit cards, but I really only used them sparingly prior to all this because I know it's a good way to build credit. I started using them to pay some of my parents' expenses while I waited for my next paycheck.

Last month, I was suddenly let go from my job. Had nothing to do with performance and it was more related to an excess of employees. I didn't try to apply for unemployment because I don't quite think I qualify since I was never employed and it was only a gig. So I applied for about 50 jobs over the course of a week and managed to find one, but it doesn't start until December 20th. Right now, I'm late on two of my credit cards and one Affirm payment and I have pretty much no money to pay them with at all. My bank account is already $200 in the negative. But once I start this job, based on the pay I'm getting, I'll literally have enough money to pay all of these dues off in the first two weeks.

What I'm concerned about is, what should I do for the time being? What will happen if I wait nearly a month before paying anything? I have an Amazon credit card and a Best Buy credit card if that matters. Thanks a bunch for any advice!

TLDR; I can't pay off my late credit card payments until about a month from now. Is it okay to just wait? What could happen? How can I minimize the damage to my credit?",finance

stocks,Tail Wagging The Dog: A case for how options hedging activity has recently been driving stock market prices more than fundamentals or macro.,"I'm a short-term degenerate options trader(mostly intra-day, max few weeks), usually just an occasional lurker on this sub. This is a long post, so if you want skip to the meat of it jump to, **Feedback Loops.**

Given the recent market volatility and all the theorizing around causes/possible outcomes(omicron, fed, etc.) and discussions around stocks/indices being ""cheap""/""overvalued""/etc. I thought I'd share some info on how options activity might be the primary driver of the erratic stock price movements recently (and in the near future). As a result even if you only trade stocks, it might be worth your while to learn how options impact the game.

Options trading activity is at an all-time high as of November(in last 2 years, on some days, options volume is higher than underlying stock volume!) and this leads to very large buying/selling flows of the underlying stocks from market makers who are hedging their risk. Depending on how close we are to large options expiration dates the behavior of these flows can change drastically setting off large market movements in either direction.

Last monthly OPEX(options expiration) occurred on 11/19, next large OPEX will be on 12/17. I think 11/19 OPEX is what paved the way for the subsequent drop the following week in markets due to large shift in market maker hedges after OPEX. I also think if there's a bounce in the market for a Santa Rally it will likely be near/shortly after the next OPEX on 12/17. Below I explain in detail how market maker hedging of stock options can drive price flow in the underlying stocks. I've attempted to keep it simple enough for people of any experience level to follow.

**Basics**

**Price and Order Book**

Every trade made in the market has 2 sides to it. A buyer and a seller. ""Price"" as we see on a chart is a real-time negotiation occurring between a group of buyers and a group of sellers. The results of these negotiations are entered into a ledger called an order book. We typically visualize that order book as stock charts, tickers, etc.

The amount of real buyers/sellers that will want to negotiate at any given time determines how easy it will be for you to buy/sell a stock (a.k.a liquidity). If you don't have enough buyers/sellers at a price, then price will have to move up or down in order to entice more buyer/sellers. Less buyers/sellers or an imbalance of buyers/sellers -&gt; more price movement. 

**Futures/Options**

Futures can be thought of as a trade that's added to the order book for a future date instead of for now. 

Why do this? Buyers/sellers can lock in prices for a future date to allow for longer-term stability/planning rather than be forced to speculate on what prices might be at that date.

Options can be thought of as the option to add a trade to the order book for a future date.

**Market Makers**

Market makers are players(usually banks/financial institutions) who make money by providing liquidity (a.k.a make it easier for you to buy/sell a stock). They do this by adding artificial buyers and sellers on both sides of the order book with a slight price difference (a.k.a spread). 

Generally their goal is to make profit only from the spread, rather than speculate in the market by actually buying/selling the stock like investors/traders(a.k.a you) are. This way their profits are tied to how many people are trading, not how the market does.

E.g

Market maker adds an artificial buy and artificial sell order on the book.

Ask $101

Bid $99

Real seller comes in and sells the stock for $99 to market maker. Real buyer comes in and buys the same stock for $101 from the market maker. Market maker keeps $2 profit.

**Tail Wagging The Dog**

**Hedging Options**

As mentioned earlier the primarily goal of market makers is to be unaffected by market movements, while profiting off spread. They do this by making sure they have an equal amount of bets up and down(a.k.a hedging).

The below table shows how they initially hedge based on what bet the trader places. As the options get closer to expiration their value will decrease and the market maker will reduce their hedge as the value of the option decreases.  E.g. As a call option loses value the market maker will sell stock to reduce their hedge to match the reduced value of the call option.

&amp;#x200B;

|Trader Bet|Market Maker Bet|Market Maker Initial Hedge|Market Maker Hedge as OPEX nears|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Buy Call|Sell Call|Buy Stock|Sell Stock|
|Sell Call|Buy Call|Sell Stock|Buy Stock|
|Buy Put|Sell Put|Sell Stock|Buy Stock|
|Sell Put|Buy Put|Buy Stock|Sell Stock|

&amp;#x200B;

The end result here is a range of outcomes. We will only discuss the two extremes, but any mixture of these and transition between these is possible:

1. Market maker is hedging with the market flow in the underlying stock.

2. Market maker is hedging against the market flow in the underlying stock.

Outcome 1 can result in what's typically referred to as a ""gamma squeeze"". 

\- Traders buy a large number of call/put options. 

\- Market maker buys/sells a large amount of underlying stock causing the price to shift up/down.

\- Traders options are ""in-the-money"", so traders take profits and buy more call/put options which causes further hedging which further accelerates the up/down movement in the underlying causing a feedback loop.

\- Market makers see the increased demand for call/put options and increase the price of the high-demand options. This reduces the number of options purchases and the feedback loop eventually loses momentum and stops and then typically reverses in the other direction.

Outcome 2 results in the market makers having a balancing effect on markets by reducing price movement in either direction. 

\- This typically either looks like the prices pinning to a certain level (e.g. SPX pinned to 4700, which on avg had the largest open interest for contracts going into 11/19 OPEX) 

\- Or a long slow gradual melt-up as the hedging flows provide a steady support for the market. (Generally we don't see slow gradual melt-downs b/c price movements tend to increase more quickly in drops. a.k.a generally market takes the stairs up and the elevator down).

**Feedback Loops**

1. Change in market maker hedges impacts underlying stock price.

2. Underlying stock price impacts options prices.

3. Options prices impact market maker hedge.

4. Repeat

This basic feedback loop here is what's referred to when people talk about ""the tail wagging the dog."" in relation to the options market. As we can see above that analogy is not quite accurate, it'd be more accurate to say ""the tail and dog are wagging each other in a feedback loop.""

The main impact of these kinds of feedback loops is that when volumes are large enough, they will overpower more traditional methods of pricing stocks (e.g. fundamentals, macro, etc.). This is not to say that those factors are not playing a role in the price, but rather that they are playing a role within the broader context of these feedback loops. 

If you ignore these feedback loops and use only your traditional methods, you run the risk of getting burned when a feedback loop is exerting pressures in the other direction. This will cause you to look at market and say it's acting ""crazy"" by your traditional methods which may certainly be true, but anytime you and the market disagree on a trend/price just remember: Do you want to be right or do you want to make money?

**In Practice**

Ok ok enough theory, how to use these ideas in your investing/trading?

You can think of options contracts as having gravity on a stock's price. The more contracts at a given price, the more the feedback loop we discussed above will ""pull"" the stock to that price. You can use this as additional info in determining support/resistance/pivots etc.

Since it's impossible to hedge continuously, market makers do it in batches which can cause large buy/sell orders to be entered on the underlying as a hedge shortly after large options prices shifts. When you see large buy/sell volume on an index/equity always ask yourself if it's real volume or if it's hedging volume. If it's hedging volume then it will be rolled back as OPEX(options expiration) nears and the price hasn't shifted much. These hedge rollbacks can be potential reversal opportunities on the underlying.

The above hedging primarily impacts high-volume options like SPX, AAPL, TESLA, etc. Even if your stock doesn't have large options volume, due to the correlation between equities, price moves triggered by SPX options can still indirectly affect your equities if it triggers larger market moves.

Flows are most pronounced near monthly OPEX b/c options price vary much more highly as they get closer to expiration. These causes the hedging flows to also increase as any options price movement requires a change in the underlying hedge. This makes feedback loop effects stronger near OPEX.

Last but not least, since gamma squeezes occur in both directions there is always the risk of a regular pullback/dip turning into a full on rout depending on how options activity behaves at the same time and how stable the underlying market structure is. (e.g. sp bull market with 450/500 climbing stocks much more stable structure than sp bull market with with 250/500 sp climbing stocks, even though both tickers show the number going up.)

**Market Next 2 Weeks**

I think based on the mentioned feedback loops and current options activity the market will continue to drop for the next week(12/6) with the potential for reversal coming the week after (12/13). 

**Week of 12/6**

There is a huge amount of PUTs that have been bought recently causing market makers to sell the underlying as a hedge, and I suspect in that broader context(news on fed taper, omicron, debt ceiling, evergrande default, crypto drop/tether fud, potential bad cpi, etc.) will be enough to increase this feedback loop downward early this week. Based on PUT positioning and the feedback loops pulling price towards large open options positions, I suspect if spy break below 4500 it will drop fast. Best case support holds at 4400. Absolute worst case down to 4000, but I doubt it will get there. 

It's possible we get a small bounce again on Monday before dropping below 4500, but I do expect us to break below this upcoming week.

I am not going to comment on actual real-life risks of those news events I mentioned b/c I don't know. Only that within the fragile context of current options positioning it wouldn't take much bad news to increase the downward momentum and there seem to be a lot of different potential catalysts that could spark fear causing selling given how fewer and fewer crowded stocks currently hold up the major indices.

**Week of 12/13**

This will be a very key week to determine whether a Santa Rally will happen. Ideal scenario for that would be traders overextend on PUTs. Market holds the line and those PUTs expire worthless. Market makers unwind their hedges by buying the underlying stock sling-shotting us back for another rally.

It's also possible we trade sideways here and don't slingshot back. This would be a wait-and-see kind of scenario. 

Either way I think it's unlikely that the market will still be dropping by 12/17 unless one of the aforementioned events results in some more bad news (e.g. omicron being worse than expected, faster fed taper, US institutions holding a bunch of Chinese property debt, Tether finally collapses, etc.) Not saying those are likely, but always good to be aware of worst-case scenarios when managing risk.

**My related positions**

As my positions show I'm quite bearish at the moment.

SPY and QQQ Puts w/ multiple expiries: now - 12/17 w/ multiple strikes: 440 - 460

UVXY calls, strike: 75 expiry: 1/21 (This position is highly speculative on my part and I've had it for a couple of months, not saying we're going to see a crash of this magnitude, but I do personally believe it's in the range of possibility.)

I will likely turn bullish near 12/17 for Santa Rally, will play it by ear as we get closer to decide exactly when.

**Disclaimer/Final Thoughts** 

I'm just some guy on the internet who bets on whether lines go up or down and have 0 formal or otherwise training in any of this. I just happen to play the game. No one(on the internet or otherwise) knows what the market is going to do. Ever. Go look at the finance ""news"" from 11/22/21 on JPow announcement. Same papers give his appointment credit for the market rally in morning and then few hours later blame his appointment for the drop in the afternoon. Absolute clown stuff. They don't know what's going to happen anymore than you or I do. Their job is only to give you ""plausible"" sounding answers you want to hear. Same with reddit/twitter/fb/etc. So they will just take the most recent major event assign it credit/blame and then spin into whichever bull/bear narrative they think you want to hear. For profit market ""commentary"" is the stock market equivalent of selling pickaxes in a gold rush.

If you take nothing else away from this post at least remember this. Markets are chaotic and unpredictable. You can't analyze or research your way out of that basic fact. All you can do in the face of that is accept the uncertainty and play this game accordingly. Uncertain scenarios are both full of risk, but also full of opportunity. Best of luck in the coming weeks, I have no idea what will happen, but at the very least it should be interesting! Cheers.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Tether: The Biggest Risk of Cryptocurrency,"Crypto is a multi-generational asset class that can be used over the next few decades as an investment vehicle to make substantial profits against the inflation that the federal reserve has triggered. 42.3% of all USD were printed in the last 18 months. It doesn't take a genius to see that blockchain technology and smart contracts are useful and will become more prominent over the coming years. That's not even the tip of the iceberg.

However, in the short term (1-3 years), nobody knows where cryptocurrencies will go, influencers who make money from retained viewership and exchanges that make money from trade commissions don't either.

This isn't a post about crypto's potential, it's a post highlighting crypto's biggest risk in the near term that we should all be aware of.

# Tether

As of today, Tether claims to have cash reserves of $75.2B. This gives Tether the 5th largest cash reserve of all companies **worldwide**, just behind Amazon with 86.2B.

Some facts about Tether:

* Tether has 28 employees. An incredibly low number for a business managing $75B dollars.
   * A common characteristic of fraudulent companies is maintaining a low employee count. They do this to minimize the risk of whistleblowers. To put this number in perspective, Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC had 25 employees.
* Tether is the largest liquidity provider to the crypto market, maintaining the highest volume by far. During times of heightened volatility, $1B+ new Tethers are regularly minted at once.

[Tether Volume \(Morning of 5 Dec\)](https://preview.redd.it/qurssymnit381.png?width=1150&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=453cb9ba8365bb3b0ec2ab4088dda75fb5fe7937)

* The Tether subreddit is heavily censored and only contains positive news about the company, you need to request to post and any negative comments get removed by moderators.
* Tether is yet to release an official audit since its inception in 2014.
* Tether has an incredibly scandalous history:
   * **November 20, 2014:** Realcoin rebrands as “Tether” and officially launches in private beta. The company hides its full relationship with Bitfinex. Tether tokens are issued by Tether Limited, which in turn is controlled by the owners of Bitfinex.
   * **January 15, 2015:** Bitfinex enabled trading of USDT of their platform.
   * **May 22, 2015:** Bitfinex is hit with its first hack. The exchange claims it lost 1,500 bitcoin.
   * **June 2, 2016:** The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission fines Bitfinex for offering illegal off-exchange financed transactions.
   * **August 2, 2016:** Bitfinex claims it has been hacked again when 119,756 BTC vanish.
   * **August 17, 2016:** Bitfinex makes an announcement “We are also in the process of engaging Ledger Labs to perform an audit of our complete balance sheet for both cryptocurrency and fiat assets and liabilities”.
   * **April 5, 2017:** Bitfinex makes the correction: “Ledger Labs has not been engaged to perform a financial audit of Bitfinex.”
   * **September 15, 2017:** To quash those rumors that tethers were not fully backed. Tether and Bitfinex arrange for accounting firm Friedman LLP to perform an attestation instead.
   * **September 16, 2017:** Tether opens an account at Noble Bank. And Bitfinex transfers $382 million from Bitfinex’s account at Noble Bank into Tether’s account at Noble Bank for the attestation.
   * **September 28, 2017:** Friedman LLP issues a report ""FLLP did not evaluate the terms of the above bank accounts and makes no representations about the Client’s ability to access funds from the accounts or whether the funds are committed for purposes other than Tether token redemptions.”
   * **August 7, 2017:** Bitfinex announces that over the next 90 days, it will gradually discontinue services to its U.S. customers.
   * **November 7, 2017:** Leaked documents dubbed “The Paradise Papers” reveal Bitfinex and Tether are run by the same individuals. Up until now, Tether and Bitfinex insisted the two operations were separate.
   * **November 19, 2017:** Tether is hacked when 31 million USDT are moved from the Tether treasury wallet into an unauthorized address. Tether initiates a hard fork to prevent those funds from being spent. After this hack, Tether notes on its website that redemption of USDT for real dollars is no longer possible via the Tether website.
   * **January 3, 2018:** A change to Tether’s legal terms of service (archive) states: “Tether Tokens will no longer be issued to U.S. Persons.”
   * **January 27, 2018:** Tether parts ways with accounting firm Friedman LLP. There is no official announcement; Friedman simply deletes all mention of Bitfinex from its website, including past press releases.
   * **January 31, 2018:** The 2017 bubble has burst. As the price of BTC plummets, tether issuance takes on a rapid, frenzied pace. In January, Tether issues 850 million USDT, more than any single month prior.
   * **June 1, 2018:** Looking to reassure its customers, Bitfinex hires Freeh Sporkin &amp; Sullivan, a law firm to confirm that Tether has $2.55 billion in its banks, enough to cover the USDT in circulation at the time. FSS is not an accounting firm and there is a conflict of interest. FSS Senior Partner Eugene Sullivan is also an advisor to Noble Bank, where Bitfinex and Tether hold accounts.
   * **October 1, 2018:** Reports circulate that Noble Bank is up for sale, as a result of having lost several of its big customers.
   * **October 14, 2018:** Amid concerns over Tether’s solvency and the company’s ability to establish banking relationships, tether’s peg slips, this time to $0.92.
   * **November 1, 2018:** Tether officially announces that it is banking with Deltec and provides an attestation letter (not an audit) from the Bahamian bank that the account holds $1.8 billion, enough to cover the amount of tether in circulation at the time. The attestation has a mysterious squiggly signature at the bottom with no name attached to it.
   * **February 26, 2019:** Tether admits, for the first time that it is operating a fractional reserve and that tethers are no longer backed by cash alone.
   * **April 24, 2019:** The NY attorney general office sues iFinex, the parent company of Bitfinex and Tether, saying that the company has been commingling client and corporate funds to cover up $850 million in missing funds.
   * **March 30, 2021:** Tether releases another attestation, essentially saying that Tether has $35 billion in assets backing 35 billion tethers at a blink in time on Feb. 26, 2021.
   * **August 9, 2021:** Tether released its latest attestation report, which included the composition of its reserves and more details about its commercial paper. About half of Tether’s roughly $75 billion in assets, which back USDT, is in commercial paper.  
* Tether is currently being investigated by numerous government agencies.
   * The New York attorney general opened an investigation of the company for claims around its backing, they settled with the NYAG earlier this year. As part of the settlement, Tether is prohibited from doing business in New York state, the capital of the US financial world.
   * Fraudulent companies continue operations for years before any employees are prosecuted.
   * The Enron Scandal ended in 2001 when they filed for bankruptcy. Company officials admitted to overstating earnings since 1997, it took the financial regulators four years to catch them. The wheels of justice turn slowly.

# The scariest part

The issuance of tethers correlates with the rapid run-up in the price of bitcoin from April to December 2017 when bitcoin peaked at nearly $20,000. This does not appear different from the current bull market.

**TLDR**:Recently, the cryptocurrency market has become more and more exciting because of the rapid increase in the number of new participants. In the current situation of extremely low bank interest rates, more and more people with a demand for ""fixed interest rate loans of 10% a year"" will step into this market.Applications like Outlet, Linus, Dharma, BlockFi, Celsius have developed user interfaces to meet this need, with liquidity coming from centralised liquidity pools or from Compound and Aave. Therefore, users' attention to decentralised fixed-rate products will be even greater.  


# General Conclusion

Bonds are one of the most in-demand financial products to date. According to Icmagroup, the total bond market is over $128Tn and the terrain is open for blockchain projects to penetrate the market.Many new DeFi projects are looking at concepts found in traditional finance, such as:

* Fixed interest;
* Decomposing fixed income assets into principal and interest;
* Leveraged yield.

DeFi protocols are beginning to address basic concepts and meet the needs of many classes of users that TradFi cannot, because of crypto's nearly frictionless composability.These protocols were born with the primary goal of uncertain and often volatile returns received when staking or depositing tokens for lending (Aave, Compound), trading (Curve) or actively farming (Yearn, Harvest).

# Traditional Bond

## Definition

A bond is a security issued in connection with a debt arrangement. The borrower (the seller) issues a bond to the lender (the purchaser) in return for some cash. A bond is an ""IOU"" (I Owe You) of the borrower. A typical coupon bond requires the issuer to make predetermined payments.When the bond matures, the issuer repays the debt by paying the face value of the bond. The bond's interest rate determines the interest payment. The annual payment amount equals the bond's interest rate multiplied by the bond's face value. The coupon rate, maturity date and par value of the bond are part of the bond indenture agreement, which is a contract between the issuer and the holder of the bond.

## Types of Bonds

* Government bonds This is a type of security issued by a government for the purpose of raising medium and long-term capital for the government. Revenues from bonds can be used to make up temporary shortfalls of the state budget, to implement national construction projects, or to finance other government purposes according to the budget allocation plan. books every year.
* Local Government bonds These are bonds issued by the People's Committees of provinces and centrally run cities to raise capital for local investment projects and works.
* Government-guaranteed bonds This is a bond issued by enterprises, financial institutions, credit institutions, and policy banks of the State subject to the provisions of the relevant laws and guaranteed for payment by the Government.
* Corporate bonds. Debt securities are bonds issued by companies or financial institutions in order to raise capital for business activities.

Excerpt: There are lots of ways to make money: You can earn it, find it, counterfeit it, steal it. Or, if you’re Satoshi Nakamoto, a preternaturally talented computer coder, you can invent it. That’s what he did on the evening of January 3, 2009, when he pressed a button on his keyboard and created a new currency called bitcoin. It was all bit and no coin.

Excerpt: The idea of digital money, liberated from the oversight of governments and banks—had been a hot topic since the birth of the Internet.

personalfinance,I work remotely for a company that has assigned me an office location that is not the city where I work or live,"I began working for a large company in June. I work exclusively from home. When I signed on, they said it was fine to work remotely but they didn’t want to officially tag me as a “remote worker” in their system. Instead, they assigned me to an office that’s a 3 hour driving commute from my actual home with the understanding that I do not need to go in. They never provided a reason for this but I didn’t push for one either.

The issue is that the payroll department is withholding taxes from my check for the city which they’ve assigned me. This is in addition to normal state and federal taxes . It’s a sizable chunk too - 2.5% of gross pay. 

This wouldn’t bother me if I lived there or even if I commuted regularly and utilized their public services. Since neither of those things are true, I'm not sure I need to be paying this tax.

HR explained that this withholding is automatic based on my office location in their system of record and the only thing I can do is change offices and the withholding will update to reflect the new location. 

It occurred to me later that there is yet another office that is roughly the same distance from my actual home but this city requires no income tax withholding. However, this is not a location where people in my division typically work.   If I was assigned this location the withholding should be zero. 

I am tempted to talk to management and ask if I can be assigned to that location instead.  I could use that money to increase my 401k contribution.

Is this allowed? I'm concerned that changing my base location to avoid taxes is fraudulent somehow.  I don’t want to get myself or my employer in hot water. 

Any advice is appreciated.

Hi all, I’m a recent graduate looking to get a car within the next year or so. I’ve never bought a car before so I’m not too sure on the process, but I do know that I’m not planning on paying in full (car budget $30k) so I’ll need to get an auto loan. I want to be able to get the best rates and I’m wondering if my credit score and history are sufficient enough:

Credit Score: 770

History: 
- Always pay full balance of each credit card on time, no late payments or any other debt
- 3 credit cards totaling $20k credit line, first credit card in 2019
- Utilization at 2% 

Salary: $100k 

My problem right now is that even though I feel like I’m doing all the financially responsible things, my credit score hasn’t increased in months and stays in the 760-770s range. Is there anything else I can do to increase my credit score, or is this enough to be able to get a good interest rate for buying a new car? 

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,HELP: Should I buy or rent a property?,"Hello, right now I'm a JD paralegal, waiting to take the bar exam and pass it anytime soon to get promoted and get a better salary. My salary is $87,000 per year. My wife gets around $60,00 per year. We live in south Florida, Miami. I've been thinking about financing a small house/townhouse/apartment (I was told that because it would be my first property, interest rates would be lower). I've been looking for properties in the range of $300,000 to 400,000. We could make a down payment up to $100,000 if necessary.

My main concern are the monthly payments that we would need to make if we finance a property for 30 years. With our salaries combined, would be difficult to live a normal life, and be able to make the monthly payments? Or our salaries are too low to commit to the purchase of a property, which leads me to think that it would be better to rent?",finance
personalfinance,Difficulty in refinancing mortgage because of a second building on the property,"Hi I bought my home in 2014 and used Coldwell Banker for the realtor and Wells Fargo for the mortgage. At the time the interest was 4.5% and now the rates are cheaper. At the time of purchase the property had a main home and a small side cottage.

I have tried a local bank and a local credit union and both said no due to their lender, Fannie May saying that they cannot do it due to a second building on the property,  a small cottage.

Wells Fargo can refinance but the interest rate is 3.X% whereas the local bank was 2.X%.

What are my options here regarding this? The purchase price was $75K, and there is 51K left.

Thanks!",finance
personalfinance,"College student with 3 jobs, minimal bills: should I contribute to my Roth IRA or prioritize paying off student loans?","I’m 19 years old finishing the first semester of my sophomore year of college. Up until now, I’ve been here for Pre-nursing. Recently decided to change my major to Information Systems (IT) so I’ve racked up $8,700 in student loan debt for a major I want no part of anymore. If I pay this debt by January, it will not accrue interest. 

On the other hand, I would like to think about retirement as well. I work three jobs making about $1000 a month at $15/hr each. 2 of these jobs I pick my own hours so I really could be making much more… My monthly expenses total to around $800 a month. I have $7,000 in savings, $500 uninvested in a Roth IRA (just sitting there as of yet, Lol, still trying to decide what to invest in and figure out how to use Vanguard), and $1800 in stocks (if i were to sell everything right now). Would it be smarter to use my savings and “disposable income” (nothing is really disposable to me since I’m in debt) to pay off my student loans racked up so far, or to start investing in my retirement? 

Let me know if I should clarify anything!

Edit: $5,500 of my loans have an interest rate of 2.75% and $3,250 of my loans have an interest rate of 3.73%",finance

stocks,Evergrande is back in the news- Asian markets mixed after China Evergrande warns of cash woes,"Shares were mixed in Asia on Monday after troubled Chinese property developer Evergrande warned late Friday it may run out of money. Hong Kong dropped 1.2% but the Shanghai Composite index rose. South Korea’s benchmark advanced but Tokyo and Sydney declined. More broadly, investors are struggling with uncertainty about the newest coronavirus variant and about when the Federal Reserve will cut off its support for markets.

Regulators were scrambling to reassure investors after Evergrande, one of China’s biggest developers, said it may run out of money to “perform its financial obligations” as it struggles to comply with pressure to reduce its $310 billion in debt. The worry is that unsustainable levels of debt in the property sector might trigger a financial crisis. China wants to avoid a bailout but also is unlikely to let the situation deteriorate to the point where problems would cascade to that level.

A number of real estate companies have run into trouble as the government has pushed to reduce debt levels, but officials have issued statements saying China’s financial system is strong and default rates are low. Most developers are financially healthy and Beijing will keep lending markets functioning, the most recent statements said. Evergrande’s shares 3333, -19.56% plunged 9.8% early Monday, helping pull the Hang Seng HSI, -1.76% in Hong Kong down more than 1%.

Chinese tech giant Alibaba 9988, -5.53%, which has been embroiled in a multi-faceted crackdown on the industry, also dragged the benchmark lower, losing 5.4% after the company said it was replacing its chief financial officer, Maggie Wu and overhauling its e-commerce business.

In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 NIK, -0.36% gave up 0.4% and the S&amp;P/ASX 200 XJO, +0.05% in Sydney slipped 0.1%. The Shanghai Composite index SHCOMP, -0.50% rose 0.4%, while the Kospi 180721, +0.17% in Seoul edged 0.4% higher. Benchmark indexes in Singapore STI, 0.93%, Taiwan Y9999, -0.05% and Indonesia JAKIDX, 0.13% gained.

“This is a week that will force uncomfortable contemplation about ‘known unknowns’ mainly associated with omicron, Fed tightening and China (regulatory/property) risks,” Mizuho Bank said in a commentary. That will bring still more uncertainty, it said.

Last week’s volatile swings on Wall Street ended Friday with more losses for stocks, as a mixed batch of U.S. job market data triggered another bout of dizzying trading.

personalfinance,How do I set up myself financially for success ?,"I (24f) currently work retail and am honestly fed up with it. It’s a terrible industry that’s underpaid. Im exhausted and drained working full-time as well as the travel being 3hrs a day. I’ve tried to transfer to closer vacancies near home without success but it’s caused some discord between myself and my manger. They have told me there’s no point investing time in me since I’m being flakey. 

I work more hours then I want to and am taking on extra responsibilities without additional pay that I don’t want but am begrudgingly complying with to avoid more conflict. I feel like it’s an endless cycle of being broke. I have honestly cut my expenses to the bare minimum and give myself a monthly allowance of £100 so I don’t lose my mind. 

I contribute to my pension (NEST) monthly 3% I think. I also have a LISA and investment account with Hargreaves lansdown. I’ve unfortunately not been able to contribute much towards them. I have 3K debt that I am paying off as much as I can but it will probably take me a year to pay off. It’s mostly credit card debt as there was a 6 month period where my hours were cut to approx 10-15hrs so I couldn’t even afford my bills.

CryptoCurrency,What's causing the global markets ( crypto and stocks) to crumble?,"Answer is FEAR UNCERTAINITY DOUBT! ( FUD ).


Reasons for FUD :-


1) world is afraid of another global lockdown due to omicron


2) tourism and travel industry ( including restaurants and entertainment industry ) are badly hit


3) SEC chairman ( sebi equivalent of USA ) Gary Gensler stated "" inflation is not transistory"". This spooked the market.. as the markets took it as a sign that governments around the world will tighten monetary policy to curb inflation ( which is bad for stock and crypto markets )


4) US government has run out of money to repay even the interest on its loans. They may default in 2 weeks IF they dont raise debt ceiling ( which they obviously will )


5) uncertainity regarding Indias stance on crypto and upcoming regulations.


6) Risk of EVERGRANDE ( second biggest real estate company in china and one of the biggest in Asia ) defaulting on its loans. It is highly overleveraged and has loans to the tune of 100s of billions of dollars. CCP bailing them out is unlikely.



Remember the world has seen worse economic times. Time in the market beats everything. Stay calm. Take a break from staring at charts. Things will eventually get better unless you are memecoin holders!

Edit : The remark about inflation was from Jerome Powell and nor Gary Gensler",cryptocurrency
defi,What are the risks and rewards of DeFi?,"Traditionally, if you want to borrow US$10,000, you first need some assets or money already in the bank as collateral.

A bank employee reviews your finances, and the lender sets an interest rate for the repayment of your loan. The bank gives you the money out of its pool of deposits, collects your interest payments and can seize your collateral if you fail to repay.

Everything depends on the bank: It sits in the middle of the process and controls your money.

At the same time ""DeFiChain"" keeps its own consensus mechanism and function set, allowing for all those characteristics that Bitcoin does not inherently have. This is achieved by DeFiChain being a dedicated non-Turing-complete blockchain, designed specifically for the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry built on top of Bitcoin.",cryptocurrency
defi,Options for Earning with DeFi - Which is the Best? - Is My Assessment Correct?,"I'm trying to compare the different options available for earning with DeFi.

I don't have an extensive knowledge of this. This is my current understanding - Is this somewhat accurate?

Are their any other points that I should add?

I have added some questions under each section that I'm trying to answer

**Staking**

Contribute towards POS validation. You put tokens in as collateral and get rewards back in the form of tokens and tx fees?

Pros

* Low barrier to entry
* Doesn’t require a large time investment (Better for someone looking for ""passive income""
* Great for people who want to hold long term
* Reasonable interest rates (3-15%)

Cons

* Tokens must be locked for a set amount of time
* You are at risk of price volatility
* Fees for unstaking tokens early

Question: Where do staking rewards come from? - Are they from TX fees paid by users of the network, or do they come from the project devs (They have coins set aside to reward people who stake?)

**Yield Farming**

Unsure - You add tokens to a liquidity pools so that other people can buy / sell the token? - You get tokens back as a reward?

Pros

* Potential for higher gains (Super high APY)
* No need to lock tokens for a set amount of time

Cons

* Larger risk of tokens depreciating in value
* Prone to security issues (resulting in loss of tokens)
* Requires more monitoring than traditional staking
* Risk of rug pulls

Question: Where do rewards come from (Is it a % of the TX fees made by the DEX?)

Question: Do we often see super high APY on yield farming due to inflation? (It's likely the tokens value will drop significantly over time, so you probably won't earn as much as you are expecting?)

**Interest Account (BlockFi etc - Maybe not DeFi?)**

You hold assets in an account. They are lent out to borrowers for you and you benefit from the interest rate? - Hands off process.

Pros

* You have the option to make interest on low risk assets (USDT - 3%)
* You can also earn interest on other assets
* Does not require constant monitoring
* Low barrier to entry
* Low level of technical knowledge required

Cons

* Lower interest rates vs staking and yield farming
* Risk of price volatility with certain assets

Question: Where does the interest come from (Are your assets lent out to borrowers and you benefit from that?)

Lending Protocols (Aave etc)

I don't know about these, how do they work?

CryptoCurrency,Stop saying that Crypto is a hedge against inflation! It is not!,"Yes, you read the title right! We all know that bitcoin or whatever have a limited supply of 21 million coins and over 19 million have already been mine and it is a good hedge compared to gold. It is also easily transferable as a store of value compared to gold and it is transferrable, portable, secure and most importantly, decentralized.

But with all this bullshit happening in the market right now and all of this FUD, I am really starting to doubt if crypto can be use as a hedge anymore. When the inflation shot up so much across the entire nation, look at what happened to bitcoin. It dipped so hard, how can this be use as a hedge? With Fed tapering and all that FUD Hooha, the stock market corrected itself and had a huge dip. Crypto market in general dip as well!!! How can it be used as a hedge?

I would appreciate if someone can enlighten me and I am starting to doubt if crypto can be used as a hedge anymore. I am tired of losing money and I believe many are tired of losing it as well.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Is there a way to short Tether,"If hypothetically Tether is not backed by anything liquid and stable (dollars, gold, real world assets) and is instead backed by assorted cryptocurrencies which have themselves been propped up by purchases through Tether, then the whole system could implode. Is there a way to short Tether to hedge against this? As unlike in traditional shorts it would be impossible to get wrecked by Tether's price going up (as it is supposedly a stable coin). Whereas if there is a run on Tether its value could fall to 0.

E.g. could you borrow $100k Tether through Defi against collateral, swap it to USD coin, then yield farm $100k USD to offset the interest payments? Then if 1 tether became unpegged from 1 dollar its price would collapse to nothing so you could pay back the Defi contract for a tiny fraction and be 100k up.  

Edit\* I looked up to see if it is possible to offset the interest rates. Looks like you could borrow Tether through Aave at 3.96% , and earn 4% interest at Coinbase by lending USDC. You are missing out on potential interest earned by your collateral but would not be bleeding money. It could be worth a shot...",cryptocurrency
stocks,AT&amp;T vs Verizon vs T-Mobile: Are they worth the investment?,"The next step for telecommunications around the world is 5G. In the US, the three largest providers in the field are Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&amp;T. The question here is can they offer us a good return on our investment? The obvious choice for industries like telecommunications are the biggest players in the country. Like I said, in the US those players are Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&amp;T so lets dig in and find out which one has the best bullish case.

# Operations

Lets start with operations. The amount of wireless subscribers is probably the most important metric to look at because it gives us a good idea of whether the operations of the companies are actually expanding. Plus, it is the main and biggest source of revenue for all three of these companies. Verizon has the most subscribers, currently sitting at 121.3 million, followed by T-Mobile with 104.8 million and AT&amp;T with 97.8 million. Verizon acquired TracFone last year, which boosted their subscriber numbers, but apart from that there was no massive change in subscribers for any of the companies. Verizon has also recently broken the record for most awarded brand by JD Power for Wireless Network Quality with 27 consecutive number one awards. Good product quality is always important so that's a positive for Verizon in my books. Plus, they literally service 99% of the Fortune 500 companies and have partnerships with tech leaders like Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Right now, it seems like the main priority for all three companies is to improve their 5G network and capability. T-Mobile is the leader in 5G with best download speeds and highest coverage of 295 million having access to its 5G services, out of which 140 million people having access to its fastest service . AT&amp;T's fast 5G coverage is only half T-Mobile's and Verizon is lagging behind with only a quarter of the fast 5G coverage of T-Mobile although their total coverage is similar to T-Mobile's. However, AT&amp;T's 5G has a partnership with Microsoft Azure and Verizon's 5G has partnered with AWS. Such partnerships with major cloud providers are definitely a plus.

Verizon had Verizon Media which comprised of brands like AOL and Yahoo, but Verizon sold its media assets to a private equity company called Apollo Global Management on the 1st of September. The media business was a relatively fast-growing part of Verizon so I'm personally not the biggest fan of that sale. Still, Verizon Media made up only 6.2% of Verizon's total revenue in Q2 so it is a fairly small segment, but it will affect Verizon's revenue and profit going forward. In comparison, AT&amp;T owns Warner Media so you can tell it is a much bigger chunk of its revenue at 21.2% in the third quarter of 2021. They own HBO and HBO Max which have seen an additional 12.5 million subscribers in the past year to a total of 69.4 million subscribers globally. Unfortunately, the gains there were offset by less cinema screenings over the past year although things are obviously picking back up again and we should see better results in the next quarters. Some more bad news, AT&amp;T will be spinning off Warner Media in mid-2022 so that means a big chunk of revenue will be lost next year! I think this will end up badly for AT&amp;T, especially since Warner Media is one of their more profitable segments! Putting that aside, other revenue sources include wireless equipment sales which make up 16.3% of Verizon's revenue, 12.7% of AT&amp;T's revenue and 23.8% of T-Mobile's revenue. Even though it's a big chunk of T-Mobile's revenue, the company actually saw a 5.9% decrease in wireless equipment sales while AT&amp;T saw an 11.4% increase and Verizon saw a massive 30% jump in equipment revenues, which is another plus for Verizon although the question here is whether they can actually keep that up.

# Revenue and Earnings

Alright, so we now have a good idea of what operations Verizon, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile have. What does their revenue and earnings look like though? AT&amp;T has the biggest revenue at $39.9 billion in Q3 of 2021, down 5.7% from last year. Their total revenue for the last 12 months stands at $173.6 billion, which is almost identical to the same period last year, meaning there was no growth. Verizon follows in second place with a $32.9 billion revenue in Q3 of 2021, up 4.3% from last year. Their total revenue for the last 12 months stands at $134.2 billion which is slightly up compared to the same period last year when they had a revenue of $128.4 billion. Finally, T-Mobile brought in a revenue of $19.6 billion in Q3 of 2021 compared to $19.3 billion last year. Last year, T-Mobile saw a massive jump in revenue which was mainly because of their merger with Sprint which closed on 1st April last year, but the growth since then has been much slower. For the last 12 months, T-Mobile's revenue was $79.7 billion up from $60 billion last year, but again that's because of the two companies merging. Overall, Verizon and AT&amp;T have seen a relatively small revenue growth over the last 5 years, less than 2% per year, and they only expect a 1% revenue increase next year. In comparison, T-Mobile's revenue has doubled since 2016, which is massive compared to Verizon and AT&amp;T, but again only a small revenue increase of under 3% is expected next year. What about their earnings though? Verizon have the best net margins at 16.4% which have doubled from an 8% in 2015. Plus, Verizon raised their EPS guidance for 2021 by almost 5%. AT&amp;T's normal margins sit at around 9% although they've had a 0.7% net margin in the past year which are due to write-offs and impairments surrounding their media business. Finally, T-Mobile have the lowest margins with 4.2% right now although their historical average is about 5 or 6%. T-Mobile also have a negative free cash flow unlike the other two, which is a bit concerning. It's not a one-off either as they haven't had a positive free cash flow since 2016! That is most likely due to their faster expansion because telecommunications is extremely capital-intensive, but it is still worrying to see that with T-Mobile. In 2022, AT&amp;T is expected to see a 4.4% drop in earnings while Verizon's earnings are expected to stay essentially flat with only a 0.3% earnings growth, but T-Mobile is looking at a 39.2% earnings growth although that follows after a drop of 32% in 2021. I personally don't think we will see such a big growth from T-Mobile and, to be fair, analysts have been reducing their expectations, too. There are just a lot of uncertainties in the market and the economy and a lot can change over the next year. 

# Financial Health

We can see that these companies are making a lot of cash, but how healthy are their financials? What does their debt look like? Well, surprisingly, AT&amp;T has the lowest debt-to-equity ratio with a 100%, followed by T-Mobile with 106% and finally Verizon with 191.8%! However, Verizon has the lowest effective interest rate with only 1.88% compared to 3.07% for T-Mobile and 3.31% for AT&amp;T. What that means is that even though Verizon has exactly twice the debt of AT&amp;T, their interest payments actually are not that much higher! Also, telecommunications is a very capital-intensive business so this type of debt levels are actually normal for the industry. None of the three companies has substantial cash and none of them can cover their current liabilities with their current assets. However, their quick ratios are just under 1 so the situation is not that bad. 

# Dividend

Before we move to the valuation, we need to look at the dividend. Telecom stocks are not typically fast growers so their dividend is important to investors. AT&amp;T has the highest dividend at 9.4%, but they are expected to cut it by almost half next year following the sale of Warner Media. Verizon follows with a 5.1% dividend while T-Mobile does not pay a dividend at all! Both AT&amp;T and Verizon pay a higher-than-average dividend. Both of them have increased their dividend every year over the last 10 years although Verizon is the company that can actually afford to pay it. Their payout ratio is 47% whereas AT&amp;T's one is massive, 1,578% although that's skewed due to the write-offs I mentioned earlier. Still, AT&amp;T has a historically higher payout ratio than Verizon so that's worth keeping in mind. Lets also take a look at share buybacks since they are another way of returning money to shareholders. Verizon and T-Mobile have not bought back any shares in the last 3 years, but AT&amp;T has actually reduced their number of outstanding shares by 2.5% since 2018. 

# Valuation

Okay, we've covered the dividend so lets value the companies. Are they cheap right now? Looking at their current PE, we can see that Verizon is the cheapest with 9.5, followed by T-Mobile with 39.8 and AT&amp;T with 168.2. Obviously, the current PE can be misleading, but if we take a look at their forward PE, we see that AT&amp;T is the cheapest with only 7.3, followed by Verizon with 9.6 and T-Mobile with 32. In terms of the Price-to-earnings-growth ratio, T-Mobile is the cheapest with a 1.11, followed by Verizon with 2.9 and AT&amp;T with 9.6. Finally, AT&amp;T is the cheapest in terms of book value with a PB ratio of 1.04, T-Mobile follows with 2.07 and Verizon with 2.93. 

# Conclusion

How can we interpret all of this? Well, AT&amp;T seems to be the cheapest out of the three stocks right now, followed by Verizon. T-Mobile is massively overvalued right now, most likely by investors betting on T-Mobile dominating the 5G market. I honestly cannot see the bullish case for T-Mobile though. Even if they completely dominate the 5G market, they still have such low margins, negative free cash flow and a lot of costs related to capital expenditure. I just don't see them justifying this high price any time soon, definitely not in the next 2 or 3 years. Despite being cheap, AT&amp;T is also a no-go in my books. Why? Their main selling point is their dividend. AT&amp;T will be cutting this in half while also selling their high margin Warner Media subsidiary. Essentially, there is no point to hold them for the dividend and they will also lag behind in revenue and profits so there is no value play there either. It just seems like their best days are behind them. They currently trade for $22.2 which is half of their all-time high back in July 1999. 22 years ago! They have not been able to come close to that price and, in my opinion, they will not do that in the next 5 years. Definitely not worth the investment. You can just stick your money in an index fund and you will get much better returns without having to do more than 5 minutes of research. Plus, AT&amp;T's price is likely to drop further once the Warner Media sale is closed and their dividend drops. The only good purchase here is Verizon. They have a solid dividend, decent margins, they can provide stability during volatile markets. However, they are not expected to grow much. No growth typically equals no jump in price. We can value their free cash flow as much as we want, but if investors don't buy the stock, the price will lag behind the S&amp;P. Still, I think there is a case for Verizon if we see continued inflation or an increase in interest rates. As I said, Verizon's dividend is also solid, which is great for income portfolios or for balancing out your risk. However, if you are looking for price appreciation, a simple US index fund like SPY or VGT will probably outperform Verizon. There are some companies that can offer you a better return so check out my stock picks here if you are interested. Let me know what you think about Verizon, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile down below. 

P.S. This is one of the occasions where you spend a weekend researching companies only to come to the conclusion that S&amp;P500 probably offers better returns! I hope you find this useful though :)",finance

*24 years old


*Associates degree


*$80-100k hourly worker


*$40,000 in savings account


* Very few expenses aside from cheap rent and food, we'll call it $1000/ish a month


*Currently living on a small island off the coast of Puerto Rico, but will be moving back to Chicago next November/December and living with parents again. Will definitely need to buy a new car once I get back, budgeting for about $25/30k


*Starting online Bachelor's degree in January, around $3k a semester for 4 semesters over next 2 years. Planning on paying each semester off in full as I go through the program.


*Max contribution to work 401k. Was hoping to fully fund my Roth IRA next year, but aside from that no real investments.


So with all that being said, I think I've put myself in a position to where I can pay off my loans in full and get them off my back. While that would be nice to not have to worry about, I've recently started reconsidering if that's worth the potential financial loss I'll be taking if I can do something else with the money and get greater gains from it. My goal for next year was to leave my current company with 100k in savings and all my debt paid off so I can go heavily into investing that money.

personalfinance,Military - Separate or retire [LONG],"I see lots of posts on here about Military folks questioning on getting out. So here is yet another. 

I'll be a 12 year E6 in spring of 2022, and I'm on the fence about separating at 12 years. I don't hate the Air Force, I just don't feel like it's for me anymore. I know I am being under payed for my value, and I'd like more freedom. I'm working in a civilian environment, I pretty much have none of the typical military duties (no people to supervise, no unit physical training, no oversight by MIL folks, no additional duties, etc). At this point the most Air Force thing I do is put on the uniform and cash a paycheck. Most days I forget I'm even in the military. I love my daily job, however I would not be able to continue doing it if I were to get out. I will also never hit E7+ without getting out of my daily job. No degree and no desire to commission taking on the extra BS. 

I am disgruntled about pay, and I know the military will never pay as well as the private/contracting sector. I take home $76696 pretax a year, of which $22896 is untaxable. I've done the napkin math, and including healthcare I'd then be having to pay for -- that's roughly the equivalent of $97211 pretax in the civilian market. My math is below, please feel free to provide any feedback on it. I'd be retiring at 39, and if I lived to 77 the pension alone is worth $1.16 Million in today’s money. 

I received a job offer in MD, which I accepted, of $190k (salary) a year (comes out to around $124k take home after federal/state/local taxes). They're going through the background investigation process now, but I still haven’t hit the ""separate"" button yet on the military -- i.e I'm not ""officially"" getting out in spring until I click it. I also have a ex-coworker who referred me to a separate company he now works at whose total compensation is $240k in a WA (salary of $150k), his supervisor reached out over the weekend and asked me to officially apply. 

At this point I'm torn. I could easily put in for an easy year in Korea, followed by three more in Germany, and back to the states for the last four and retire as an E7/E8 (having enjoyed the rest of my time) -- taking home between $30k-35k a year for as long as I breath. BUT I could also take a higher paying job and essentially ""buy back"" that same military pension with all of the additional money I'd be earning. 

I understand there are other benefits like base access, healthcare, etc. The only other benefit beyond pension I care about would be healthcare. But having lived with military healthcare for almost 12 years...I'm solely looking at pension for this decision. I fall under the old system of high3, which is the average monthly base pay of the last 3 years, multiplied by .5. Military pension is taxed. Also, let’s not consider disability in this. I'm fairly healthy. 

I'm 31 years old, no wife/kids, only debt is a car, $130k in Roth TSP, $76k in Roth IRA, $8k between checking/savings. I found YNAB early, received a nice bonus a few years back which I saved. We don't have bonuses right now for my job. I know in MD I'd have a higher cost of living then I do now, and pay state/local tax. And in WA I'd have a higher cost of living, but no state tax. I this ""buying back"" your pension by earning more a valid idea? I know I'd have to watch out for lifestyle creep, and actually have to continue save money. I'd also like more stability in my life and settle down somewhere... also leading me to separating. I know life isn't all about money, I grew up middle of middle class with a good family, but damn life is sure easier with some extra money...whether it an additional $40k/yr for life, or $190k+ a year. Of course this all involves lots of assumptions (keeping that high of a paying job, making it to retirement, staying healthy, etc) but does a pension really matter when you earnt hat much?

Maths:

* In 2020, the average monthly individual costs were: $456 for health insurance, $14-60 for dental, and $5-15 for vision. All in all, $475-$531 a month. But, because it's hard to calculate lets add an additional 20% ontop of the larger number. Better to OVERESTIMATE than underestimate -- $637/mo .. $7644/yr
* 12yr E6 $4115, $375 SDAP, $1548 BAH, $360 BAS, no state income tax. First, calculate yearly total TAXABLE income: 4115 + 375 = 4490 \* 12 = $53800. Next calculate UNTAXABLE income: 360 + 1548 = 1908 \* 12 = $22896. I make a total of $76696 a year. Plug $53800 in the smartassets income tax calculator with a TX zip, filing single, 1 exemption. The ""Income after Taxes"" field is what I'm looking at, currently it's $44786. Take this amount and add the previously calculated untaxable income to it, $22896, totaling $67682. Adjust the ""household income"" field to $86346, the ""Income after Taxes"" is now $67682. I'd need to make $86346 to essentially take home the same amount of money I do now ($76696) after taxes
* Paying for healthcare. The yearly cost ($7644) needs to be added in a way where it doesn't come out of my take home pay (I don't pay anything now). Take the previous income after taxes ($67682) and add the yearly health care costs to it, $75326. Adjust the ""household income"" field to $97211
* E7 at 20 year pension collecting from 39-77: ($5095 \* .5) \* 12 = $30570 ($1,161,660)
* Taking $97211 and adding $30570 (to buy back each year’s pension), I'd need to make a minimum of $129479 a year.",finance
stocks,SEC probes Tesla over whistleblower claims on solar panel defects,"[Reuters link](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/exclusive-sec-probes-tesla-over-whistleblower-claims-solar-panel-defects-2021-12-06/)

The U.S. securities regulator has opened an investigation into Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) over a whistleblower complaint that the company failed to properly notify its shareholders and the public of fire risks associated with solar panel system defects over several years, according to a letter from the agency.

The probe raises regulatory pressure on the world's most valuable automaker, which already faces a federal safety probe into accidents involving its driver assistant systems. Concerns about fires from Tesla solar systems have been published previously, but this is the first report of investigation by the securities regulator.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission disclosed the Tesla probe in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by Steven Henkes, a former Tesla field quality manager, who filed a whistleblower complaint on the solar systems in 2019 and asked the agency for information about the report.

Henkes, a former Toyota Motor quality division manager, was fired from Tesla in August 2020 and he sued Tesla claiming the dismissal was in retaliation for raising safety concerns. Tesla did not respond to Reuters' emailed questions, while the SEC declined to comment.

In the SEC complaint, Henkes said Tesla and SolarCity, which it acquired in 2016, did not disclose its ""liability and exposure to property damage, risk of injury of users, fire etc to shareholders"" prior and after the acquisition.

Tesla also failed to notify its customers that defective electrical connectors could lead to fires, according to the complaint.

Henkes, in the SEC complaint, said he told Tesla management that Tesla needs to shut down the fire-prone solar systems, report to safety regulators and notify consumers. When his calls were ignored, he proceeded to file complaints with regulators.

""The top lawyer cautioned any communication of this issue to the public as a detriment to the Tesla reputation. For me this is criminal,"" he said in the SEC complaint.

Litigation and concerns over faulty connectors and Tesla solar system issues stretch back several years. Walmart in a 2019 lawsuit against Tesla said the latter's roof solar system led to seven store fires. Tesla denied the allegations and the two settled.",finance

personalfinance,Is it ever a smart choice to convert Federal Direct Student Loans to private loans?,[deleted],finance
finance,Was president Erdogan right to reduce interest rates?,,finance
personalfinance,What loan term should I choose when refinancing my student loans?,"I'm looking into refinancing my student loans. Currently I have 4 different federal loans, all of which I could get a better interest rate on if I refinance.

| Principal | Interest Rate |
|:----------|:--------------|
| $33,514 | 6.83% |
| $48,649 | 5.05% |
| $20,495 | 5.83% |
| $20,500 | 4.05% |

This comes out to $123,203 with an average interest rate of 5.51%.

My monthly budget gives me $1,500 per month that I can afford to pay towards my student loans. I'm already contributing 6% of my gross income to a Roth 401k in order to get a 3% match from my employer (matched in one lump sum each year, fully vested after 5 years).

I've shopped around on refinancing and found the best quotes for payoff periods of 10, 15, and 20 years (7 years left me with too high a monthly payment). Here's a breakdown of those quotes:

| Term | Interest Rate | Monthly Payment |
|:-----|:--------------|:----------------|
| 10 years | 3.27% | $1205.07 |
| 15 years | 3.74% | $895.35 |
| 20 years | 3.84% | $736.24 |

So I have a two options:

1. I chould choose the loan with the lowest interest rate and pay $1500 per month towards it.
2. I could choose any of these loans, may the monthly minimum, and put the rest of the $1500 monthly into my Roth 401k or Roth IRA.

Based on some back-of-the-envelope calculations, it seems best to choose the 20-year loan and put the rest into retirement, but obviously the least risk-averse option is to choose the 10-year loan and pay it off as quickly as possible.",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay off all my student loans?,"I’ve recently come into 60k and I’m wondering if I should pay off some (or all) of my student loans, refinance, or wait. I graduated with a Master’s in Finance before starting my job. I’m 24 with 3 years of work experience at a government job although my current outlook is not staying there much longer. My annual salary is about 95k. I currently contribute 7% to retirement with employer match. Beyond my student loan student loans, I have no other debt. I currently have 6 months worth of savings. With those aspects in mind, I don’t really see PSLF as an option (both because I might leave but also the loans will be paid off before I’m eligible). Below is my rough loan situation. I graduated in late 2019 just before the pandemic came so most of these have the full principal left but little interest (until January 2022).

|Loan|Amount|Interest Rate|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Perkins|10k|5%|
|Graduate PLUS|10k|7.6%|
|Stafford Subsidized|5k|4.29%|
|Stafford Subsidized|5k|3.76%|
|Stafford Unsubsidized|25k|6.6%|

My general thinking is I’d rather have some majority of the money left rather than pay everything off. I looked into refinancing some or all of the loans and the interest rates range from 2.5-3.19%. I do understand these are all Federal loans so there is some value lost in refinancing, although my general outlook is I wouldn’t benefit from too much. I don’t anticipate too much loan forgiveness (if any). Talk of interest rates increasing has me wanting to try and lock in something now.

Here’s my plan: Pay off 20k and refinance the remainder of the Perkins, Graduate PLUS, and Stafford Unsubsidized (effectively refinancing 25k at about 3% interest). Leave the 10k in Stafford Subsidized as is. The extra bps isn’t worth losing any potential Federal perks.

personalfinance,What to do with substantial equity?,"New/Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I've been told I'm too fiscally conservative and experience paralysis by analysis. I admit I do not like change all that much.

**Do I pull equity out of my home to build an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) or continue to build equity for use down the road? What am I missing? This no-brainer idea just isn't as palatable as I'm told it should be. Zooming out even further, what do people do with this equity in general, if anything?

I have a 'good' problem I suppose that's been gnawing at me quite a bit and it's resulting in uncertainty and doubt.

I'm 55, live in a desirable area that has quite a bit of tourism, have a very stable, relatively well paying job, have excellent credit, no kids, no other debt then my home. I have never inherited significant money or have had any help with my finances from family. My parents are extremely tight lipped about their finances and don't have a will. I have an able bodied brother a few years older then me who has been dependent on them to a degree for years. I am planning my future as though I will not be getting an inheritance. 

I purchased a multi-unit property just after the RE crash in 2009. Back when my interest rate was 5+% I would pay additional principal on the loan monthly. I have since refi'd down to 2.3% for 15 years and no longer pay additional principle, but rather put that money in a reasonable investment that makes more then 2.3%.

I plan to retire at 62, but could potentially retire earlier if I no longer find work tolerable. I live in one of the units I've purchased and rent out the rear unit. As property value and rents have increased over the years, the other unit on the property pays for the entire property including taxes and then some. It's easy at this point. My home is small, some additional space would be nice, but it works. I also have a shop in the garage that has been something I've wanted for a long time. I don't rely on the shop for income, just hobbies, additional space, work on cars, a place to help out friends, have a few beers, etc. 

Property taxes where I live are lower then many locations but property is ridiculously expensive. Over the years the property value has gone up quite a bit. Based on the recent assessment for the refi it appears I have over 1.1 million in equity with a note on the property just under 300K. My plan was to have this completely paid off by the time I retire, which is tracking just fine. 

Recently the area that live in has made building ADU's fairly streamlined. I have several colleagues that have taken advantage of this and for the most part are glad they did. Some have very strong opinions and suggest that if I don't take advantage of this opportunity it would be a huge mistake. Building expenses have increased substantially, but money is cheap. 

I don't know what to do. I don't want to look back and regret not developing the property, or doing something 'smart' with the equity, but I'm certainly not looking forward to the immediate impacts (some listed below):
- living through the construction process
- practically speaking I believe this would cost approx. $400k, so new mortgage would be about $700K
- due to parking requirements I would lose my shop
- additional congestion and occupancy on my property due to the ADU occupants may reduce quality of life a bit.

With the new construction being taxed at today's rates I'm thinking the new payment would be somewhere in the neighborhood of $5k/mo. I believe both units would cover that and I could live 'for free', but the hopes to pay off the property prior to retirement are reduced and I lose my shop. 

I have been told ""Just rent out all three units, buy something else and let the rental pay for it."" Problem is coming up with a significant down payment that would make that happen is challenging and I've always thought having a mortgage paid off at retirement was 'good'. I'd prefer to not work until I'm 70 as well. 

If you've made it this far, thank you. I feel as though I'm just not seeing how building on the property is a no-brainer like a few colleagues have suggested. I don't want be in debt for the rest of my life however I am trying to stay open minded and understand why different view points make more sense then mine.",finance
CryptoCurrency,If your panic selling crypto right now because of all the FUD then you were never in it for the right reasons.....,"#TENDIES TENDIES TENDIES 

if that was your reasoning for buying crypto then your probably in the growing pool of panic sellers who have liquidated their positions in the last few days because you didn't buy because you believe in blockchain technology, the future of commerce, or ending the central banks monopoly on money...all you wanted was to make empty fiat gains. Of course we all want to make money but if you believe in the technology and know that it is the only way forward to end the strangle hold the central banks have on monetary policy then your far less likely to panic sell during times like this. 

My recommendation to those of you just in it for the money is to learn about the tech so you can see its potential and then you will be better off mentally during troubling times like this and will have a stronger resolve to HODL! 

I also think this has been a wake up call that perhaps the very rapid adoption by crypto novices recently is not necessarily a good thing as the newest investors into crypto seem to be the first to sell at the initial sign of trouble and or take up highly leveraged positions that get liquidated and create the cascading sell offs we've seen recently.

personalfinance,Trying to do a cash-out refi on my mortgage to pay off some debt. Hitting roadblocks. Advice?,"Wife and I purchased our home in 2018 through the VA for 155k at 4.75%, 30 years. At the time our combined income was 100k.

Fast forward to now. Both in the midst of career changes, finishing up schooling, working part-time. Combined income is 50k, which includes an $1800 BAH allowance we receive from GI bill.

I currently owe 146k. My mortgage website *says* we have $104k in equity, based off a Zillow estimate of 250k and an Xhome estimate of 226k. 

I could essentially eliminate all personal debt, student loans included, with the equity. Which would greatly improve our financial situation. So I call my lender. On his end, my house is estimated at 200k, which still gives me equity of about 50k.

No big deal, I figure. I can still take care of pretty much everything except my student loans and likely have a smaller monthly payment on the house with a lower interest rate. Still a win.

Wrong, I guess. Lender starts talking about ""accessible"" equity and seems to be losing confidence that I can do anything right now. When we first got on the line, he was optimistic and excited to help. After providing updates about our situation, several long holds while he ""crunched numbers,"" the phone call ended with him saying he needs to get final approval from his manager and will call me back, with a less than optimistic tone. I doubt I will hear back.

Can someone explain to me how this all works? Would it be worth my time to look into refinancing through someone else?",finance
stocks,Millennials complain about boomers but then tout investing in S&amp;P 500 funds,"To start, I (28M) am far from any kind of investing expert. I also want to say that I'm generally opposed to how much our society obsesses about generational differences.

That said, I'm one of many millenials who believe that we've been dealt a really shitty hand and totally agree that it's frustrating af when boomers don't understand why we don't want to buy a home, a car, etc. Clearly, the system has not been working well for younger generations.

So, something that I find fascinating is how so much millenial/gen Z financial investing advice (when not of the WSB variety) is to just invest in the total stock market/S&amp;P 500. Is this not actively putting our money into capitalism writ large? Is this not supporting the status quo that has led to such monstrous wealth inequality? (Reminder: something like 100 people own 50% of the world's wealth.) 

It has taken me a ton of time and effort but I've spent the past few years doing my best to create a reasonably well-diversified portfolio that also doesn't hold companies actively engaged in fossil fuels, tobacco, guns, etc. I realize, of course, that not everyone has this much time or energy to spend and would rather just do what's considered a safe bet. If our planet is severely f'ed up in 20-30 years, however, due to climate change, social unrest, etc., it may not matter that much how safe of a bet it is now. 

Anyway, kind of a rant but I hope maybe some food for thought as well. Perhaps people who feel the way I do can post some of the ESG stocks they're long in.",finance
personalfinance,Advice for getting a car in the current market?,"I think that car prices right now (especially used) are higher than they will be in the future. However, I need a car in a couple of months. I want to know what the best option is. I don't have many constraints, but I would prefer a hybrid or electric car since gas is around $4.50 a gallon. You can assume I will travel 150 miles per week, mostly highway. Also, I'm obviously willing to pay more for a nicer car, but only up to a certain point and I have no idea what that point is.

I think I can get an auto loan in the ballpark of 1.9-2.5% APR from my insurance company on a new car. A used car loan will have a higher interest rate. Alternatively, I can just buy a car in cash. But, I think that won't be worth it since the interest rate is so low.

I can also lease a car and then buy one in (hopefully) a better market. However, I'll be paying a similar amount to a car loan (for a shorter amount of time) with nothing to show for it.

Another option is to buy someone out of their lease--I have no idea how this works.

Anyone have any advice? I'm not sure what to do since there are so many options and I have a hard time quantifying what I want in a car.

stocks,The greatest wealth transfer in history?,"This is in response to a comment earlier about millennial buying the assets boomers are selling. If we are talking about current stocks I would argue the opposite is happening. Stocks are so expensive (both in P/E and nominal pricing). Because housing and stocks weren't truly allowed to collapse during covid millennial are buying assets at high valuations when recessions are normally times for generational wealth transfer. As Boomers are more in wealth preservation they are not at as much risk from a market collapse as younger people are at this point. 

I think the way millennial will become the wealthiest generation in the world would be through inheritance. This of course will mean that a specific few millennials will be extremely wealthy and the less fortunate will have to deal with the consequences of astronomical debt. We see repeatedly that federal government is inclined to cut taxes on the wealthy and corporations and cut spending on social and infrastructure programs that benefit the many.",finance

## Celsius

## Pros

* Interest rates second-highest of all companies
* Large number of supported coins
* Most security features of any company
* Unlike other companies, has a website in addition to a phone app

## Cons

* CEL tokens are a huge part of their business
* A small issue with Celsius could cause a blowout in the price of CEL tokens, causing potential problems if Celsius doesn't drop rates quickly
* Token lending firm that is not publicly listed on stock exchange, so no financial health reporting requirement with legal penalties attached
* Interest rates seem too good to be true in many cases
* (Disqualifying) Widely known for their exceptionally poor customer service - to the point of not replying at all to some tickets
* (Disqualifying) Unable to determine state banking license numbers

## Pros

* Higher interest rate then BlockFi for bitcoins
* Accepts Bitcoin Cash, which many companies do not
* Well-known for its exchange
* Gemini Custody is safer than personal wallets for most people
* Fully licensed in New York state (see below)
* Does not charge for the first 20 withdrawals per month

## Cons

* Does not offer interest on key stablecoins - even on its own stablecoin
* Mismatch between its list of ""approved lenders"" and its interest rates
* Lacks support for some of the fastest appreciating coins, like Ethereum Classic
* Deceptive advertising - press release about ""Earn"" program issued before it was actually available to most customers

* (Disqualifying) Almost every product is dependent upon the CRO token

Crypto.com scared me. Every single product, or so it seemed, involved their CRO token in some way. If the CRO token wasn't involved, the interest rates were uncompetitive.

One of the most amazing deals they advertise is an 8% cash back bonus on their Visa card. This deal is unbelievable because it is far better than interest on dollars. You can spend as much as you want on the card and earn 8% immediately, rather than having to wait a year to earn 8%.

personalfinance,Calculating tax for IRA to Roth conversion,"I have a rollover traditional IRA which is about 7 years old now. At some point I started putting money in Roth IRA and left the traditional untouched. This year my wife has been unemployed and my salary is lower than it has been and will likely be the lowest ever since I am starting in a new industry. My wife is looking for a job. I think this would be a good time to convert it and save on taxes owed.

I did a rough calculation on income (I have 2 jobs). And it looks like I might just tip over a fed tax bracket. So I suppose I can convert say 90% of the traditional IRA to Roth IRA so that I fall in the lower tax bracket. Any suggestions on how to get the calculations right? Any tools that I can use? I don't have the W2 yet. Also does my strategy make sense?

EDIT: Thanks for all the replies. I forgot that with taxes it's the %of income that falls within that track that gets taxed.

So my annual income comes out to be $63k without conversion. With conversion it goes to 107k. So with $25k deductible, it comes to be $82k. The 22% tax bracket is around $81k. Does this help decide if it is worth converting? Now that I think about it I can also move the money after I retire and still have it fall in about the same tax brackets as now as others have pointed out.

personalfinance,Using 529 plan to pay student loans for state tax deduction. Am I doing this right?,"This is something new I learned today and I wanted to check with you guys to see if my understanding is correct and I'm taking the right steps to take advantage of a 529 plan. TIA!

Under the SECURE act, student loans have been added as a qualified expense that can be paid for by 529 plans as of 2019. There is a lifetime limit of $10,000 from a 529 plan that can be used without any penalties or tax consequences to repay the beneficiary's student loans, including federal and most private loans.The Virginia529 (VA is the state my spouse and I currently reside) allows state residents to deduct annual contributions up to a limit of $4,000 for taxpayers filing married/jointly.

With the current COVID-19 forbearance, we've been saving to make a bulk payment towards my wife's federal student loan debt once forbearance ends in Jan. Based on the info above, are there any issues with the following plan to take advantage of a 529?

1. Open a Virginia529 with wife as beneficiary in Dec 2021 and contribute $4,000.
2. Contribute an additional $4,000 in Jan 2022.
3. Towards the end of Jan (before forbearance ends) pay off highest interest student loans by withdrawing $8,000 from Virginia529 and using any remaining savings reserved for student loans.
4. Make regular payments in 2022.
5. Contribute additional $2,000 to 529 in Jan 2023 and withdraw to make an additional $2,000 payment in 2023 to complete $10,000 lifetime limit.

This would effectively allow me to take the maximum annual 529 state tax deductions in 2021, 2022, and 2023. We've been saving to make a bulk student loan payment anyway, might as well route $10,000 of it through a 529 to take advance of the state tax deductions right?

Also, one caveat to this is that plan holders cannot claim any student loan interest deductions paid with a 529. Earlier this month, I also paid exactly $2,500 in student loan interest to get the max annual deduction for interest paid on student loans in 2021. My plan above wouldn't impact this because that payment was not through 529, correct?",finance

CryptoCurrency,"Overconfidence among young investors, because you hardly read about failures","[Source, translated from Dutch](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2021/12/06/jongeren-schatten-risico-van-beleggen-in-crypto-verkeerd-in-a4067983)

&amp;#x200B;

At first glance, it makes perfect sense: 42 percent of young Dutch adults between the ages of eighteen and thirty are investing. Now that savings rates have completely evaporated under the pressure of monetary policy, young people (like older people) are looking for other ways to grow their fortunes. At the same time, there is always the risk of loss: an investment can increase in value, but certainly also decrease.

&amp;#x200B;

The study by Rabobank and budget educator Nibud, which underlies these figures, also found that 27 percent of young people say they invest in crypto-currencies. Investing in these digital currencies, of which bitcoin and ethereum are the best known, is very risky. The value fluctuations amount to many percent per day, up and down. Typical for the young investor: they overestimate the chance of profit and underestimate the risk of loss. Youthful hubris.

&amp;#x200B;

The popularity of crypto investing cannot come as a surprise. The massive attention on social and traditional media to crypto currencies has translated into a collective parlor game. The conversation at the pub and between young people soon turns to crypto. Everyone is doing it, so why not you?

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, everyone, including adult youth, is free to spend their money as they see fit within the limits of the law. Whether that's sports, stamp collecting, or investing. And that young people assess risks differently than older people is also a given and not something to be au fondly concerned about.",cryptocurrency

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**PLAN WITHDRAWALS AND DISTRIBUTIONS**  
&gt;  
&gt;***In general*** — The taxable portion of a distribution (pre-tax contributions, Company match contributions, rollover contributions and all investment earnings on those contributions and any investment earnings on traditional after-tax contributions) will, in general, be subject to ordinary income taxes. In addition, any taxable amount you receive before age 591⁄2 that is not due to your death, disability, payment of tax-deductible medical expenses, or separation from service after you have attained age 55 will be subject to a 10% penalty tax. (The 10% penalty does not apply to distributions made to comply with Qualified Domestic Relations Orders “QDROs”.)  
&gt;  
&gt;***Plan Withdrawals and Distributions*** — These same rules apply to distributions based on financial hardship.  
&gt;  
&gt;Federal income tax rules also require that Federal income tax be withheld at a rate of 20% on all cash distributions and withdrawals eligible for rollover to an Individual Retirement Account (an ""IRA"") or a subsequent employer's tax-qualified plan, unless the distribution is payable to an IRA or a subsequent employer's tax-qualified plan (see ""Rollovers"" below).  
&gt;  
&gt;If you were age 50 or older on January 1, 1986, special ten-year averaging rules may be available with respect to the taxable portion of your RELX 401(k) Plan distribution. The rules with respect to this special ten-year averaging are complex and it is recommended that you see your tax advisor for an explanation of the rules if you believe that these provisions might be applicable to the taxation of your RELX 401(k) Plan distribution.  
&gt;  
&gt;***Rollovers*** — Individuals who receive certain distributions from the Plan may roll over all or a portion of the distribution into an IRA, a Roth IRA or a tax-qualified plan of a subsequent employer (if permitted by the subsequent employer's plan), in order to avoid current taxation on the distribution from the Plan. After-tax distributions from the Plan (and the earnings thereon) are also eligible for rollover into an IRA, a Roth IRA or a tax qualified plan of a subsequent employer (if permitted by the subsequent employer’s plan). Neither the rollover nor income earned on the amounts rolled over, in general, will be taxed until they are distributed from the rollover account (to the extent they represent pre-tax funds). If the rollover is to an IRA, pre-tax amounts distributed from the IRA are taxed as ordinary income and will not qualify for the special ten-year averaging treatment described above. Roth 401(k) after-tax contributions are eligible to be rolled over into a Roth IRA or into a 401(k) plan that accepts Roth 401(k) after-tax rollover contributions.  
&gt;  
&gt;A tax-free rollover from the Plan may be made if the distribution is an ""eligible distribution."" An eligible distribution (i) is not part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments over the life expectancy of the participant, the joint life expectancy of the participant and the participant's designated beneficiary or a specified period of at least 10 years, (ii) is not a minimum distribution required after the participant has attained age 70 1⁄2, (iii) does not represent amounts returned to the participant because they were in excess of those permitted to be contributed to the Plan and (iv) does not represent pre-tax contributions taken as a hardship withdrawal.  
&gt;  
&gt;A participant who chooses to have a distribution from the Plan made directly to the participant's IRA or subsequent employer's tax-qualified plan that accepts rollovers (i) will not be taxed on the distribution in the current year and no income tax will be withheld from the amount distributed, and (ii) will be taxed later as amounts are distributed from the IRA or the other employer's plan.  
&gt;  
&gt;If the participant chooses to have the Plan pay the distribution or withdrawal to the participant, the participant will receive only 80% of the taxable portion of the distribution, because the Plan administrator is required to withhold 20% of the taxable portion of the distribution and send it to the IRS as income tax withholding to be credited against the participant's income taxes in the year in which such taxes are withheld. The participant can roll over the remaining 80% of the payment by paying it to the participant's IRA or to another employer's tax-qualified plan that accepts rollovers. This payment must be made within 60 days of receiving the distribution. The amount rolled over will not be taxed until it is distributed from the IRA or other employer's plan. The participant will be taxed on the 20% portion of the distribution that was withheld and not rolled over and may also be subject to the 10% early withdrawal tax described above on such amounts withheld.  
&gt;  
&gt;If the participant wants to roll over 100% of the taxable portion of a distribution to an IRA or subsequent employer's tax-qualified plan, the participant must find other money to replace the 20% that was withheld. In this case, the 20% withheld will be eligible for refund after filing of the participant's tax return and none of the amount rolled over will be taxed until distributed from the IRA or subsequent employer's plan.  
&gt;  
&gt;In general, the rules summarized above that apply to payments to a participant also apply to payments to the surviving spouse of a participant and to the former spouse who is an alternate payee under a Qualified Domestic Relations Order.  
&gt;  
&gt;More specific information on the tax treatment of payments from qualified plans is covered in IRS Publication 575 (Pension and Annuity Income) and IRS Publication 590 (Individual Retirement Arrangements). These publications are available from local IRS offices or by calling 1-800-TAX- FORMS.  
&gt;  
&gt;If a participant does not transfer an entire Plan taxable portion of a distribution to an IRA or subsequent employer's tax-qualified plan, the portion of the distribution retained by the participant will not be eligible for the special ten-year averaging treatment described above. In addition, the transfer to the IRA or another employer's tax-qualified plan of an amount equal to any portion of the proceeds from the sale of property received in the distribution will be treated as a transfer of the property itself and the participant will pay no current Federal income tax on the gain which may result from the sale of such property to the extent the sales proceeds are transferred to the IRA or another employer's tax-qualified plan in the manner and within the time required.",finance
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, December 6, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, December 6, 2021**

After last week’s extremely volatile trading, stocks bounced on Monday, as investors continued weighing the potential impact of the new coronavirus ‘Omicron’ variant and looked ahead towards the monthly Consumer Price Index, set to be released later this week, which will give us more information regarding the pace and potential staying power of inflation. 

**Notable Numbers Today**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): +1.18%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): +0.80%
* Dow Jones (DIA): +1.90%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +2.01%
* Volatility Index (VIX): -7.80%
* Del Taco (TACO): +65.60%
* BioNTech (BNTX): -18.34%
* Moderna (MRNA): -13.49%
* Airbnb (ABNB): +8.46%
* Crude Oil (WTI): +4.44%

Some encouraging developments about the Omicron variant helped boost risk assets today. During an appearance on CNN today, Fauci said that preliminary data and reports coming out of South Africa, where Omicron was originally discovered November 24, suggest the severity of the virus is not as bad as originally feared. Fauci said, “Clearly, in South Africa, omicron has a transmission advantage. And although it’s too early to make any definitive statements about it, thus far it does not look like there’s a great degree of severity to it. But we’ve really got to be careful before we make any determinations that it is less severe, or really doesn’t cause any severe illness comparable to delta, but thus far the signals are a bit encouraging regarding the severity.” 

Like I said last week during my recaps, it was way too early to panic regarding Omicron, I remember the same song and dance happening after the discovery of Delta, which ended up being one of the juiciest dips all year. It’s still too early to make any conclusions, but the data is so far very encouraging. I’m personally nibbling at some stocks last week and today. 

Meanwhile, however, Moderna (MRNA) President Stephen Hoge told ABC on Sunday that there was a ""real risk that we're going to see a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccines"" currently available as the Omicron variant spreads. The vaccine-maker had also said last week it could have a COVID-19 booster shot designed to address the Omicron variant available as soon as March. CEO Stephane Bancel said something very similar last week. Not to be too conspiratorial, but it is in the interest of these companies to produce a new booster vaccine to boost profits. I personally trust public health officials over CEOs and executives, though again, more data is needed to make any conclusions.

J. Pow’s latest remarks before the Senate Banking Committee further spooked the markets, after he said he would back off from using the word “transitory” to describe rising inflation. This is very notable because the Central bank has been using the T-word since the beginning of the year, when it warned that steep differences in year-over-year comparisons and supply-chain bottlenecks would lead to elevated inflation. 

Powell said, ““We tend to use \[the word transitory\] to mean that it won’t leave a permanent mark in the form of higher inflation. I think it’s probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean.”

Moreover, Powell suggested the Central Bank was considering completing its asset purchase taper “a few months sooner” than previously telegraphed. Market participants expected a more supportive stance, especially with the new COVID variant, but instead Powell suggested his priority was now on curbing higher than expected inflation. 

Again, this is simply my humble opinion. As I have said for months at this point, I am unconcerned regarding tapering the pace of quantitative easing. I remain bullish until the Fed begins concretely discussing plans to raise the interest rate, which the Fed currently telegraphs to happen around the middle of next year, according to the Fed’s dot-plot. Again, this is simply my opinion, don’t get too worked up about it (been weirdly getting a lot of aggressive comments because of this opinion from doom and gloomers). As always, I acknowledge the risks and am prepared to act if it turns out I am incorrect.

**Highlights**

* Tesla (TSLA) stock gapped down in the morning, before mostly recovering by market close, after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it was investigating a report from a whistleblower that alleges that Tesla did not properly inform buyers that defective electrical connectors on the panel could cause fires.
* Lucid Motors (LCID), another EV company, is also being investigated by the SEC. Lucid said the probe “appears to concern” the merger that took the company public along with “certain projections and statements” made by the company prior to becoming public. 
* The Nasdaq Inc is geared to eclipse rival New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in initial public offerings (IPO) this year, which has seen companies raise record levels of capital. Nasdaq raised a total of $191.38 billion through IPOs in 2021, compared with $109.25 billion raised at the NYSE, according to data from Dealogic.
* Shares of Alibaba (BABA) broke (at least briefly) from its death spiral to climb roughly 10% after the company announced it was reorganizing its e-commerce team and naming a new Chief Financial Officer in the face of tightening regulation, increasing competition, slowing growth, and a more than 60% loss in stock price.
* The Department of Justice opened an investigation into allegations that Apple (AAPL) is unevenly enforcing its rules for app developers, favoring some like Roblox (RBLX) at the expense of others.
* Microsoft (MSFT) won Yahoo Finance company of the year
* **\*\*Please note that current price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\*\***

So, my husband (who was not the most financially stable or responsible person until recently) did not realize that he had a little over $6000 in student loans. “How the hell do you not know you have student loans?” you may ask… I have no fkn clue. EITHER WAY, about $3700 are now in default. We applied for an FHA loan to purchase a home within the next six months(I am in the mortgage industry and feel FHA is the best way for us to go). Once we did, the loan officer that I’m working with came back and said he got a hit on CAIVRS for my husbands default loans. Obv you can’t take out a federal loan if you owe Big Brother any money. 

I saw that Loan Consolidation was one way to get your SL out of default and off of CAIVRS in a reasonable amount of time (3-5mos). I also saw 3 consecutive payments at your own  will will do it. But that took longer.

It is resistant to disasters and economic collapse, as if one country’s currency fails, thats the end of it. But for bitcoin, if a economic collapse happens in one country, there are miners and hodlers in other countries securing the network. In a sense, bitcoin allows for better security due to not having a central single point of failure, while having passed the byzantine general problem of trust in a trustless system

Problem is even many institutional and retail investors don’t know this, and sell bitcoin to go into more “safer” assets, when there are negative news in the market (e.g omicron) which i think is one of the worst decisions they make
They view bitcoin like centralised stocks, that if one disaster destroys it, its over. 
It takes more than regulation, monetary policy, quantum level computing to destroy bitcoin, in-fact, to destroy bitcoin, we have to reach a consensus level higher of that of bitcoin, well for that to happen, is basically impossible, given how “uNiFiEd” we are as a human race
One particular possibility is for a solar flare large enough to incapacitate all miners in the world, to even come close to have a chance to destroy bitcoin.

investing,Is the party coming to an end?,"Just thinking ""aloud"" here. What can we expect in the coming years?

1. Slower growth  
Stock market returns over the last 15 or so years are largely the result of boomers in their peak earning years, rushing to prepare for retirement (and recover from the '00, '08 crashes). This trend will come to an end soon, as the majority of boomers retire over the next few years, and move towards more conservative investments. Maybe dividend stocks will become interesting again. Don't expect tech stocks to keep crashing to the upside.
2. Higher interest rates  
Inflation will force interest rates up, and the resulting increase in the cost of capital will slow corporate growth. This is a tricky one, because increased interest rates could make it hard to service the national debt, which is now over 100% of GDP - maybe they *can't* go up much.
3. Higher taxes  
Because of #2, government will need more revenue to service its debt. Also, high interest will drive down bond prices, so don't buy those. We'll also need more taxes to pay for the boomers' social security and medicare, from a smaller pool working-age people (gen X).
4. Lower housing prices  
Higher interest = lower housing prices. Also, the migration of high-earning professionals to the suburbs is decreasing demand - and supply of qualified buyers. But even if SFRs drop in price, they will still be unaffordable to the majority of people, so multifamily will likely not be affected much.

So... with lower growth on the horizon, we should focus on income. Stay away from high-PE stocks, wheel the SPY, and invest the premiums in some dividend ETFs.

I'm still expecting TSLA to keep crashing to the upside, because they're doing the right things at the right time: the transition to electric transportation and self-driving are as inevitable as the rise of the internet and smartphones, and they are years ahead of the rest of the industry. IMHO, they'll 4x in the next two-three years.

stocks,Valuation doesn't matter until it does,"I have seen a lot of post in the last year (including one two weeks ago), saying that valuation doesn't matter anymore.

It all started when Disney and Paypal started to tank, a lot of stocks followed such as Twilo, PLTR, DKNG, SQ, ZM, meme stocks, and all the others.

Financial markets are forward looking, as announced, the FED will start tapering soon, and will increase the interest rate in 2022 most likely. So all the growth stocks will be hit by a higher expected return on the Discounted Cash Flow models, and with more conservative multiples. We can forecast a shrinking of PE / PE1 / PS ratios. However, with the bond market offering such a low yield, **we can expect higher stock multiples than usual**. A good stock with a P/E of 20 is way more attractive risk/reward than anything else. There's no place to park money, and with inflation, cash is trash.

If the elevator is going down (growth stocks), it is better to take the stairs. However, the market will still offer a great return (in my opinion) for the year 2022. Stocks selection will be crucial.

\-Cyclical stocks: With the economy re-opening, cyclical stocks will be very hot. Stocks like McDonald's, Walmart, Bath&amp;BodyWorks, Airlines, cars marker will all beneficiate from people that cannot wait to go out to spend their money once they are allowed to do so.

\-Financials: As we said, markets are forward looking, financial stocks will beneficiate from an interest rate hike.

\-FAANG+M: Those companies rule the World. They are money printing machine, and they will all keep growing. They are a little bit more expensive, but you have to pay a premium for such quality companies that have a lot to offer.

\-Energy: This one is a shorter trade. Supply cannot keep up with demand. Joe Biden doesn't want the US to produce more oil, the OPEC+ is in the driver's seat, and US oil companies are distributing the cash to investors instead of drilling more. Price of oil will keep going up in, at least, the first half of 2022. Both Chevron and Exxon offer more than 4.5% in dividend yield, and they will see their stock price going up accordingly with oil prices.

\-Buying leaps on the SPY: It is hard to go wrong with this one. The problem with options is the timing. If you buy long duration call options on the SPY during dips, you will most likely see a profit. This one is for a bit experienced investors. Be careful to not lose all your money.

**The metaverse is everywhere**

It seems that the crypto community is way ahead of the curve. Nothing new there. Facebook announced that they had changed their name to Meta to reflect their focus on the metaverse. Whilst blockchain entrepreneurs have been developing metaverse applications for a few years now Facebook gave it mainstream recognition. Before that announcement the average person hadn't even heard of the metaverse and if they had they didn't have a clue what it meant.

Here is a brief definition for those in the metaverse beginner camp:

A shared, realistic, and immersive computer simulation of the real world or other possible worlds, in which people participate as digital avatars.

Investors are piling into cryptocurrencies which have even a faint connection to the metaverse. 

The top 5 cryptos in the metaverse space are:

Axie Infinity $7.0bn

Decentraland $5.0bn

The Sandbox $5.1bn

Enjin Coin $2.9bn

Illuvium $0.8bn

A few long shots worth a closer look:

Somnium $0.2bn

Rentible $7m

The metaverse is an interesting concept to investigate, from an investors point of view anyway. There are two plays. The first is investing in the cryptocurrency and the second is buying land. Let’s take Decentraland for instance. Its fully diluted market cap of $10 billion is priced to perfection. In other words, the valuation already assumes they will be a leading player in this market going forward. And that thinking is also priced into the value of their virtual land which is selling for up to millions of dollars. 

Virtual land is like real estate. It is in finite supply with location playing an important role in its value. Canny investors are buying up virtual land plots on various metaverses expecting to either develop it, rent it or flip it.

The metaverse is set to be part of our future. However, a few words of warning. Don't go rushing out to buy the next shiny metaverse project. 99.9% of the new projects coming to market will fail. Also remember, buying virtual land comes with risk. Like buying land in the real world, if you purchase a plot within a metaverse where there are few visitors your land will have as much value as buying land in the middle of the Sahara. 

**dYdX and the perpetual**

Let’s start with, what is a perpetual?

A perpetual swap is something similar to a futures contract. The core difference is that perpetuals do not have expiration dates. 

dYdX’s perpetuals have proved so popular that they have eclipsed Coinbase in daily volumes. It achieved this by solely offering perpetual for four assets. dYdX is now one of the most liquid exchanges in crypto.

**Rapid fire**

The influential FATF (Financial Action Task Force) **wants governments to hold the people behind DeFi protocols accountable**. This will send the shivers down the backs of the many platforms that have decided on anonymity. This proposal is not likely to come in for some time, but it is something that we can see being implemented and enforced ruthlessly.

Muslim leaders have warned their flock that **crypto is forbidden**. According to these well-informed individuals, ‘it has elements of uncertainty, wagering, and harm’.

Binance CEO announced that he intends to **give away up to 99% of his wealth**. No doubt this raised the eyebrows of US authorities who will be eyeing much of his wealth for themselves!

Binance made **Know Your Customer (KYC) mandatory** for global users in their effort to make Binance a regulatory compliant business. 

In another attack on the DeFi space. BlockFi, which offers high interest rates to investors, is being **investigated by the SEC**. The SEC considers that BlockFi’s interest accounts represent the offering of unregistered securities, something that no doubt the SEC will use to target many other high profile yield farming platforms in the near future.

Cardano the blockchain platform has **achieved over 20 million transactions worth over $18 billion**. That figure is only slightly lower than that of Bitcoin and compares to Ethereum’s $9 billion. The price of ADA however is in the doldrums with many complaining of the lack of DAPPs because of its complex programming language. 

eToro announced it was **delisting Cardano and TRON** by the end of the year for US customers as it believes these coins could represent securities.

**Staking and Yield Farming**

Each week we provide the latest APRs from leading staking and yield farming platforms together with news from the industry.

Staking and yield farming has been a major driver in the huge growth in the DeFi sector. Investors are being enticed by the massive APRs on offer. Totally new projects tempting investors with returns of 10,000+ % are able to attract a deluge of money from investors who don’t seem concerned with the high risks involved. Our weekly review looks at the best platforms out there and the ones to avoid. We attempt to weed out the platforms that we think won’t stand the test of time.

**Catchy by name Catchy by nature**

A tracker wallet that has to be tried to be appreciated!

Tired of manually adding token addresses to Trustwallet? Tired of seeing out-of-date and inaccurate balances? Tired of switching apps to check on your multiple wallets? We present CATCHY, an innovative solution that facilitates wallet tracking, implemented directly on Telegram, the flagship crypto platform. CATCHY aims to provide a suite of crypto tracking tools for Telegram users. From the currently available multichain (BSC + ETH) Telegram wallet tracker, to the upcoming whale watcher, price alert, and sniper bot tools, our vision is to create an ecosystem that satisfies all crypto enthusiast needs. Today, we’ll give a small overview of our multi chain wallet tracker and the many useful features it has to offer.

Our Telegram wallet tracker is made with both accessibility and convenience in mind. Simply talk to one of our tracker bots (found in our Telegram group [CATCHYTOKEN](https://t.me/CATCHYTOKEN)), and it will direct you to the tracker bot you were specifically assigned to. From there on out, you’ll only use one command: /wallet. On your first use, the bot will notify you that you haven’t added any wallet addresses to the tracker and will ask you about the blockchain you wish to use. Keep in mind that you can add up to 3 wallets at any time, and they can belong to different blockchains, so your choice here isn’t final. Reply to the tracker bot’s message with a wallet address of your choosing, and you’re good to go! 

Note that the tracker DOES NOT require a wallet connection, making it the absolute safest option to keep tabs on your balances. The tracker can never be linked back to your person either, as it relies on an anonymous numerical ID that is unique to each individual. The bot you were assigned to will remember you through that ID, so you’ll never have to go through the setup process again.

After you’re done with the first step, the tracker will immediately attempt to fetch your wallet balances based on publicly available data. Just wait a couple seconds and VOILA: the balance of every token in your wallet, valued in USD and BNB/ETH (depending on the chain), ranked by value. These values are the most up-to-date balances you can fetch, as they rely on the BSC and ETH blockchains directly instead of waiting for other services to supply prices (like Trustwallet for example). From this point onwards, you’ll rarely ever need to use /wallet again, as the buttons supplied under your balance sheet are more than enough to satisfy any needs you might have. 

The \[Refresh\] button immediately updates your balances, the \[Gains\] button enables percentage gain calculation from the last time you pressed \[Refresh\], the \[MC\] button adds the market cap of every token directly into the balance sheet, and the \[Charts\] button offers immediate access to the charts of your tokens. The \[Manage\] button allows you to add wallets (up to 3) or remove existing ones, as well as play around with language settings (English and Chinese are available at the moment). 

At CATCHY, your convenience is our utmost priority, and we hope that is reflected in the intuitive design of our tracker and its ease of use. However, our most convenient feature is one that you’ll rarely ever notice: Scam/Dead token filtering. Unlike sites like poocoin, where you have to manually hide dust and dead tokens, our tracker automatically does that for you by employing our own filtering system. And if our system oversteps its boundaries, you can use the \[Show Missing &amp; Hide Existing Tokens\] button to take full control of your tracker’s output. These choices will be saved forever, so you’ll never have to reconfigure your balance sheet. 

Our tracker strikes a delicate balance between convenience and complexity, offering you extensive control of what you see without sacrificing simplicity and accessibility. The tracker is currently free for users to try and explore, but in the near future, you will have to hold CATCHY to make use of its features, making it the first of many use cases that are coming down the line. Please visit our website https://catchy.finance/ for further details on the tracker and other products currently in the works.

**The metaverse is everywhere**

It seems that the crypto community is way ahead of the curve. Nothing new there. Facebook announced that they had changed their name to Meta to reflect their focus on the metaverse. Whilst blockchain entrepreneurs have been developing metaverse applications for a few years now Facebook gave it mainstream recognition. Before that announcement the average person hadn't even heard of the metaverse and if they had they didn't have a clue what it meant.

Here is a brief definition for those in the metaverse beginner camp:

A shared, realistic, and immersive computer simulation of the real world or other possible worlds, in which people participate as digital avatars.

Investors are piling into cryptocurrencies which have even a faint connection to the metaverse.

The top 5 cryptos in the metaverse space are:

Axie Infinity $7.0bn

Decentraland $5.0bn

The Sandbox $5.1bn

Enjin Coin $2.9bn

Illuvium $0.8bn

A few long shots worth a closer look:

Somnium $0.2bn

Rentible $7m

The metaverse is an interesting concept to investigate, from an investors point of view anyway. There are two plays. The first is investing in the cryptocurrency and the second is buying land. Let’s take Decentraland for instance. Its fully diluted market cap of $10 billion is priced to perfection. In other words, the valuation already assumes they will be a leading player in this market going forward. And that thinking is also priced into the value of their virtual land which is selling for up to millions of dollars.

Virtual land is like real estate. It is in finite supply with location playing an important role in its value. Canny investors are buying up virtual land plots on various metaverses expecting to either develop it, rent it or flip it.

The metaverse is set to be part of our future. However, a few words of warning. Don't go rushing out to buy the next shiny metaverse project. 99.9% of the new projects coming to market will fail. Also remember, buying virtual land comes with risk. Like buying land in the real world, if you purchase a plot within a metaverse where there are few visitors your land will have as much value as buying land in the middle of the Sahara.

CryptoCurrency,Slight concern regarding feds meeting to increase interest rate,"As you may know, the feds are holding a meeting on the 14th to 15th this month and may release on their taper schedule for next year and I’m wondering since this past weekend’s crash might’ve been partially caused by the fear of an interest increase, I’m wondering if we may see a blood bath like it again. Please educate me on this matter for I just got on the crypto train recently, and I’m in dire need of guidance on this journey 

Don’t mean to ruin everyones pay day today, just legit bit worried about it. And sorry for the bad Engrish",cryptocurrency
ethereum,Risk of Stable coin &amp; Venezuela’s Petro coin,"When the word ""stable coin"" is used, it is referring to stable, relative to the underlying pegged asset. If we have to be technical, it is more of a ""pegged coin"" than a stable one.

# Analysis 1: Stable coin is useful. But it could reduce the demand of actual currency and create serious devaluation.

✔️ Stable coins are good. Let’s get the straight.

❌ But the risk is that stable coins become a threat to the existing currency and its monetary policy.

## Case in point: Venezuela’s Bolivar 🇻🇪

1. Venezuela experienced hyperinflation in its currency. (Meaning if 1 banana costs 1 Bolivar, the same banana costs 3 Bolivar tomorrow. Your Bolivar cash is the same but everything suddenly becomes more expensive.)
2. This means that Bolivar is less valuable.
3. People move to an alternative; cryptocurrencies.
4. More people use cryptocurrencies and more businesses accept currencies.
5. This means less demand for Bolivar. (Actual currency)
6. My fear is this risk: as less people demand Bolivar, it becomes even less valuable (see 3). So in the end, the currency might devalue to the extent where it is no longer valuable and the system is gone.

&gt;Funny thing: money only works when we believe in it. It’s literally just pieces of paper. When we stop believing in Bolivar, Bolivar will also cease to exist.

If that can happen in Venezuela, how about a large scale, say the US economy? One day, you wake up and realise the green bag is worth nothing.

## Analysis 2: Strange math aside, Petro is centralised by few organisations.

✔️ Venezuela has oil. It’s how they have been sustaining themselves.

❌ But this can be easily manipulated.

## My 4 questions:

1. Accepted Petro rate is dependent on oil prices, determined by OPEC. (Arguably centralised)
2. How is Petro/Bolivar determined? It is defined by operations authorised by the government. (Centralised)
3. Oil prices defines the Accepted Petro/Bolivar rate in an ambitious manner. (Not transparent. Is opaque)
4. Government controls the faction of Dv (discount rate in terms of oil prices). (Opaque and centralised)

## Some ways to manipulate Accepted Petro:

1. Collude with OPEC (i.e. lobbying) to adjust the supply of oil, hence the price of oil. Or invest in alternative energy and reduce demand in oil, hence the price.

2. Be the government in Venezuela. Accept or reject “volume of operations of exchange house authorised by the gov” and affect the Petro/Bolivar rate.

3. Be the government and change the discount rate (Dv). E.g. if citizens are paying taxes in Petro, have a low discount rate (Dv) so the government gets a higher Petro than with discount. And when gov has to spend a lot, increase the Dv so less Petro is needed to pay for the expense.

  - Watch out judging a person by their results because history will only show you the winners. You won&amp;#39;t hear the stories of the losers
- Over short terms, you see variance, not returns. Don&amp;#39;t monitor your portfolio on a daily basis
- AFTER an event has occurred, it is easy to make a story as to why it happened and why people should have seen it. But it is difficult to see in advance BEFORE it happens
  - Events are more random than we think
- Negative pangs cause a 2.5x more emotional response than a positive one
- It is not how likely an event is to happen that matters, it is how much is made or lost when it happens that should be the consideration
  - Maximize your profit expectancy, not probability
- I try to benefit from &amp;quot;rare events&amp;quot;, events that do not tend to repeat themselves frequently
- I believe that rare events are not fairly valued, and that the rarer the event, the more undervalued it will be in price
- Investors for pure emotional reasons, will be drawn into strategies that experience rare but large variations.
- Pascal&amp;#39;s Wager – The optimal strategy for humans is to believe in God because if God does exist the believer will be rewarded and if he doesn&amp;#39;t exist, the believer has nothing to lose.
  - IE - Inequality of outcomes, don&amp;#39;t try to pick up nickels in front of a train
- There is no point in searching for patterns that are available to everyone; once detected, they would be self-canceling
- &amp;quot;One cannot judge a performance in any given field by the results, but by the costs of the alternative (i.e. if history played out in a different way). Such substitutes courses of events are called alternative histories. Cleary the quality of a decision cannot be solely judged based on its outcome.
- Past events will always look less random than they were (hindsight bias)
- Probability almost never presents itself as a mathematical problem or brain teaser
- No one accepts randomness in their success, only in their failure
- Take into account the costs of mistakes
- Bad information is worse than no information at all
- 5 traits of a Market Fool
  - Overestimating accuracy of data or overconfidence
  - Getting married to positions
  - Changing story
  - No plans for taking losses or exit strategy
  - Denial of luck and randomness

# **The Black Swan**

- 3 attributes for a black swan
  - A black swan is an outlier, as in outside the realm of regular expectations
  - Carries extreme impact
  - Human nature makes us concoct explanations for its occurrence _ **after** _ the fact
    - Rare, Extreme Impact and Retrospective predictability
- There are great problems with trying to forecast the future, given limited knowledge of the past
- Black swans being unpredictable, we need to adjust to their existence rather than naively try to predict them
- The human mind suffers from 3 ailments as it comes into contact with history
  - The illusion of understanding or how everyone thinks they know what is going on in a world that is more complicated (or random) than they realize
  - Retrospective distortion or how we assess matter only after the fact (history seems clearer and more organized in books than in empirical reality)
  - Overvaluation of factual information
- Taleb realized that he was totally incapable of predicting market prices, but that others were just as incapable as him but did not know it or did not know that they were taking massive risks. Most traders were just picking up pennies in front of a steamroller
- 2 types of randomness analogy
  - Mediocristan – land of average
  - Extremistan – land of black swans
    - Mediocristan - When your sample is large; no single instance will significantly change the aggregate or total. The largest observation will remain impressive, but insignificant to the sum. IE – Human weights, Human heights, car accidents, IQ
      - Black swans don&amp;#39;t occur here. Once you collect enough data should reveal all you need to know and if you do have a surprise, it won&amp;#39;t be consequential. Collecting data here is ok. What you can learn from data in Mediocristan augments very rapidly with the supply of information. You can predict here.
    - Extemistan – inequalities are such that one single observation can disproportionately impact the aggregate or the total. IE – wealth, income, book sales per author, financial markets, commodity prices, inflation rates, economic data
      - Black swans do occur here. You will have trouble figuring out the average from any sample since it can depend so much on one single observation. Be suspicious of the knowledge of the data you collect here. Knowledge here grows slowly and erratically with the addition of data. Difficult or even impossible to predict.
- Black Swan Example – Consider a turkey that is fed every day. Every single feeding will firm up the bird&amp;#39;s belief that it is the general rule of life to be fed every day by friendly humans &amp;quot;looking out for my best interests&amp;quot;. But the Wednesday before Thanksgiving something unexpected will happen to the turkey. It will occur a revision of belief. Ironically, the turkeys feeling of safety had reached a maximum when the risk was the highest.
  - The turkey had &amp;quot;learned backwards&amp;quot; from observation
  - oHow can we know the future, given finite knowledge of the past?
  - Something may have worked in the past until, well it doesn&amp;#39;t. You don&amp;#39;t drive your car looking in the rear-view mirror.
    - Before 1987, the biggest single day drop in the Dow was 13% so some people incorrectly concluded from the past that they most the Dow could drop in a day was 13%. It dropped 22% on &amp;quot;Black Monday&amp;quot;
- Positive Black Swans take time to show their effects while negative black swans happen very quickly
- Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence
- Naïve Empiricism – We tend to have a tendency to look for instances that confirm our story and our vision of the world and these instances are easy to find. You take past instances that corroborate your theories and treat them as evidence.
- Negative Empiricism - The way to counter your Naïve Empiricism is to understand that a series of corroborative facts is not _Necessarily_ evidence.
  - Seeing White Swans does not confirm the nonexistence of Black Swans.
- The error of confirmation - We are quick to draw conclusions from what we have seen to what is unseen.
- Confirmation Bias – our natural tendency to look only for corroboration of our ideas.
  - To counter this George Soros was known when taking a financial bet to keep looking for evidence or instances to prove his initial theory wrong
- Narrative Fallacy – this is associated with our vulnerability to overinterpretation and our predilection for compact stories over raw truths. It severely distorts our mental representation of the world, especially rare events
  - We tend to look at sequences of facts and weave them into an explanation. Explanations bind these facts together. Making them easy to remember. They help us make more sense of the facts. Because our brains can&amp;#39;t store all that information. Stories stick, statistics don&amp;#39;t
    - The more you summarize, the more order you put in, the less randomness. The same condition that makes us simplify pushes us to think that the world is less random that it actually is.
- In some strategies, you gamble dollars to win a succession of pennies while appearing to be winning all the time. In other strategies, you risk a succession of pennies to win dollars. In other words, you bet either that the black swan will or won&amp;#39;t happen. These require completely different mind sets.
  - Most people have a preference for number 1
  - Some bets in which one wins big but infrequently, yet loses small but frequently, are worth making if others are suckers for them and if you have the personal and intellectual stamina
- We favor the narrated. We are not manufactured to understand abstract matters, we need context. Randomness and uncertainty are abstractions. We respect what has happened, ignoring what could have happened.
- Our ideas are sticky: once we produce a theory, we are not likely to change our minds. When you develop your opinions on the basis of weak evidence, you will have difficulty interpreting subsequent information that contradicts these opinions. So those who delay developing their theories are better off
- We humans are the victims of an asymmetry in the perception of random events. We attribute our success to our skills, and our failures to external events outside our control, namely to randomness. We feel responsible for the good, but not for the bad.
- Taleb&amp;#39;s Perfect World – &amp;quot;Think of someone heavily introspective, tortured by the awareness of his own ignorance. He lacks the courage of the idiot, yet has the rare guts to say &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know.&amp;quot; He does not mind looking like a fool. He hesitates, he will not commit, and he agonizes over the consequences of being wrong. He introspects, introspects, and introspects until he reaches physical and mental exhaustion. This does not mean he lacks confidence, only that he holds his own knowledge to be suspect.
- Louis Pasteur – &amp;quot;Luck favors the prepared&amp;quot;
- The black swan asymmetry allows you to be confident about what is wrong, not about what you believe is right
- So, what to do if you can&amp;#39;t predict in a world with Black Swans??
  - Avoid unnecessary dependence on large scale harmful predictions. Be fooled in small matters, not large. Example – don&amp;#39;t accept the government forecast for SS payments 50 years from now.
  - Do not listen to economic forecasters or to predictions
  - Be prepared! Be prepared for all relevant eventualities
  - People are often ashamed of losses, so they engage in strategies that produce very little volatility but contain the risk of large loss.
  - Barbell Strategy
    - Be as hyper-conservative and hyper-aggressive and you can instead of being mildly aggressive or conservative
    - Put 80-90% in extremely safe investments – (Example – T-Bills)
    - Put the other 10-20% in extremely speculative investments (Example – VC)
    - You have no risk on one side and high risk on the other, which equals out to medium risk. This minimizes your risk of negative black swans and exposures you to positive black swans
    - Put yourself in situations where favorable consequences are much larger than unfavorable ones
    - I am very aggressive when I can gain exposure to positive Black Swans and very conservative when I am under threat from a negative Black Swan

# **Anti-Fragile**

- Fragile-Robust-Antifragile. Fragile wants tranquility, Antifragile grows from disorder and robust doesn&amp;#39;t care too much
- Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, randomness, disorder, and stressors and love adventure, risk, and uncertainty. This is Antifragile. The opposite is fragile
- Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets stronger
- I would rather be dumb and antifragile than smart and fragile
  - It is much easier to figure out if something is fragile than to predict the occurrence of an event that may harm it.
- Asymmetry: anything that has more upside than downside from random events is antifragile; the reverse is fragile
- Fragile needs to be very predictive in its approach, and conversely, predictive systems cause fragility
- For the economy to be antifragile as a whole, individual companies must be fragile. We don&amp;#39;t have this currently
  - Many government interventions and social policies end up hurting the weak and consolidating the established
- We are fragilizing social and economic systems by denying them stressors and randomness
- We make social, political (and other) systems vulnerable to Black Swans when we over stabilize them
- The problem with artificially suppressed volatility is not just that the system tends to become extremely fragile; it is that, at the same time, it exhibits no visible risks. They become prone to black swan events
- Attempts at eliminating the business cycle led to more fragile economic systems (IE – The Greenspan Put)
  - Part of this is due to the fact it is easier to sell &amp;quot;Look what I did for you&amp;quot; than &amp;quot;Look what I avoided for you.&amp;quot;
- Our track record in figuring out significant rare events in politics and economics is about zero
- What makes life simple is that the robust and antifragile don&amp;#39;t have to have as accurate a comprehension of the world as the fragile, and they do not need to forecast
  - A person with extra cash in the bank and stockpiles of tradeable goods and gold bars doesn&amp;#39;t need to forecast correctly.
  - People in debt are fragile and need a lot more forecasting ability
- There are 2 types of domains
  - Those we can somewhat predict. IE – The physical like planet motions
  - Those that we cannot. IE - The Black Swan – Social, Economic, and Cultural life
- The first step toward antifragility consists in first decreasing downside, rather than increasing upside. That means lowering exposure to negative black swans
- What matters is the route taken, the order of events, not just the destination – what scientists call path-dependent property
  - Example – A kidney stone operation and anesthesia after is very different than the opposite
- People miss the strong logical precedence of survival over success
- In other words, if something is fragile, its risk of breaking make anything you do to improve it or make it &amp;quot;efficient&amp;quot; inconsequential unless you first reduce that risk of breaking
- Barbell Strategy or Bimodal Strategy
  - Combination of 2 extreme areas with nothing in the middle
    - Playing it safe in some areas – robust to black swans
    - Taking a lot of small risks in other – open to positive black swans
      - The whole then becomes antifragile
- The causes extreme risk aversion on one side and extreme risk loving on the other
  - But the barbell also results, because of its construction, in the reduction of downside risk – the elimination of the risk of ruin
- Antifragility is the combination aggressiveness plus paranoia, protect your downside from extreme harm, and let the upside take care of itself
- Yiddish proverb &amp;quot;Provide for the worst; the best can take care of itself.&amp;quot;
  - Many people tend to provide for the best and hope the worst takes care of itself
- Example of above
  - People find insuring their house a necessity, not something to be judged against a financial strategy, but when it comes to their portfolios, because of the way things are framed in the press, they don&amp;#39;t look at them the same way.
  - They think that the barbell strategy needs to be examined for its potential return as an investment. That is NOT the point. The barbell is simply an idea of insurance of survival
- When you are fragile, you need to know a lot more than when you are antifragile. Conversely, when you think you know more than you do, you are fragile to error.
  - Overconfidence leads to reliance on forecasts, which causes borrowing, then to the fragility of leverage. Example – Long Term Capital Management (LTCM)
- Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence
- Much of what other people know isn&amp;#39;t worth knowing
- Non-linear means that the response is not straightforward and not in a straight line, so if you double say, the dose, you get a lot more or a lot less than double the effect.
- For the fragile, shocks bring higher and higher harm as their intensity increases (up to a point)
  - Example – Falling from a height of 30ft one time brings more than 30 times the harm of falling 30 times from a height of 1ft
- What is fragile is something that is both unbroken and subjected to nonlinear effects
- The fragile is hurt a lot more by extreme events than by a succession of intermediate ones
- For the antifragile, shocks bring more benefits as their intensity increases (up to a point)
  - Example – powerlifters get more benefits lifting 300 lbs one time than 1 lb 300 times
    - Every additional pound brings more benefits, until one gets close to the limit, what would be known as &amp;quot;failure&amp;quot;
- Convexity effect analogy (Positive and Negative) Think of a smile (+) and frown (-)
  - Positive – Convex – Think Happy face - Gain more than pain. Likes volatility. If for a given variation, you have more upside than downside, it will be convex (slopes up)
  - Negative - Concave – Think Sad face – Pain more than gain. Dislikes volatility. If for a given variation, you have more downside than upside, it will be concave (slopes down). The more harm from the unexpected. Large deviations have a disproportionately larger and larger effect (acceleration)
- The inverse philosophers stone or how to detect fragility
  - Figure out if our miscalculations or mis forecasts are on balance more harmful than they are beneficial, and how accelerating the damage will be.
    - You don&amp;#39;t have to be exact with this measurement. You can get a scale that isn&amp;#39;t zeroed and know if you are gaining or losing weight. I can have a non-exact ruler and know if my child is growing or not.
  - Example – Government deficits are particularly concave to changes in economic conditions. Every additional deviation in, say, the unemployment rate, particularly when the government has debt, makes deficits incrementally worse.
  - Financial leverage for a company has the same effect: you need to borrow more and more to get the same result
- Average (First order effects) do not matter
  - &amp;quot;Do not cross a river if it is on average 4ft deep&amp;quot;
  - Analogy – You grandmother will spend the next 2 hours at 70 degrees (Perfect Grandmother Temp).
    - But there is also a second point of the data – she will spend the first hour at 0 and the 2nd hour at 140 for an average of 70
    - Temp changes become more and more harmful as they deviate from 70. And the 2nd piece of information, the variability, turned out to be more important than the first.
  - Point of above – The notion of average is of no significance when one is fragile to variations
    - Grandmother is non-linear to temperature (response is not a straight line), it curves inward (concave), the more nonlinear the response, the less relevant the average
- Many people are drawn to financial markets because we hear or see the success, but the failures are buried and we don&amp;#39;t hear about them",finance
vet,My regular stray came to me with an injured leg. What can I do?,"There's a stray in my neighborhood I've named ""Corky"" for his corkscrew-shaped tail. He's a very beautiful and sweet boy, unneutered. Has never hissed or swatted but is very shy and easily startled, and my parents aren't good at helping things along. He usually comes crying for something to eat, and I feed him dry food that I've made wet so that he's fed and isn't dehydrated. So far he'd been doing well, but tonight he came to me limping, refusing to walk on his left hind leg (his left). I think I saw pink from under his fur on his leg, but he wouldn't let me get a good look. I want to know what I can do for him immediately. My parents refuse to help me catch him and take him to a vet despite the fact I have plenty of money to get him fully vetted as well as get his leg cared for (and they were all about keeping him until he was injured... naturally 🙄). What can I do besides continue to feed him? Should I look into buying antibiotics and pain relief? Which kind would be best? He also sneezed, if I give him antibiotics could they make him more ill?",cryptocurrency

42. The Galaxy Digital paper on Gen 3 blockchains is out. I think some may definitely take issue with their description of the capabilities of eUTxO smart contracts in the Cardano section.

59. Looks like Cardano is seeing a huge amount of on-chain activity. The crazy part is this is all pre-PAB. Just wait until dApps can actually launch! Unsurprisingly, some supporters of other chains were shocked to realize they didn’t understand the difference between exchange trading volume and actual blockchain use volume. [https://twitter.com/cardano\_daily/status/1460238659098005504](https://twitter.com/cardano_daily/status/1460238659098005504) [https://messari.io/screener/most-active-chains-DB01F96B](https://messari.io/screener/most-active-chains-DB01F96B)

72. Charles dropped a new AMA where he mentioned very briefly that they are actually going to look into read-only UTxOs. If it’s possible to have these types of UTxOs while preserving determinism, it would be a big change since transactions must currently consume inputs. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJcVEJ1a6eg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJcVEJ1a6eg) Some background reading on read-only UTxOs: [https://github.com/Emurgo/Emurgo-Research/blob/master/smart-contracts/Unlocking%20The%20Potential%20Of%20The%20UTXO%20Model.md](https://github.com/Emurgo/Emurgo-Research/blob/master/smart-contracts/Unlocking%20The%20Potential%20Of%20The%20UTXO%20Model.md)

82. Charles drops a video on the eToro user limitations. It sounds like IOHK knew nothing about this. Interacting with exchanges falls in the Cardano Foundation’s wheelhouse. It’s unclear whether the CF knew anything. He also pointed out it’s very interesting that an old line exchange like Bitstamp has decided to LIST Cardano during this same period. Charles also mentioned that they haven’t seen any regulatory activity on IOHK’s end. eToro is a relatively small source of liquidity for Cardano and there shouldn’t be much of an impact. [https://youtu.be/WYQTkf8ndpY](https://youtu.be/WYQTkf8ndpY)
83. The Pavia map is expanding on Wednesday, Nov. 24th at 1500 UTC with a second land sale. [https://twitter.com/Pavia\_io/status/1463153632484941834](https://twitter.com/Pavia_io/status/1463153632484941834)

85. The Pavia second land sale saw demand vastly outstrip supply to become (reportedly) the biggest Cardano NFT drop ever. [https://twitter.com/Pavia\_io/status/1463560375442591753](https://twitter.com/Pavia_io/status/1463560375442591753) [https://twitter.com/Pavia\_io/status/1463547885539278849](https://twitter.com/Pavia_io/status/1463547885539278849)

worldpolitics,Who does the U.S. fight against in Arctitc?,"In the 19th and 20th centuries, the attention of scientists and explorers was drawn to the poles of our globe. We are talking about the study of Antarctica and the Arctic. And the latter enjoyed less popularity. Everything changed in the second half of the 21st century, when not individual researchers, but the whole states turned their eyes to this region.Today, the main ""promoters of peace in the world"" in the person of the United States and NATO are actively promoting the positioning of the Arctic as a territory of peace and cooperation. Obviously, the interests of America in this region are not to study polar bears. This raises two questions: What do the United States and its allies want in this region?The answer is straightforward. First, Soviet scientists discovered that the North Pole holds vast gas and oil reserves. Antarctica, too, is rich in minerals, but extraction and transportation are difficult. The Arctic is an entirely different matter, much of which is divided among the so-called Arctic countries. These are the countries whose borders are washed by the Arctic Ocean. History shows that when it comes to economic gain, the U.S. is willing to take away whatever it wants by force.Secondly, Moscow, basing on the results of its studies, proved that a huge chunk of the Arctic Ocean shelf is an extension of the continental part of the Russian Federation with all the minerals. There also passes the Northern Sea Route, the carriage of goods through which is more economically profitable than through the Suez Canal (the main transport artery of the world economy).Economically and strategically, Russia has confidently seized the initiative in the Arctic. It should be noted separately that Moscow has achieved this in compliance with all international norms and requirements. Naturally, this state of affairs runs counter to the interests of the West. European and American peacekeepers with one hand hold the mouthpiece, through which they call everyone for peace and cooperation, and with the other hand load the gun. The U.S. and NATO have been increasingly active militarily in the Arctic every year. In the summer of 2021, they conducted the Arctic Challenge Exercise, in which some 70 combat aircraft took part. In the spring of the same year, the U.S.-Canada NORAD (NORAD) exercise was held, and the U.S.-Norwegian Viking exercise was held in the winter. Washington also actively criticizes Moscow's activities in the region, trying, for example, to challenge its right to regulate the movement of ships along the Northern Sea Route.U.S. and NATO military exercises and provocations undermine stability in the Arctic. This, to put it mildly, is not good for the development of the region. But who cares when it comes to billions of dollars.",energy

What's today?

Talking more to close relatives and friends in the last months I discovered they all play around with investments apps. The amount of money the put is substantial. What struck me how many of them actually use leverage, as it is offered as well in such apps. It is gamified, it has a slider ""2x"" which can with a swipe increased to 5x. They have no clue what they are actually doing.

All-in-all they are extremely naive and not informed at all. I tried to educate, but then they show how much money they made on such accelerators. They don't look at P/E numbers of valuations, or risk. They jump onto stuff they hear in the news. The notion that the risk they take they have to compare, for example against the S&amp;P500 index tracker performance in the same time they are invested, is not present. (most of them have net green numbers)

Without exception all of them had the same motivation: their banks charge them negative rates on their cash (I live in europe), up to -0.5% they have to pay. With a currently inflation of 5% ish percent that means loosing 5.5% per year on their cash. But I guess in the rest of the world it is similar. On bonds/cash account you lose every year several % of your money. So everyone flocks into equity, without looking at the risks, ""as it ain't gonna get worse than my cash account bleeding"".

Even an insurance agent tried to sell me an investment with a very high TER. No, the TER was not even known to her. Arguments didn't help, she was sure as hell, again the motivation was that cash was just losing value and that wouldn't change as Europe couldn't afford to raise the rates.

Also the ""large cap over small cap"" pattern I see. They buy Amazon, Meta, Apple, Alphabet, stuff they wear (Adidas, Nike), you name it. They stay away from the small stuff, because then they have to understand the business.

Also COVID did a lot. They were bored and saw advertisements everywhere... especially the banks themselves show every time on the login to their cash account their brokerage offer.

[So I just looked up the use of margin.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGZ1FL663067003Q)

As images tell more than a thousand words, but aren't allowed here, [here's a link.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=J6OZ) It basically dipped a bit in the march 2020 stock crash and then went up by a factor of 2.

This ain't good at all. So much leverage, with the FED preparing to raise rates.

My next step? Get more to a cash position. Green positions I partly exited (will hold some of them nevertheless) and will continue to do so. I want more dry powder if this powder keg goes up.

Yes, I know the ""time in the market"", market timing, etc etc. I will stay invested but I'm getting more to cash.

Do you observe mania like behaviour?

CryptoCurrency,Important factors for an extended bullrun?,"It was very unfortunate that Evergrande defaulted. But it was in my opinion not enough to start a bear market. I think the crypto market will continue as long as:

1) the interest rates are low  
2) the FED and central banks, for example of Europe, continue to inflate the fiat money supply (inflation), which is tied to the duration of the corona pandemic.   


I think a severe crash (much bigger than we've seen this past week) will occur only when the whole goes up like crazy in a short amount of time. Reasoning: In 2017, the market went up about 436 % in two months, which is 218 % a month. From December 2020 to 13 March 2021 the market went up about 496%, which is about 124% a month. From July 20 to November 9th of 2021, the market went up about 130%, which is about 37% a month. This is not crazy enough.

CryptoCurrency,The worst feeling is when you have no more fiat to buy the dips right after a crash,"Buying after the market just crashed is an amazing way to get Crypto for insanely cheap. Unfortunately, the worst feeling is when you can't buy these dips due to not having enough FIAT. You watch coins selling for a bargain and you cant get in on the action. Yeah, you will recover the losses you made from the crash eventually, but dips are very rare, and getting in one of those is probably going to give you insane returns in the future.

The recent crash had left many Cryptocurrencies in a massive discount. Coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum were at their lowest since late September. Buying in that crash was literally the equivalent of DCAing for the past year.

TLDR: Make sure you don't get into the situation some of us went into. Always have some extra amount of money sitting in stablecoins with high interest rates. It is going to be extremely beneficial for you when you have money ready to buy Crypto at bargain rates in the future.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Everyone and their dog knows that inflation is bad and that we are trying to act as a hedge against it. But do you know why exactly is it bad?,"Here we are.. inflation! Likely the most popular topic in crypto. We are after all trying to be a hedge against ever rising inflation right?  ^((you need to slowly nod))

Inflation, especially nowadays during pandemic, is a highly debated issue in financial world. Some level of inflation is said to crucial to drive consumption, and many governments claim that high levels of spending are crucial for the economic growth of the country, but is that true? Aren't there a lot of negative downsides to the inflation?  Well duh!

&amp;#x200B;

**First let's define inflation.**

*Inflation is the rate of increase in prices over a given period of time. Inflation is typically a broad measure, such as the overall increase in prices or the increase in the cost of living in a country. But it can also be more narrowly calculated—for certain goods, such as food, or for services, such as a haircut, for example. Whatever the context, inflation represents how much more expensive the relevant set of goods and/or services has become over a certain period, most commonly a year.* \[1\]

&amp;#x200B;

**The big bros Keep Inflation ""Healthy""**

The [Federal Reserve](https://www.thebalance.com/the-federal-reserve-system-and-its-function-3306001) has set the official [inflation target](https://www.thebalance.com/inflation-targeting-definition-how-it-works-3305854) at 2%.1﻿ On August 27, 2020, the FOMC announced it would allow a target inflation rate of more than 2% if that will help ensure maximum employment. It still seeks a 2% inflation over time but is willing to allow higher rates if inflation has been low for awhile.

That's for the [core inflation](https://www.thebalance.com/core-inflation-rate-3305918) rate. It strips out volatile gas and food prices. It is also the year-over-year rate, not the month-to-month rate. Former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke was the first U.S. Fed chair to set an inflation target.

Inflation targeting spurs demand by setting people's expectations about inflation. They believe the Fed will make sure prices keep rising. That spurs them to shop now before prices rise even more.

When the inflation goes above those 2% it becomes dangerous. Term ""walking inflation"" is when prices rise between above 2% to over 10% in a year, which we saw in the Turkish Lira. In such case, inflation literally robs you of your hard earned money. Price of goods rises faster than the wages do. \[3\]

To put it in an example.  Tomato prices in Turkey (which heavily relies on export) were up 75% in August, compared with the year before, according to the chamber of commerce in the south coast agricultural hub of Antalya. \[2\]

&amp;#x200B;

**Why exactly is inflation bad for us?** 

&amp;#x200B;

* Inflation causes a decrease in the purchasing power of currency.  To put this in an example: Remember when grandmas used to say how a cup of coffee used to cost a few dimes? Nowadays you are lucky to get the coffee under three dollars.   ( ಥ ʖ̯ ಥ) 

&amp;#x200B;

* Some goods that cannot (yet) be replaced, such as food, water, fuel etc., can affect inflation all by themselves. This is why we see gas prices going to the sky.

&amp;#x200B;

* When inflation hits, and populations starts to spend more the inflation can actually boosts itself and causing a domino effect of the financial world. As we've seen in hyperinflation during 1920s Germany, population spends their currency as fast as possible in order to reduce the holding time of their ever depreciating currency and the demand simply out levels the purchasing power. This turns people into a spending frenzy just to get rid of the about to be worthless paper FIAT.

&amp;#x200B;

* Well known Phillips Curve theory that claimed the inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment was pretty much debunked despite coming back into debates nowadays during corona pandemic.

&amp;#x200B;

Situation: I will graduate college in May 2022 and will start full-time work in mid July 2022. I will be renting an apartment starting June 2022 and will need to pay security deposit + first/last month of rent. 

To pay for the apartment security deposit etc, I am considering the possibility of applying for a short-term personal loan (on the order of $10k). 

Constraint: I am an international student on an F1 visa. I am looking to avoid having a co-signer on the loan. 

Research: Most online lenders require co-signers for F1 students. The one place I was able to find that doesn't require a co-signer ([stilt.com](https://stilt.com)) has a minimum loan period of 6 months. I only really need to borrow the money for \~3 months, until I get my first paycheck.

Questions:

\- Are there any other options that you are aware of for borrowing money short term (without exorbitant interest rates)?

\- I could borrow cash from my brokerage margin account. My brokerage (TD Ameritrade) lists an interest rate of \~10%. Are there any pitfalls with this strategy?

# [Dow futures jump more than 300 points, continuing rebound as investors reassess omicron risk](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/06/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures jumped early morning Tuesday after a rebound from a rollercoaster week as investors grew less fearful of the potential impact from the new omicron coronavirus variant.
*****
&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 345 points. S&amp;P 500 futures rose 1.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 1.8%.
*****
&gt; Chipmaker stocks were the early winners, with Intel leaping 8.4% and NVIDIA up 3.7%, following news that Intel was planning to take its self-driving car unit, Mobileye, public in mid-2022.
*****
&gt; Casino stocks also were hot, as Las Vegas Sands rose 3.4%, while cruise lines also gained on the enthusiasm that omicron may pose less of a threat than feared. Carnival and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings jumped about 3.5% each.
*****
&gt; Apple shares rose 1.8% in premarket trading following a call from Morgan Stanley, which maintained its outperform rating on the stock but heightened its price target on it to $200, citing the company’s commitment to developing augmented and virtual reality technology.
*****
&gt; Shares of GlaxoSmithKline were about 1% higher following news that the drugmaker’s monoclonal antibodies treatment had shown effectiveness treating omicron.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere Tesla shares rose nearly 4% despite news that the company had to replace cameras in three of its models. UBS said the electric carmaker will be the dominant force in the industry and raised its price target.
*****
&gt; The overnight session followed a comeback on Wall Street that saw the blue-chip Dow gain nearly 650 points. The S&amp;P 500 jumped 1.1% on Monday with all 11 sectors registering gains. The Nasdaq Composite reversed higher to end the day up 0.9%. The rally was led by travel-related stocks such as airlines and cruise line operators.
*****
&gt; “Easing Omicron fears are making way for investors to position for a more hawkish Fed,” said Fiona Cincotta, senior financial market analyst at City Index. “The markets are dialing back on the potential economic damage that Omicron could cause as initial reports suggest that the new COVID variant is less severe.”
*****
&gt; Investors are betting that the new Covid-19 strain may cause milder illness than feared. White House Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday that the initial data on the variant is “encouraging,” though he cautioned that more information was needed to fully understand it.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, the market also is weighing the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would begin to remove its massive pandemic easing policies and hike rates sooner than expected.
*****
&gt; Comments by Fed officials suggest the central bank is likely to decide to double the pace of its taper to $30 billion a month at its December meeting next week. Initial discussions could also begin as soon as the December meeting about when to raise interest rates and by how much next year.
*****
&gt; “After the markets roller coaster ride last week traders are likely at a bit of a crossroads,” said Chris Larkin, managing director of trading at E-Trade Financial. “On one hand Omicron may be less of a threat, but on the other the Fed could potentially accelerate tightening, so we could see some shifts in the market.”
*****
&gt; Market focus will shift to the new inflation data later this week. The consumer price index, which is expected to be even hotter than the prior month, could become the catalyst for the Fed to deliver faster tightening of its policies.

defi,"Let's Talk About Liquidity And Farming | What A Fair Ecosystem, in De-Fi, Looks Like","If liquidity pools didn’t exist, we wouldn’t be able to exchange tokens. By staking (locking up) tokens in a liquidity pool, you are allowing for the use of those tokens in the trades that occur on the DEX. The person staking the tokens gains interest, much like a person who puts money into a savings account at a bank, earns interest. 

&amp;#x200B;

What is farming? Farming is when you provide liquidity of a token or token pair, and gain interest from the token(s) being locked for a given period of time. You are able to ""harvest"" or unstake these tokens, to remove them from the farm, no longer gaining interest. Perhaps there are too many people in this particular farm, and your rate of interest (ROI) is decreased. Due to this decreased interest, you may want to stake your tokens in another farm, one with higher rewards. Liquidity Provider (LP) Farms work identically to that of regular farms, with the addition of fees to stake and unstake your tokens. What the f$\*k is an LP Farm, you ask? LP farms are a part of the TOAD ecosystem. 

&amp;#x200B;

PADSwap. I have had my eye on this project for a little while. It interests me in a way that no other De-Fi project has, to date. 

&amp;#x200B;

TOAD aims to create the fairest system of perpetual liquidity, reliant on only natural market forces. At the core of this system, is Decentralized Perpetual Liquidity Protocol (DPLP). How TOAD is able to create this ecosystem:

The smart contract doesn’t allow for any more TOAD to be minted - most smart contracts keep this option - , which helps to keeps the price more stable - no inflation, deflation, unlike the Fed. TOAD devs have tied their interest to their users, donating all LP tokens to the farms. Each farm will have varying reward stats, depending on how many people are currently staking in that farm. The more people there are in any given farm, the lower the reward stats and vice versa. This natural flow creates a constant incentive to move into and out of farms. If the farmer has already seen a return on their investment, and is looking out for their own best interest, they will seek to stake in a farm with a higher return. 

All of these cogs work together to create a constant flow of liquidity (DPLP) into the TOAD ecosystem.

What are your thoughts on this ecosystem? What DEXs are you currently interested in and why?",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Hypothetical application of Bitcoin in a potential inflation crisis?,"Greetings,

So to my understanding Bitcoin during this adoption phase is more useful as a hedge against inflation (aside from being a great investment) than an actual currency since we are still two decades from having the entire supply mined and until then it is expected to appreciate consistently. I also watched a video with an interesting point concerning why bitcoin cannot truly replace hard currencies like the US Dollar given the credit/loan/welfare based society that we currently live in. This is perhaps the difficulty of not being centralized and able to freely print (as polarizing as that topic itself can be). Now crypto is certainly in its infancy and there is potential for systems or ideas to potentially account for the need of credit or supply increases, but it sounds like fundamentally, it serves best as an alternative method that operates on scarcity characteristics similar to gold but with the extra perk of being secure, decentralized and potentially cutting out third parties fees (although exchanges are operating and profiting in this space for now).

With that being said, how can Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies help during a hypothetical or potential inflationary crisis? The Weimar Republic departing from the gold standard and printing ridiculous amounts of money to pay war reparations ultimately led to the collapse of the middle class and provided sentiment for WWII, would having an asset similar to Bitcoin during this period make any difference for people or the government in a situation like this? Would benefits only really derive from governments pegging currency to Bitcoin reserves or having institutional funds, companies and normal people putting money into Bitcoin for the period of extreme inflation to retain value? 

I guess another potential interpretation is how Bitcoin will be used in the coming potential inflationary crisis if 'transitory' inflation turns out to be a lot more permanent than the Fed is letting on. 

Also explanations on what exactly Bitcoin's future is if you share the belief that not being able to increase its supply or have monetary policy to combat potential crises would be nice to hear or be directed to content about.

personalfinance,Car insurance denying my claim because address is wrong,"Recently moved to a new apartment. I called to update my address using a welcome document from my landlord- zip code was incorrect by one digit. I remember the insurance rep wanting to clarify the correct zip code because it was showing the actual one when he entered it and I clearly remember saying “please go with (correct) zip code then.” I guess he entered the incorrect one that I pulled from my landlord’s document. Note the welcome document is not the lease, the lease has the actual zip code.

So I got in an accident about a week later and my car was totaled. I owe $20,000 on it still. They are trying to FedEx me the title release and FedEx won’t deliver because the zip code is wrong.

CryptoCurrency,I'm tired of a small but loud minority spreading FUD in this community,"Okay, hear me out, this is not a ""NOOBS BAD"" post.

In fact, a lot of you folks would probably define me as a noob, i'm your classic lurker that's just about smart enough to HODL. 

What really just grinds my gears is the following:
Yeah, we might be in for a bear run, or a bull run, no one, and i repeat, *no one* , can tell, since it's the fucking MARKET. 

My perspective is this: IT DOESN'T FUCKING MATTER.

You can speculate all you want.

What matters is this:

1) 
You should be in this because you BELIEVE in the projects, not because you want a quick buck. (i know, duh). If you really, actually, sincerely believe in a project, a dip or crash shouldn't phase you to the point where you are spamming forums and discord servers with panicky messages. 

2)
Every crash or dip (even in my short two years in crypto) is followed by a massive upwards movement,
 because what we *for sure* can say is that, IN THE LONG TERM, we are in an upwards trend.
Do you really think this immensely growing sector of Finance is just going to get blown into dust just because you wake up one day and see red dildo?

3)
You can always reason or speculate on why things are moving downwards or upwards, but it's basically just wasted energy. You have no control. Just hold and shut the fuck up, or sell, but only, if you can't pay your bills anymore and more important things are on the line.

4) 
CRYPTO IS NOT REAL LIFE(YET) . IT'S JUST NUMBERS ON A SCREEN SO PLEASE PRIORITIZE YOUR WORK, EDUCATION, FAMILY SO IN THE VERY UNLIKELY SCENARIO THAT SHIT ACTUALLY HITS THE FAN, YOU HAVE OTHER THINGS TO FALL BACK ON.

5)
Do your research. Don't just follow the stream, develop nuanced, well-sourced reasons as to why you should or should not invest in things. if a new project's on the block, always assume it's a rug pull and then find aspects that prove that assumption wrong. that way you won't fall for shit like Squid Coin or Snowdog. 

6) 
Sorry for this rant, you might say i'm stating the obvious, but i'm just fed up of people only wearing their short term goggles and panicking or being euphoric because they gained/lost within a week or 24h or 1h. Nothing in life is free, and in crypto, patience and ruggedness towards the market is what you pay.

personalfinance,Family Member With Big Student Loan Debt,"Hey there, 

I have a family member that is currently $90k+ in student loan debt. 

About $30k of that is federal loans in his name. The rest \~$60k is in my parent's name on parent plus loans. The parent loans are in the 6%-7%+ interest range (robbery).

This individual has a solid job making \~$50k/year with prospect for growth. He wants to pay it all off (my parents cannot afford to pay the loans). But I'd like to give him solid advice on the best path forward:  


1. He lives with the parents and is trying to save heavily. The problem is he is now getting older and would LOVE to move out and start his adult life. We went over a budget, and it's possible. But he wouldn't be able to afford paying down the loans but $100/month extra or so. Another variable is he currently has a 45-1hour commute to his workplace from the parent's house. With working long hours + the drive he barely has time for a personal life. Who would vote to move out vs. suck it up and pay debt for another few years?
2. He is considering refinancing the parent plus loans into his name at a lower rate. But, then if hard times come, there's no federal protection for deferment. Seems quite risky? I'd say his job is pretty secure/stable at this point. Not sure what rate he could even get with the debt/asset ratio skue.
3. Any other advice? I've considered offering a 0% interest loan to pay off the 7.5%+ interest loans immediately bc I'm financially quite stable, but I know giving family money gets messy.

Thank you for your help!",finance

* $4132 @ 3.67%
* $3564 @ 3.4%

My original plan was to knock out the private loans first in case there is any chance of public loan forgiveness (unlikely, I know). But now I’m wondering if:

1. I should take care of the largest and highest interest federal loan first, then knock out subsequent higher interest rate loans after that and
2. At what point should I consider paying the minimums on lower interest rate loans and invest my money instead? Should I even consider that at all?

Quick notes:

* My loans are currently deferred until 2023 as I’m wrapping up grad school, so this means no minimum payment due (but I’d like to pay, lol)
* I have a credit card with about $700, I throw a few $$ at it every month. It has 0% APR until late next year
* I could be making closer to $130-140k, but took a lower paying role with a company that allows remote work, incredible health insurance, a work environment I love, 3 weeks off minimum as a rule, two company retreats a year, and more. I wonder if I should look for a higher paying role to help with this debt though...",finance
stocks,2022 Outlook: The Great Rebalancing Begins,"“Investors seem to agree that the economy is beset by huge excesses and extremes, and that 2022 is likely to normalize economic growth and inflation. However, will the new business cycle resemble the prior one of low growth and low inflation, or are structural shifts afoot that require portfolio repositioning? The stock market seems to discount a scenario in which the winners of the past cycle will repeat. Bond market pricing suggests accelerated interest rate hikes in 2022 and that unchecked inflation will be destructive to the cycle. We suggest a third scenario: a robust global recovery; a moderation of US growth and inflation; and more balanced monetary and fiscal policies. We expect the S&amp;P 500 to be range-bound and volatile, and bond returns to be negative net of inflation. Consider rebalancing portfolios: US equities versus non-US; growth versus value; cyclicals versus defensives; megacap versus small- and mid-cap stocks; and active versus passive management. Fixed income should be reduced to fund greater exposure to real assets and to absolute return funds.”

I have about $110k in federal (unsubsidized) student loans of varying interest rates around 6.4% in aggregate.

Based on some pre-screening surveys from various student loan refinance companies, I could refi these loans down to a \~3% interest rate to be repaid over 10 years.

My dilemma:

Do I keep some (\~10k?) high interest federal loans for forthcoming/theoretical student loan cancellation/benefit legislation or should I just refinance the full amount and then pay the minimum each month and invest any extra cash? This is becoming more time-sensitive as I am debating to refi before interest rates may rise due to inflation, also Jan 31 is last day of zero student loan interest for federal loans.

CryptoCurrency,Reply from Senator Sherrod Brown regarding cryptocurrency,"This email was sent to my inbox today after I contacted my senator from Ohio about the recent cryptocurrency legislation:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Thank you for sharing your thoughts regarding cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin.  
&gt;  
&gt;In July 2021, as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, I held a hearing where experts gave testimony on the risks and opportunities associated with cryptocurrency. At the Committee hearing, I called for increased accountability to ensure working families do not end up with all the risk in the digital asset system.  
&gt;  
&gt;Unlike currencies issued by central banks, virtual currencies like Bitcoin - also referred to as digital assets or virtual currency - have no physical form and generally are not accepted by retailers, though a few online retailers and select locations have begun to accept Bitcoin as a cash equivalent. Digital assets are also not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States and are subject to speculation, so while they can sometimes be used like cash, they often have extreme price swings. Several virtual currency exchanges, where a virtual currency can be converted to cash or another virtual currency, have been subject to fraud and theft through hacking. As a result, virtual currencies put Americans' hard-earned money at risk.  
&gt;  
&gt;Federal and state regulators continue to scrutinize cryptocurrency exchange services, like digital wallets and the exchanges themselves, and the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have issued a statement explaining that many crypto assets traded on exchanges appear to be securities. If it's determined that these assets are, in fact, securities, those virtual currency exchanges would need to register with the SEC or face enforcement action for securities law violations. The SEC staff statement, which offers considerations for potential virtual currency investors, can be reviewed here: [https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/enforcement-tm-statement-potentially-unlawful-online-platforms-trading](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/enforcement-tm-statement-potentially-unlawful-online-platforms-trading).  
&gt;  
&gt;Virtual assets and blockchain technology have captured the public's attention and may have useful applications. However, useful applications often use blockchain outside the realm of finance; we should support those innovations. And, I understand the arguments for cryptocurrencies as a method of reclaiming power from Wall Street. The people of Ohio have been spurned by the biggest banks with fees, minimum balances, waiting periods, and ""second chance"" accounts. However, Ohio communities need better solutions than start-up technologies, which largely mirror the Wall Street model. Ohioans deserve greater access to community banks in their own neighborhoods and no-fee accounts, which would allow every Ohioan to open a bank account and make purchases online.

&gt;We must be wary of the risks of emerging technology that fail to safeguard consumer finance. Scammers, fraudsters, and money launderers proliferate in the virtual currency markets, and it is critical that our financial regulators keep pace with innovation. The United States must ensure our economy remains the safest and most dependable in the world. The best thing we can do to protect Americans' money is to adopt smart regulations that protect investors and consumers, and separate the innovators from the extortionists.  
&gt;  
&gt;As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, I will work with my colleagues to ensure that financial regulators, like the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, work to protect consumers from bad actors while ensuring virtual currency innovation can continue.

stocks,VTI vs VOO in a recession/crash/correction?,"These days it seems people tend to prefer VTI over VOO (or other S&amp;P 500) because VTI exposes you to small caps whose growth you could otherwise miss on if you invested in VOO. However, with rising interest rates, I keep seeing the argument that growth stocks are going to suffer, and there's going to be a compression of multiples, with unprofitable companies being the most affected.

My question is, if we assume that interest rates will rise, which would you rather invest in, between VTI and VOO? On the one hand, the S&amp;P 500 tracks profitable, established companies, these are likely to do better in a downturn. On the other hand, some of that compression of multiples has already happened, may already be priced in. Growth stocks have been crushed recently. VTI may also be the less risky option simply because it's more diversified, implies less of a choice.",finance
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, December 7, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, December 7, 2021**

Wrote this on Friday’s Recap: ""*On a personal note, I am taking this opportunity to do some very small dip buying. As usual I believe the market is overreacting (as it tends to do). While it is important to acknowledge the risks present in the market, and be prepared to act if they arise, I personally believe Omicron fears are overblown (I remember we had the same song and dance when Delta was first discovered). More concerning is the Fed’s change in attitude towards inflation. That said, the only thing discussed so far has been accelerating the timeline for tapering asset purchases. As I have said for months at this point, I am not worried about tapering. If/when the Fed begins discussing raising interest rates, then I will step back and reassess.""*

*My point with highlighting is this: the market loves to overreact. Do your own research, stick to your convictions, never listen to mainstream media, but be prepared to react to anything. The market loves overreacting, both to the upside and downside, reality is always somewhere in the middle.*

Stocks extend gains from yesterday with a huge bounce today after new Omicron data coming out of South Africa suggests the severity of the variant is less than originally expected and looked ahead towards the monthly Consumer Price Index, set to be released later this week, which will give us more information regarding the pace and potential staying power of inflation. In other news, the People’s Bank of China recommitted to accommodative monetary policy in the country in an effort to stimulate growth. This is notable at a time when other Central Banks across the world are tightening policy.

**Notable Numbers Today**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): +2.04%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): 3.01%
* Dow Jones (DIA): +1.38%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +2.30%
* Volatility Index: -15.34%
* Apple (AAPL): +3.54%
* NVIDIA (NVDA): +7.96%
* Ford Motors (F): 3.85%
* NovaVax (NVAX): +28.87%
* Square (SQ): +5.27%

Some encouraging developments about the Omicron variant helped boost risk assets today. During an appearance on CNN today, Fauci said that preliminary data and reports coming out of South Africa, where Omicron was originally discovered November 24, suggest the severity of the virus is not as bad as originally feared. Fauci said, “Clearly, in South Africa, omicron has a transmission advantage. And although it’s too early to make any definitive statements about it, thus far it does not look like there’s a great degree of severity to it. But we’ve really got to be careful before we make any determinations that it is less severe, or really doesn’t cause any severe illness comparable to delta, but thus far the signals are a bit encouraging regarding the severity.”

China’s Central Bank cut its capital reserve requirement ratio for banks in the region, meaning they could lend out more money and boost growth. This is interesting given most other Central Banks around the world, including the US, have started tightening monetary policy.

After a massive 25% spike in the Volatility Index (VIX) last week, the fear index lost all its gains in two trading days, a sign that market participants remain bullish and eager to buy up any dips in the market.

Alongside concerns of the Omicron variant, investors have also been ascertaining when and how robustly the Federal Reserve will move to accelerate its asset-purchase tapering program and raise interest rates from their current near-zero levels as inflationary pressures continue to mount. On Friday, the Labor Department is set to release its November Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is expected to show the fastest year-over-year rise in core consumer prices since 1991, at a 4.6% annual gain.

Tech and growth stocks are the longest-duration assets, which means they're going to be the most negatively impacted in valuation by any bump up in inflation which would take interest rates up. But on the other hand, what the Fed is doing and is even talking about doing, which is going from accommodative to more restrictive monetary policy, is known.""

**Highlights**

* Ford Motor (F) said it plans to retire up to $5 billion in high-interest debt and tap into the fast-growing market for ""green"" bonds to help it finance new electric vehicles and expand credit to customers with lower scores.
* Ford partnered with Salesforce (CRM) to launch new SaaS software for Ford’s commercial and services unit.
* In similar news, automakers Stellantis rolled out its new software strategy today, with a 2030 target of 20 billion euros in annual revenue.
* Twitter (TWTR) announced it was acquiring messaging platform Quill in an effort to improve messaging tools in the social media. Based on Salesforce technology, the system will digitize paperwork for contractors, repair technicians and other trades people, and start at $39 per month per user, Ford said.
* Apple (AAPL) signed an agreement with the Chinese government worth an eye-watering $275 billion to placate threats that would hurt their devices and services in the country. As part of the agreement, Apple promised to use more components from Chinese suppliers in its devices, sign deals with Chinese software firms, collaborate on technology with Chinese universities and directly invest in Chinese tech companies.
* Intel (INTC) rose 3% after the company announced it planned to spin off its self-driving unit Mobileye into a company. The IPO is set for 2022, with Intel hanging on to a majority of the company.
* The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on Monday argued that competition in the nascent markets for chips in self-driving cars and a new category of networking chips could be hurt if Nvidia Corp carries out its acquisition of Arm. Sad to say, since NVDA is my favorite company and largest holding, but doesn’t seem like the Arm deal will go through in the end.

CryptoCurrency,Crypto Gaming Won't Suck,"As a long-time lurker of this sub, I'm writing this after reading all the negative sentiment about Crypto Gaming in this sub, and I wish we could be a bit more positive about the revolution crypto and blockchain integration is able to bring to this space.

As someone who is invested in and familiar with a AAA Crypto gaming projects, I would like to share why I think Crypto and NFT Gaming might have a bright future head.

**(Please don't ask which project, I won't be revealing that as I'm looking for discussion and debate, not shilling.)**

I will go through some of the main concerns listed yesterday in the ""Crypto gaming sucks"" post in this thread, so let me know if you think I might be overlooking something!

**1) ""All the Crypto Games I played are crap""**

&gt;All the games people listed are basically browser games that took months rather than years to develop.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the example I am referring to, the game is only expected to come out in 2024, because, well, that's how long a AAA title takes to develop. Good games take time to build, and those who are rushing to push out a market are taking advantage of speculators and gamblers in the market. It's a shame, because projects like this tarnish the good name of crypto for everyone.  
&gt;  
&gt;Crypto Gaming sucks today because good developers need years to develop a good AAA game, and this segment of crypto hasn't even been around that long.

**1.5) ""What makes you think they will actually make a good product if they're not a legacy studio""**

&gt;Well, it's the people. In order to find an actually good project, you need to look at the talent that have associated themselves to a project. Anyone and their mother can launch a coin easily on certain chains--there's no doubt about that. But look how many actually are looking to produce a successful product rather than cashing in on the crypto and metaverse hype?  
&gt;  
&gt;In this particular project I'm eyeing, they have a well-known Movie/Film Director writing the story/world/lore as the World Builder.  
&gt;  
&gt;They are working with an industry leading art director that has worked on many serious titles that you may all be familiar with across all major consoles within the last decade.  
&gt;  
&gt;They chose experienced people for lead roles (Game Director, Tech Director, etc.), hired great developers, and on top of that also partnered with a veteran game development studio that worked on multiple blockbuster titles across consoles and PCs.  
&gt;  
&gt;In addition to this, this project team is releasing their information very transparently. They are informing their community of their development status, showing their in-game Prototype footage, with progress (game design, animations, models, etc.) being shown in a Dev Blog bi-weekly. All of this isn't a flashy CGI animated trailer. There's real substance being built, and not using prepaid assets available from the UE shop.  
&gt;  
&gt;So, based on all the info above, I personally see no reason to not be at least somewhat confident.

**2) ""I don't trust big Publishers like EA with Crypto/NFTs, they only care about money""**

&gt;Well, great, neither do I!  
&gt;  
&gt;The project/independent Studio I am familiar with is independently funded through their tokenomics. A small part of each transaction goes to development, and another part goes to the in-game rewards wallet (not used until launch). This has raised around $3m for Development in the few months since launch, and around $12-13 Mil in the rewards wallet in the native Token.  
&gt;  
&gt;**This is what empowers an independent team of talented, experienced people to develop a game with no restraints from corporate suits who are willing to rush out a buggy, under baked product for the sake of revenue. Case in hand, Cyberpunk 2077. Look what happens when management push developers to release something when it's not ready.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Apart from that, there may be some external capital buying in, however, these people have NO say in development as the game can be made without them, so they have little negotiating power.  
&gt;  
&gt;This is exactly what ruined BF 2042, Cyberpunk 2077, Fallout 76, etc. Management/Investors making decisions for the developers, pushing for earlier releases, all at the expense of the actual gamers.

**3) ""All Crypto-Games are pay to win""**

&gt;I actually personally asked one of the designers about this, and mechanics are being designed to prevent this. The team is staffed with gamers who love to *game*. They're a company of gamers first, building a game for *gamers*, and integrating crypto because that's their vision for the future. Not the other way around.  
&gt;  
&gt;As said, part of every transaction is going to the rewards wallet, meaning as long as people are buying tokens to be spent in-game through shops or buying from other players, all players have the ability to earn rewards simply by playing and looting NFT items from the game, or mining resources and crafting NFT gear and reselling it on the in-game market.  
&gt;  
&gt;Apart from that, there'll be matchmaking mechanics that prevent Giga Chad decked out in $10,000 worth of gear to be put into the same session with Mike's F2P quality gear.  
&gt;  
&gt;Also, to prevent an overflow of items as time goes on, they are also considering solutions like item degradation, scrapping items for parts, upgrades, etc.  
&gt;  
&gt;A game designed by gamers, for gamers.

**4) ""Crypto Games are designed Crypto first""**

&gt;This is true to some extent, especially those certain projects that had been capitalizing on this recently fueled crypto, NFT, and metaverse hype. These projects have skyrocketed to insane market capitalization that is absolutely absurd, and unfortunately, it's the greed fueling this astronomical growth. This eventually capitulates into an earthshattering crash. **But, not all projects are following this hype fueled trend.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Case in point, this project is one where I have had the privilege to have a Director from a TV Show I watch consider my thoughts about the lore and world design he is writing actually engage in conversation with me on Discord.  
&gt;  
&gt;There are AMAs with the people making decisions (CEO, Devs, Designers etc.) at least 2 x Month. The reason the game will some years to release is precisely the fact that it will need so much optimization, balancing, etc. Hell, they are even looking for people who solely specialize in In-Game Economics.  
&gt;  
&gt;They have made it clear, the core Game and Mechanics are #1, otherwise, it'll just remain an unutilized shell made for speculators instead of gamers.  
&gt;  
&gt;And additionally, they are thinking outside the box. They aren't designing this game to be play-to-earn as a sole priority. It is about designing and creating an *actually* *good* game, and then integrating the best parts of crypto, blockchain, and NFTs, into the gaming experience. They are even looking into the wider spectrum of mainstream crypto adoption wherein as of today, the onramp process to even get situated in this space is tough, to say the least.

  
These were the 4 most common themes I found here. I would address them more in detail, but those are the basics.

personalfinance,Need some advice on how to use my refund check,"Hi everyone, 

New to the subreddit and have a quick question. Basically, I don't pay tuition at my graduate program because I have an assistantship on campus. Every semester I get a refund check of about 9k from the school because of this and other federal aid I get. In the past, I'll admit I have been irresponsible because I usually use half of it to pay off my credit card fully, but then I end up racking up credit card debt again, and I ended up spending the other half of useless stuff like eating out or other nonsense. Please don't shame me, I know this was a terrible habit to rack up debt but my parents always had credit card debt and no one ever taught me how to save money or how credit cards work or anything like that. It's not my parents fault either since they are immigrants and didn't know either. I've gotten a lot better with not using my credit card unless I have to use it, but I definitely still have room to grow. 

I'll be getting this refund check at the end of January and I was wondering what I should do. Should I use half of it to pay off my credit card if I know I won't rack up debt again? Should I set aside the money and just make monthly payments on my credit card as security for myself so I don't overspend again? I have a regular savings account, so should I just put the money in there to save or should I open up a high yield savings account to start building up a little bit at a time? If it helps, I don't have any bills except for things like a few streaming services (I also get a free apartment and meal plan through my job on campus) and a few random vet bills/other expenses for my cat here and there. 

Sorry for all the questions, I don't know a lot about personal finance.

personalfinance,Mom wants to pay off mortgage with life insurance but I'm concerned,"My dad died last year and left my mother with around $150k USD in life insurance payouts. 5 years earlier, my parents bought their first house for $175k USD on a 30yr mortgage. (They refinanced about 6months before dad died to a 20yr mortgage and just under 2.5% interest rate.)

Right now there's about $150k left on the mortgage and my mom wants to use the life insurance money to pay off the house. I'm hesitant to back her decision bc my parents were (are?) on a payment plan with the IRS for around $35k in back taxes/fines and my mom hasn't been forthcoming with info on their credit card debit. Everything was joint/in both their names/the cosigned everything, so there's no way for her to get out of repayment.

I'm worried that the IRS will put a lein on the house, or outright take it if it's paid off and something happens to my mother. She's entitled to one of my dad's pensions next year and there's a second pension she can start drawing from when she's 63, but right now she's working full-time as an ""essential"" worker making $10/hour. She can't pay the utilities and the mortgage on that wage, so she's trying to eliminate the mortgage. I'm not confident on her retirement plans or savings and I won't be in a position to help her financially for several more years/at least a decade.

What other things should she be considering? I keep telling her to consult a financial planner but she refuses to make an appt bc ""she knows what she's doing"". I just don't want her to lose the house and the insurance money bc she made a poor financial decision due to fear.",finance
investing,Vanguard Target Funds… a question on risk profile,"So… have any of you done either of the following?

To;dr - I’m currently in the 2055 retirement fund in my 401k. For no other reason than my age (30). Have any of you changed your targeted funds, or have you found a better allocation strategy altogether and thrown targeted funds to the wind?

A) forseen a shaky time and shifted your funds into a near term target fund on the premise that it would be more conservative and fixed income driven? We are at all time highs, and a lot of shakiness in the market and Fed. Obviously who am I to time the market. However, the Vanguard 2015 target fund is showing 5-6% over the last decade. Is that nearly the 40% we’ve seen from the s&amp;p ? Absolutely not. However, noting the parallels to .Com bubble and today, as well as the fact that many companies never returned to their valuations of pre-2001, that6% looks enticing!

B) gotten 10years into your investing career and thought, you know what, I’m going to start investing in a later target retirement fund to get more aggressive. 

I am not going to pretend that I can pick my own basket of stocks to beat the market, but I am curious if I can edge out more aggression by moving my investments (or future contributions) from the current 2055 target date to the 2065. 

Would just love to hear your collective takes",finance
personalfinance,Can my employer cap my 401k contribution percentage?,"Hello!
My goal is to fully max my 401k. I believe the Federal Limit is 59k. In order to meet that goal, I have to contribute 29% of my salary. However, my company will not let me contribute more then 20%. Is this normal?

Side note: while I feel like I should be considered a ""highly compensated employee"" by the IRS, I am not considered one according to my HR department. I do make over the federal limit which I think is currently 130k. The only way around this would be that my employer must make top-paid elections and I am not in the top 20% of earners in my company. 

Any suggestions on how to help are greatly appreciated. Obviously I feel very privileged to make the money that I do, but I live in an area where I still can't afford to buy a tiny house. So I am trying to get creative in building wealth.

economy,RBI MPC Updates: Repo Rates unchanged announced by Shaktikanta Das,"The RBI MPC is likely to keep rates steady and choose to be ‘conservative’ till February 2022 when public health risks would become clearer, experts feel

**RBI Monetary Policy LIVE:** Amid global scare due to new coronavirus variant Omicron, the RBI is likely to maintain status in its upcoming monetary policy and wait for a more opportune time to calibrate benchmark interest rate to promote growth without sacrificing the main objective of containing inflation. If the RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das announces that the central bank continues to maintain status quo in policy rates on December 8 (today), it would be the ninth consecutive time since the rate remains unchanged.

The Reserve Bank Governor-headed Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is scheduled to meet during December 6-8, 2021. The decision of the rate setting panel would be announced on Wednesday (December 8). The central bank had kept the benchmark policy rate unchanged in October.

we believe the talks of a reverse repo rate hike in the MPC meeting may be premature as RBI has been largely able to narrow the corridor without the noise of rate hikes and ensuing market cacophony,” said an SBI research report.

According to it, the RBI is not obliged to act on reverse repo rate only in MPC. “Also, change in reverse repo rate is an unconventional policy tool that the RBI has effectively deployed during crisis when it moved to a floor instead of the corridor,” it added.

Experts also feel the RBI MPC is likely to keep rates steady and choose to be ‘conservative’ till February 2022 when public health risks would become clearer, experts feel.

**Omicron factor:**

Before the Omicron variant of COVID-19 took over the epidemiological and markets discourse, there was a reasonable likelihood that the MPC would signal to the RBI would start the normalisation process of monetary policy at its December 6-8 meeting with a small, maybe 15 basis point, hike in the reverse repo rate.

The RBI has emphatically communicated on multiple occasions that it will proceed with normalisation not in a time dependent, but a state dependent (with a data driven approach) in a gradual, and calibrated fashion with advance telegraphing. This it has already done with the steady rise in both the average and cut off yields in the Variable Rate Reverse Repo (VRRR) auctions.

**Other factors:**

Other than the potential fresh public health uncertainty, the recent and expected growth-inflation trade-off dynamics had warranted a start of normalization, which had been pointed out by some MPC members during the last policy review in October.

The recovery, both globally and in India, continues, although the momentum has been decelerating, and China’s loss of growth momentum is becoming a matter of increasing concern. In many of the large developed countries, inflation has remained high over the past few months, and is expected to persist into the first half of 2022.

Labour markets, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom, remain tight, engendering concerns of wage inflation spilling over into wider price pressures. There is a shortage of labor across a range of professions, further exacerbating price pressures. Housing markets remain strong in many geographies.

**Background:**

The central bank had last revised the policy rate on May 22, 2020, in an off-policy cycle to perk up demand by cutting interest rate to a historic low. The RBI has been asked by the central government to ensure that the retail inflation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) remains at 4 per cent with a margin of 2 per cent on either side. The Reserve Bank had kept the key interest rate unchanged in its after monetary policy review in August citing inflationary concerns.

In its October MPC meeting, the central bank had projected the CPI inflation at 5.3 per cent for 2021-22: 5.1 per cent in the second quarter, 4.5 per cent in third quarter; 5.8 per cent in the final quarter of 2021-22, with risks broadly balanced. CPI inflation for the first quarter of 2022-23 is projected at 5.2 per cent.",finance

Bitcoin,Why I think Bitcoin offers a better monetary standard for the planet than fiat money.,"The Austrian School of Economics defends that money should always arise on the free market.

Our current acquired view of money is set on it always being controlled by some sort of central entity (top-down via government). That central authority is in charge of managing both inflation and monetary policy. 

Bitcoin, however, offers opposite paradigms. It has no central authority and its supply is limited, auditable, and known in advance.  
Economies as a whole are complex and adaptive systems that flow from a different degree of top-down decisions (centralized) and bottom-up decisions (decentralized). It has been proved again and again that economies with an excessive top-down approach (centralisation) don’t allocate resources efficiently.

***Problems with a Fiat standard***

*PRICE SIGNALS*

  
All price dynamics in an economy are moved by an infinitely complex mesh of individual knowledge that a centralized entity cannot gather. The biggest problem of constantly manipulating the money supply is that it obscures and distorts price signals**.**  It is impossible to find out whether the aggregate demand is growing  naturally or because of the additional money injected into the economy. 

When the money supply is constantly manipulated, the pure mathematical objectivity of its measurement cability is distorted. 

Price signals, however, should always be just a pure mathematical coordinative force for free-market agents. If you measure a door with a measuring instrument constantly inflating its scale, then you don't know whether you measure the door or the instrument, you cannot distinguish the signal (the  height) from the nouse (the changes in the unit of measurement). 

  
With productivity gains, prices should fall naturally -we produce more with the same resources-. Price dynamics should only reflect real free-market dynamics. -economic preferences and real demand and supply dynamics-. However, constantly inflating the money distorts the mathematical purity of price signals. As a result, the precision of economic agents to make rational economic calculations is compromised, deriving inexorably in a less efficient economy.   


*DISTORTION OF TIME PREFERENCES &amp; CAUSING BUSINESS CYCLES*

  
Trying to plan monetary policy in a centralized top-down fashion also leads to the distortion of the time preferences of individuals. In the free market, a natural interest rate forms with the equilibrium between low and high time preferences, but in the fiat standard, borrowed money doesn’t come from someone else’s savings, it is just debt that gets created.

  
These dynamics make economic calculations less precise and cause the system to overborrow and misallocate capital. Today, interest rates are artificially lower without a lower time preferences. This according to the Austrian school causes the business cycles of boom and busts.  


**How does Bitcoin solve all these problems?**

With a known, auditable, open-source and absolutely scarce limited monetary supply (mathematically objective), Bitcoin allows for pure pristine price signals, preventing inefficiency costs associated with monetary distortion. All price dynamics just reflect real free-market realities (productivity gains, scarcity, abundance,....) that come in aggregate from each economic agent’s decisions. Prices just reflect economic truth.

  
Interest rates also fluctuate according to real market demand and time preferences in the economy, smoothing the business cycle as a result. 

In conclusion, Bitcoin not only allows for a more efficient economy to flourish as money just represents pure mathematical objectivity, it also takes the monetary power away from politicians, dictators, and bureaucrats back to the individual economic agents. 

Autocrats like Erdogan in Turkey can corrupt the monetary policy of the central Bank of Turkey, but they will never be able to influence or alter Bitcoin’s monetary policy. 

In this last regard, Bitcoin truly unleashes monetary empowerment for all economic agents.",cryptocurrency
stocks,Fed margin call?!,"I recently wire transferred $20,000 to my etrade account and loaded up on some discounted shares.

What I am confused about is I have never used funds that were not already in the account. So margin should not even be applied?

# [Stocks are set to gain for a third day after Pfizer says 3 vaccine doses neutralize omicron](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/07/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures reversed higher and gained for a third day Wednesday after Pfizer and BioNTech said three doses of their vaccine are effective at neutralizing the omicron variant.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial average futures gained 54 points, while S&amp;P 500 futures were up 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.2%. Stock futures were mostly flat or lower before the Pfizer news.
*****
&gt; Pfizer and BioNTech cited their own preliminary lab tests, saying the booster dose provides similar protection as two doses did against the older strain. The companies said two doses may still protect against severe disease.
*****
&gt; On Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite posted their best days since March. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 492 points helped by gains in Apple, Salesforce and American Express. The S&amp;P 500 also registered a gain, climbing 2.1%. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite was the stand-out performer after gaining more than 3%.
*****
&gt; All 11 sectors were positive on Tuesday, led by tech, which rose 3.5%.
*****
&gt; Stocks have recovered this week from last week’s market rout on fears of the omicron Covid variant and a possible faster-than-expected taper of the Federal Reserve’s bond buying program.
*****
&gt; In individual stock news, Apple shares climbed 0.8% despite a report that the iPhone maker is expected to fall 15 million units short of its 230 million-unit goal this year due to supply chain problems.
*****
&gt; Technology stocks have lead the way, with the Nasdaq up 4% since Monday. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 notched their largest two-day gain since November 2020.
*****
&gt; JPMorgan’s Chief Global Markets Strategist Marko Kolanovic said Tuesday that investors can trust this rebound in stocks.
*****
&gt; “When the omicron news hit the tape on Thanksgiving night there was clearly an overreaction,” said Kolanovic, who is also an Institutional Investor Hall of Fame strategist, on CNBC’s “Halftime Report” Tuesday. “Markets sold off very rapidly on news that was not very reliable,” he added. “And now its basically recovering those back.”
*****
&gt; This week’s gains have put the major averages back within striking distance of their record highs. The Dow is 2.3% from its record and the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are 1.2% and 3.2% from their all-time highs, respectively.
*****
&gt; On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release October’s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting there were 10.6 million open positions in October, up from 10.4 million in September.
*****
&gt; While the major of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported third-quarter earnings, Campbell Soup, GameStop and Rent the Runway report on Wednesday.

solar,Need some opinions on rooftop system options,"We just had our roof replaced and now it's time to get some panels up and running.  We've talked to three area contractors and I've also seen what a Tesla system would be.  The top two contenders are locals.  I've read enough about Tesla's customer service issues and habit of trying to kill markets that they're not an option, despite the lower cost.

House is a 2 story colonial in northern Delaware and faces 201° with no tree obstructions.  Delmarva is our utility (net metering is used) and offers up to $6k in rebate, which both systems below would qualify for.  Usage over the past 12 months averaged 1060 kWh (12,720/year) and we paid on average $137/month.  Current rate is 14.5 cents, IIRC.

System 1:  ""Local"" company, about an hour away in NJ, does roofing and solar for the past 13 years.  Had a lengthy Zoom call with a senior solar analyst.  10.2kW system of 30 340W Q-cell panels (5x6 array) with IQ7 microinverters.  Cost about $34k, just under $20k after local rebate and federal tax credit.

System 2:  Local company (doing only solar for the past 17 years) maybe 30 minutes away just inside Maryland (but started in DE).  Their system designer met with us at home for about an hour.  9.6kW system of 24 400W Q-Cell panels (4x6 array) with 7.6kW inverter and optimizers.  Cost is $25.5k, under $13k after rebates tax credits.

Just for laughs, the 3rd guy was a 6.6kW system for about $33k.

PVWatts shows

System 1 - 13.1 kWh (12.5 - 13.6)

System 2 - 12.4 kWh (11.8 - 12.8) 

We agreed initially to system 1 just to lock in the price break on dwindling stock of remaining panels in the warehouse, otherwise it would be a $41k system due to what he said were prices of the new shipments of panels.  We still have the option to back out or have him try to match price to system 2.

Neither company uses subcontractors, both include critter guard, warranties are very similar at 25 years (got system 2 guy to up the inverter warranty to 25 years, but they're only offering 10 year warranty on labor and install.  Which would you go for?",energy
CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin is about to break 40% dominance= Altcoin season,"To date, Bitcoin continues to be the leading market indicator that dictates the future direction of the crypto market as a whole, but data shows that consolidation phases often give Altcoins an opportunity to push higher against Bitcoin.

Soon Bitcoin dominance will break the floor of 40% and cause ALTCOINS to outperform BTC at least. (we do not know against USD) [https://www.tradingview.com/x/zc5XqoQc/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/zc5XqoQc/)

**WHY? : Here is the simple logic that can NOT be ignored.** 

More and more Institutional investors are investing in Altcoins, starting with Ethereum, filtering down to other L1 blockchains.  (Ethereum, Solano, Cardano, BNB, Polkadot, Terra, Avalanche, Fantom, Waves, Celo, ...)  Filtering down to L2 chains etc after.

**INFLATION:**

With inflation picking up, FED tapering and interest rates going up. Investors demand higher Yields.

With Coinbase, BlockFi and Celsius being forbidden to offer stable coin high yields, the border to cross over to Bitcoin yield is likely.

Leaving only Altcoins with PoS that offer staking rewards the only option left for higher yields.  At the same time these chains have also a much higher growth rate of adoption then Bitcoin.

**REGULATIONS:** (from the Biden infrastructure bill)

This means staking Yields are legal.

**HYPER GROWTH RATES:**

* Extreme growth rates in users adoption, much higher then the internet or the Apps as Whatsapp, Uber, Twitter, Instagram, etc.
* \+ combined with very high yield (as staking) that not even can be received by the ""Dogs of the Dow"" : OIL &amp; energy stocks, Big Pharma stocks, cigarettes stocks etc., Who ALL have no or single digit % growth in revenues.
* \+ combined with a 100% security that the high yield won't change in the next 5 years.
* \+Combined with an acceptable inflation rate in the Total Supply of coins.
* \+ Combined with an upfront known inflation rate in the total supply that for no reason will increase.

Just go an search for it in the stock market:

1. triple digit  growth rate in : users, usage, monthly active users etc. expected for many years.
2. \+ High Yield (dividend) +5%/Y with a 100% security for the next 5 years the dividend Yield won't be changed.
3. \+ an upfront know and fixed inflation rate in the total supply of outstanding shares. (where not any directors options, or ATM of selling new shares can surprise you dumping new shares on the market)
4. \+ Be able as retail investor to buy in way before the institutional money will invest. Most of the time, institutional investors buy first and leave the bread crumbs for the small retail investor.

= you won't find any stock on the market that meets these 4 criteria's.  Please let us know if you know any stock that meets this.

But you will find many in the ALTCOIN CRYPTO MARKET.

OK, now you know we are part of a goldilock scenario that institutional investors want also. But they do not like to buy high or last. The only way they can get in cheaper is to manipulate the market. The Future ETF's was one shot. They probably have more down their sleeves to shake your coins out of your pockets.

If you invest with the money you do not need to eat or live, and not with margin. Knowing the above, the institutionals can shake as much as they want between themselves but your coins won't fall in their pockets. And as coins can't be created more by voting of the board of directors as in the stock market, they do not have many options to get your coins. Except if they change the law and make it illegal as retail investor to own crypto. Some countries as China follow that road. (but the force of the crowd can not be ignored or stopped at the end)

personalfinance,Paying off student loans before or after buying (mortgaging) a house?,"Hi all, thanks in advance for reading this post and any advice you might have.

I graduated from undergrad a few years ago and have student loans totaling $14,000 (all subsidized loans, all between $3k-$4.5k, all with interest 5% or lower). I immediately entered graduate school, so my loans have since been deferred since I am a full-time student. During grad school, I have been receiving a stipend from my university; additionally, I have a paid internship. As such, I am in a good position to begin paying off my loans now, during this deferment period. Ideally, I would like to pay them off completely before my deferment and grace period ends, and I believe I could support this financially without issue.

However, I am also looking to purchase/mortgage a house in the near future (summer/fall 2021). I know that paying off a loan will temporarily impact your credit score, so my question is this: would it be better to wait to pay off my loans until I have a secured mortgage? Another thought I had was to at least pay off the loan with the highest interest rate first, and before the new tax year. But I would be interested to hear your thoughts and advice on the matter before I do anything.

I should note that both my partner (who will also be involved in the mortgage) and I have credit scores around 740-760.

Let me know if you need any other information. Thanks again for your help!

Fed target inflation rate is 2% annually, so how in hell a raise in interest rates by 1% will Tame inflation that is running hot now at over 8%? 

If they want that 2% target then the Fed will have to raise interest rates overnight to 6% to tame that 8% inflation right? What the hell can a 1% rate increase can do? Its like throwing a cup of water onto a house fire to hopefully put out the fire. I don't get it, someone explain lol.

All this is causing risk on markets like bitcoin &amp; stock markets to sell off which is absolutely nonsense or is the Fed really and can shoot up interest rates to 6% overnight and the markets are fearing this?

Bitcoin,"They are getting desperate: ""Earn 7.12% Risk-Free on Your Savings, No Crypto or Junk Bonds Needed""","[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-02/these-risk-free-inflation-protecting-bonds-earn-7-12-interest](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-02/these-risk-free-inflation-protecting-bonds-earn-7-12-interest)

Low-risk saving just got considerably more lucrative. Forget cryptocurrencies and junk bonds, individuals can now get a whopping 7.12% direct from the U.S. government.

That’s the new rate for Series I savings bonds bought from the U.S. Department of Treasury from now through April 2022 -- the second highest ever offered.

Rising inflation is responsible for the eye-popping headline rate. Labor shortages have pushed wages up, and the ongoing pandemic continues to wreak havoc on the supply chain, a combination that’s led to higher prices across the U.S. 

Graph: U.S. prices rise at the fastest pace in more than 30 years 

The interest rate on the Series I bond is set twice a year based on recent changes to the the consumer price index for all urban consumers, so November’s pricing is based on the change from March to September. The rapid surge in inflation means you’ll now get double the six-months-ago offer of 3.54%. 

With interest rates still at crisis-era levels, it’s one of the few places individuals looking for inflation protection can turn without getting into higher risk investments. 

The interest rate is guaranteed for the first six months and after that will rise or fall depending on inflation. You have to hold onto your investment for at least a year, and if you exit before five years, you’ll lose three months of interest. 

The maximum investment is $15,000 per calendar year, they aren’t tradeable, and purchases are limited to U.S. citizens, residents and employees.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Trying to decide if I should pay cash for my car,"So I’m buying a new car, I ordered it in October and it should be here mid-December. A few things have happened in that time and I’m trying to decide my best financial options. Any advice would be appreciated. I’ll lay out all relevant info (maybe some not relevant lol) below. 


So originally I was planning on trading in my 2020 Impreza(lease) for a new Forester. But a few weeks ago I was hit by another car and it did a lot of damage to the Impreza. The buyout for the Impreza was around $18,000 in October and Subaru wanted to give only $14,000. I looked and Carvana offered me $23,000 before the accident. Now, after the accident, I don’t even think Subaru will take it and Carvana is offering $16,000. Better than nothing. I’m trying to look into diminished value claims at the moment to see if I can recoup the $2,000 loss. 


I’m also selling my house. We close next week. After all fees and the agents cut, I’ll be making $106,000 from the sale. 

Debt to be paid: 
HVAC unit: $8,000
Credit card: $6,000
Student loan: $16,000 
POD moving container: $5,000 
Potential loss on Impreza: $2,000 

So with all of that paid I’ll still have $69,000 from the sale. 

I have about $12,000 in the bank right now. So total in my account would be $81,000. 

The forester is about $35,000. 

With interest rates being so low, does it make sense to finance it and just do monthly payments? Now that we won’t have a mortgage, would having a car loan be good for our credit? (Score is around 800) 

We would obviously like to see $81,000 in our savings, but does it make more sense to pay cash for the car?",finance

personalfinance,Should I pay cash or finance a new car?,"I'm in the process of buying a new car. I own my old car with a trade-in value of $16,000 (2017 Hyundai Elantra). The new car is $48,000 (used 2021 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid). I'm also putting down $5,000 so the total down payment on the RAV4 is $21,000 making the amount to be financed $27,000. My credit score is 800 and it's looking like used car interest rates are 4-4.5%, I just assumed 5% for this. I will be financing for 48 months. Looks like my total interest cost will be around $60\~/month or $2800 over the course of the loan. I don't have to finance the car; I can just pay cash for it - but I like to keep a healthy amount of cash on hand just in case (I would still have $30,000 in the bank after paying cash for the car).

So I guess the general question, do I finance or pay cash? What are the general thoughts here?

Thanks.",finance

personalfinance,I'm worried this is a scam. I got an email congratulating me on completing something for navient. It wasn't me.,"I have student loans through nelnet. They are over 10 years old. I recently filled out a form with them to readjust my monthly payments based on my monthly income. Other than that one form, which was through a .gov website, I have not done anything to interact with my personal finances in any way.  That was about a week ago. 

Just now I got an email from ""Navient-Department of Education Loan Servicing CustomerService@navient.com"" the email congratulates me on completing the Federal Rehabilitation Program. 

The email goes on to tell me exactly this: 

""We're servicing 1 recently rehabbed loan totaling $3,265.96 on behalf of the U.S. Department of Education. Navient is committed to providing you reliable support with the simplicity you deserve."" 

It then gives me instructing on how to manage my new loan. I disregarded the contact information on the email and found a customer service number for navient on Google. It was answered on the second ring without an automated answering service by a woman with a thick Indian accent. When I explained I thought I had a fraudulent Loan she said OK let me get you the phone number for navient. I thought that was who I called but OK. I called the number she gave me. Again, I was answered on the second ring without an automated answering service, this time by a guy with a thick Indian accent who couldn't even pronounce the word navient. His first question was my social security number. When I tried getting information without giving my number he got very rude. How do I find out if I've had my identity stolen and a Loan made in my name, or if that has all been nothing more than a scam?

personalfinance,"38, 40 yr olds looking for guidance and sanity check","We are 38 and 40 yrs old with a 3 year old. We're in a Upper-Middle Cost of Living Area, from what I can tell. I'm looking for feedback on our retirement plan and home expense affordability. 

Income: 

* $75k salary, $35-45k self-employed.
* take-home pay for the salary is approx $1800 per pay period.

Assets: 

* Cash: $63k (50k set aside for student loan payments)
* Retirement: $29k
* Car is owned outright. 

Liabilities (all student loans): 

* Federal: $51k @ average of 6%, monthly payments $740, give or take (these will be paid off with cash once COVID forbearance ends)
* Private: $40k @ 7%, monthly payment: $440 or so. not refinanced 'cause... no good reason really. 
* Private: $10k @ 5.25%, monthly payment: $125 or so. 
* Credit cards are paid off in full every month. 

Plans, past and future: 

Past: Pay off debt as quickly as possible. Since February 2018, net worth has increased $110k (I feel pretty good about this, considering we had a baby in that time frame and some other very large and unexpected medical bills). 

Current: Pay off the larger monthly payment loans to increase cash flow. Continue throwing a ton of money at the loans, but also consider setting some aside for a small down-payment on a house. 

Future: Save $24k tax-advantaged per year starting ASAP, but let's use age 45 for the starting point. Likely would be sooner. Assuming retirement at 70 and a tepid return (4%) on investments due to the extended boom we've been in for 13 yrs now,  we'd end up with about $1M in the market at retirement. Does this seem about right. 

Over the past 2+ years (since first decent job, but with a pretty crappy one in there for 9 months), our monthly expenses, excluding medical (now under employer), childcare (which will likely be decreasing in September), taxes, rent ($1100), and debt payments, has averaged $1825. 

So, after debt is paid off, I'd want to be spending about $4k in our current expenses and retirement savings. Take-home pay for us averages about $7333. 

In this situation, does budgeting $2000 per month for all home expenses (mortgage, pmi, taxes, upkeep) seem reasonable? (as an aside, what are some good guidelines for housing upkeep cost as a percentage of home value. I know this depends on age of house, etc, but a ball park would be useful).",finance

stocks,Don't fight the Fed...,"We all witnessed a more hawkish J Powell past week. QE has already started and  the rate of tapering is probably increasing. Many analysts claim that the Fed will start raising interest rates by May 2022. While many believe that the onset of tightening will mark a period of low returns from equities, i believe that the real question is how fast will the rates rise: a 0.25% increase every 4 months is a lot more manageable for the broader market than a 0.5% increase or higher. So, while a more hawkish Fed could very well be a headwind for the market going forward, maybe it's not all ""doom and gloom"" for 2022 and beyond if the committee adopts a more gradual approach to rate hikes.

CryptoCurrency,Crypto crash: Over 60% of investors who borrowed money to buy Bitcoin are now sh**ing themselves,"In a [study by KIS Finance](https://www.kisbridgingloans.co.uk/finance-news/cryptocurrency-consumer-research-and-data-autumn-2021/), it was revealed that over two thirds of cryptocurrency investors borrowed money to make their purchase, rather than using income and/or savings.   


Overall, more than two thirds (64%) of those who have invested in cryptos, used one or more credit facilities to do so.   


Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and a risky way to invest large sums of money. Bitcoin, for example, reached at all time high of more than $69,000 (£52,000 approx.) in early November. Just a month later, it is now worth just over $50,000 (£37,700 approx.) per coin.   


That’s a drop of almost $20,000 in just a few weeks.   


Percentage of crypto investors who used one or more credit facilities to fund purchase, by age  


* 18 - 24: 70%
* 25 - 34: 64%
* 35 - 44: 68.9%
* 45 - 54: 62.5%
* 55 - 64: 45%
* 65+: 25%  


As the data shows, those aged between 18 and 24 were the age group most likely to use borrowed funds to make their investment, with a significant drop of borrowers in the two highest age groups.  


What type of credit facilities have people used to fund cryptocurrency investments?  


When we break down what kinds of credit facilities people have used to purchase cryptocurrencies, over a third (35.5%) made their investment using a credit card. Almost a fifth (19.3%) funded the purchase out of their overdraft.  


* Credit card: 35.5%
* Overdraft: 19.3%
* Personal loan: 14.6%
* Secured loan: 9%
* Payday loan: 7.6%
* Re-mortgage: 3.3%  


Holly Andrews, Managing Director at [KIS Finance](https://www.kisbridgingloans.co.uk/), comments on the findings.   


“In recent years, cryptocurrencies have become far more mainstream with tech giant PayPal now offering a cryptocurrency trading platform.  


Although cryptos, and specifically Bitcoin, have seen people make thousands or even millions in profit; the last few weeks have shown that they are incredibly volatile and can see investors losing large percentages, or all, of what they put in very quickly.  


It’s concerning to see that so many people have turned to borrowed funds to purchase cryptocurrencies as they are extremely unpredictable and offer no guarantees that the money invested will be returned. So, if people are investing money that isn’t theirs and subsequently losing it, this could cause some serious financial challenges later down the line.  


The biggest concern is those who don’t have the means to pay the money back, especially if their original plan was to repay their loans with the profits made from their investment. With a very strong possibility of losing the money for good, people may be left severely out of pocket and racking up interest on their credit cards and overdrafts. Also, some credit card providers will view this type of transaction as a cash advance, meaning a cash advance fee and higher interest rate will be applied.  


So, if you are thinking of making an investment into cryptocurrencies, you should only invest an amount of money that you can afford to lose and it should be funded through income and/or savings rather than a credit facility.  


Borrowing money to invest in cryptos can become a very vicious cycle that’s difficult to break. Once you start losing money, it can be very tempting to invest more to make the money back; especially if you don’t have other means of repaying the funds.  


Great care should be taken when you invest money anywhere, but especially when it’s something as volatile as cryptocurrencies. If you can, seek some professional financial advice first and never invest more than you can afford. Buying cryptocurrencies should also not be your only form of investment or savings as there is very little stability – spread your investments out and treat cryptocurrencies as a smaller, fun investment.”

personalfinance,What to do about a bug in the FICO score calculation on my report.,"HEY PF,

 I need some help. I recently had my credit card limit lowered and Bank of America refused to raise it because of what seems to be a bug in the FICO score algorithm.

This has been an ongoing problem for a long time now (it showed up when I applied for a mortgage a while back and would have seriously impacted my interest rate if my SO wasn't able to qualify solely under her name).

* USD Coin or $USDC is the 2nd largest stablecoin by market capitalisation. $USDC is governed by Centre, a membership-based consortium that sets technical, policy and financial standards for stablecoins. $USDC is issued by regulated financial institutions, backed by fully reserved assets and is redeemable on a 1:1 basis for US dollars according to Centre. In contrast with the decline in Tether's growth, we see a corresponding increase in $USDC's market capitalisation. $USDC market cap increased by a whopping 133% in Q2 2021, in comparison to Tether's 54%.
* Binance USD (BUSD) is the 3rd largest stablecoin by market capitalisation and is similarly a 1:1 USD-backed stablecoin issued by Binance (in partnership with Paxos), and is approved and regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). $BUSD is used in the Binance Smart Chain and has also seen an uptrend in its market cap.
* $DAI uses an over-collateralised mechanism to maintain a $1 peg of $DAI to USD. Unlike the 3 aforementioned stablecoins, $DAI is a form of crypto-collateralised pegged stablecoin and is decentralised. However, much of what collateralises $DAI involves $USDC.

* $UST is the stablecoin used within the Terra ecosystem. The $LUNA token in Terra is used to support the $UST stablecoin peg.

For whatever reason, I noticed today that on my earnings statement that I had been deducted exactly $0 in Federal Tax Withholding for the entire time I've been employed. When I called the Accounting folks in our organization about it, they mentioned that it had to do with the $2000 being more than my $1674 gross pay that I take home per pay period and that I needed to change the number.

So my question is was $2000 correct and I had to put in additional withholding below? Should I have put something else in Step 3? (Note: I already know I will owe a decent amount of money, I just want to understand what went wrong cause it doesn't make any sense to me)",finance
personalfinance,How to take advantage of current low interest rates for federal student loans at 3.76-5.05%?,"I took out student loans starting in 2015, so my loan interest rates range from 3.76% to 5.05%.

The complication is that I have the repayment plan selected where my initial payments are low and increase over the years, so I am also wondering if any options exist where I can both lower my interest rate and still have a progressively priced repayment plan.

CryptoCurrency,"Let's deep dive on USDT's and USDC's much cooler older brother the Terra ecosystem. Understanding the economic model behind Terra - an ecosystem which hopes to provide global, algorithmic stablecoins.","What is Terra? What is Lunar? How does it differ from other stablecoins? I hope to answer these questions below and provide an informative guide for users dipping their toes in the ecosystem. As always chime in if you feel there are any inaccuracies or have another perspective. 

**Overview** 

* DPoS blochain supporting stable payments and open financial infrastructure development 
* Algorithmically backed stable coin supported by fiat-pegged stable coins which are stabilised by the native crypto asset Luna 
* Stable coins are pegged to the USD, EUR, CNY, JPY, BGP, KRW, IMF, SDR 
* Luna represents mining power in the Terra network – the stake represents the pro-rata odds of generating Terra blocks 
* Built using the Cosmos SDK, utilising a PoS BFT consensus mechanism based on Tendermint 
* Relies on the top 100 validators to commit new blocks into the blockchain – they broadcast votes, which contain cryptographic signatures signed by each validator’s private key 
* In order to maintain the security network validators will incur heavy slashing if: 1) Double sign, 2) Are non-responsive, 3) Miss too many oracle votes 

**What is Luna?** 

* The native token of the Terra ecosystem and serves to protect the integrity of Terra mechanisms through staking 
* It plays a crucial role in pegging the value of Terra stable coins to fiat currencies by acting as collateral 
* It can exist in 3 states: 

1. Unbonded = Luna that may be freely traded 
2. Bonding = Luna that is staked, accuring rewards for both the delegator and validator 
3. Unbonding = Luna that is undergoing the process of being undelegated from a validator by the delegator, such that it may be freely traded. This process takes 21 days 

**How does Luna address multi-fiat pegged monetary policy?** 

* Price-stability 
   * Terra aims to be a family of cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the world’s major currencies 
   * Terra SDR will be the flagship currency of the family as it exhibits the lowest volatility against any one fiat currency. This is the currency in which transaction fees, miner rewards and stimulus grants will be denominated 
   * Liquidity is achieved by Terra by supporting atomic swaps at market exchange rates – e.g. you can swap Terra EUR for Terra USD at the effective EUR/USD exchange rate. This allows for international trade settlements 

&amp;#x200B;

* Measuring price-stability 
   * A decentralised price oracle is used to estimate the true exchange rate
   * The mechanism is as follows: 
      * For any Terra sub-currency miners will submit a vote for what they believe to be the current exchange rate in the target fiat asset 
      * Every n blocks the vote is tallied by taking weighted medians as true rates 
      * X amount of Terra is rewarded to those who voted within 1 SD of the elected median. Those who voted outside may be punished via slashing of their stakes 
   * Minimising the risk of profiting by a false vote is achieved by limiting the vote to a subset of voters who have a significant vested interest in the system

&amp;#x200B;

* Achieving price-stability 
   * Stability is achieved with consistent mining awards and following a simple supply vs demand model
      * For example, when price levels are falling below the target, contracting the money supply will return price levels to normalcy 
   * Terra miners absorb volatility in the Terra supply 
      * Miners can absorb contraction costs through mining power dilution – in this case the system mints and auctions more mining power to buy back and burn Terra, contracting the supply until its price has returned to the peg. This will temporarily dilute the mining power 
      * They are compensated in the long term as the system buys back mining power until a fixed target supply is reached, and then increases mining rewards 

&amp;#x200B;

**How miners absorb short-term volatility but are compensated in the long-term**

* Luna serves as a defence mechanism against Terra price fluctuations 
   * When Terra USD price &lt; 1 USD, users and arbitragers can send 1 Terra USD to the system and receive 1 USD’s worth of Luna 
   * When Terra USD price &gt; 1 USD, users and arbitragers can send 1 USD’s worth of Luna to the system and receive 1 Terra USD
   * What is important to note here is that $1 worth of LUNA DOES NOT equal to 1 LUNA token  

&amp;#x200B;

* Luna is minted to match with Terra offers, which theoretically means that if unmitigated represents diminishing rewards for miners due to inflation. This is circumvented by burning a portion of Luna that is earnt during expansions, until Luna reaches a supply of 1 billion 
* There are two ways in which miners are rewarded for their work: 
   * Transaction fees 
      * Defaulted to 0.1%, with a maximum of 1%
      * These fees are significantly cheaper when compared to what centralised financial institutions offer with modern financial products 
   * Luna burn (seigniorage) 
      * Luna is burnt, making miner power more scarce 
* Logically it would follow, to maintain consistency within the system and reduce volatility: 
   * If mining rewards are increasing then fee rewards DECREASE and the rate of Luna burning DECREASES
   * If the mining rewards are decreasing then fee rewards INCREASE and the rate of Luna burning INCREASES 

&amp;#x200B;

**Miner reward function** 

Let’s go over some maths. The following is from the whitepaper and formalises the relationship between transaction fees and miner rewards. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/l0bkffka8f481.png?width=451&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d6473d111b600b893921e6699699db1bb53d20d9

Let’s assume that ft, Rt and bt represent the transaction fees. Therefore, let us assume ft+1 represents the next state in the chain, and Rt-1 represents the previous state in the chain. Let’s consider the following: 

* Assume that mining rewards dropped by 60% 
* Plugging this into the formula: ft+1 = (1+g) \* 1/0.6 \* ft = 1.67 \* (1+g) \* ft 
* Thus, fees would increase by a factor of 67% 
* 1+g represents a growth factor that will gradually increase in proportion to long-term growth of the Terra economy 

&amp;#x200B;

How does this play out, and why is it important? 

* Consider that all transactions in the Terra ecosystem represent its GDP 
* Mining rewards and fees are inversely related to the GDP – that is, as the GDP increases the mining rewards and fees per transaction decrease. This shouldn’t be alarming as miners would be adequately compensated by the volume of transactions whilst users can continue to enjoy low fees (to a certain extent) 
* This might be concerning as following this logic it would mean that a large-scale adoption of Terra would result in increasingly diminishing rewards for miners and thus perturb their involvement in the ecosystem, reducing miner volume and centralising nodal power 
* However, recall the above formulas and arbitrage situations – mining rewards would be adjusted by a proportional increase in fees 
* This means that mining rewards will be of low volatility
* Reducing the volatility and providing predictable rewards to miners is a mechanism via which Terra can continue to grow without fear of losing miners to more profitable and volatile protocols 

&amp;#x200B;

**Terra Treasury**

* The main focus of the treasury is the allocation of Luna from seigniorage to dApps
   * This process has multiple steps and involves the dApp applying for an account with the Treasury 
   * Democracy is at the core of the system with validators voting to accept or reject dApp applications 
   * Yes votes must be &gt;= 33% of validator power for a dApp to be accepted 
   * Validators have the right to blacklist a dApp for bad behaviour and the voting system is similar as above 
   * The amount of funding is weighted 
   * Weighting is determined by two factors: 1) How much economic activity does the dApp stimulate?; 2) How efficienctly does the dApp utilise allocated funds? 

&amp;#x200B;

**The mechanisms behind dApp funding allocation** 

The following is the formula via which Terra weights funding allocation to a dApp

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x1pzk7xv8f481.png?width=268&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=22adb92c6f1c83606119979ae75915a01b43b23c

The meaning of the symbols: 

* \* = moving average 
* TVt\* = Average transaction volume generated by the dApp in a preceeding arbitrary interval (we will assume from genesis of the dApp prior to a Treasury application). Therefore, this would represent the economic activity of the dApp. This considers factor 1) we discussed above. 
* ∆TV\*t = Trend in transaction volume between two time points – we will again assume this would be between genesis and the current time point. If positive this would imply that the transaction volume is increasing 
* F\*t-1 = Funding received up until this point 
* Thus, ∆TV\*t/ F\*t-1 = How does economic activity relte to funding, that is to say how efficiently does the dApp utilise its funding – a larger number implying greater degrees of funding efficiency. This considers factor 2) we discussed above 
* λ= How important is this economic activity? From the above we can see as  decreases there is a favour towards higher degrees of funding – thus we can modulate this parameter to favour dApps which have large economies 

&amp;#x200B;

**How do Terra stablecoins differ from other popular stablecoins?** 

* Let’s consider the current top stablecoin USDT 
* USDT is centralised, controlled by Tether and minted arbitrarily by the organisation. 
* It is similar to Terra in that it is fiat-pegged 
* However, it differs in that its focus is fiat-pegging to the USD, whilst Terra is an ecosystem of stable coins which increases its potential to have more global adaptation and facilitate transactions between vendors where USD is not a viable medium 
* What further differs Terra from other stablecoin protocols is the adoption of decentralised oracles in which validators contribute to the price feeding via submitting oracle votes (bad behaviour being discouraged by slashing)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; **Jim Rickards:** Sure. There are two reasons. One’s sort of more anecdotal; the other is much more rigorously scientific. The first reason is that the international monetary system has collapsed three times in the past 100 years, in 1914, 1939, and 1971. It’s been over 40 years since the last collapse. These things do seem to happen every 30 or 40 years. That’s just based on experience. That seems to be the useful life of the international monetary system. 

[The Collapse of the international monetary system and the petrodollar, part 1](https://internationalman.com/articles/the-collapse-of-the-international-monetary-system-and-petrodollar-part-1/)

 

#### Historical overview

From the 19th century to present, the major international monetary systems have evolved as follows.

&gt;**Gold standard, until 1914** (fixed rates under UK dominance): throughout most of the 19th century and up to 1914 (outbreak of WW1), the world was on a gold standard. Especially, the period of 1879-1913 was called the Classical Gold Standard (or International Gold Standard) because all major countries participated in it. Trade was liberalized and capital was mobile.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Interwar period**: after WW1, the world powers tried to return to the gold standard at prewar parities (i.e., at the previous exchange rates), but the attempt to restore gold convertibility did not succeed, except momentarily. The 1920s-30s were characterized by recessions, banking crises, the Great Depression and the rise of fascism. Exchange rates were mostly floating and protectionism increased. There was a hegemonic power shift from the UK to the US.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;**Bretton Woods system, 1950s-1971** (US-centered fixed rates): Under the international dollar standard, the world economy experienced high growth, price stability and movement toward freer trade. Unlike the gold standard days, however, there were severe restrictions on private capital mobility.  
&gt;  
&gt;**General floating and attempts to reduce instabilities, 1973-**: After the transition period of 1971-73, the major currencies started to float. Soon, it was discovered that currency sometimes fluctuated too much. Crises and calm periods alternated. Overshooting, currency crises and massive capital flows became common. From 1985, major countries occasionally intervened jointly to correct currency levels. At the same time, European countries strived to create a unified currency in steps, which was achieved in 2002.

&gt;Why Currencies Collapse  
&gt;  
&gt;History is full of sudden [currency collapses](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/currency-crises.asp). Argentina,﻿ Hungary,﻿ Ukraine,﻿ Iceland,﻿ Venezuela,﻿ Zimbabwe and Germany﻿ have all experienced terrible currency crises since 1900. Depending on the definition of ""collapse,"" the Russian currency calamity during 2014 could be considered another example.  
&gt;  
&gt;The root of any collapse stems from a lack of faith in the stability or usefulness of money to serve as an effective store of value or medium of exchange. As soon as users stop believing that a currency is useful, that currency is in trouble. This can be brought about through improper valuations or [pegging](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency-peg.asp), chronic low growth, or [inflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp).

&gt;Will the U.S. Dollar Collapse?  
&gt;  
&gt;There are some conceivable scenarios that might cause a sudden crisis for the dollar. The most realistic is the dual-threat of high inflation and high debt, a scenario in which rising consumer prices force the Fed to sharply raise interest rates. Much of the national debt is made up of relatively short-term instruments, so a spike in rates would act like an [adjustable-rate mortgage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/arm.asp) after the teaser period ends. If the U.S. government struggled to afford its interest payments, foreign creditors could dump the dollar and trigger a collapse.  
&gt;  
&gt;If the U.S. entered a steep recession or depression without dragging the rest of the world with it, users might leave the dollar. Another option would involve some major power, such as China or a post-European Union Germany, reinstating a commodity-based standard and monopolizing the reserve currency space. However, even in these scenarios, it is not clear that the dollar necessarily would collapse.  
&gt;  
&gt;The collapse of the dollar remains highly unlikely. Of the preconditions necessary to force a collapse, only the prospect of higher inflation appears reasonable. Foreign exporters such as China and Japan do not want a dollar collapse because the United States is too important a customer. And even if the United States had to renegotiate or default on some debt obligations, there is little evidence that the world would let the dollar collapse and risk possible contagion.

2. P2P is now live on the Cardano testnet! This is a busy week for new products launching on testnet! [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1468592725532553226](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1468592725532553226)
3. The heads of Circle, FTX, Bitfury, Paxos, Stellar Development Foundation, and Coinbase appeared before the House Financial Services Committee. As expected, the questions from some of the House Committee members belied a misplaced focus on things like terrorist financing while others understood the need to regulate crypto appropriately so that crypto innovation is not forced offshore. There was significant focus on stablecoins due to the President’s Working Group placing so much focus there. One representative also chose to focus heavily on the energy consumption of Bitcoin mentioning coal power plants coming back on line to fuel Bitcoin mining. The witnesses from the crypto industry seemed to focus on dispelling misconceptions and also pushing for a single crypto focused regulatory body as opposed to the fragmented regulation that is typical in Washington.

They also want to curtail such affiliations for custodial wallet providers.

71. Charles dropped a new AMA where he mentioned very briefly that they are actually going to look into read-only UTxOs.

81. Charles drops a video on the eToro user limitations. It sounds like IOHK knew nothing about this. Interacting with exchanges falls in the Cardano Foundation’s wheelhouse. It’s unclear whether the CF knew anything. He also pointed out it’s very interesting that an old line exchange like Bitstamp has decided to LIST Cardano during this same period. Charles also mentioned that they haven’t seen any regulatory activity on IOHK’s end. eToro is a relatively small source of liquidity for Cardano and there shouldn’t be much of an impact.

CryptoCurrency,Coingeek's hidden financial motive behind presenting Wright as Satoshi ! Be careful what you read on internet,"In case anyone wants to read the original article : https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/08/there-was-no-satoshi-nakamoto-lawsuit/



The people active in Crypto knows the truth.But people outside the crypto might not be aware of the truth and fell for these catchy headlines being circulated all over internet creating a false narrative of Wright is the Satoshi.Be very careful of what you read on internet. 


A number of mainstream news outlets are addressing Wright as the Satoshi Nakamoto the sole creator of Bitcoin. 

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59571277

https://www.republicworld.com/technology-news/other-tech-news/bitcoin-inventor-wins-right-to-keep-cache-worth-billions-of-dollars.html


It all started with Coingeek's article 

https://coingeek.com/bitcoin-creator-craig-wright-100-satoshi-nakamoto-says-kleiman-v-wright-jury/

as an evidence for it's claim the article quotes a statement made by Wright's lawyer Andres Rivero after the trial :

&gt;The decision reached by the jury today reinforces what we already knew to be the truth : Dr. Craig Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto, the sole creator of Bitcoin and Blockchain technology

The above statement by Wright's lawyer made outside of court proceedings has nothing to do with the jury's ruling. The case did not consider the question of Satoshi's real identity. 

The real verdict : 

&gt; jury found Wright guilty of intellectual property theft and has ordered him to pay $100m in damages to am entity he founded with Kleiman, W&amp;K Info Defense. 


The website Coingeek has financial motives for it's campaign.,this website is an Ayre Group company 
Proof : https://ayre.group/portfolio , 

one of several owned by federally indicted gambling entrepreneur Calvin Ayre. 
https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2017/07/14/former-online-gambling-billionaire-calvin-ayre-pleads-guilty-to-misdemeanor-charge/

The Ayre Group is also an investor in nChain,the company that employs Wright as Chief Scientist.
The Ayre Group has also invested in several projects including Handcash,Taal built on BSV, the fork of BTC that Wright has pitched as designed according to Satoshi's vision. 
Coingeek is not a news site, but an owned media branch of Ayre Group.

Bitcoin,Student Here Trying to better Understand Bitcoin,"As I learn about bitcoin I wanted to post some thoughts and ask some questions and tie that to what I am taught in class and hear feedback.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all Bitcoin is able to transfer globally at an incredible speed which is very useful and seems to make companies such as Square and PayPal unnecessary. But  I will argue that however PayPal offers protection for fraudulent payments or scams.

Second there is no central authority so it is decentralized. What I am taught in macroeconomics is that a decentralized currency is not necessarily good. In our current world of flexible exchange rate our central banks are able to conduct monetary policy which is necessary during booms or contractions. 

A decentralized currency removes this power from the central bank.  Also it would limit fiscal policy since governments don't have unlimited currency . So the covid relief bill or banking bailouts would be impossible. 

This makes me think that if our economy ever falls in a bad recession that we have no central authority with the tools to be able to fix that. 

Thirdly bitcoin claims to be resistant to  high inflation. So I imagine a world where there is only bitcoin.  So we assume that all bitcoin is mined so almost 21 million and everything is priced in bitcoin and you can't print bitcoin. So since the supply is constrained inflation is not a problem. But in class I am taught that the supply of money no longer affect inflation.  Essentially quantity theory is no longer considered valid.

These are some of my thoughts I was wondering if they could be cleared up by the community!",cryptocurrency

stocks,(12/9) Thursday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Thursday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, December 9th, 2021-

# [Stock futures are lower after major averages post third straight day of gains](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/08/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock index futures dipped early Thursday, after the major averages posted a third straight day of gains as traders bet that the omicron variant’s economic impacts won’t be as severe as initially thought.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 106 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were each off by 0.3%.
*****
&gt; Stocks were set to give back some of their gains in recent days, with the move higher spurred by the belief that the omicron variant of Covid looks less severe than earlier forms.
*****
&gt; The move comes a day ahead of important inflation news as the Labor Department on Friday releases the consumer price index for November. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the year-over-year growth rate to be 6.7%. If that is the case, it will mark the biggest move since June 1982.
*****
&gt; Federal Reserve officials are expected to react to the burst in inflation by announcing next week that it will begin pulling back on its economic aid.
*****
&gt; The first step will be accelerating the reduction in the central bank’s monthly bond purchases, with markets expecting the Fed to double the taper to $30 billion. That in turn could pave the way for interest rate hikes as soon as the spring of 2022 and mark the latest Fed policy pivot under Chairman Jerome Powell.
*****
&gt; Weekly jobless claims data will be released on Thursday at 8:30 a.m. on Wall Street. Economists are expecting the number of first-time-filers to come in at 211,000, according to estimates from Dow Jones.
*****
&gt; During regular trading Wednesday, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 advanced 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively, with each registering a third straight day of gains. The S&amp;P’s gain over the last three days is the strongest of the year, according to MKM Partners.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.64%, also registering a third day of gains. Apple had the most positive impact on the index, while Nvidia was the biggest drag.
*****
&gt; Equities got a boost after Pfizer and BioNTech said Wednesday morning that a booster dose of their vaccine provides a high level of protection against the new omicron variant.
*****
&gt; “The range of possibilities is still wide, but in the bigger picture, we think the odds are still very much in favor of the pandemic phase winding down,” Bank of America wrote in a note to clients following the announcement. “In our view, COVID is here to stay, but a shift to the endemic phase is approaching where infections are common but severe outcomes / lockdowns / travel restrictions are not,” the firm added.
*****
&gt; With Wednesday’s gain, the S&amp;P 500 is now just 0.9% below its all-time intraday high from Nov. 22.
*****
&gt; Ed Moya, senior market analyst with Oanda, said that the market is in a wait-and-see mode ahead of Friday’s inflation report, which could “fuel further Fed rate hike bets.” Economists are expecting the report to show that prices rose 0.7% in November month-over-month, according to estimates from Dow Jones.
*****
&gt; “While growth and labor markets have provided reasons to be optimistic about the economy, inflation is also running hot and sits at a 30-year high,” UBS wrote in a recent note to clients. “With the omicron variant entering the picture, investors are now questioning what monetary policy will look like going forward. The pandemic has already greatly increased the uncertainty over the economic outlook,” the firm added, noting that its base case is that the Fed will be patient.
*****
&gt; There are some notable earnings reports on Thursday, including from Oracle, Broadcom and Lululemon, all of which report after the market closes.

stocks,"THE STOCK MARKET WILL ALWAYS REBOUND AND STAY ""OVERVALUED"" SO LONG AS NO OTHER INVESTMENT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO NON-BOOMER GENERATIONS","From many news media outlets and youtuber finance experts and stock gurus, I keep seeing the notion that the stock market is heavily overvalued currently relative to its former valuation metrics that have held for decades. 

To be honest, this is true, and they're not wrong, but what they fail to take into account is that until interest rates go up and/or median home prices come down, for the VAST majority of Americans there are only the following ways of avoiding poverty: education (becoming less and less worth it for most degrees), fraud (risky AND makes you a piece of shit), literal gambling, poker (which I don't classify as gambling if you're highly skilled but is NOT easy to be consistently profitable), starting your own business / youtube / social media (risky if you go all in and not definitely for everyone), and investing in stocks (admirable, and dramatically easier than all of the above to be profitable). Investing in housing is a very viable way to make money, but when the median home price is $400,000 this is no longer accessible to the everyday American for younger generations as a means of building wealth (fuck boomers, they have literally written and enacted laws that benefit them and only them throughout their lives).

Until investing is no longer the ""easy"" and accessible way to succeed in life for the everyday American, the stock market is going to perpetually be ""overvalued"" by former metrics and dips will always have rapid recoveries.   


So when people and institutions say that the market is ""overvalued"" take this with a grain of salt and when the market reaches ""insane valuations"" rest assured you can ignore this until there is another more reliable means of ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO FUCKING RETIRE SOME DAY.",finance

personalfinance,Need HELOC with Bad Credit,"My home was appraised for $850k five years ago. I owe $590k on the first mortgage and $40k on a second. I have a minimum of $220k in equity, though with the price of homes in my area that is probably understated by $50-100k.

My spouse earns $100k/year and I am making very little driving/delivering for ride-share providers as I finish my degree. We have gotten behind on our bills (60-90 days on some) and are looking to borrow $50k from the equity in the home. With our plummeting credit scores, high DTI ratio, and relative lack of income we have not been able to get a loan through any traditional means. This includes HELOC, personal loans, and credit cards.

We would like to stay in the home for another couple of years while our child finishes high school. This loan will enable us to catch up on bills and get us through the next quarter while I finish my degree and reenter the workforce. 

I have looked into sale-leaseback and shared appreciation companies but none operate in my state.

I am willing to pay an interest rate that reflects the risk in what I am asking, though I am out of ideas at this point. Are there any other means of securing a loan using our home equity that I am overlooking?",finance

CryptoCurrency,It's funny that banks act like they give a shit about people when it comes to Crypto.

personalfinance,Cash Out when I Refinance to pay off student debt?,"I am looking into refinancing my home mortgage. Currently owe 203k. House should appraise at 310k on the low side, 360k on the high side. Current interest rate for mortgage is 4.5%. Current mortgage is 4.5% 30 yr fixed. I should be able to get a much better interest rate on my new refinanced mortgage. My goal is to get rid of PMI, and start paying more money into the principal cost of my loan. Refi may be 20 yr fixed or 30 yr fixed. Lender should be rolling closing costs into the price of the loan so I won't have to come out of pocket for this. I am cool with a slightly larger monthly payment as a result of a shorter loan term. 

My question is: should I take the ""cash out"" option when refinancing in order to pay a lump sum towards my student loan debt? Debt is as follows: (1) Remaining 5,400 @ 6.8% (2) 7,100 @ 3.86% (3) 7,100 @ 4 .66% (4) 7,762.34 @ 4.29% (5) 4,900 @  3.76%

I feel like the loan at 6.8% is pretty high, so I would want to handle that one first. I know it makes more sense to take more cash out than just $5,400. I should be able to take out a max of \~46k cash.

stocks,Thesis Regarding Current and Future Market Scenarios,"TLDR: The world economy is about to face the bursting of an economic bubble that will be unprecedented in magnitude. Justifications for current valuations will fail as market sentiment shifts and overleveraged positions chase losses downwards.

Let me preface this by emphasizing that I am not a professional investor, nor do I hold any relevant degree in the field. All thoughts discussed below are my own

&amp;#x200B;

For the past year, I have been gathering information from the past, and present regarding the current state of the market. I have made money, and I have lost money. Most importantly, however, I have gained significant insights into how the market operates on a fundamental, psychological, and theoretical basis. It is my current belief that our markets are overleveraged, underregulated, and destined for catastrophe.

Let's begin.

Throughout history, the world has encountered various economic rises and collapses of all kinds. Trading has been around since humans learned how to make tools. Of course, over time the complexity and value of trades have grown significantly, but it still relies on the same fundamental variables. The ""stocks"" of 400 years ago are much different than the stocks of today. The main difference is that companies no longer pay shareholders out of profits directly. This is an incredibly interesting difference that decouples the theoretical ""shares"" from actual company revenue. When you own shares of a company today, you are no longer relying on the company's solvency for profit, but that another individual will be willing to pay you more for your ""shares"" than what you purchased them at.

At some point, a shift from the tangible to theoretical created a ""fork"" where stocks, securities, and derivatives are traded entirely independent of the underlying asset. Instead of being used as a measure of a companies competence and solvency, they are marketed as a product whose valuation depends entirely on another individual being willing to value them at a higher price. This is not itself a bad thing. After all, trillions of dollars have been made by following this new strategy. However, it does pose a significant risk to world economies.

As these assets become more convoluted and complex, the amount of research put into selecting which assets are wise investments has dropped dramatically. After all, there is no need to research the fundamentals of a company when all you need is the ""product"" they produce to trade. Of course, fundamentals still matter in the case of bankruptcy, debt, and default, for the most part, but otherwise as long as you can convince another person that the digital file you hold has value you can profit.

To exemplify this concept, let's examine the current market conditions. After COVID hit, many companies' stock valuations fell. This was a time when the market dictated that fundamentals matter. In an attempt to maintain the integrity of the U.S. Economy, the Fed dropped interest rates to near zero and stock valuations skyrocketed. Why is this? The COVID pandemic was still in full swing, so why did market sentiment change so rapidly and with such magnitude. To explain this, I must explain how the effective interest rate concept works.

Say you're a large investment firm looking to make a profit for your shareholders. Most of what you do involves scouring the market for information that you believe will positively impact specific stock prices. You find company XYZ and decide to invest $100M after reading over the balance sheets and determining that it is not in danger of default/bankruptcy. When Investment firms invest, they often do so on margin or by using leverage. This significantly increases the amount of money you can make (or lose) with your investment. This makes shareholders happy. When you borrow money to use as leverage in trades, you must pay an amount of money to the lender that is determined by the federal interest rate. When calculating profits or losses your calculations must include the money spent paying back that interest on the loan you took out. At 0-0.25%, this is extremely tantalizing as the amount of money you'll have to pay as interest is extremely low. This creates an environment where perceived profits are exponentially higher, as previously these rates were near 3%. You can now take much greater risks with many fewer drawbacks. As rates increase, however, the amount you have to pay back increases which cuts into profits. As rates inevitably increase, your profit margin becomes smaller and smaller. Riskier trades are swapped out for more fundamentally sound trades and a market selloff begins as all investment firms operating in the same manner seek to mitigate their risk.

The current market is operating heavily within the context of the ""greater fool theory"". This is to say that there is always someone who is looking to increase their exposure to risky assets as they believe there will always be someone willing to buy at a higher price. This is true for now, but when the market sentiment turns sour for any reason, leveraged trades will be wiped out at a magnitude equal and opposite to the inverse. This will create significant downward pressure on stock valuations that can no longer be justified at their current valuations.

It is my belief that the valuations of the broader market cannot be justified, and the market will seek equilibrium. There are an infinite number of factors that could cause this, but very few left that can help sustain the current market conditions. Market volatility will become extremely pronounced, and surprise defaults and bankruptcies will be widespread. This pattern has been, and will always be, consistent throughout time. Trading apps and brokers have designed investment tools that operate more like a casino than a stock exchange. Alternatives to current stores of value are introduced that seek to provide ""hope"" for a market in turmoil. Investment firms begin to target younger populations, even kids, in attempts to scrape together as much capital as humanly possible. These are all indicators that the market is on life support, and my outlook for the future is unfortunately dismal.

We will look back at this time 5 years from today and wonder how we couldn't see the slow-moving train wreck occur in front of our very eyes. The truth is that the investment firms, hedge funds, FED chairs, and corporations do see it. They've always seen it, and will always be the first to know. In the end, it will be the friends, the loved ones, the families, and the individuals seeking hope in a broken system who will finance this disaster. In the end, history will repeat itself. The stage has been set, and the orchestra is reaching its crescendo. After the final number, the greatest fools will be revealed as the musicians face the audience, take a bow, and thank us all for our attendance.",finance

Those updated goals have shaped the entire economic recovery.

&amp;#x200B;

""maximum employment"" means what?

We're already seeing the Fed give up their ""transitory"" language when it comes to inflation so they want to keep inflation higher - more printer going brrr.

personalfinance,Liquidating RothIRA to Pay Debt? *Warning: Long Read Ahead!*,"Hey PF, I hope you're all well. I've come to you all to ask for your guidance and assistance. If I need to repost this in a different subreddit, please let me know.

I am looking to pay off credit card and personal loan debt. I recently was in the middle of trying to purchase a home (with my father as a cosigner), but fortunately it didn't happen because that would've been a huge financial mistake on my part. In talking to the loan offer, he said it *may* be okay to move forward with financing a home, in *hopes* that it'll appreciate over time so I can use any built equity towards paying down debt. However, we both knew this would be a major gamble, so we agreed it'd be best to try and pay off debt as aggressively as possible.

Since I don't have any actual capital saved to put towards a home, I was going to use my RothIRA for down payment and closing costs (plan was to get sellers to cover closing costs if possible). This way I could take advantage of the First Time Homebuyer RothIRA option, where I wouldn't get taxed on the first $10,000.

I wanted to know what you all think of possibly 98% of my RothIRA to pay down debt. I've been briefed on the 10% penalty/income taxes. Issue is I'm not entirely sure what that would look like for the next tax year.

My plan is:

* Sell $25,000 of my Rollover IRA, keeping $1000 in the account so it doesn't close out
* Pay off the **Discover Personal Loan** \- $25,000
* I'm expecting $2000 this month, bringing my total CASH ON HAND to $6500-$7000
   * Use this towards one of my Chase cards *and* paying down the Citi card where the 0% interest rate will soon expire on $2158.10
* With $1050 free from removing these two/three debts, I can put that towards the next Chase card ($5705 balance) and pay that down as quickly as possible
* Rinse and repeat
   * I'm going to look over my miscellaneous monthly bills/expenses to see what I can cut out to free up some more money
      * Example: I have two different Life Insurance plans, one through my job, and another through State Farm - the State Farm insurance is about $162/month - I was advised to keep State Farm in the event I quit my current job, but God willing/nothing goes to shit/layoffs, I do not plan on leaving my job for a long, long time (its a great place to retire from, and I have job-related goals)

Of course, this all hinges on liquidating the majority of my Rollover IRA account being:

1. A good idea
2. Penalties/taxes will outweigh the debt

Please let me know what you all think, I'm desperate to get all of these paid off. Unfortunately a lot of these CC companies drastically lowered my available credit because of the amount of debt I have (lesson learned), thus dropping my credit score like crazy.

If you guys have any questions, please let me know. Thank you all in advance for your help!

btc,Coinbase launches high-interest DeFi benefits to 70 countries,"Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced that qualified customers in more than 70 countries can now earn income through DeFi.

Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced that customers in more than 70 countries/regions can earn income through the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) through the cryptocurrency they hold. arrive

Coinbase said in a prepared statement: “We are making DeFi more accessible, enabling qualified customers in more than 70 countries to obtain attractive DeFi loan yields on their DAI without any cost, lock-in Or troublesome settings.

At the core of this move is Coinbase's desire to make DeFi ""more customer-friendly and approachable.""

With DAI stablecoin, customers can choose to join to earn DeFi income. Customers' DAI assets will be stored in Compound Finance, which Coinbase describes as an ""industry-leading"" DeFi protocol. However, the interest on this rate of return is variable.

For example, in October, Compound's rate of providing DAI fluctuated between 2.8% and 5.3%. Coinbase stated: ""Higher interest rates reflect both the unique way to obtain global liquidity and the increased risk that DeFi may bring.""

Despite this risk, Coinbase is still optimistic about the prospects of DeFi. The exchange added: ""DeFi has great potential to help increase economic freedom, and we are excited to provide a trusted and easily accessible way to participate.""

However, this announcement has an obvious omission.

Although the service has been launched to 70 eligible countries, including major economies such as Germany and the United Kingdom, Coinbase’s DeFi benefits have not yet been provided to US customers.

U.S., Coinbase and DeFi

In September, when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) threatened to sue the exchange, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong made a statement on Twitter on the premise that the exchange launched the Lend Income products.

Many branches have closed their teller windows and have been replaced by ITMs (Interactive Teller Machines). I understand the cost/benefit of replacing the tellers with these machines, however they do have a few limitations:

* They don't carry **ALL** bills  - They carry 50,20,5,1
* You can't get a bank check from them - I don't do this often so it is definitely an edge case 
* As it is a machine they can run out of paper currency - This has happened to me
* For larger withdrawals you \*MAY\* hit your ATM withdrawal limit and be forced to carry smaller bills 

The official answer of the video representative is ""Just do an exchange with the local representative"" (The human that's there to handle these less frequent transactions) 

My initial reaction to this response was:

""That just sounds like a teller transaction with more steps ""

&amp;#x200B;

First off, I am heavily around crypto, Web 3.0, metaverse projects, and a few other things. But foremost I'm a person with basic set of logic, who lived an extremely poor life, and know the fear of new systems like this.

Please feel free to ask questions.

A few terms to note:

Metaverse: When I say this I don't really mean the thing we have now. I mean what has been in the works for over 10 years. Basically Augmented Reality (AR) has been in the works for a long while now. I would suggest taking a look at magic leap, hololense, and other projects. The big thing to note is the blockchain part is what adds that to the metaverse. Apple is estimated to release their AR glasses by 2025, and a number of others are showing we could easily get AR glasses that look like normal glasses and be around the $100 range by 2030. This means it's HIGHLY likely just like your phone you will be using it to interact with things around the world. Please feel free to ask me stuff on this because this is easily where we are going to get extremely cool games from and really cool future stuff from.

Mint: It basically means to make

&amp;#x200B;

# What is a NFT and why should you care?

To be blunt, with how we are developing Web 3.0 you shouldn't have to know x is an NFT in the future. But basically, NFT is just a file on the blockchain. Literally, that is it.

The power comes in

1. blockchain is highly auditable and bigger blockchains are extremely secure due to the nature of them.
2. smart NFT is similar to smart contracts. Basically unlike a normal file you can set rules on it which does things like only can be written to but not edited for example.

# Anti-cheating

So for example with some MMO game where you have lets say some sword that comes up. If the game is mostly ran on or depended on blockchain where all the items are an NFT and can be minted in real time. We all seen it where cheaters got into a game spawn fancy cars in GTAV or money. Well since it is all an NFT and they got the game servers themselves to mint the NFT. This simply wouldn't be possible.

Again, this comes down to the servers being secure and the coding being worth while. If they aren't, then the company wasted everyone's time if this was their goal.

&amp;#x200B;

But if you take a look at something like Pokemon for example. Like imagine they are a bunch of NFT. It is common to have it where people hack in pokemon, screw with their EV stats, and trade them. Sometimes they are caught, but the bulk of the time they aren't. I remember one time it was so bad it was stupid easy to get legendary ones through the trade thing when you're trying to be 100% legit. And there was no way of knowing if the person cheated other than the sheer amount you were getting from the global trade thing.

Now if they were an NFT since it is on the blockchain, it would make it impossible to mess with their stats like that. Again, this comes down to the servers and the code being secure. One method that could be used is if you were to capture it and do whatever in SP. Then when it hits the internet it would be minted (made) to reflect what you have. If someone broke the code or whatever, or the servers couldn't tell between a mod pokemon game and legit, then again you run into this being a waste of time. However, if you could tell and everything is secure. Fundamentally there would be no way to cheat the system.

Note it doesn't mean you need to even have a wallet or know what a wallet is. This could be on the company blockchain or a major one that uses the company wallet. So as a player you wouldn't and shouldn't even know it is heavily based on the blockchain to work.

&amp;#x200B;

# Psychology

Basically this comes down to what people actually care about and what they don't. From my understanding the entire point of achievements is to help developers track how many of the player base done what. Like if you look at achievements in many games, most don't even get beyond the first level. meaning yes the developers put all their time, energy, and company money into the entire thing. And sells looks great. But sells DO NOT tell you if you have a good or a bad game.

Now the psychology part of it comes in 2 fold.

1. The user is more likely to care and hold emotional value to something they could take game to game. Even more if it's something like a pet.
2. The game devs can see if people really care about these skins or whatever, or do they tend to use them for a short time and never touch them afterwards. Some of this data could be collected now. But with smart NFT mix with metaverse. It could be possible to see was time well spent in making something or not. Like if AR glasses were a mainstream thing now, and you could hand AR things you earn in games on the wall. This means game companies could make more money on that, but also it's extremely good marketing even if it's free because the more you see it the more likely you will buy the next game.

# Transfer assets from 1 game to another

**BIG NOTE**: at first and most likely in general. The majority of NFT that work in 1 game will not work in another. The majority will most likely be a simple line of code with no art work attached to them. It is up to the game to understand what it needs to do with that.

But, in theory you can attach artwork and all the needed bits to an NFT. One thing I'm trying to explore with others is ways to put petabytes on the blockchain without loading it down. The way we we think it will work right now is by all devices above a given MB or GB will be a node if they connect to the blockchain. Meaning instead of each node needs to be the entire blockchain. It is highly scalable and while keeping the highly redundant. Like blockchain now is basically if you mirror the HDD on everything. Where as I and a number of others working on this is basically making it into a RAID system if I was to use that example.

This is a must for Web 3.0 since the entire internet outside of very exact things will be on the blockchain.

Now with that being said. This means in theory you could have all the things around say a person in a game giving they are part of an NFT. The sound, the animation, and so on. And that will all be within the NFT itself. This means another game doesn't need to do the artwork, and all of it is there. The game just has to acknowledge the file and run with it. (At first a lot of bugs will happen. So don't think this is going to be 100% seamless. But after the bugs get figured out, standards are in place, and so on. You could see this common in most newer games.)

If this is in place, then in theory you will be able to bring that into the metaverse.

&amp;#x200B;

For the here and now, you can transfer things between exact games if allowed. But the developers will have to animate it and what not.

Important, because of this it's unlikely we will get a lot of rare stuff that transfers unless if the animations and what not easily transfers. But if they lose those files. Then chances are it will be a dead NFT.

&amp;#x200B;

# Selling and buying

Obviously some devs can do some tricks to make it where you can't do this or you have to use their thing. But lets use Ubisoft's Quartz. The NFT goes into your wallet, so you can use their marketplace or another marketplace.

It should be noted fees are high. Opeanseas (which is under ETH) is something like 12.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: if the company is shady they could put in the NFT where it breaks if it doesn't get traded on their market place. Or the buyer has to pay the game company to reactivate the NFT. Basically, smart NFT can tell what wallet they are on and act in a different way per wallet and condition.

I think if we have any political people here. Please look at regulating that so that doesn't happen. It hasn't yet, but it could.

# Saves

Your save could be an NFT. Again, NFT is basically just a file on the blockchain. meaning since it is far more secure on the blockchain and auditable. I can see a time where instead a cloud saves being some server that can get hacked and cost a bit of money to run. It just saves and edits on the blockchain. You don't need to know it is on the blockchain however, and most likely it will keep it's name of cloud saves.

# In the future games going away due to servers being abandon won't be a thing.

Part of Web 3.0 is all of what you're see and deal with will be on the blockchain. While some things won't be on it. In theory you can have an entire game server on the blockchain under a massive NFT or group of NFTs. If you pass the processing power and other things onto the client or a group of clients (being ones playing the game or not). This means you in theory will always have access to the game and game servers. Where with right now if a game dev doesn't pay the bills, if they just stopped caring, or whatever else. Then the game could be forever taken down.

&amp;#x200B;

# The bad

So I'm not going to get into business practices like companies forcing people to buy some random NFT for a chance they might earn a high value one. I think that is as bad as loot boxes.

A major thing you need to know is due to the nature of a blockchain. The only way to change something is by you owning the NFT and having the ability to edit it. Or by a 51% of the blockchain voting to change that 1 thing. Meaning if you put a bad name or something in and you can't edit the NFT. Guess what your username or whatever is stuck as. Even if you make another NFT. If someone can read the old NFT then they can see what you done that was bad.

Note we are trying to find general ways to solve it. But realistically that isn't likely. Like we want to find some way because people do stupid things like take stupid pictures of themselves that years later they regret. But removing it from the blockchain itself is not likely possible. The reason why is if we can then this means a gov power can edit pictures and info and we don't want that. Like you can't have 1 without the other.

&amp;#x200B;

Another bad thing I see is I can see companies trick people in thinking they will be able to buy say a skin 1 time and transfer it to the next game because the tech in theory allows it. But the company who makes the game doesn't so they wasted their money. I can see this hurting the NFT name for a little bit but IDK how to fight that.

&amp;#x200B;

Taxes is a major thing people need to keep in mind. Because it's on the ledger within blockchain, this means the gov could track everything (at least on all but a handful like xmr). Anyways, this means if you got an NFT for free, and sold it for something with the value of $600. This could mean you now owe $600 in capital gains taxes. Note in the USA normally long term capital games (meaning if you hold over a year) if you made less than $40k then it isn't taxed federally but it could be locally. And then it messes with your income tax.

And then if you get an NFT say some sword in the game, and the gov can figure out the value of that. Like figuring out per gold or whatever how much is it compared to the $ and then figuring out how much the sword sells for in game and doing the math to find the base value. This in some locations means income tax.

I've been pushing hard for USA senate and congress to fix this but it has landed on deaf ears for the most part. You can help by talking about it here and other places.

&amp;#x200B;

I worry that using **current** NFT to transfer something from 1 game to a 3rd party game will cause legal problems since the artwork has to be remade. Like I can see the 3rd party running into legal problem if push comes. If not, or if artwork and other things goes into the NFT much sooner than thought. This shouldn't be a problem.

&amp;#x200B;

# The good

We most likely will at some point have true play to earn. Meaning play and you can earn an NFT for getting an achievement. Realistically you won't make a living off of this after things really come out because you're not even a drop of water on a water planet. But the neat thing is mix this with the metaverse were you can hang up your achievements on the wall.

Like imagine achievements having real use. Use like it opens a calendar or you get a pet that uses machine learning general AI and it becomes apart of you in your day to day.

How I see this playing out is at first we will get the stupid icons. Maybe we can hang them on the wall, but so what. But then I can see at some point someone will figure out what if we get the icon to do something like start the game, take you to a secret level, or show you the weather. Then companies will 1 up that until we get some cool stuff. If general AI is good enough then, we could see virtual pets or other things come from this. (most likely 2050 by that point)

&amp;#x200B;

This could open the door where you can take things to new games, and so on. Even more when AR games will be mainstream. (We estimate that to be a trillion dollar industry. Remember inflation and how far out that is from now. But we estimate that is going to be bigger than mobile games currently.)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Again, please feel free to ask questions.

Now for the screenshots. Note this isn't to shame them or the subreddit. This is pointing out how badly we need to get these damn political people and others to stop spreading lies saying crypto is used for drug money or is a scam. And why education is extremely important right now.

But also this could be 1 mod there view and not all of them. So do with that info with what you want.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**:

Understanding the two terms of APR  
 and APY  
 becomes even more important in DeFi today, as nearly all protocols with yield farming fields display these numbers. Knowing them well is not only for understanding and executing different strategies and calculating real profits.

&amp;#x200B;

# General Conclusion

APR and APY are used in many yield farming programs in DeFi protocols. However, they are not the same thing! We, the participants in the market, are not only investing but actively receiving yields by farming and staking DeFi tokens. So these basic terms are not only important, but they are also information that helps you to invest more effectively.

Both are related to returns. But how are they different? Why are they not interchangeable? We discuss that in today's newsletter.

# Definition

APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the actual annual rate of return, **NOT** taking into account the effect of compound interest.

APY stands for Annual Percentage Yield. It is the actual annual rate of return, taking into account the effect of compound interest.

Who uses what? APY is better to calculate your returns on investment while APR is more common in lending.

&gt;Quick math: which do you think is higher? APY, the one that considers compounding.

# What Are They Different?

## APR

For example, a yield farming program offers an APR  
 of 100%/yr. You use $1000 to join this program. One year later you will receive $2,000, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1000 is APR  
.

Once you see the APR, it is possible to immediately calculate how much profit will be earned at the end of the period. This profit comes from your staking or farming, so just join at the beginning to get the result for APR interest.

### Formular

APR = r x N

Where:

r: The interest rate of the year;

N: Interest period (N = 1, means 1 year).

## APY

APY is another way of calculating the percentage of real profit you will receive.

&gt;What will you get if you receive profit every day from staking and you will add that to your principle and earn interest on that **every day**?

If you have an APR  
 of 100%/yr with getting daily profit, you have to divide APR  
 by 365 days to calculate the interest received daily (0.27%). Then reinvest this interest continuously every day. The amount you get is $2,714.57, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1714.57 is APY  
.

Assuming you participate in farming pairs on Solana's Raydium application, I also combine Step Finance to know the APR  
 and APY  
 of these farming pairs. Typically, I am staking $RAY on Raydium (current project APR is 35.33%), with $1,000 you farm at the beginning of the year to the end of the year, the total income will be $1,423.51.

### Formular

APY = (1+r)\^n - 1

In which:

r: The interest rate of the period;

n: Interest period (n=1 means 1 day).

# Awareness

As such, today's projects often offer 2 ratios of APR and APY to show users what the rate of return is currently available. However, some projects that give daily, 7-day interest rings directly provide APY. This has two implications:

* First, displaying APY  
 will produce a larger percentage than APR  
, making brave people feel that they will receive more profit.
* Secondly, the APY  
 interest is only true if the user reinvests (restake, refarm) continuously in the allowed period (e.g. when receiving rewards, immediately stake).

Today we see a lot of aggregator protocols already using this ability to increase profits, continuously reinvesting within the capacity of the original protocols. This is really good if the transaction costs are not significant. Hopefully, we can find those solutions in Layer 2.",cryptocurrency

 of 100%/yr. You use $1000 to join this program. One year later you will receive $2,000, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1000 is APR  
.

Once you see the APR, it is possible to immediately calculate how much profit will be earned at the end of the period. This profit comes from your staking or farming, so just join at the beginning to get the result for APR interest.

### Formular

APR = r x N

Where:

r: The interest rate of the year;

N: Interest period (N = 1, means 1 year).

## APY

APY is another way of calculating the percentage of real profit you will receive.

&gt;What will you get if you receive profit every day from staking and you will add that to your principle and earn interest on that **every day**?

If you have an APR  
 of 100%/yr with getting daily profit, you have to divide APR  
 by 365 days to calculate the interest received daily (0.27%). Then reinvest this interest continuously every day. The amount you get is $2,714.57, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1714.57 is APY  
.

Assuming you participate in farming pairs on Solana's Raydium application, I also combine Step Finance to know the APR  
 and APY  
 of these farming pairs. Typically, I am staking $RAY on Raydium (current project APR is 35.33%), with $1,000 you farm at the beginning of the year to the end of the year, the total income will be $1,423.51.

### Formular

APY = (1+r)\^n - 1

In which:

r: The interest rate of the period;

n: Interest period (n=1 means 1 day).

# Awareness

As such, today's projects often offer 2 ratios of APR and APY to show users what the rate of return is currently available. However, some projects that give daily, 7-day interest rings directly provide APY. This has two implications:

* First, displaying APY  
 will produce a larger percentage than APR  
, making brave people feel that they will receive more profit.
* Secondly, the APY  
 interest is only true if the user reinvests (restake, refarm) continuously in the allowed period (e.g. when receiving rewards, immediately stake).

Today we see a lot of aggregator protocols already using this ability to increase profits, continuously reinvesting within the capacity of the original protocols. This is really good if the transaction costs are not significant. Hopefully, we can find those solutions in Layer 2.",cryptocurrency

**TLDR**:

Understanding the two terms of APR  
 and APY  
 becomes even more important in DeFi today, as nearly all protocols with yield farming fields display these numbers. Knowing them well is not only for understanding and executing different strategies and calculating real profits.

# General Conclusion

APR and APY are used in many yield farming programs in DeFi protocols. However, they are not the same thing! We, the participants in the market, are not only investing but actively receiving yields by farming and staking DeFi tokens. So these basic terms are not only important, but they are also information that helps you to invest more effectively.

Both are related to returns. But how are they different? Why are they not interchangeable? We discuss that in today's newsletter.

# Definition

APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the actual annual rate of return, **NOT** taking into account the effect of compound interest.

APY stands for Annual Percentage Yield. It is the actual annual rate of return, taking into account the effect of compound interest.

Who uses what? APY is better to calculate your returns on investment while APR is more common in lending.

&gt;Quick math: which do you think is higher? APY, the one that considers compounding.

stocks,Cathie Wood Says Ark ‘Soul-Searching’ as Once-Stellar Funds Lag,"(Bloomberg) -- Ark Investment Management is “going through soul-searching” as its growth-focused funds fall out of favor amid expectations of tighter Federal Reserve policy, said founder Cathie Wood. 

The $17.8 billion ARK Innovation ETF has tumbled more than 20% this year, with several of its top holdings like electric-vehicle giant Tesla Inc. and video-streaming platform Roku Inc. down from their peaks. During the same period, the S&amp;P 500 Index climbed about 24%.

“I’ve never been in a market that is up -- has appreciated -- and our strategies are down,” Wood said in a Thursday interview with Bloomberg Television. “That has never happened before.” 

“When we go through a period like this, of course we are going through soul-searching, saying ‘are we missing something?’” she said, adding that in response, Ark has doubled down on its research and modeling.

Wood noted that the companies she invests in are aggressively investing in the future. While those stocks may have high multiples now, Ark is assuming that those valuations are going to compress in the longer term.

stocks,Demographic reason that US stock markets have no choice but to upper right trajectory,"TLDR: in 2040, US will have 20-23% of entire population as retirees, meaning that they can't go back to job markets simply because index funds are 30% down, nor can they go to mass suicide events while they have to make end meets. The best course of an action is to make index go upper right through fed's intervention and government's policy. Everyone will be happy except a few gruntling soul that keeps complaining that everything is over-valued.  

&amp;#x200B;

I read u/waxMyRear's post on  **THE STOCK MARKET WILL ALWAYS REBOUND AND STAY ""OVERVALUED"" SO LONG AS NO OTHER INVESTMENT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO NON-BOOMER GENERATIONS** 

The great discussion has been made, but I wanted to add another fundamental side of background: US demographic. 

Common sense should tell everyone that in 1950-1960, the average life span used to be 60-70, but due to modern biological revolution, the average life span in 2020 is about early 80s in USA. Sure, COVID19 perhaps helped to reduce the life span, still the average life span is expected to be early 80s in USA.

So in 1950-1960, the retiree would be 5-10 years to make end meets, but in today's world, the retirees will have to live on another 20-30 years, and as you know, living is not easy thing to do, espeically when you want to make your dignity and financial needs are met

So let's just think about it. 

Those who are set to retire between 61-65 are gonna have to make end meets to survive on when medical bills are supposed to be higher/paying kids tuitions/and living expenses on college campus. Sure, government aids such as Medicare and Social Security are there to help for one reason, but everyone knows those are not enough to live comfortably. 

The retirees can't simply go back to employment markets and compete with age groups over 30/40 just because their portfolio is -30% down over night. Physically, intellectually, and bodily, they simply can't compete, meaning that their primary capability of income is little to nothing, but yet, the social expectation is that it's time for those age group over 65 to call it a day and go home, playing with grandkids or video games when they still have so many bills to pay.  

Sure, in unusual exceptional cases such as doctor/businessmen/women/lawyers may still choose to continue work or have access to go back to employment market, should it be better suited for the financial needs, but 95% of population in the age group dont have such a privilege to go back to employment markets. Sure, they can, maybe, work in HD/WMT as part of courtesy group, but still the issue remains that the paycheck is too small to make end meets. 

And for the records, employers are doing their best to replace human workforces as much as possible so they would be more than happy to let employees in 30s go, when they find robotic arms to flip burgers, so why would they even bother to consider to hire 60s? 

As a result, the only viable option to make end meets successfully for the retirees is to have money set in the markets. Whether it's TSLA/NVDA or SPY/QQQ or bond markets, investing is the only way within legally allowable means unless one's so genius enough that your financial success can be made. 

&amp;#x200B;

After all, that's how capitalists work out: No need to do physical work, but just sit and play the markets (whether it's time the market or time in the market). And as you know, it's emotionally distressing jobs, when you buy the equity only to find out it's dipping even more, and when you sell only to find out it's skyrocketing. At the end of days, you take the risk, and you either get reward or pay the price. 

Now, the conclusion is that [Per 2020's Census,](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2020/demo/p25-1144.pdf) it's projected that by 2040, 22% of population will be age group over 65. 

In pure capitalism world, an investor will be held accountable for actions when they are losing the money. But in today's capitalistic world, an investor dont lose the money if it's index funds. 

That's the fundamental message that Fed sent out in 2008 Financial Crisis and 2020 in Covid19 crashes. Fed won't come to save you when your TSLA is 50% off, but they will come to save you when your SPY/QQQ index are 50% off. Whether it's QE or it's 0% interests or some other genius ways I dont even know, they have both moral and legal obligation to secure the nation and provide the bread at the end of days especially when someone's already retired and dont have primary source of income. 

It will be more costly if 20-30 % of US population will suffer from financial doom that would occur due to Fed's policy and government's intervention. At the end of days, government is there for a reason to protect its constituents and provide food/shelters regardless of their financial status. 

For the very this reason, I dont think that even if Fed see the inflation coming, they can really raises the interest rate to 20% in 1980s. My gut feeling is that 5% is max they can literally do and face the total purge of Fed board members either fired or replaced due to political leadership changes. 

Even with 5% key interest rates, this will bring total chaos to housing market that the retiree groups have as their primary source of assets.  

Can American voters be ready to see their 401K/IRA 30% red? This is absolutely unacceptable for anyone in any case if it's to occur during Republican time or Democrats time no matter how much they are die-hard partisan voters, not to mention that independent voters will simply flock to other party that just happen to be not in the WH's term. 

And if SPY/QQQ are 30% down, it means TSLA/NVDA are 40-50% down, and all those growth stocks are 80-90% down. 

Now some may point out that other countries like Japan/Euro zones dont have their index go upper right, which is absolutely true, and while I dont know everything in their social welfare, Japan/Euro zones, in general, have better social safety net than US. If this is not enough answer, then consider that USD is a key currency that US fed have unlimited authority to print out, if it's deemed to be the best interest of American Republic, not necessarily for the sake of the rest of the world. Whether it's Biden or Trump, the #1 is American First.  

When economy goes down, the best safe harbor investment destination is US dollar in treasury notes that's guaranteed while US is a leading country that have the best state of art companies in many areas and innovative technologies with cutting edge talents, so while the rest of the world suffer, it's perhaps the safest investment. 

So the index will be different than Japan/Euro zones. 

At the end of days, what Fed in 2008 and 2020 have shown is that America will never fail (until there is literally no other ways to avoid the failures, which I hope is not within our generation). So investing in US indexes is the same question that should read like ""***Do you believe that within your life time, US will continue its success or face failure***?"" 

My bet is that it will continue its success at least until my life time (early 30s). 

If the answer is yet, consider to to slowly buy SPY/QQQ in different months. 

If the answer is no, I am not too sure where to invest, but you would be on your own. 

Time will prove your choice, but even if not, at least, it's worth going to US index if you are investing for 10-20 years.",finance

personalfinance,Questions on Debt Consolidation/0% Balance Transfers/Hardship Plans,"I have too much c/c debt, plain and simple.  I've a steady job but it's performance based income and during lean times I racked up too much debt.  It's on me.   I've been taking concrete steps to work on a budget and slash costs.  All my accounts are current.  My credit score is good.  I've never missed a payment.   

Still, I am paying high interest on large balances. I want to get out from this, so I researched debt consolidation loans and 0% balance transfers.  I figure that if I am going to snowball debt, I might as well refinance it at a lower rate first and then snowball.   

Question 1:  I have received soft approval (no hard inquiry) for a consolidation loan with an interest rate almost 50% lower than the average rate I am paying now.  I've also received soft approval for a new c/c account with a very long 0% intro balance transfer option.  I won't know the credit line until I formally apply.   I could obviously also be denied credit when I apply.  If I go this direction, is there an order in which I apply for accounts?   I'd be generating hard inquiries for two different products.  Will this prompt red flags?   

Question 2:  Does anyone have experience with c/c hardship plans?  Amex has one that ""reads"" well but it doesnt contain many details.  It seems that in exchange for shuttering accounts, interest rates etc could be reduced for anywhere from 1 - 5 years but it doesnt say by how much.   There is no explicit credit score damage for enrolling in a program.  Accounts are not listed as in arrears etc.   However I imagine that since accounts are suspended (or whatever the correct term is) and credit lines cut, my utilization would rise which would lower my FICO until balances are paid down.  Still, if Amex say lowered the interest rate to the same or approximate rate as the consolidation loan, it's the same effect as a debt consolidation loan except I did not apply for new credit.   

Is talking to a c/c issuer about lowering interest rates worthwhile to explore?   All options are on the table for me.  I don't care if ""Amex"" cuts off my credit.  If that's what it takes to get back on track then so be it.   It's only worthwhile though versus the consolidation loan if its a sizable reduction in interest.  

Thoughts are welcome.  Feel free to criticize or make other suggestions.  Thx in advance.",finance

Apparently this put me in a higher tax bracket because the after tax deductions made the payout about $50 less than what I normally get paid weekly. Additional deductions with my regular weekly pay are medical and life insurance deductions, 401K, etc. which weren't deducted from this bonus check - just the typical federal withholding and the like.

CryptoCurrency,"Dapper Labs already has partnerships with 33% of the top record labels, ready to launch avatars and wearable NFTs for what might be the next boom after the gaming meta craze.","The project is Genies. Genies is ""extrapolating avatars and digital goods that have been prevalent in gaming for decades and trying to bring it to social circles and social communities for the very first time.""

Genies = a virtual portable identity.

This avatar will be more than a sticker-pack (like Snapchat's Bitmoji &amp; Apple's Memoji).

Genies started as exclusively available to celebrities and tastemakers.

Consumers will be able to participate in celebrity moments with their avatars (and buy goods to commemorate the experience).


**How Genies will work**

The Genies API will integrate the Genie creator into third-party platforms. 

Genies will take on a different ""superpower,"" depending on the environment.

The first partner is GIPHY, the gif sharing app (now owned by Meta)

The goal is to roll out ""hundreds of partners like this over this year"" (2021)

Unlike Memoji &amp; Bitmoji, the Genie avatar will be portable across platforms. Genies is working with ""a few dozen."" (Use cases might include: dancing partner, skit creation, mannequin)

An avatar for the ""metaverse.""


**Product Strategy**

The first step is to build affiliation.
Over the past 2.5 years, Genies has worked with 1000 celebrities and ""have 99% celebrity avatar market share.""

Celebrities use it to memorialize any key life-defining moment (song release etc.) where they're looking to connect with different audiences.

Gen Z is digital-first, and avatars have been an effective way for celebrities to engage with them.

Founder aspires for Genies to become ""the decentralized Disney,"" people will have the tools to create high-quality content with their avatar.

As celebrities use their Genie, it builds IP value (Justin Beiber used his for a music video). For example, when the Genies marketplace is live, if Justin Bieber comes out with a Christmas album, he can now sell 1000 limited-edition Santa Claus hats for his fans to use on their avatar. **Today a partnership with Universal Music was announced**

Pseudonymous representation (lets people express themselves how they want)


**Genies Marketplace - NFTs, Monetization, &amp; Go to Market**

Genies will be free for the base avatar, but upgrades and new items will cost money.

Genies did several NFT drops in advance of the marketplace with singer Shawn Mendez ($600K+ in 10 minutes), international soccer player Mesut Ozil ($500K+ on Nifty Gateway), and Pac Man.

Bandai Namco (parent company of Pac Man) is an investor in Genies.

Genies wants to bridge the chasm between the crypto and the non-crypto community by prioritizing cultural relevance, not financial return.

Genies will not emphasize the NFT aspect, ""we don't need to tell them about blockchain or crypto, we just say, look, go buy this dope, digital good or wearable from some of these icons that you already look up to.""

The Genies team were always focused on digital goods but thought of them more like Fortnite skins. It wasn't until Roham Gharegozlou from Dapper Labs (**FLOW token**)had reached out and explained how this concept was tightly aligned with NFTs that Genies was committed to making an NFT marketplace.

The same NBA Top Shot economy design team at Dapper Labs is building the Genies marketplace. Flow blockchain is already partnered with NFL, La Liga, UFC, Ubisoft, Samsung (more in link below)

""To foster a healthy economy, it is suggested that you don't have a secondary market out of the gates because then you get a bunch of people looking just to flip it immediately.""

Most Genies goods will be priced affordably. But ""one-of-ones"" will likely be very expensive.

Genies is stockpiling all talent &amp; IP they expect will resonate with the community for moments coming up in the fall &amp; winter.

Genies will take a % of the sale (not publicizing splits at this time).

At first, there will be two drops or so a week, but eventually, it will be a daily occurrence.

The goal is to open up the creation engine to be consumer-facing ""so that the 16-year-old in high school that wants to create a wearable because there's an inside joke amongst her friends can just release on the marketplace.""

Right now everyone is scrambling to get rid of ₺ cash and the most popular instrument to do so here seems to be real estate, maybe along with gold and USD/euros.

With the CBRT reducing interest rates, the public banks have followed suit with reducing housing loan rates to ridiculously low levels around 0.70% yearly but private banks haven't. Something similar had happened last year also with rates lower than 0.70% with government subsidies in housing purchases.

Last week data came in that said loan defaults increased 150%. Especially public banks are scrambling to give loans to everyone. They literally call people earning minimum wage and try to give them housing loans more than 10x their yearly income.

The result of all this is that houses have sold like hot cakes since 2020. House prices have nearly doubled in one year. But no one is living in these houses. In 2018-2019 we had tens of thousands of empty houses that could not be sold. Now we apparently have a housing shortage.

58. Looks like Cardano is seeing a huge amount of on-chain activity. The crazy part is this is all pre-PAB. Just wait until dApps can actually launch! Unsurprisingly, some supporters of other chains were shocked to realize they didn’t understand the difference between exchange trading volume and actual blockchain use volume.

71. Charles dropped a new AMA where he mentioned very briefly that they are actually going to look into read-only UTxOs. If it’s possible to have these types of UTxOs while preserving determinism, it would be a big change since transactions must currently consume inputs.

81. Charles drops a video on the eToro user limitations. It sounds like IOHK knew nothing about this. Interacting with exchanges falls in the Cardano Foundation’s wheelhouse. It’s unclear whether the CF knew anything. He also pointed out it’s very interesting that an old line exchange like Bitstamp has decided to LIST Cardano during this same period. Charles also mentioned that they haven’t seen any regulatory activity on IOHK’s end. eToro is a relatively small source of liquidity for Cardano and there shouldn’t be much of an impact.

There was significant focus on stablecoins due to the President’s Working Group placing so much focus there. One representative also chose to focus heavily on the energy consumption of Bitcoin mentioning coal power plants coming back on line to fuel Bitcoin mining. The witnesses from the crypto industry seemed to focus on dispelling misconceptions and also pushing for a single crypto focused regulatory body as opposed to the fragmented regulation that is typical in Washington.

personalfinance,Recent Grad Investing Advice (already made basic budget),"Hello everyone! Thank you in advance for any advice, I am consistently amazed by how kind and helpful most people on Reddit are. I read the rules of this subreddit and I think this is an appropriate thing to post, but if not I apologize.

I want to first give a little background, then I have a few questions based on the research I have already done that I hope some people will be game to answer (have already read the personal finance mega threat and flow chart).

**Background:**

I am graduating from college in May 2022, moving to San Francisco in the fall to start work (signed an offer already). I hope it is not gouache to share numbers but because this is anonymous I am hoping this is okay, also just want the most accurate advice.

Base salary: $100k

Probable bonus: $15k (not the max amount possible, what most receive in first year; also this increases by around 30% yearly, so next year could potentially earn $20k bonus, and so on and so forth)

Employer 401k match: 4.5%, no contribution on my part required

Rent + utilities: prob going to be around $2k

Groceries (not including any eating out): around $100/week

I am fortunate to not have any loans or other major expenses (that I can think of right now). I also want to add that I am incredibly grateful to have a secure and well-paying job lined up. I don't come from a lot of money, so I am really proud of my hard work and excited to learn how to be financially responsible.

**Questions:**

\- From my research, I think I should max out my 401K ($19K Federal limit) and probably max out a Roth IRA as well ($6K). Do these seem like sound choices? I am hoping to be in a higher tax bracket when I retire which is why I imagine the Roth IRA makes the most sense.

\- According to some tax calculations I ran, I should have about $67,296 in take-home income each year, or $5,608 per month. Less my estimated rent and grocery costs and factoring in the 401K and Roth IRA contributions (this is on the conservative side given that 401K is tax-deferred — I couldn't wrap my mind around how to calculate that), this leaves approximately $1,124.67 per month. Is it okay to set aside $800 for recreation and other expenses each month (haircuts, gas, eating out, bars, weekend trips, etc?). I know this seems on the higher side but I am very used to Bay Area prices and think this makes sense for me. This would result in $324.67 in savings per month or $3,896.00 per year. I also plan on putting all of my bonus into savings, which post-tax would add around another $10,372, for a total of $14,268.00 in savings in year one. Also, where should I store my savings? Right now I don't have a ton of savings since I am a college student so I just keep them in a savings account with a local credit union.

Thank you again! I appreciate the time you took to read this. If anyone has any other advice or thinks I missed anything, I would love feedback.",finance
CryptoCurrency,#1 Rule in Markets,"There is 1 main rule when it comes to markets…

- Don’t fight the Fed -

For the first time since BTCs inception monetary policy has changed. Most people involved in crypto have actually never faced a monetary policy change and most likely don’t even know what that truly means..

Crypto and assets in general are in for a sizable downturn with a true recession looming.

Don’t mean to spread doom and gloom. Not what this is about. Just want to make people aware since most have likely never  been through this!

btc,What the industry giants are doing as the cryptocurrency market takes hit?,"**On December 9th, Phunware, an enterprise cloud office software company, announced that it had purchased another 100 bitcoins for approximately US$4.975 million in cash, at an average price of approximately US$49,750 per bitcoin. As of December 9, 2021, Phunware holds a total of approximately 630 bitcoins. The total purchase price of these bitcoins is approximately US$36.8 million, and the average purchase price is approximately US$58,513 per right bitcoin.**

***In the same breath, MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor tweeted that he bought 1,434 bitcoins for about $82.4 million in cash. As of Dec. 9, the company held about 122,478 bitcoins with a total purchase price of $3.66 billion, or an average price of about $29,861 per bitcoin.***

According to documents submitted by MicroStrategy to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last Monday, the company purchased 7,002 bitcoins in October and November at a cost of US$414 million, with an average price of US$59,187 per bitcoin. After completing this ""purchase"", the total number of bitcoins held by MicroStrategy has exceeded 120,000

Although most investors in the crypto market have only one or two years of understanding of MicroStrategy, the development process of MicroStrategy has exceeded 30 years. In November 1989, MicroStrategy was established in Tysons Corner, Virginia, USA. It is an enterprise that provides business intelligence, data analysis, mobile software development, and cloud computing. For 30 years after its establishment, MicroStrategy has always adhered to its leadership. In terms of business, it has not been reported that it has any intersection with encrypted assets. Even the company's CEO Michael Saylor (Michael Saylor) criticized Bitcoin on social platforms in 2013.

https://preview.redd.it/pzu4fcr59p481.png?width=1124&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aedbd10104e36a440a6fb97beb88d48cc95a789b

*However, with the arrival of the bull market in the crypto market in 2020 and the increasing risk of uncertainty in the global economic environment, Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy under his leadership did not escape the ""law of true fragrance"" in the end. On August 11, 2020, MicroStrategy suddenly announced that it had bought $250 million worth of Bitcoin, and thus became the world's first public company to publicly allocate Bitcoin as an asset. In this regard, MicroStrategy gave the following reasons: the depreciation of the U.S. dollar, the decline in cash returns, the impact of the new crown epidemic and other macro-environmental impacts prompted the company to seek more diversified asset allocation plans. Looking back at the historical market, we can find that the Bitcoin price at that time was only around $11,000. From the perspective of later comers, it can be described as an accurate bottom hunting.*

*Soon after MicroStrategy announced the purchase of the first batch of bitcoins, bitcoin started a significant upswing, from around US$11,000 in August 2020 to a maximum of US$64,846.9 on April 14, 2021. Platform market data), but since then started a five-month volatile downward trend. During this period, MicroStrategy continued to raise Bitcoin.*

*As of the close of Nasdaq on December 2, 2021, MicroStrategy's total market value is 7.08 billion U.S. dollars, and the value of its holdings of Bitcoin is 6.841 billion U.S. dollars, which means that the total value of its holdings of Bitcoin has reached the company 96.62% of the total market value, compared with 71.76% in June this year, an increase of nearly 25%. Such a high proportion means that Bitcoin's rise and fall will directly affect MicroStrategy's stock price, and its trend is closely related to the ups and downs of the crypto market. It is precisely because of this that MicroStrategy's stock has also won the title of Bitcoin ""shadow stock"".*

Multiple debt issues to raise additional bitcoin

MicroStrategy has a record of borrowing to buy Bitcoin. As early as December 11, 2020 and February 19, 2021, MicroStrategy issued two notes, raising a total of 1.7 billion US dollars in funds, and will raise money. All funds are invested in Bitcoin. The most noteworthy thing is that MicroStrategy’s two bond issuances cleverly used ""convertible notes"" as a financial tool to obtain funds from the traditional market with a cost that is almost negligible. For betting on Bitcoin with high volatility, from the current results, it is clear that MicroStrategy is betting in the right direction.

On December 11, 2020, MicroStrategy announced that it has completed the issuance of a senior unsecured convertible note (Senior Unsecured Convertible Notes) valued at US$650 million. According to the Business Wire website, the annual interest rate of the convertible note is 0.750%. In 2021 Interest will be paid semiannually starting from June 15th, that is, interest will be paid once every year on June 15th and December 15th. The bill initially planned to raise US$400 million, but eventually the excess funds raised reached US$650 million, which to a certain extent reflected the attitude of the capital market towards the digital asset industry at that time. It is understood that the expiry date of the note is December 15, 2025, and investors can choose to convert the note into cash or MicroStrategy's Class A common stock, or a combination of the two. The agreed initial conversion ratio is 2.5126 MicroStrategy Class A stocks for the principal of the $1,000 note, which means that the investor buys its shares at a price of $397.99, and MicroStrategy’s closing price on December 8, 2020 is calculated at $289.45. The premium is about 37.50%, but if the latest closing price of MicroStrategy stock is calculated at $683.36, then the current floating profit of the creditors of MicroStrategy's financing has exceeded 130%.

On February 19, 2021, MicroStrategy once again completed the issuance of a $1.05 billion senior unsecured convertible note with a maturity date of February 15, 2027. The convertible note also allows investors to choose to convert it into cash, MicroStrategy Class A stock, or a combination of the two after maturity.

The initial conversion rate of the convertible note is 0.6981 MicroStrategy Class A shares for every US$1,000 note, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of US$1,432.46 per share. Compared with the closing price of US$955.00 on February 16, 2021, a premium of approximately Is 50.00%. In addition to the premium rate that shows that investors are enthusiastic about this round of financing, the interest paid by MicroStrategy's convertible notes can also be seen. The previous round was still 0.750%, and this round is directly with zero interest (the annual interest rate is 0%), and you only need to repay the principal after maturity. To be precise, this is not a regular zero-coupon bill. Zero-coupon bills are generally issued at a discount, while MicroStrategy is issued based on the face price. For these two debts worth up to $1.7 billion, MicroStrategy has to bear only $24.375 million in interest. From the point of view of the floating profit of MicroStrategy’s current Bitcoin holdings mentioned in the previous article, although it is less than a year since the completion of the first financing, the book income has already been more than ten times the interest it should pay, and Taking into account the impact of “shadow stocks”, the rise in the price of Bitcoin in the past two months has not only made MicroStrategy a fortune in the crypto market, but also increased its stock price. Compared with the low price in June this year, At present, MicroStrategy's stock price has gained a 48.16% increase.

MicroStrategy's last financing to buy Bitcoin occurred on June 7th of this year. In a report submitted by MicroStrategy to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), it was mentioned that the company expects at least $284.5 million in impairment losses on Bitcoin investments in the second quarter. But then it was announced that it would issue Senior Secured Notes (Senior Secured Notes) worth 400 million U.S. dollars (later increased to 500 million U.S. dollars) to purchase Bitcoin at an annual interest rate of 6.125%, which will expire in 2028. However, because the entire crypto market was still immersed in the panic since the 5.19 drop, the crowd who was optimistic about the news in the capital market was obviously less than the previous two financings.

The opposition believes that MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin position is already too large, and it can even be regarded as the company’s main business. If the price of Bitcoin continues to fall, this aggressive method of increasing positions may make MicroStrategy insolvent. Once it reaches this point, the huge bitcoin position it holds may become a bomb that will be thrown into the market at any time. Citibank even adjusted its rating to sell after MicroStrategy first claimed to issue convertible bonds for the purchase of bitcoins, and HSBC prohibited customers from buying MicroStrategy stocks.

personalfinance,Found a credit history problem during mortgage pre qualification.,"I’ll try to summarize without too much detail. My wife and I are looking at building a new home. We have really good income, plenty of equity in our current home, and good debt to income in general. FICO is 790 ish. 

We are closing in on signing a new construction contract that will let us accommodate our family better. During the prequal the mortgage guy at my bank found an issue with numerous (16) 30 day late payments on our current mortgage from 2017-2019. 

I told him that it had to be a reporting mistake as we had no issue at all with income or paying bills. He said outside of that we are fine and the underwriters would have no problem with the pre-qualification. 

So I talked to my wife, who has been in charge of bill payment and it looks like she legitimately made some payments late. She doesn’t know how many and apparently had no idea at all that it was a problem. I will have to deal with that topic separately. 

But my question is, is there any way to rehab this in the 10 months or so it would take to build the house?  Or should I walk away from the whole plan?  I really hate to let the property go, as the opportunity to build in the school district we want is truly a once in a 20 year opportunity, so if I let the lot go it is gone. But now I have no idea what would happen if we went to get our mortgage assuming this black stain is legitimate. Would it bump our interest rate up or sink the entire thing?",finance
dogecoin,On a scale of 1-10 how public should I go about everything.,"1-10 techniques
1-10 identity
1-10 motivations
1-10 transparency of ulterior motives (I. E. Plan A, 1000x, was necessary to create resistance latter, was necessary to leverage divergence, etc.

I try to be as transparent as I can be but I don't know where the line is... And I'm always nervous about crossing the line. Obviously I wouldn't ever disclose anything that would be destructive but I feel like I'm as clear as I can be without jeopardizing others and or myself or anything that would cause too abrupt a change to the game as to cause outright chaos or otherwise trouble.

I'm kinda the front runner which is kinda stressful. 

Xmas is coming up. There is a plan... It would be a great opportunity to flip the economy. IE the concept that a dollar is a debt note owed while a doge is a gratitude token owned.

BTC is a cartel, the gas fees and ethereum is way too over priced to the point where the gas fees seem worse than fed interest rates.

That leaves us with doge. If you believe that something has to be scarce to be valuable bury yourself and bathe in the scarcity of space for a while... Scarcity is the definition of a cartel... It's only correlated to value the same way the mob makes you appreciate your knee caps not being broken.

When the first billionaires cropped up in the 20s burgers still costed 5 cents and it took about 100 years before a burger became around 5 bucks. It'll take 300 years for there to be as many doge as there are dollars: the global reserve currency. As much as I would not want the dollar to collapse but would prefer a smooth transition the only thing that keeps the dollar valuable is the need to exchange dollars for petro.

Currently big data and big oil are teaming up to keep everyone dependent on petro, thus the attack on the REE supply chain leading to the chips and components shortage.

CryptoCurrency,There is no need to be two steps behind every time we enter a bull cycle.,"The state of this sub sure has changed since 2018 and while that isn't necessarily bad I see new people struggling with the same stuff over and over again.

 I'll just quote a few posts from the front page to try and get my point across.

&gt;Just because a coin's value is $0.00001 doesn't mean it has room to reach $1

**Isn't this self-evident?** How much time do you have to spend researching crypto before you realize that every token has a defined supply that plays a key role in determining the token price? Why are we still learning the basics here?

&gt;Saying ""we are still early"" is setting yourself up for wildly unrealistic expectations

You are still early. There is no doubt about it. For perspective, only [3 million ETH wallets](https://nairametrics.com/2020/06/18/ethereum-wallets-holding-at-least-0-1-eth-just-crossed-the-3-million-mark-for-the-first-time/) have more than 0.1 ETH in them. There are 8 BILLION people on this planet and they all need financial services. You are as early as you can be. Even Bitcoin active wallets only crossed 65 million active users recently. Do the math. It's that simple.


&gt;TA YouTubers are full of sh*t

YouTubers are here to make money for themselves, not for you. If you want them to paint a bullish scenario just because you want your bags to go up they will. Their content is determined by metrics and your Google searches. If you want to feel bullish they will make you feel bullish because that brings in more revenue.

This doesn't mean that you can't find reasonable people out there. Some that I follow are expecting BTC to go down to 30K before we can make a significant rebound. Are they also full of shit?


&gt;Whitepaper's today is nothing more than a long list of promises like that of a politician's manifesto before election! 

Did you not find it suspicious that people asking for money up front can't even bother to give you a working product to try first? Whitepapers are there for show and none of them should be taken seriously. This is something we all learned during the ICO era, why do we have to reevaluate the same shit over and over again?  They all smell like manure so treat them accordingly.


**Perspective is everything in crypto**


The problem may lie in the unrealistic expectations new people are fed with as soon as they step into the crypto industry. Before you can talk reason into them they will find Bitboy crypto and he will tell them that Ripple is going to $250 in 2022 while also lying that he is an expert on the subject.


The hard truth is that no one knows what they are actually doing. We can't know if Ethereum will be here in 10 years even though it may seem obvious today. What if they don't fix the issue with fees and people just find something different but equally useful?


**You are running a marathon** and anyone who tells you otherwise is a liar. If you want to ""make it"" in crypto you need to commit to something. Find a project that resonates with your personal beliefs and moral values, get involved, stack the token over time and reap the rewards once people recognize the value you saw years ago.


It is really not that hard if you stop listening to idiots. NO ONE KNOWS what they are talking about when it comes to long-term investments. Just find something that makes sense to you and mute the noise. It won't get you anywhere.

#[Stock futures are positive ahead of key inflation report](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/09/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Friday as investors braced for an inflation report that is expected to show prices at their highest level in nearly 40 years.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 85 points, or 0.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures rose 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.2%.
*****
&gt; Markets expect a high inflation reading, which could lead the Federal Reserve to hasten the taper of its $120-billion monthly bond-buying program. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect a 0.7% gain for the month of November, which would translate to a year-over-year growth rate of 6.7%. If that is the case, it will mark the biggest move since June 1982.
*****
&gt; Oracle shares soared, gaining more than 11% premarket, a day after beating earnings on the top and bottom lines.
*****
&gt; Southwest Airlines dropped 2.5% in premarket trading following another downgrade on Wall Street, this time from Goldman Sachs. The industry has been deemed susceptible to inflation risk, and Alaska Air Group also was off Friday, falling 2.7%.
*****
&gt; Interactive fitness company Peloton added to its woes, dropping 2.7% premarket after tumbling 11.3% on Thursday. Credit Suisse cut its view on the company, saying a return to gyms and shifts in consumer spending will weigh on profitability.
*****
&gt; The moves came after the major averages ended the regular trading session lower, each snapping a three-day win streak. The Dow, moved less than a point lower, finishing at the flatline. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.7% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 1.7%. Nevertheless, all are on track to finish the week higher.
*****
&gt; Jobless claims data released on Thursday showed the labor market recovery remains strong. The Labor Department reported initial claims for unemployment insurance totaled 184,000, below the 211,000 estimated by economists surveyed by Dow Jones and the lowest reading since 1969.
*****
&gt; Trading was largely muted as investors await more data from the Labor Department, which will release the November consumer price index on Friday. It was the market’s second day of pause, following the two-day market rally earlier this week as they turned their attention to the economic data instead.
*****
&gt; The University of Michigan is also set to release consumer sentiment data on Friday, which AXS Investments CEO Greg Bassuk said he’s also following closely as it appears at odds with inflation levels.
*****
&gt; “Sentiment seems to be really at lows, yet consumer shopping and retail strength seems to be quite strong, so there’s a mismatch there,” he said. “We think the proof is really at the cash register. As long as we’re seeing strong consumer shopping, employers continuing to bring people back to work, bigger picture we remain much more bullish moving toward the end of the year.”

personalfinance,SSDI and student loans,"My (36F) husband (40M) has been on SSDI for 5 years but it was recently rescinded after his review. He is not physically able to work full time  but that does not guarantee we will be able to reinstate SSDI, as SSDI criteria have become harder to meet in the last few years. We have an attorney and are appealing this decision.


 In the event we lose the appeal, we will have to start paying back his federal student loans ($71k balance) which has been in forbearance for this time. These have not yet been eligible for SSDI discharge due to his SSDI review status. He was on a 1-3 year review schedule and one's condition must support a 7 year review schedule to be eligible for discharge. Our payments will be another $600-800 per month on these loans. If we file taxes separately so he can do IBR, my taxes will go up the same amount, so its a wash. I'd rather pay the debt. 

I make a 6 figure salary ($110k) and we live very frugally but our healcare costs  are very high, nearly $22k per year for insurance and out of pocket costs.  We also have a kid (8F) and another $76k in student loan debt that we are making payments on. 
We have no credit card or car payments. Our mortgage and Home equity loan payments are under $900 per month, all at low fixed rates. We had to do some repairs to our home this year, but nothing crazy. 

I have over $100k in my current employer 401k and $60k from an old rolled over IRA. We have about  $25k in our emergency funds. I'm thinking about cashing out some of my IRA (pre tax) to pay these loans down so the paymentscanbe closer to $300 per month. Otherwise we simply will not be able to make the payments without completely stopping future  retirement contributions and foregoing my 3% company match.

So do I cash out a current account or postpone future contributions to my current 401k? If cash out, how much?",finance

stocks,"Inflation surged 6.8%, even more than expected, in November to fastest rate since 1982","The consumer price index was expected to rise 6.7% from a year ago in November, according to economists surveyed by Dow Jones.

The consumer price index, which measures the cost of a wide-ranging basket of goods, rose 0.8% for the month, good for a 6.8% pace on a year over year basis and the fastest rate since June 1982.

Excluding food and energy prices, so-called core CPI was up 0.5% for the month and 4.9% from a year ago, which itself was the sharpest pickup since mid-1991.

The Dow Jones estimate was for a 6.7% annual gain for headline CPI and 4.9% for core.

With unemployment claims running at their lowest pace since 1969 and gross domestic product expected to show strong gains to end 2021 after a lackluster third quarter, inflation remains the biggest problem for the recovery.

The Federal Reserve is watching the data closely ahead of its two-day meeting next week.

Central bank officials have indicated that will begin slowing the help they’re providing in an effort to tamp down inflation. Investors widely expect the Fed to double the tapering of its asset purchases to $30 billion a month, likely starting in January. That would enable the Fed to start raising interest rates as soon as next spring.

personalfinance,How do I turn a bonus into a better future?,"I was hoping for some guidance from more knowledgeable people than my friends and family, so here's my quandary: I am about to accept a position with a company that is offering me a $15,000 sign-on bonus if I sign a 2-year contract.

The two years is not a problem, the problem is how can I turn that bonus into a better financial situation for myself? 

I'm at a loss, some people are telling me a CD, others are saying a money market is the better option.

I have very small balances on my two credit cards and my only other debt is my federal student loans.

My new hourly pay (and other benefits) will be more than enough for basic needs, savings, and debt payment.

So, what can I do to turn that bonus into a better financial future for myself?

personalfinance,Questions about early retirement withdrawal,"Hello,

First off, this is embarrassing. Secondly, I can't seem to find my answers from google searches, so I have turned to good old reddit for some hopeful insight. 

I haven't worked since before the pandemic began. Money has been tight. I found out I had a decently sizable (to me) retirement account from an old job that had been sitting there collecting for ten years. I know it's not the smartest move to withdraw from this, but, desperate times. And to clarify, my early retirement withdrawals happened AFTER whatever that law expired that allowed penalty free withdrawals.

Ok - my question is regarding how much I am going to have to pay come tax time. I understand there is a 10% penalty for early retirement withdrawals (I am not 55 1/2 years old). Knowing this, I socked away 10% of each withdrawal I made into a savings account I do not touch. So, I should be good in that regard when it comes time to pay the 10% penalty. However, I am an idiot and did not take into account income tax. I started googling last night calculator estimations for paying back and they all included the 10% penalty plus % income tax. So hypothetically, if I withdrew $25k, put $2500 away into savings to pay the 10% fee, it would seem I could still owe somewhere around 4k-6k in income tax on the withdrawal, in which case I am totally fucked. However, then a lightbulb went off in my brain (again I am an idiot), and I remembered Vanguard holds I think 20% of withdrawal for federal income tax payment. Does this mean that my income tax portion is taken care of because of the automatic withholding on behalf of Vanguard? Am I in the clear and will just owe the 10% penalty? 

Thank you anyone who took the time to read this and can help shed light!",finance
personalfinance,Side hustle self-employment + income taxes,"I have a ""regular"" job that, as a single person, puts me into the 24% federal income tax bracket.

Since I am saving for a home, I am considering doing some contract work as a side hustle. I have done this before, but not while also working a full-time W2 job.

Since my full-time job already puts me in a relatively high tax bracket, if I were to do self-employed work on the side, would I essentially be paying self-employment tax of 15% *plus* 24% federal income tax? That would basically mean 40% of my self employment income would be gone, and would reduce my net earnings to a point where it's probably not worth it anymore.",finance
personalfinance,Start Paying Student Loans in Big Chunks?,"Hi all,

I need some advice on how I'm planning on paying off my student loans. I have 25.1k in student loans. I graduated in December 2020 so I have no interest. I very thankfully got a job in April 2021. I haven't paid anything back yet. Since January 31, 2022 is just around the corner, I need to come up with a plan on paying this back soon!

I'm not the most financially competent, I just save all my money in my savings and don't invest since I have no knowledge on it. By the end of January 2022, I will have about 10k in my bank account. I have 90% of my money in a savings account and the rest in my checking. When my loan is due, should I pay 5k into my loans and knock it back to \~20k with no interest? I used the loan calculator on the federal student aid site for my current loan of 25.1k, and they estimated (with a 4.52% interest rate) that I'd pay $250-415 a month until 2030. Would my $5k big chunk pay be beneficial to me or just stupid when I could pay it off slowly in 10 years?

CryptoCurrency,What are your theories on these constant dips?,"Btc under $60k was surprising tbh, now it’s hovering at mid $40ks. Eth at under $4k was a thing of the past, yet as of now it’s under $4k. Wtf is going on. I understand this market is relatively tiny $2-3t compared to equities at $300t and every move by whales causes identifiable ripples whereas in equities markets move based on government action or global news. Rarely in equities do whale action influence the market as a whole unless those sentiments are accepted universally. In crypto, specially with the big 2, we have major supply issues. 80% of btc holders don’t sell, so 20% are moving prices. Eth is even more consolidated where only 11% is available for trading. Eth has a burn element as well that takes away supply. 90% of btc has been mined and there are only 21million of these for the whole world to share. Network adoption is supposed to be growing faster than the internet did according to Raual Pol or however you spell his name. So wtf happened. I know crypto has already had major gains this year. It’s obvious some people take profits. But so many more have come in. Btc stayed above $60k for a good while after reaching its recent ath. There was seemingly enough support to keep it there until the next pop. Eth is the darling coin of crypto land and let me repeat only 11% is available for trading. 
So wtf is going on? Are leveraged accounts being squeezed. Too many immature young people borrowed money to buy crypto driving up prices artificially and current valuations were over inflated? What the problem is?

Edit: Thank you for the various awards; I’ll need to figure out what’s what, but thank you.

Edit (another one): there are a lot of responses about holiday and Christmas selling. However, my take is we’re not in a vacuum with same buyers and sellers. Where are the people/institutions with loads of cash waiting to come in on these dips. I’m sure many are buying, but not enough to keep prices stable. I guess January will be more telling, if the dips continue this whole thing needs to be reassessed.

Edit (final): I appreciate all the comments and awards. This thing really blew up and it seems a lot of people had the same sentiments. I read pretty much all the comments, of course I couldn’t respond to all of them. From what i could put together, there were a lot of responses on whale manipulation and I’m not sure I agree with that, but of course I can see whales taking advantage of the situation; that’s what whales would do, but that’s what anyone would do. Macro headwinds with fed action is a big concern. Bear v. Bull, or dips in bull markets? Dips are expected, this is normal.

It requires work, study, temperament. Just because you're young doesn't mean you can afford to set your finances back years.

Do you know how to determine the fair value of a company? Do you know how risk-free yields influence that calculation? Do you actually do that calculation before deploying your capital?

Do you try to predict the short-term direction of the market? Try to predict when the next crash will be? How's that been working for you?

Don't blame others. The market is not rigged against you--that's no excuse when it has been so easy to make money.

Some people have genuinely been dealt a rotten hand---but you can't blame others for wealth inequality if it was **your own bad decisions** that caused you to lose money. Learn from it.

The market won't always be like this. Since Covid the overall market has been on 'easy' mode.

personalfinance,Looking for some ELI5 help understanding the tax liability for emptying a rollover IRA from an old pre-tax 401k.,"****Edit:****  *Sorry for the lack of replies, typing gets painful after awhile  - but you've all helped so much!  I still have some math to do this weekend, but have a much clearer picture of what to expect.  Thanks so much!!*      


So just to be honest, I’ve been really overwhelmed by all the financial/investment terminology; it’s been like trying to learn a new language and no matter how hard I try, it still just seems incomprehensible to me.  Would really appreciate toddler-level terms here.  Of course, if there’s a better place to ask this, please let me know.

The long story extremely short:  I had a 401k plan at an old job (almost 10 years ago) that I didn’t realize still existed (I was laid off before I could contribute anything – all that went in was a safe harbor contribution).  Old boss is now retiring and needs to close out that plan, so called me about it, at which point I learned there was close to $5500 in that account.  In the short term, I opted to roll the money into an IRA, to get the process moving and avoid the flat 20% tax hit.  

I am planning to withdraw the full balance and close out the IRA before year-end.  I know this is generally a no-no, but in my particular circumstances, it’s the best decision.  Due to a medical condition, my income has been reduced by 75% in the last year;  I still have about $8k in credit card debt at high interest, and can barely make the minimum payments some months.  If I leave the IRA alone, I will essentially be throwing over $100/mo away on credit card interest.  

Due to aforementioned medical issues (which led to multiple months of unpaid FMLA leave this year), my total wages for 2021 are less than $8000.  Even if I withdraw the full amount of the IRA, my total taxable income will be minimal.  

Before I decide whether to withdraw a portion, or simply wipe out the entire IRA this year, I need to fully understand how the tax works.

I tried using a tax refund calculator to estimate, but there was no option to account for early withdrawal from an IRA, which to my understanding carries a 10% penalty.  The financial advisor I’ve been working with, hasn’t been able to dumb this down enough for me to understand, and some of his comments confused me even more.

My questions are:

-	Is the 10% “early withdrawal” penalty a tax, or more like a fine?  Will I owe 10% on the full amount of the IRA at the time of withdrawal, or does it get accounted for in my taxes?

-	If it’s something that’s included with my taxes, do I only have to pay the 10% on the amount of my income that’s taxable?  Or will I still be looking at a flat 10% on the entire amount of the IRA withdrawal?
-	Likewise, if I would decide not to withdraw the full amount (so as to stay under the standard deduction), will that mean I don’t have to pay that 10% penalty at all?  
-	To my understanding, the 10% penalty is Federal only, but will I need to set money aside to pay income tax on this money to state/local as well?  (I am in PA if that helps.)
-	My S/O and I have the same employer; he has mentioned giving me some of his holiday bonus to just pay the rest of the debt off.  Am I overly-paranoid to worry that they'll think we're trying to dodge taxes or something?  
-	One other (somewhat-related) question:  my grandmother passed away this year, and I received a small life insurance payout ($772) – do I need to include that as income or otherwise account for it on my taxes?

# The Hangman

When he dispatches the cease-and-desist letters, sues, and brings on FINRA to sheriff the stablecoin market, bitcoin is going to pivot and diverge from “crypto” in a very dramatic way. The largest stablecoin whom’s name starts with a “T” has done bitcoin no favors. Mainstream talking points will have you believe it somehow provides BTC liquidity so it can “pump”. No. It’s a horse thief. What it does is provide the moonshine for leverage, the harlot for hyper fractional reserve lending, and a the playing cards for people to gamble amongst themselves with.

I'd like to add there’s a robust yield curve slowly growing around bitcoin; it’s very young, hardly visible yet, and both custodial and non-custodial. The stablecoin horse thief even took our source of manure to feed this yield garden. The sooner he's ridden down and hung the better.

# Trail of Tears

I’d like to add to his thesis that Zk’s will reach full composability as well. All of this stuff more or less foreshadows technological independence and a coming moment whereby all the L1 taxation gets dumped in Boston Harbor. Kings are not needed anymore to dictate to their colonies who to worship and how much to pay. This could in some telling usher in the *Decentralized Autonomous Organization* era. And I bet their treasuries get gold bricked with bitcoin.

So what the hangman Gary Gensler is about to do is only speeding up the inevitable anyway folks. It’s best people’s necks break and their feet thrash in regret above the ground now. No need to let another global trillion dollars and some poor kid’s Christmas money find its way into Charles Hoskinson’s social token, or Vitalik Buterin’s tokenized orgy of swaps, wraps, burns, mints, and stakes.

CryptoCurrency,Why Decentralisation of the Financial System isn't Happening Anytime Soon,"While crypto is slowly entering the mainstream, I still remain skeptical about whether decentralisation as a concept is going to be implemented anytime soon. You only need to glance at the front page of r/cryptocurrency to see the arguments about whether we are early or not but crypto adoption, whilst great for prices and market cap I believe may work against true decentralisation. I suppose you're probably wondering how I could adopt this point of view when many cryptocurrencies are decentralised by their very nature but humour me here.

Hypothetically, let's say the banks burn- let 'em, banks have always lined their pockets irresponsibly using the fractional reserve system. Sure, the winds of change come and the traditional financial system restructures and adopts defi in the coming years. Those that change with it survive, those that don't die. This would be great for collaterlised loans, interest rates and giving power to the consumer. However, I imagine since you are reading this, you've already explored decentralised finance. It's not exactly the easiest concept to understand and use. Will the average Joe, or your elderly parents or grandparents, with absolutely zero interest in cryprocurrency be motivated enough to learn about DEXs, LP tokens, yield farming, staking or impermanent losses? Throw in transaction fees, transaction delays, risk of fund loss, rug pulls and the loss of somebody to blame if things go wrong as a cherry on top. I just don't see defi being adopted. 

Yet there is no denying it's a superior system in my mind. So what do I foresee happening? My take is that companies will take advantage of this complexity and offer a centralised solution to defi. A savings account that functions like a normal bank yet with higher interest rates. Companies that make tasks easier for the consumer and sprinkle in a little customer service have always flourished. Take airbnb, booking.com, uber or skyscanner. All the above take many decentralised versions of a service and make it available to the consumer under one umbrella company. However, here is the catch- centralisation brings infrastructure, customer service, maintenance and other costs. These costs incur fees in return for peace of mind and consumer protection. How many defi projects have to be hacked or flash loaned for us to realise that no asset is completely safe in the cryptosphere? Is the risk of losing your life savings really an acceptable risk to the general population? Most definitely not...

Crypto.com, a company which we all love, has started down this path, simplifying defi investments with their earn program. A fantastic idea, but I can't help but wonder when these interest rates will start to fall. The net interest margins for banks are around 3% and yet you get offered 0.5%. Are we really convinced that if financial institutions starting to offer defi investment solutions, they wouldn't start dipping their fingers in the honey pot? High interest rates are great for the few who take the defi risk, but would be the very cause of inflation if 10-20% APY became the expected normal.

Thank you for reading my thoughts, it remains to be said that I am still incredible bullish and excited about the change crypto is bringing about. I just remain dubious whether defi will stay decentralised or rather become the new centralised finance.",cryptocurrency

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, December 10, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, December 10, 2021**

Stocks ended broadly higher today as market participants shrugged off the new Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is roughly in line with economist expectations ahead of the Federal Reserve final meeting of the year, a sign that market participants. The Russell 2000 (IWM) which tracks the performance of small-caps, underperformed today. Looking ahead, market participants wait for the Federal Reserve’s final policy-setting meeting next week. 

**Notable Numbers Today**

* CPI: +6.8%
* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): +0.94%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): +1.9%
* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.59%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.28%
* Volatility Index (VIX): -6.40%
* Apple (AAPL): + 2.8%
* Microsoft (MSFT): +2.78%
* Grab (GRAB) -12.75%
* Oracle (ORCL): +15.61%

The Labor Department released the Consumer Price Index, which showed the rate of inflation coming in at a multi-decade high for the month of November. CPI climbed 6.8% in a year-over-year period, marking the fastest rate of inflation since June 1982. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the “core” CPI came in at 4.9%. 

On the other hand, new weekly unemployment claims in the US plunged to the lowest level since 1969, coming in even below pre-pandemic. Here are the numbers:

* **Initial unemployment claims, week ended Dec. 4:** 184,000 vs. 220,000 expected and an upwardly revised 227,000 during prior week 
* **Continuing claims, week ended Nov. 27:** 1.992 million vs. 1.910 million expected and a downwardly revised 1.954 million during prior week

Currently, the US has more than 11 million job openings, highling how tight the labor market is becoming in the US. A tight labor market combined with elevated inflation will likely make the Federal Reserve to finish quantitative tapering sooner than expected. 

Seema Shah, Chief Investment Strategist at Principal Global Investors, said “Wage increases are probably on the agenda for next year. That's part of the broadening of inflationary pressures that we've already started to see come through in some of that CPI data. But I have to say that we're not so worried because we're starting to see other parts of the inflation picture actually starting to fade. So at the end of next year, 12 months from now, we're not expecting the kind of 6-7% CPI numbers ... We're thinking more like 3% level for 12 months time.""

stocks,CPI calculation is understated - Bill Ackman,"https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1469438745791410183

Interesting comments from Ackman. Anecdotal, but my 1 BR in NJ renewal is coming up and it's a 14% increase from last year so I'm definitely feeling the heat.

Wanted to bring this up to foster a discussion on CPI calculations and the Fed's rationale for calculating CPI in their own special way. This isn't a news shock, similar discussions have been occurring this past year re: used cars, commodities, etc. and wanted to get your thoughts on the situation because it's extremely relevant to markets right now.",finance
personalfinance,Cousin in debt. How can I help without paying it off myself,"My wife asked if we could loan her cousin $100,000.
So...  I immediately said no and I'm sticking to it.

But...  That might not stick due to ongoing problems the cousin and husband are currently in

Both the cousin and their husband have jobs.  1 owns a company and is not taking a salary right now.  The other has a high paying salary. Like maybe 200k.

The problem is that when one of them was unemployed, they opened a credit card and charged stupidly.  Amassing 100k of debt.


Credit card Debt is possibly the highest interest rate debt that you could get.  I know it.

I do not want to ""loan"" them money because I wouldn't expect to get it back and 100k is a boatload to me.

Instead I would want to give them advice that could help them to reduce the debt and help them pay it off over time. To me, this forum is perfect for brainstorming those ideas.

Some initial questions.

Is there a way to convert their credit card debt to something with a lower interest rate?
What other strategies can I recommend to them to help them, without paying their debt?",finance

Forex,inflation figures released and its affect.,"Hi everyone,

I came to this reddit page because i had a question regarding the recent CPI figures that were released yesterday by USA.

the GBP/USD rose upon higher inflation figures - does this normally happen?

As i was expecting the inflation figure release to have a downward affect on the pair, seeing as though inflation is rising meaning fed will have to taper and raise rates in future.

any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated.

Please excuse any naivety.

personalfinance,Student Loan High Payments,"Just to head off people thinking I’m complaining about my student loans - I’m not. My wife and I are fortunate to have well paying jobs that covers all of our life expenses so I’m paying off my loans, it’s fine, we’re fine, etc.

However, I was thinking about student loans vs my mortgage and the payment seemed out of proportion. For example we owe $250k (after down payment) on our mortgage which is $1500 a month. However, my student loan at $70k is $720 a month which is roughly half the mortgage payment but is about 1/3 of the principle of the mortgage.

What makes it so much more? The interest rates make some difference (2% vs 6%) and I know one is a secured vs unsecured loan. Are these the only variables? Does anyone have the math off the top of their head?

Just looking at this now I would actually assumed a payment much less that 720 (maybe in the 200s) would cover such a loan - or at least a 30 year fixed mortgage.

Also the $720 student loan payment is not the minimum it’s enough to cover interest + principal.

personalfinance,Mortgage servicing transferred to a BSI Financial Services and I am TERRIFIED!!,"As the title states, our mortgage servicing was transferred to BSI, which we received notice of middle of November. Initially we didn't think much of the notice as this is common practice in the mortgage industry.


However today my fella gets a call from someone who doesn't identify themselves personally nor what company they are calling from simply states 'We bought your loan; why have you not paid yet this month?' 


This seemed odd so he gave an ambiguous response of 'The check is in the mail.' Which is true! The lady who called stated she would remove us from the call list until the 15th and if they had not received our payment by then they would call us back. At this point in time our payment is still within the 15 day window and is not considered late. Let alone the 60 day period following the effective date of the loan servicing transfer in which Federal Law states it may not be treated by the new servicer as late.


The notice of mortgage servicing transfer stated that any payments due on or after 12/2/2021 would need to be paid to BSI. Our mortgage payment is due the first of the month, so we mailed it to the current servicer on 11/29/2021.


On my lunch break I called the mortgage servicer we have been making payments to since we closed on our house 7/2020. They verified that they did receive our payment and that it was being sent to BSI.


If you are still reading you may be thinking 'No big deal, status quo.'

CryptoCurrency,Congressional Crypto Hearings Wrap-up | Crypto Market COFFEE BREAK Report 12.10,"### Overview

* Crypto Market Insight: 200 EMA | Bitcoin Dominance | Congressional Hearings
* Major Crypto News
* NEWBIES’ Lesson of the Day: What is a non-fungible token (NFT) 

&amp;#x200B;

### Market Insight

Bitcoin continues to test the 48-50k support as volume begins to lose steam. This key support will likely be retested varies times the coming days. The support is in-line with 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) which historically indicator of overall market trend. (Above-bull, below-Bear). If Bitcoin holds the 200 EMA, an extended accumulation is likely after a strong ousting of retail positions during the extended drawdown.

&amp;#x200B;

[BTC 1D Chart ](https://preview.redd.it/z441u1z5hu481.png?width=1019&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=293142e8bd25e8d2444c89b8049fb4d731d6cfe0)

&amp;#x200B;

 

**Bitcoin Dominance**

It will be interesting to see if Bitcoin Dominance hits new lows or if it decides to break its downward trend. Its generally expected for dominance to rise during uncertain market conditions but that was not the recent case. Investors are becoming more comfortable holding some altcoins like Ethereum during these conditions. Dominance currently sits at 41.49%.

&amp;#x200B;

[Bitcoin Dominance](https://preview.redd.it/m2ghwy2ahu481.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=737168eff1d33bcb9ae708e079fc9270d66a0e72)

&amp;#x200B;

**Inflation Data**

The U.S. bureau of Labor Statistics released the CPI data this morning putting U.S. inflation at 6.8% for the last 12 months. The CPI measures the prices paid by U.S. consumers for goods and services. Inflation is at its highest levels since 1982.

 The Federal Reserve that printed 40% of all US dollars into existence this past year is holding talks on December 14 &amp; 15 to discuss bond purchase tapering and interest rate hikes. Crypto investors should keep a close eye on the outcome of the meetings. Widely considered a speculative asset, crypto will be strongly affected by Fed policy changes. Another related factor is the rising number of Covid cases that will likely only get worse as US enters winter. The Fed began aggressive monetary policies around the time lockdowns began in 2020. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Congressional Hearings**

     The congressional hearing on Wednesday that featured some keys names in crypto such as FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, and Bitfury CEO Brian Brooker were a success according to the participants. Excluding a few Congressmen, there was a sentiment of progress. The CEOs voiced support for a new regulatory platform for cryptocurrency that wouldn’t destroy its progress in the US. Brian Brooks of Bitfury was the MVP of the hearings. [Highlights of the hearings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6CmsrOFeo).

[Senator Representative Brad Shermon, who appeared to prepare for the wrong type of hearing, added some comedy to the event. Watch minute 2:30.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3o2ATETwBY&amp;t=182s)

## NEWBIES’ Lesson of the day

#### What is an Non Fungible Token (NFT)

*Read in conjunction with yesterday’s*[ *report*](https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-practical-future-of-nfts-5bfb1cab4e4e)

&amp;#x200B;

Characteristics of NFTs:

* Non-Fungible
* One of a kind
* Cannot be altered
* Will always exist on the blockchain
* Non-Fungible
* A blockchain token

&amp;#x200B;

**Non-Fungible and One of a kind**

Every item on planet on fungible or non-fungible. A loaf of bread is fungible. There are numerous loafs of Wonderbread at the store and It really doesn’t matter which particular one you buy. An example of a non-fungible item is a famous sculpture. The sculpture can be duplicated but it will be never have the value of the original.

**Cannot Be Altered**

When you create an NFT and attach it to the data that mints it on the blockchain, its in a complete state. It will never be altered again. Imagine the Mona Lisa in an indestructible box.

**Will always exist on the blockchain**

Just like bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency, once a block of data is minted, it will always exist on a that blockchain.

**A token**

Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hamstercoin and NFTs are all tokens. What sets an NFTs apart is that it is ONLY token one of it’s kind. Each Bitcoin is also unique in a sense but the value is identical despite each coin’s uniqueness.

personalfinance,Managing Student Loans - Choosing Repayment Options,"Hi! Looking for recommendations about how I should approach repaying my student loans because I've been getting conflicting advice (i.e., some people say to go for 20-year forgiveness and others say to try to pay it off ASAP). I'll explain the situation below, but I'm also interested in any recommendations for a financial advisor service that wouldn't be super expensive (i.e., a professional whom I can explain my situation to and who can offer advice).

So here are the details: I'm 28, live in NYC, and will be done with a grad program in May. By that point, I will have taken out a total of $128,982. I've used federal loans (Direct Graduate PLUS and Direct Unsubsidized). The breakdown of interest rates is: $20,500 = 4.3%, $41,000 = 5.28%, $37,603 = 5.3%, $29,879 = 6.28%. 

When I graduate and based on NYC salaries, I can expect a job that pays $60-$65k. After 2-3 years of work experience and some additional certifications, I believe I should be in the $70k range. 

For added reference, my partner and I are planning on getting married within the next year. They are currently working full time and also doing a grad program. They'll graduate in December 2022 with about $65k in federal student loans and can expect a job that pays around $65k. Neither of us have savings. 

At some point in the future, we might want to move out of NYC and buy a house. 

Until recently, I had been planning on doing the Pay As You Earn repayment plan and aiming for the 20-year forgiveness. But, recently, someone said I should refinance my loans with a private lender that would have lower interest rates and try to pay off the loans within 10 years. 

So, looking for advice on how to approach repaying these loans: should I refinance with a private lender? Should I stick with the PAYE plan or go with another option? Other tips?

I have been happily doing that at vanguard for six years through their app. Once a month making an ira deposit to max out each year. 

Well last month vanguard updated their app and now state this in their FAQ of the app:

“Which accounts aren’t fully supported by the app?”

While we currently support the majority of Vanguard account types, if you have a Mutual Fund-only account on our legacy brokerage platform, you will only be able to use the app to check your portfolio. There are no plans to add functionality for this type of account in the app, but you can still visit vanguard.com to make any transactions.”

I know I’m a pretty low source of money for these guys, but it’s sad to see them remove features on an app like buying and selling mutual funds for a specific type of account. Just generally annoyed. I’ll likely use the website for a year or so before getting fed up and then transfer my balance to fidelity or something similar.

EDIT: ok I’m an idiot. I thought i was locked out but I’m not.

personalfinance,Early Savings or Early Pay off?,"Hello! I have recently begun to get my finances in order after falling deep in the debt hole that was dug even deeper by COVID. Here’s a little about my situation

I am currently an intern for my profession, however in my state interns get paid as first years and I am earning approximately $58,000 a year. I am still enrolled in classes paid via federal student loans. I am getting my Fall tuition reimbursement from my employer of around $3000, along with about $3400 of a refund check from my Spring semester tuition. I also do not get paid from mid June to mid August, meaning I need to save money for summer. I have budgeted about $5000 for this. 

I am currently around $9500 in debt with five credit cards, bad I know but I’ve actually reduced it by almost $3000 in the past three months! One card is paid completely off. 

The breakdown of balances and interest rates are as follows:

Card 1: $6500 balance 0% interest (card closed, monthly payment of $124 per agreement)

Card 2: $990 balance, 24% interest (card closed, no monthly payment agreement)

Card 3: $300 balance, 24% interest rate

Card 4: $0 balance, 27% interest rate

Card 5: $1700 balance, 20% interest rate 

I am not interested in using my refunds to go back to my student loans because I work in a public service position and will qualify for forgiveness down the line (let’s hope they have it fixed by then). With that being said, I am wondering if it is wiser to use the reimbursement and refund checks to quickly pay off my credit card debt (and wondering which cards would be wisest to pay off first) OR if I should allocate it to my summer savings, and use all of my leftover income to continue paying them down as I have been for the last three months.

2. Do you see any where in my plan where I could make better choices?

CryptoCurrency,Whales Are Preparing For a Crash,"Whales are taking incremental profits by selling and buying back lower only to sell again. The same is happening in the stock market as well, where low-mid caps are getting thrashed while large caps like Microsoft and Apple skyrocket in value. 

This gives the appearance that the market is doing good, because large caps determine the sentiment behind the DOW and S&amp;P 500. 

They offload low-mid caps, ie, riskier investments to free up cash because those investments go down the worst during a crash, and then pumping large caps so that they can give the public a hopeful sentiment that everything is okay while they offload their assets before a large crash. 

Similarly, this is what is happening to the Crypto market. Bitcoin drops from 66k because whales take profits, they then buy and sell back and forth to make incremental profits while giving the public hope before the next leg down.

This is what is currently happening right now, which is why I see a major drop/crash in the Stock/Crypto market coming up here within the next few weeks.

Edit : Inflation, over leveraged positions, Fed Tapering, Possible increase in interest rates, the fact China’s housing market is in shambles is a good indicator of a large downtrend. This is more than likely *why* the whales are selling, because they see economic destabilization coming soon.

3. I've saved 15k for an emergency fund 
4. Currently living at home with parents, commuting to the office
5. Majority of my spending is: covering home utilities (water, internet, electricity) and gas for driving to and from work. This comes up to be roughly 10ish% of my monthly paycheck. I don't spend much money outside of that outside of the occasional fast food run or dining out with friends on the weekends once in a while
6. Employer 401k match is in effect up to 7%, dollar for dollar. 

My main questions are: 

1. My emergency fund is currently in my checking account, I'd like to move this to a savings account ASAP. I'm very strict with my finances and I know that I'm not going to touch my emergency fund unless needed, but from what I've read on this subreddit, everyone advises to keep your savings in a different bank than your checking for security purposes along with temptation to withdraw. What is everyone's opinion on this? I currently bank with Bank of America and would prefer to keep everything under one roof but there is a security risk should the bank run into issues and the fact that the interest rate is a complete joke. Is an online savings account like Discover or Ally worth the hassle? 
2. What should I do with my paychecks now that my emergency fund has been established? I'm still going to continue contributing a % of my future paychecks to the emergency fund so that it keeps growing but I'd like to start setting aside some money for recreational spending, a travel fund, and then throw some money into investing. Is a Roth IRA the next logical step if the 401k is already in the works? Or would it make sense to open a brokerage account with Fidelity/Vanguard and throw money into funds? Or would it be better to throw this money into building a stock portfolio on Robinhood/Coinbase? Any recommended path there? 
3. Is there anything else you would be doing in this situation if you were in my shoes? I'm always open to hearing advice and would love if anyone had anything to suggest

I appreciate the help and advice with pertaining to this post, thank you all in advance!",finance
stocks,What to do with all this buying power?,"So I have been investing for the last 3 years now but i have kept my portfolio small (around 10k) as I am just learning. 
I have been getting good returns and been sticking to ETFs. But now I feel more comfortable and want to add more funding to my portfolio.(about 150k). 

How would you guys go about what to buy with that much buying power? I was thinking evenly diversifying into, VTI, and SPY and ride it for the long run. 

Or should I invest 75k evenly and dollar cost average the rest? Or should I wait til the FEDs begin tapering and raising the rates and then make my move? 

Would love to hear others opinions?",finance
personalfinance,Looking for real estate inheritance-ish advice,"Howdy all - looking for some advice here. I've reached out to my attorney but thinking this community may lead me onto something I've not yet thought about. I have a set of aging grandparents that have lived their lives as artists in St Louis MO. They have a 11k sqft gallery + residential space in a trendy historic neighborhood close to downtown. It's lovely, but needs some work. They currently have a $140k personal loan on the property. If I had to estimate, $200k is likely to get this thing into great shape. They want out from under this loan and if I do that for them, I can have the property. Couple things:

1) I don't yet live in STL, but I will be moving there for work spring 2022 (same position I'm in now, just relocating).
2) my annual take home income is ~$200kish. Little debt on a brand new truck but other than that, clean. No family of my own.
3) I'm a personal trainer in my free time. Would love to turn this property into a training studio. Potentially rent it out to other folks that need a training studio for their business as well. It's got like, big 4 rooms that could be fit for this purpose. It's zoned mixed use. They use it as both their gallery and living space right now.

I think I'd start by just ordering an inspection and appraisal just to see where we're at perhaps? Then, treat the $140k as a regular mortgage so they can pay off the loan and I can take advantage of great interest rates right now. But what about the rehab? And zoned mixed use implications of a property like this? Any advice here would be appreciated.

Thanks pals.",finance
personalfinance,Somehow I misrepresented myself on my Michigan unemployment claim and now they want me to pay it all back.,"I received a letter in the mail from the Michigan unemployment office. They claimed that I misrepresented myself on the states and federal pandemic unemployment assistance. They are giving me a window of 30 days to protest this determination or I’ll have to pay back $11,600 received between March to November of 2020.

The problem is, I have no idea what I did to misrepresent myself. When I called the hot line, the person I talked to informed me that “she is not allowed to explain the letters that I received” and “that I should read them carefully and submit a protest in response to the charge explained on the form that I do not understand. Which is extremely frustrating. So somehow I misrepresented myself in a combination of section 32a(2) and 62(b) Michigan Employment Security Act….. what ever that means.

Why would they approve my biweekly submissions to MARVIN (Michigan’s unemployment reporting program) and reward me money only to ask for it all back over a year later? Why didn’t they reject my application if there was something wrong with it?

I am only starting to find my self in some sort of financial stabilization since the forced lock downs due to COVID which resulted in my loss of job because my employer closed permanently. I think this will totally ruin me for years to come. I am already struggling to pay off the credit card debt that I got myself in because of my unemployment and the hardships of COVID.

Is this an issue others are struggling with too? How were they able to recover?

Some facts about my financial situation. Starting in December of 2020 I was hired for a position that pays $22/hr. For the first few months they were only able to hire me for part time. Now I am still technically working part time but I am working closer to 32 hrs per week.

My current rent is $900 per month. My health insurance is like $250 per month. Car insurance is $135 per month.

I have about $9500 in credit card debt split between 2 cards

I am not sure how much I am spending on groceries and other house expenses.

I am 31 years old.

I am applying for a second job so I can earn a little bit more money.

I have about 15K saved in a Roth IRA. Can they come after that?

Thanks in advance for any and all help.",finance
personalfinance,do personal loan interest rates function the same way as CC rates?,"Any other tips welcome but basically my main problem is are the interest rates that I've gotten myself stuck into. The initial problem was money management and just over spending, but now the balance on my cards are just stuck in a loop where I'm only affording to pay off just barely more than the interest I'm accruing each month. I hate even the thought of loans but is this my best option since the interest rates are lower than my CC rates? My thinking is if the interest is accruing in the same manner then the lower rate would be cheaper in the long run. If I can clean out the CC debt then I would be spending less on interest and have more to pay down my overall debt. I'm generally good with the math of it but can never remember the different ways they are calculating the interest. My thought process is, because of the situation of only paying CC interest and minimal balance, it might take me longer than 5 years to pay off everything, or at least 5 years of interest at a higher rate than a loan rate. If the loan rate is shorter than the time it would take to pay down everything wouldn't it be cheaper in the long run?",finance

Bitcoin,"3 Major Attacks on Bitcoin This Year, And We're Still Crushing every Other Investment on Earth","1. China Full Ban, forcing a miner migration that should have hurt the global network, but didn't
2. ""The Infrastructure Bill"" written by central banksters, for the central banksters, legislation that includes a provision that creates new reporting requirements for many participants within the blockchain industry, designed to slow down adoption, public trust, and regulatory compliance.
3. SEC backs Futures ETFs and kills any Spot ETFs. Gary Gensler is clearly on the take, and is working for the central banksters on this one. He's not a very good liar. May be getting blackmailed, or just sold Bitcoin out for cash, but either way he is working against Bitcoin's best interests. Since this passed October 19th, Bitcoin has tanked, after the initial ETF investment spike.

*(Gensler may take a little more explanation. I think Gensler is compromised for many reasons, how he has stated the terms for a spot ETF, and the dozen companies that have applied have all failed to comply?  Not buying it. You think the banks want Bitcoin going over $200k this year, when they don't have much, and they have to get board approval to go deep on Bitcoin, and that can take another year or two? I don't think so.  they want to slow Bitcoin down the most, because they don't own it and can't compete with it.)*

(*""Being the head of the SEC is an appointed position, like being the Commissioner of the NFL. they installed Goodell as commish because they know he's look after the owners interests first, last, and always, not the fans, not the players. Gensler is in the same spot with the central banks. They run the SEC, just like they run The Fed. He knows who's paying his bills, and its not Bitcoin, you or I. Especially after the 2020 Election, you can think Washington is as clean and true as the driven snow if you want, but I see a swamp, and Gensler didn't get to the top without capitulating to someone. He answers to someone, and its not us, clearly. )*

(*He knows Bitcoin, which may make him a real asset to those who control him.  You may see him as an asset.  I see him as a liability. He wasn't voted in by the proletariat.  He was installed by a group, inside of Washington.  Big difference. He's not ""fighting the power"" in Washington. He's just another empty suit.  He's just one that understands Bitcoin, which may be a curse, for Bitcoin, as much as a gift. Just because he understands Bitcoin doesn't mean he puts Bitcoin above the interest of his superiors. If you think he's really looking after your best interest, not Wall Street. then so is Biden. To each his own. That's what I see.  It's way too easy to pay him off, or pull his strings, then to allow a decentralized asset to run wild against Wall Streets interests. Futures ETfs acts like a parachute, slowing Bitcoin growth down.  Who does that help?  You or the banks?)*

Any one of these would destroy a lesser crypto, but all this can do is slow Bitcoin down, to an extent.  Still up over 65% this year, but with this much headwind, Bitcoin wasn't allowed to operate in a free market in 2021. These were all done deliberately to slow Bitcoin's growth and value.

Bitcoin is up 65%, when the S&amp;P is half that, Gold and Silver are down for the year, Apple is at 38%, moving up based on inflation, not value.  Same for Tesla, up 39% in 2021. Bitcoin is crushing the established market players, and this year isn't over yet.  There's one more run coming.

The good news is Bitcoin is still growing at a healthy rate, exchanges are seeing supply shrink, and next year, there will be plenty of SEC filing from top corporations and brands revealing their Bitcoin stacks, spurring another round of bull runs for 2022.  This will happen in Q1 of ever year, so don't get used to the outdated idea of Bitcoin winters.  Bitcoin has evolved past that part of its growth curve.",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,I don't understand why people sell Bitcoins for Inflated $Dollars?,"Inflation is 8% now. Some say its much higher than this. 

Bitcoin is deflationary so why people take risk of selling bitcoins for possible hyperinflated $dollars Jack Dorcey said? 

If Fed don't raise interest rates high enough to tame inflation then inflations gets out of control right?

Why the DXY Dollar index is performing well in a high inflationary environment? Is it because the other  fiat currencies compared to the dollar are much worse and more devalued than the $dollar?

If bitcoin goes to $100k next month and we sell at the top at $100k and 2 weeks later the $dollar collapses loses value then the sellers are screwed right? Can the collapse of the dollar cancel the bear market following the $100k top?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Digital nomad and California tax,"Hi, sorry if something like this has been asked before.

I'm sort of a digital nomad in that I work for a tech company but don't really have any set roots. I was hoping for some guidance on how to file my taxes.

I moved from Canada to California for a full time job at the end of 2019. The pandemic began soon after and I left California.

**2019**

* My W-2 for the 2019 tax year states my income as being from California.
* I worked in California for around two months, having just moved to the US.
* I haven't filed any US federal or state taxes for the 2019 tax year yet (my employer overpaid).

**2020**

* My W-2 for the 2020 tax year states my income as being from California.
* I lived in California for around 5.5 months cumulatively and left in June 2020.
* I lived in Canada for around 3.5 months.
* I lived in New York for around 1.5 month.
* I lived in Washington for around one month.
* My company overpaid CA state taxes and so I didn't feel pressured into filing my state taxes at the time and so I haven't filed any state taxes for the 2020 tax year.

**2021**

* My W-2 for the 2021 tax year still states my income as being from California.
* I've been living in Washington since the beginning of the year.
* HR has given me the option of changing my work location to WA. I'm waiting to hear back whether this will apply retroactively for the whole 2021 tax year and if it does, I might push to ask whether they could change it for 2020 too.

**My personal ties**

* I was living in temporary housing when I was in California (with family, airbnb, etc.) and did not sign any leases.
* I used my cousin's mailing address in California for: my bank, my cell phone bill, the address my workplace had for me
* Other than my SSN and my visa, I have no federal or state level ID.
* I am not an American citizen.
* When I moved to Washington, I continued living in temporary housing but recently signed a lease with my name on it (2021 fall).

**Questions**

* Do I have enough of a basis to be considered a part year resident for 2020 be able to request a refund for the second half of 2020, assuming that my employer can not retroactively change my work address?
* The above question, but assuming that my employer is able to retroactively change my work location to not be California.
* Same as the above two questions, but for the 2021 tax year.

I've been living in Washington for longer than I've lived in California, so if my employer is able to retroactively change my work address for 2021 at least, it would feel unreasonable for California to take a cut for this year. I'm not too optimistic about getting money back from 2020, but 2021 feels more possible.

I'll probably talk to a tax consultant soon, but wanted to see what the community here had to say first.

Thanks for reading this long post.

EDIT: the reason why I didn't update payroll as soon as I left California was that my employer has only recently allowed us to change our work location. We were allowed to change our physical address, but our work location was still tied to California.",finance

**TLDR**:

In conclusion, risk analysis of DeFi protocols is a very complex process as the areas of risk exposure are very different and often interfere with each other. For example, a protocol that allows more freedom in governance will attract investors who want to make the most out of being able to cast their votes on a wide variety of factors, but it will also be subject to more volatility in changes and be undesirable to another group of investors who want to hold the tokens for stability in asset value. Thus, we have to be clear of our purpose first, and then make the relevant analysis and comparison across protocols.

&amp;#x200B;

 

# General Conclusion

Risk is one of the most prominent issues in traditional financial markets. In particular, risk helps investors to quantify a specific number representing an asset value, in order to assess whether that level of risk is acceptable.

In DeFi, however, risk is often undervalued as the majority of participants do not fully appreciate it. Several lending/borrowing protocols are at the forefront of this field when it comes to assessing the risk of an asset. In other protocols we rarely see full consideration of risk.

In this article, we will introduce the concept of systematic risk (generalised) from traditional markets to DeFi.

# What Is Systematic Risk?

Assuming you invest in a single asset, what is the source of risk for this ""portfolio""?

We can say that there are two common sources of uncertainty:

1. Risks arise from overall economic conditions, such as business cycles, inflation, interest rates and exchange rates. These economic factors are difficult to predict with certainty and all affect the return on assets.
2. Risk comes from the asset itself (specificity). For example, is the government controlling the asset or is their direct demand for it, etc. These factors affect one asset but do not affect other assets.

Now we look at the ""portfolio"" of even more assets (a diversification strategy), asking the same question, what about portfolio risk?

Diversifying multiple asset classes spreads the risk of the entire portfolio. The ability to decrease the value of one asset provides the ability to increase the value of another asset. These effects will offset and stabilise the return on the entire portfolio and portfolio volatility will continue to decrease.

However, even if we hold a certain amount of assets (e.g. &gt;1000 assets), we still cannot avoid risk completely, because almost all assets are affected by factors such as general macro factors. For example, if all assets held are affected by the business cycle, then we cannot avoid business cycle risk no matter how many assets we hold.

&gt;This risk that persists even after diversification is called market risk, which is associated with sources of market-wide risk. Such risk is also known as systematic risk, or non-diversifiable risk.

*Note: Risk that can be eliminated by diversification is called unique risk, nonsystematic risk, or diversifiable risk.*",cryptocurrency

gaming,Legends: Arceus wishlist,"Hi everyone, this will be my first post on this subreddit and in it, i will talk about my hopes and what i wish for in pokemon legends arceus:

\-A new evolution for spinda (or hisuian form, but preferably a new evolution)

\-Celebi event. I love Celebi and considering this game takes place in the past, Celebi would fit i think

\-A new type. I thought long and hard for this, but I think having the computer type would work. It could be super effective against psychic types because computers are smarter than people, and weak to bug because computers get viruses

\-Remove the grass type. I know hisuian voltorb is grass type, but i HATE the grass type and i think it should be removed. Maybe they can explain it by saying ""oh this game takes place in the past before grass types were real"" also they can change it before the game comes out so dont worry

\-More dragon type pokemon. I think they need to be able to fly in the game to be able to be a dragon. Maybe youre character can learn how to fly, and battle dragon in the sky. Like deoxy

\-Remove the save feature. This would make the game much harder, i feel like if you play the game and then save and turn it off, it would ruin the difficulty of these games. I think you shouldnt have the option to save at all, so then it feels much more risky when you play and you have a chance to lose all your progress

\-Warrior cats refrence. I am a HUGE warrior cats fan, so i think pokemon should refrence them by havinf different warrior cats show up (not too obvious, but maybe have different cat pokemon show up and make them talk like in warrior cats)

\-Undertale refrences. I am also a fan of undertale, maybe have a secret trainer called Asgore, and he uses alot of steel type pokemon and dark type pokemon and ghost type pokemon like Salamence

\-Every pokemon should be able to learn dragon dance. Dragon dance is super strong i want more pokemon to learn it. So far not many strong pokemon learn it. Also it would make weak pokemon better like garchomp (whihc brings me to my next point)

\-Buff a bunch of weaker pokemon. ALOT of pokemon are weak like garchomp, silvally, scizor, greninja and morpeko. I think they need to be buffed. Maybe mack garchomp a legendary and remove gible and gabite. (actually we seen garchomp on the first trailer, maybe they are hinting that they removed gable)

\-Please remove levels. Sometimes i think it is hard to train pokemon and i hate battling trainers and wild pokemon. I think to remove the levels will be a good idea. That way i dont have to worry about training and can just play instead, and make the game fun for once

\-Ability to connect with pokemon black/white/black2/white2. I have my ds with pokemon white 2 and i think it would be cool to connect with those games to trade so i can use kyurem in my game. I think it could work because all you need to do is create a trading room in the game, and maybe the can update black and white to connect with legends arceus (which would be really easy)

\-Add real life music. I know pokemon has their own music, but i think it would be cool if they add music from real people, like kanye, ed sheeran, post malone, and justin beiber

\-Gen 9. Have gen 9 be the post game. That also could work because it would be really easy for them to add it. Like when you finish the game, you can have an option on the start screen that sayd ""would you like to play gen 9 now, yes or no"" (also this wouldnt be too hard to add into the game because it can just be some extra code. and i tried some coding before, and i think i know how they can add gen 9)

Anyways, this was my wishlist for pokemon legends arceus. I have faith that pokemon would implement these, especially if they read my list becaue i think my ideas are actually really good. And i spoke with my friends. and they said they liked my ideas and that pokemon would suck if they dont add these, which i believe them honestly.",technology
personalfinance,Tax refund check much bigger than expected,"Hi. I filed 2020 taxes in October. I got my federal refund deposited and then a check from my state tax board (California).

personalfinance,"I-Bonds, do the real math before committing","Lots of chatter about I-bonds at &gt;7% as a replacement for your HYSA and/or Emergency Fund. While it may be a good tool for some, be careful. 

If you think inflation is here to stay and you plan to leave your cash in I-bonds for well over a year, it may make sense. 

However, if you think you found a new HYSA, you did not. 

1. Your money is locked for a year. 
2. If you pull out your money in under 5 years, you lose 3 months of interest. 

Quick math for someone trying to make a quick buck. 

Let’s say I pull out my cash after a year. You lose 3 months of interest and now you are at 5.25%. Not bad, right? Wrong. You get taxed at federal rates (let’s say 32%). That shaves off another third. 

Now you are left at 3.5% gains for the year. Not terrible, but not good. If my money is locked up for a year I would want more than 3.5%. 

Do your math, but I-bonds may not make sense for you.

Edit: Appreciate all the comments. I did some more learning and due diligence and made a shift in thinking and strategy, largely due to some of the comments here. So thanks!

I began shifting $ from my EF to I-Bonds. We can do up to 30k a year, so will likely due a quick back to back in Dec. and January for a total of 60k, which is our full EF. 

For the next 12 month we will drop to 3 months (30k) in our current HYSA EF just to cover our bases in case we need liquidity and then invest the 30k. Credit line and Muni’s in our taxable can be a second tier in a true expensive emergency. 

If and when interest rates in our HYSA return better rates than I-Bonds we will consider switching back. Think INGDirect in the good old days.",finance
personalfinance,20 v 30 year mortgage,"I’m in the process of purchasing my second home and I’m debating whether to do a 20 or 30 year mortgage. With my 1st home, I did a 15 year and paid it off in 5 years (but it was a small mortgage and a modest home). My BIL says I think about money all wrong - especially with the low interest rates.

If I do a 20 year mortgage, my payment would be about $1075 at 2.7% int - so I’d pay a little over $50k in interest over the loan if I paid the regular payments over the full 20 years.

If I did a 30 year, my payment would be $850 at 3.1% int, paying over $100k in interest over the life of the loan.

My BIL suggests I take the $225 difference I’d get by doing the 30 year and invest that in an IRA - he thinks even if I get a 5% return on that over the 30 years, I’m still going to make more money than by just trying to pay off the mortgage faster.

personalfinance,"Advice on Student Loans (53k Principal, ~13k Interest)","Hello all,

At 25, I've come to terms that my financial habits over the past year has been dismal and I wanted some advice on how to tackle my $53K student loan.  I am finishing up a Masters program by this upcoming summer and apparently, my first ""required"" payment won't be until 2024 (Idk why this is, could be an error)?  Does this mean technically no interest until 2024?

Anyway here are the numbers:

* Salary for the foreseeable future: $100k
* Interest rates:  One loan at 5.3% and the rest are sub 4.5%, a few under 4%
* Rent: Living at home w/ the rents rn so none
* Car: $400/mo

I guess my main question is how much of my income should go towards the loans and how much should go towards investments/retirement?  I really, really wanted to do some trading (Covered Calls mainly) with my new cashflow, but at the same time I realized that F THESE LOANS lol.

I've also been banking on some loan forgiveness because I don't essentially want to throw out money in case it does happen, but I have no idea how realistic this is. Some advice/insights would be nice.  Thanks :)

personalfinance,Seeking investment advice after completing emergency fund,"Hello everyone, I created a throw away account just for this. I'm seeking some financial advice on what to invest my money on after having my emergency fund ready.

I'm 30 years old, single and live in a state with no state tax and mid to high cost of living, no dependents.  This is a break down of my assets:

Salary: 87,000 a year, my weekly take home after health insurance, 401, and federal taxes is $1,190. I should be getting a nice raise in the next few weeks, so my salary could be around $100,00.

401k: $9,000, I put 5%. My company matches %50 up to %4.                                                                                                                                                                        

Roth IRA: $18,000

Savings/Checking account: $10,000

Emergency fund in a HYSA: $25,000

Debt: $0

My monthly expenses:

Rent: $500, shared with roommates. I expect this to stay the same for the next 2-3 years, after that rent will go up a lot, probably triple. I might get my own place in 5 years or so.

Car payment: $269, Car insurance: $180, Gas: \~$50

Gym: $32

Electricity/internet: \~$70

Phone: $97

Groceries/eating out: \~$300

Fun money: \~$300

Roth IRA: $500

Subscriptions(spotify etc): $50

Total expenses: \~$2300 when you include the IRA(not sure if that's an expense, but I treat it as one). So my left over money in a year is around $35,000 or \~$675 a week.

In general I'd say my finances are in decent shape, and I work in a sector where I get raises or can change jobs for a bigger salary kinda often, so my salary should increase a lot in the next 5 years or so, maybe to something like $125k to $150k.

Some specific questions I have:

1- Is my emergency fund too big, should I take some of that money and invest it somewhere else? I was furloughed because of COVID last year and having a good emergency fund gave me such a big peace of mind, but at the same time inflation is so high right now lol.

2- After having an EF and maxing out your IRA the next step seems to be to put more money in your 401k, but the thing is the one my company offers is actively managed and from what I've read these seem to be worse than the passively managed ones, my 401K is with PIMCO RealPath Blend target fund 2055, what do you guys think about this, should I put more money towards it or invest somewhere else?

3- I've been thinking of opening an individual investment account and invest in some ETFs, is this a good idea, if so which ETFs do you recommend?

Bitcoin,Will Bitcoin always be volatile?,"I've been hearing that as the market cap increases, the volatility will decrease. It's probably already happening.

But the other day I was watching one of Peter McCormack's videos where he was interviewing a VC and the VC said Bitcoin will always be volatile, because it has a fixed supply. He called it a rigid monetary policy, and said fiat is stable because the central bank controls the supply. I understand that when the price rises, the central bank can print more money to bring the price down; and when the price goes down, it somehow 'sequesters' it to bring it up? (although I'm not sure what such sequestration would look like? does it have anything to do with bonds?). So he essentially says interventionism is needed to keep the price stable; an idea I don't particularly like.

Another thing with Bitcoin is that a lot of it is in the hands of a small number of whales, who can manipulate the price. With fiat that's not the case, because no one wants to hold massive amounts of a deflationary currency with an unlimited supply. Since there is no such thing as voluntary fiat whales, the central bank / government can be that whale and have a monopoly on manipulation, for better or worse.

But I also suspect the relative stability of fiat is due to the fact we denominate the prices of goods and services in it. The value of a fiat currency can also swing a lot, e.g. when the BoE kept the interest rate unchanged in the November meeting, against expectations, GBP dropped against the other major currencies. But the prices of groceries etc. didn't change overnight. Prices lag behind for many reasons: it's not practical (and costly) for merchants to update them every day, they don't want to put their customers off, goods in retail were often bought in wholesale months earlier and can still be sold at a profit while stock lasts, some of the goods are domestic and some are imported, price control (e.g. rent control, energy prices caps). Also, employers generally only review their employees' salaries annually, only ever increase them and do so carefully, so they don't feel pressured by the market to decrease them when the currency strengthens, for which there would be no acceptance. Employees want predictability and don't want their wages to go up 5% one month and down 5% the next - so we give them seemingly constant wages, kind of sweeping the real volatility under the carpet and smoothing it out.

Bitcoin, on the other hand, is not used to denominate the prices of goods and services in; it's pretty much only traded on exchanges, so the prices can go up and down all they want and the people that feel the volatility's impact are generally not the kind of people that mind it.

If/when the world switches to the Bitcoin standard and everything is denominated in BTC, I suspect the same price lag effect will give it stability. But then, the world probably won't switch until BTC is already somewhat stable.

If we purchased a $500,000 house I would put 100k down and increase my EF to $40k from the proceeds from selling my current home.

If I purchased a home for 400 to 500k which is what is reasonable in my area, my monthly cash flow would meet our budget BUT would only allow me to continue to max my Roth and not save for college. If I stay I could max my Roth, contribute $400/month to 529 and have about $8000 in annual savings.

Bitcoin,Bitcoin will outperform the entire crypto space soon. Who else thinks this is a plausible theory.,"There are two types of people in this space, those here to change the world by supporting the advancement of sound money and sound finance for the modern age, and those that are trying to get rich quick.

I see so many people complain bitcoin was the worst performing crypto asset of 2021 and that has made them abandon bitcoin to spray 100 small bets at 100 different projects hoping to hit a 1000x return in a few months. They have left the mission of sound money to try and get rich quick.

What if this is a natural mechanism to separate the people that believe in sound money from the get rich quick crowd. Inflation is rising, Interest rates are rising, we are closer than ever to the start of the great global debt crisis of the 2020s. This will cause many asset classes that are reliant on debt and speculation to crash while sound money and scarce commodities rise. This would imply the speculative side of crypto would get hit hard along with bitcoin initially, but bitcoin being the hedge against a financial crisis that it is would eventually go on to become the single best performing asset on earth in the face of a financial crisis worse than 2008.

Everyone currently abandoning bitcoin for alts in order to try and get rich quick will get poor fast, and everyone who stayed true to the mission of sound money for the world will be on the right side of this trade. This is a natural mechanism that rewards those who believe in the mission of sound money and punishes those trying to use this space to just get rich quick.

MachineLearning,[R] Researchers Propose ‘ProxyFL’: A Novel Decentralized Federated Learning Scheme For Multi-Institutional Collaborations Without Sacrificing Data Privacy,"Tight rules generally govern data sharing in highly regulated industries like finance and healthcare. Federated learning is a distributed learning system that allows multi-institutional collaborations on decentralized data while also protecting the data privacy of each collaborator. Institutions in these disciplines are unable to aggregate and communicate their data, limiting research and model development progress. More robust and accurate models would result from sharing information between institutions while maintaining individual data privacy.

For example, in the healthcare industry, histopathology has undergone increasing digitization, providing a unique opportunity to improve the objectivity and accuracy of diagnostic interpretations through machine learning. The preparation, fixation, and staining techniques utilized at the preparation site, among other things, cause significant variation in digital photographs of tissue specimens. 

Because of this diversity, medical data must be integrated across numerous organizations. On the other hand, medical data centralization involves regulatory constraints as well as workflow and technical challenges, such as managing and distributing the data. Because each histopathology image is often a gigapixel file, often one or more gigabytes in size, the latter is very important in digital pathology.

Detailed rundown:

I am in the process of landing a job after a year of schooling/hiatus from office life. I have made less than federal poverty limits (allowing my health insurance), and am trying to figure out what would benefit me the most...

Do I pull my old HSA and Retirement accounts and shuck them at my student loans along with the bulk of my savings account, and have my student loans paid in full by estimated April of next year, and then save for a down payment on a house with the remaining months, or do I leave my HSA and Retirement accounts alone and spend the next year and a half paying off my student loans? I should be able to pay $1000/mo on my minimum new salary, with a goal of $1.5-2k actual (depending on life).

I'm nowhere near retirement age, so I would be taking a penalty to pull any of that money out.

And I might end up taking an additional penalty to pay back my health insurance, which has covered me for free all year.

So... what would be better for me? Estimating health insurance would require a payback of $1.2k-2.4k max for the year...

I guess it makes sense since other countries don't want to be subject to the mistakes of one single government; one who is more than happy to print at will, impose sanctions or seize funds. You have to take into account that the U.S federal government has been known for weaponizing the Dollar throughout its history.

But it's not like other countries have such a good reputation with the way they manage their own central banks. Being irresponsible with how you print money or completely fuck up your currency is not the sole domain of the U.S

But now that the USD is losing global dominance maybe we could go two ways; A world where countries have their own CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies) and its business as usual but in digital form, or one were we have a decentralized global crypto standard (with countries moving reserves to Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc and accepting them as legal tender) Maybe both things could take place? What do you think?",cryptocurrency

stocks,Corsair Gaming (CRSR): Intrinsic Valuation Analysis,"Growth has underperformed value stocks over the last year due to inflation concerns. This has presented buying opportunities for those who want to add to their boomer portfolios for the long-term. I've decided to analyze companies that are down 50%+ from their 52-week highs.

**Company Overview**

Founded in 1994, Corsair Gaming Inc. (“Corsair” or the “Company”) provides gear for gamers and content creators. The Company designs and sells gaming and streaming peripherals, components and systems globally. Corsair operates through two segments: Gamer and Creator peripherals, and Gaming components and systems. To increase brand loyalty and repeat purchases, the Company has 2 proprietary software platforms: iCUE for Gamers and Elgato for Content Creators.

With many of Corsair’s products maintaining a number one US market share position, its brand, scale and global reach provide significant competitive advantages and allows the company to continue to capture a growing share of the rapidly expanding gaming and streaming market, estimated at over $36.0 billion in 2019.

Corsair leverages its scale and operations to acquire and integrate complementary brands and businesses into its portfolio, completing 6 acquisitions since 2018. Notable acquisitions include Elgato, Origin PC, SCUF Gaming, EpocCam, and Gamer Sensei.

*Historical Revenue, EBITDA, and EBITDA Margins. 2021E - 2025E based on my own assumptions*

Sales growth from 2018 - 2019 was 17.03%, and increased by 55.16% in 2020 due to increased demand, consumer sentiment, and better margins. Over the historical period, gross margins increased from 20.55% to 27.34% and EBITDA margins increased from 6.22% to 11.84%. Net Income and Earnings per share had a significant increase primarily due to strong top-line revenue growth, gross margin expansion in both segments, expanding EBITDA with low capital expenditures, an asset light business model, and investing to consolidate market leadership.

**Q3 2021 Results**

* Corsair gained market share in almost every category through Q3 2021
* Q3 Revenue was impacted by availability of reasonably priced GPUs which curtailed the demand for new PC builds and its components
* Higher logistics costs including ocean and air freight had an impact on Q3 margins resulting in Gross Profit Margin of 25.9%
* Gaming Components and Systems segment was impacted by GPU shortages which caused retail prices to surge to 150%+ of MSRP causing many customers to hold off building a performance gaming PC
* Gamer and Creator Peripherals segment was impacted by IC shortages which caused Corsair’s premium high value products to be in limited supply. Additionally, Gross Profit Margins were impacted by increased logistics costs as well as some reduced sales in premium products
* Company refinanced LT Debt, increased revolver size, and reduced the interest rate to LIBOR + 125.0 bps

**Preliminary Risks**

* Corsair’s competitive position and success in the market depend upon the ability to build and maintain the strength of its brand among gaming enthusiasts
* Long term success and company growth depend heavily on continuous development and improvement of existing and new products
* The Company depends on the introduction and success of third-party high performance computer hardware including GPUs, CPUs, and sophisticated new video games to drive sales of its products
* Industry is highly competitive and Corsair faces intense competition for market share
* Sales depends on the growth of gaming, streaming, and eSports industries

**DCF Valuation**

[https://imgur.com/a/ZzXmFOh](https://imgur.com/a/ZzXmFOh)

*Base Case DCF Valuation: $28.72 / share*

*Winter's Opinion Case DCF Valuation: $42.58 / share*

Winter's Assumptions: Revenue Growth of 13.0% / 20.0% / 17.5% / 17.5% / 15.0% in projected years, EBITDA Margin 11.0% to 12.5% in projected years, Cost of Equity 10%, Terminal Value EBITDA Exit Multiple 10x (used EBITDA given CapEx estimates), $20.0MM growth capex per year, effective tax rate of 17.4%

* Commentary: Conservative growth estimates based on management expectations and industry growth. Supply chain disruptions should begin to decrease throughout 2022 and its likely GPUs and other systems will have pent-up demand over the next few quarters. The company should see a bullwhip effect in sales growth and a decrease in operating costs moving forward. Increase in stay-at-home lifestyle due to Covid-19 should help sustain sales for years to come.

**Public Comps Analysis**

Competitors: Logitech, Turtle Beach, Dell Technologies, HP Inc.

Based on Multiples (EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, Price/Earnings), CRSR share price ranges from $17.40 to $32.30 with an average estimated share price of $23.31

**Outlook and Final Thoughts**

Based on my intrinsic valuation, I believe Corsair is valued at $32.95 (average est. share price of DCF/Comps). Corsair closed at $21.17 on 12.10.2021, representing a 55% discount to my valuation. I think that Corsair is undervalued and selling at a discount. Growth stocks will continue to face problems based on inflation risk until supply chain issues are resolved. The share price may remain volatile in the coming weeks or months. I think this is a good stock to own if you're a strong believer in the gaming industry for the long term and believe that Corsair can continue to capture market share through marketing efforts and quality products.

So basically I'm trying to find a place to stay, I've been skimming around reddit searching for similar experiences of mine so I can get an idea. I've read the possibility of renting a room, a studio, someone even said that they rented an office and snuck out every day at 6am when they woke up and when that ended, they rented a garage until their business started becoming successful, I thought that was pretty interesting. I wouldn't even mind living in a car to be honest, I feel like I can make that work with a gym membership to shower and go to the bathroom, I'm frugal on spending money so I feel like that's a good trait to have for this case. 

Basically where I'm at is I go to community college right now about to finish my first semester in 2 days, I was working this temporary job that paid $27/hr which was a blessing to say the least and saved up after like 12 shifts. I had to spend a couple to help my family out but now I'm sitting at $2.5k. This is very low in my opinion but my plan was to finish the semester off and then start working again so I applied to a couple full time jobs, I don't even have a credit card so I'm trying to apply for that right now and I'm going to have a couple of months to save up and build my credit score. I live in SoCal and everything here is so expensive. 

I'm just so lost right now to be honest, it's like I have an idea but I really don't at the same time, I don't know where I'm going to live, I don't know what I'm going to do, I don't know the estimates of having to pay everything by myself.

*Essentially, 20% of the world lives in a country where inflation is higher than 10%.* 

This is primarily because governments are either corrupt or lack the ability to manage their own currency. Simply, many govts around the world are capable of running their own monetary policy.

Bitcoin,Great Protocol Politics : How The Future Belongs To Bitcoin,"In a pair of recent essays, political scientist [Ian Bremmer](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/world/2021-10-19/ian-bremmer-big-tech-global-order) contends that Big Tech companies will reshape the global order, while FP columnist [Stephen Walt](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/11/08/big-tech-wont-remake-the-global-order/)’s  friendly rejoinder is that states will remain predominant. We take a  third view: Not only has technology already changed the global order,  but it is also changing the nature of both companies and states  themselves. The 21st century belongs not to China or the United  States—nor to tech companies as traditionally understood. It belongs to  the internet.

This is true for many reasons, of which perhaps the most important is  the rise of decentralized protocols like Bitcoin and Ethereum that are  controlled by neither states nor companies. To Bremmer’s credit, he does  mention them, but he still underrates their importance. Many of the  global technology firms’ weaknesses both he and Walt discuss—that  they’re typically domiciled in the United States or China, that they  rely on those jurisdictions for contract enforcement, that they don’t  have a state’s political legitimacy, and that their exercise of power  has already caused a global backlash—are addressed by the introduction  of crypto protocols, which can safeguard property and execute contracts  beyond the boundaries of traditional nation states.

But technology’s challenge to traditional geopolitics goes beyond  crypto protocols, tech companies, and even digital space itself, as it  has begun reshaping the physical world. Here are 10 ways in which we are  transitioning from an age of geopolitics to one of technopolitics. 

#### 1. Network proximity is now on par with physical geography

Traditional geopolitics of the [Mackinder school of thought](https://americandiplomacy.web.unc.edu/2000/02/mackinders-world/)  concerns itself with the eternal location of territorial powers. Russia  and Japan might have different ideologies over time, but their  geography remains constant—or so the argument goes.

However, the internet is adding a new dimension to this. It is not  merely a passive data layer that states enable and contest but a new  kind of geography comparable in scope to the physical world. Think of it  as a digital Atlantis—a new continent floating in the cloud where old  powers compete and new powers arise. Within this cloud continent, the  unit of distance between two people is not the travel time between their  positions on the globe but rather the degrees of separation in their  social networks.

This means anyone can put themselves near anyone else by simply  following them on social networks or keep others away by blocking their  accounts on those same networks—no plane ticket required. Any floating  entity within this cloud continent can likewise attempt to interact with  any other by pinging the right IP addresses, for the purpose of  anything from transactions to cyber invasions—no preexisting proximity  required.

Every citizen of the old world, provided they have internet access,  can simply become a citizen of the new by telecommuting via their  screens to spend a few hours in the cloud each day, as billions of  people routinely do—no physical immigration required. Encryption serves  as the digital equivalent of physical fortifications in the cloud,  allowing any user to defend their digital property without resorting to  traditional munitions—no physical force required.

Bottom line: Network proximity is now on par with physical geography,  and basic geopolitical assumptions about citizenship, migration, power  projection, and the use of force need to be rethought for the digital  world.  
 

#### 2. National currencies will face digital monetary competition

Think about what happened with newspapers: First, they all went  online. Then, Google News indexed them all. Last, local papers found  that their geographic monopolies had evaporated now that it was no  longer necessary to distribute physical newspapers via trucks.

A similar fate will befall national currencies. Already, national  currencies compete with cryptocurrencies because individuals and  institutions hold digital wallets filled with various assets that can be  traded against one another. This will only accelerate once central bank  digital currencies (CBDCs) are introduced. Every asset will be traded  against every other asset in a gigantic table we call the “defi matrix”  (defi is short for decentralized finance), including CBDCs themselves.

We are about to enter an age of global monetary competition, where  national currencies must earn their place in someone’s wallet portfolio  every hour of every day, even among citizens of their own countries. The  digital version of the Japanese yen will be plunged into head-to-head  global competition with the Swiss franc, the Brazilian real, and any  other asset with an open capital account, including Bitcoin. Everyone  becomes a foreign-exchange trader, all the time, and only the best  national currencies—or cryptocurrencies—are ever held by anyone.

Rather than the current environment of unchecked inflation and  competitive devaluation, the defi matrix imposes a new kind of  discipline on national currencies, as billions of people make individual  choices regarding which currencies to hold—or not hold.

#### 3. The remote economy has created a talent market for citizens

Walt asserts that because proponents of stateless digital  techno-utopias still need to live somewhere, a state ultimately has  control over them. But in a competitive marketplace of jurisdictions  where somewhere can be anywhere, no single government has as much  authority as people think.

Places as varied as Estonia, New Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan,  Portugal, the United Arab Emirates, and Chile are all vying for newly  mobile talent through “nomad visas” and other similar programs. After  all, many aspects of life are already in the cloud (like email,  education, and e-commerce) and many others are partially digitized (like  finance and foreign incorporation). Government is what economist Mancur  Olson famously termed a “[stationary bandit](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2938736),” extracting rents in exchange for providing benefits.

But so long as people can afford to or are allowed to leave, they  have more options than ever for a more hospitable host state. Just ask  the [9 million](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/18/the-top-reason-why-americans-abroad-want-to-dump-their-citizenship.html) American expatriates scattered around the globe, a figure that has doubled over the past decade. The [Great Migration](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/10/09/parag-khanna-move-book-excerpt-immigration-economy/) is on.

#### 4. Bits are finally reshaping atoms

Over the last decade, entrepreneur [Peter Thiel](https://www.forbes.com/sites/richkarlgaard/2011/12/21/is-technological-progress-slowing-down/?sh=537c9c164b45), developer [J. Storrs Hall](https://rootsofprogress.org/where-is-my-flying-car), and economist [Tyler Cowen](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Stagnation-Low-Hanging-Eventually-eSpecial-ebook/dp/B004H0M8QS)  made compelling cases that digital technology had advanced while  physical technology remained stagnant. But if we think about drones,  robotics, self-driving cars, brain-machine interfaces, vaccine  passports, gene-editing tools like CRISPR, and mRNA vaccines—as well as  the return of nuclear power, the space race, and supersonic  aircraft—we’re finally seeing a reinvigoration of innovation in the  physical world. Once something works online, it can be printed out  anywhere and scaled faster than ever before.

This is why Walt’s argument that states necessarily control the  “physical environment”—a concept known as “territoriality”—may not  actually hold: A government that doesn’t understand the digital may not  be able to control the physical. Less capable states will attempt to  maintain control by making futile, reactionary attempts to regulate  emerging physical technologies back into the garage from whence they  came while more capable jurisdictions will embrace them.

In other words, it’s short-sighted to think technology will remain  indefinitely confined to the digital realm. States will need to reinvent  themselves as masters of new technologies, both digital and physical—or  fall behind and witness their best citizens leave for jurisdictions  that do.

#### 5. Cloud-based regulators are outcompeting state-based regulators

Traditional taxi regulators might do cursory inspections of medallion  holders. But they do not regulate their drivers as aggressively as  Uber, Lyft, Grab, [Gojek](https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/indonesian-goto-group-raises-over-1-3b-in-its-first-close-of-pre-ipo/#:~:text=GoTo%20Group%20claims%20that%20it,than%202%25%20of%20Indonesia's%20GDP.),  and DiDi do. That is, they do not GPS track every ride, ensure both  driver and rider can complete a transaction, record star ratings from  both parties, and use the full panoply of tools available to a modern  “cloud regulator.”

In a real sense, these tech companies are more modern regulators than  the paper-based models of the 20th century. As such, they’ve suffered  significant backlash from legacy actors that want to preserve their  control over the system, perhaps best exemplified by [ongoing attempts](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-battle-continues-prop-22-struck-5046989/)  to legislatively squash the square peg of the 21st-century sharing  economy into the round hole of 20th-century lifetime employment.

This will prove a rearguard action, however.

First, these companies are, in important instances, already achieving  state ends faster than the state. For example, GoTo Group, parent  company of the ride-sharing service Gojek, now powers more than [2 percent](https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/indonesian-goto-group-raises-over-1-3b-in-its-first-close-of-pre-ipo/#:~:text=GoTo%20Group%20claims%20that%20it,than%202%25%20of%20Indonesia's%20GDP.)  of Indonesia’s over $1 trillion GDP, creating millions of jobs and  bringing nearly 2 billion annual transactions into the taxable formal  economy. This gives Gojek a massive base of public support.

Second, these companies won’t remain companies forever—they’ll be  phased out by protocols that split the upside with their users. From a  political standpoint, anti-technology activists have only been able to  muster [slim and contentious](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-battle-continues-prop-22-struck-5046989/) margins of support for new regulations because [app workers](https://rein.pk/replacing-middle-management-with-apis) did not profit as much from the rise of the sharing economy as app developers—giving a wedge for class actions.

However, the next step is the full Web3-based decentralization of  online marketplaces and sharing economy services, which is already well  underway via peer-to-peer trading of cryptocurrencies (so-called [decentralized exchanges](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/dex/)).  These new forms of transnational regulation, where app users have a  stake—and a say—in how their platforms are run, will expand beyond  cryptocurrencies to the peer-to-peer exchange of other goods and  services over time.

Why? Because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was set up to  regulate Merck and Pfizer, not 1 million biohackers; the Federal  Aviation Administration was built for Boeing and Airbus, not 1 million  drone hobbyists; and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was  created to go after Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, not 1 million Web3  developers. The people running these institutions typically have career  tenure; they were not democratically elected and are [not easily fired](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/employee-relations/reference-materials/douglas-factors.pdf). They are thus not obviously accountable to the public they claim to serve.

Crypto protocols, by contrast, allow millions of active  participants—both customers and producers—in a market to develop  decentralized regulatory [mechanisms](https://consensys.net/blockchain-use-cases/decentralized-finance/) that avoid both the perils of [captured](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/nobel-economist-george-stigler-on-capture-theory-and-the-inevitability-of-businesses-seeking-regulation-and-tariffs/)  state regulators and corporate self-regulators. It is only a matter of  time before cloud-based entities emerge for decentralized regulation of  industries beyond cryptocurrencies. Importantly, these bodies will be  truly global and boundary-spanning, unlike today’s geographically  constrained national regulators.

#### 6. Property rights have become encryption

The state’s conception as the legitimate guardian of private property  extends back to at least philosophers Thomas Hobbes and John Locke. But  cryptocurrencies challenge this view as they establish a full-fledged  theory of digital property rights outside the state. A full exposition  of why this is the case would get technical, but in short: No amount of  violence can solve certain kinds of math problems, particularly those  devised for secure encryption.

When property becomes a password, all our intuitions change. Soviet Premier [Joseph Stalin](https://wordhistories.net/2019/08/23/how-many-divisions-pope/)  famously asked: “How many divisions has the Pope?” But in the age of  encryption, it’s not about how many divisions a state has to defend its  property. It’s about how much [long division](https://web.northeastern.edu/dummit/docs/cryptography_3_discrete_logarithms_in_cryptography.pdf) it would have to do to seize yours.

#### 7. International rule of law is becoming rule of code

After three decades of bombings and invasions, sanctions and  surveillance, the United States can no longer credibly claim to be the  impartial arbiter of a rules-based international order. Obviously, any  such rules are very clearly not applied to itself. Of course, China  can’t claim to be a defender of a rules-based order either.

Yet the goal itself is desirable—small countries would prefer some  kind of order rather than being at the mercy of one power (the United  States) that gives international rule of law only lip service and  another power (China) that doesn’t even do that.

For this, at least in the commercial realm, we believe they will  increasingly turn to what we call “rule of code.” Whether Democrat or  Republican, Chinese or American, the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains  are the same for all and treat all the same. Intellectual property is  already being codified on blockchain ledgers, beginning with nonfungible  tokens, bringing transparency to what has been a fragmented legal  process.

Property rights themselves can be digitized through geographic  information system (GIS) mapping and land cadastration (surveying and  parceling of property), eroding the bureaucratic opacity that favors  predatory governments. And rather than subject themselves to  expropriation risks, investors could demand governments put up  collateral codified in smart contracts that would be forfeited in  default.

We are still in the early days, but enforceable international law may  become synonymous with decentralized smart contracts, at least in the  context of international trade. And beyond trade, crypto protocols  provide [transnational protection](https://bariweiss.substack.com/p/is-bitcoin-anarchy-or-civilization)  for civil liberties like freedom of speech and privacy. This is not yet  the entirety of what the rules-based order purports to protect, but the  ability to guarantee free speech and free markets to anyone with an  internet connection is a major step forward.

#### 8. Web3 is addressing global inequality by sharing the reward—and the risk

While physician and professor [Hans Rosling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVimVzgtD6w)  and others have documented how global inequality is actually falling,  the issue remains a hot topic for Western countries, which have seen  their net worth remain stagnant even as others (particularly countries  in Asia) rise.

The most promising way to resolve this may be via Web3 protocols,  which can be thought of as a variant of universal basic income that  splits the reward—and the risk—of building a giant tech service across  millions of volunteer asset holders. Put another way, if the roughly $5  trillion total market cap of Alphabet, Meta, Apple, Amazon, and  Microsoft were split across a billion users to give them around $5,000  each, they’d be much more supportive.

Most of the funding for Web3 protocols has not come from established  tech companies. Bitcoin was coded by a pseudonymous founder who took no  venture capital investment. Ethereum was started by a college dropout  who crowdfunded the start-up capital online. And with the rise of [decentralized finance](https://defipulse.com/),  there is now an incredible variety of financing mechanisms to allow  smart people with no money to find smart people with money to build  tools that allow all people to make money. And that is how Web3 may  accomplish what no antitrust action or arbitrary seizure could.

#### 9. Companies, cities, currencies, communities, and countries are all becoming networks

We used to think of books, music, and movies as distinct. Then they  all became represented by packets sent over the internet. Similarly,  today we think of stocks, bonds, gold, loans, and art as different. But  all of them are represented as debits and credits on blockchains.

We should start thinking of collections of people—whether  communities, cities, companies, or countries—as cohesive agents unto  themselves, less constrained by territoriality and with different layers  aligned with one another in shifting combinations. Physical governments  can, for example, integrate with digital networks, and companies can  run as apps on a city state’s dedicated blockchain.

El Salvador’s Bitcoin City, Wyoming’s decentralized autonomous  organization (DAO) law, and projects we’ve backed financially like  MiamiCoin and NYCCoin are early pieces of this future. In El Salvador,  President Nayib Bukele has put his country on the map by making Bitcoin a  [national currency](https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1402507224916836352) and is attracting global investment for a special economic zone he calls “[Bitcoin City](https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1463672975270498308).” In Wyoming, the new [DAO law](https://sos.wyo.gov/Business/Docs/DAOs_FAQs.pdf)  provides rules for fully digital vehicles to be put on an equal playing  field with legacy, paper-based corporations, thereby enabling many  corporate actions to be automated. And Miami Mayor [Francis Suarez](https://twitter.com/FrancisSuarez/status/1458861523678412810) and New York City Mayor-elect [Eric Adams](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-08/new-york-gets-own-cryptocurrency-after-adams-touts-bitcoin) have embraced the concept of City Coins, which give their citizens a digital currency that yields Bitcoin.

In each of these cases, cities and states are fusing with cryptocurrency networks to provide their citizens with new services.

#### 10. Power is decentralizing away from the United States and China

About [75 percent](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/) of the world’s population, more than [60 percent](https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/gdp_share/) of global GDP, and around [50 percent](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-26/the-geography-of-the-world-s-billionaires?sref=wAVxlDts)  of all billionaires are neither Chinese nor American. Those two  superpowers may well fight, but it’s not obvious if the rest of the  world will want to align with either party. Indeed, with the rise of  decentralized protocols, we anticipate that many states in the middle  may decide to use Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other chains for China- and  U.S.-resistant communication and financial transaction channels.

That is, in addition to building national stacks (data and app  ecosystems) for domestic transactions and communications, countries may  use neutral protocols for international transactions and communications.  This gives every country a choice: Rather than being forced to take  sides in a new Cold War, they can update the “Non-Aligned Movement” to  form an “[Aligned Movement](https://balajis.com/why-india-should-buy-bitcoin/#the-decentralized-movement),”  where they rally around their joint sovereign stakes in Web3 protocols  to facilitate cross-border trade. Early signs of this are already  visible with [Latin American](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1402279912623464458)  countries adopting Bitcoin. Not incidentally, such protocols will also  command the respect (and investment) of many millions of Chinese and  American citizens.

&amp;#x200B;

**Concluding Paragraph :**

Put all these pieces together, and rather than a unipolar Pax  Americana or a bipolar “New Cold War,” the future will be a  decentralized race to the top as countries, cities, companies, and  communities—physical and virtual—compete to attract talent and capital.  We do not argue that states are irrelevant; rather, they will be more  relevant if they embrace the arrow of history and work with the network  and less relevant if they attempt rearguard actions against it. Such is  the nature of great protocol politics.

What does that mean for the United States? Today, the United States  is experiencing a relative decline in strength across economic and  military axes. Its global role is more a function of its victories in  1945 and 1991 than its capabilities in 2021.

Yet precisely because it lacks the force to change this downward  trajectory overnight, it has more reason to support a decentralized  order, where societies and individuals freely choose to ally with  high-quality “Made in America” protocols—digital rules that bind others  just as they bind those in the United States or China. Reinforcing the  Biden administration’s “[Build Back Better](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/10/04/belt-and-road-initiative-bri-build-back-better-us-china-competition-west/)”  mantra, Web3 protocols could also reduce polarization and inequality by  giving citizens more of a stake in the system—as is already underway  with experiments in New York City, Miami, and Wyoming.

The United States could also continue on its current path and try to  fight China, Bitcoin, and the internet at the same time. But if it  chooses that route, to paraphrase Bremmer, the unrealistic utopians  wouldn’t actually be the technologists—they’d be the politicians.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Capital gains tax on primary residence owned less than two years? (North Carolina and federal),"Hello all,

I hope you had a great weekend!

I am having trouble finding this info via Google searches:

My husband and I have owned our home for just about a year and are planning to move next year for me to go to graduate school. Our current home is our first home and it is our primary residence. Are we required to pay capital gains simply because we have owned for less than two years, or are there other exceptions? Also, does North Carolina have state capital gains, and if so would we be required to pay those?

Any help is greatly appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Selling Stocks to Pay Off Student Loans,"My wife and I have been using the student loan forbearance period to not pay into her loans and increase her 401K contributions. She has approximately $40K in loans left. We are considering liquidating a portion of our brokerage account to simply avoid the $600 monthly payments that will start come February. If we do this, it would allow both myself and my wife to max out our 401Ks on a go-forward basis. I think this would be extremely valuable, as we are both 28 and have time on our side. Additionally, a market correction will likely be coming in the next couple years, so now would not be a bad time to pull out a small portion (would end up being ~15% of stock holdings in brokerage account).

Some numbers for context: $40K in outstanding student loans with a 6% interest rate; Wife has $25K in 401K, I have $100K. Current brokerage funds: $225K in stocks (VTSAX) and $60K in bonds (VWIUX- using this as a holding place for future down payment).",finance
personalfinance,Unmatched Teacher 403B can’t rollover?,"I’ve read through a lot of responses here. I currently have a Vanguard Roth IRA that I contribute my annual maximum to. I’m satisfied with its growth.

Additionally I’m a teacher with a 403B through Equitable (AXA) that I contribute through my paycheck as a pretax automatic deduction.

I’ve wanted to get out of it for a while, and after talking to my account manager he informed me that it’s a federal law that I cannot rollover my managed 403B into a different account unless it’s another employer account, I change districts, or I stop teaching.  I had a rollover IRA account all set, but now it seems I’m stuck with this?

If there is any way I can get my money away from this managed account and into my own hands WITHOUT having to leave my district, I’d love to know. If I’m stuck, I’m stuck I guess. If this is the millionth time this question has been asked I’m sorry.  I’m not asking if AXA 403Bs are bad, just how I can get away from mine.",finance
personalfinance,I have student loans. I went to grad school for a semester after graduating and changed my mind. Does my 6 month grace period reset?,"The title, mostly. I have a mix of private loans (Sallie Mae), Federal Subsidized Loans, and Federal Unsubsidized loans that got me through my bachelor program. Originally I was supposed to start paying this January, but I opted to withdraw after this semester as the interest on the debt was starting to make me nervous and I have a degree in Computer Science and Engineering and knew I could find a job with just a B.S. I also found that I REALLY did not like doing research (I was working with a cybersecurity professor, and while I'm great in that particular field the research does not interest me at all.) I'm already on the second and third round of interviews with multiple companies.

Will my grace period reset? (I.E., I have another 6 months to start paying), or will I need to begin making payments at the original January date?",finance

62. Charles dropped a new AMA where he mentioned very briefly that they are actually going to look into read-only UTxOs. If it’s possible to have these types of UTxOs while preserving determinism, it would be a big change since transactions must currently consume inputs. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJcVEJ1a6eg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJcVEJ1a6eg) Some background reading on read-only UTxOs: [https://github.com/Emurgo/Emurgo-Research/blob/master/smart-contracts/Unlocking%20The%20Potential%20Of%20The%20UTXO%20Model.md](https://github.com/Emurgo/Emurgo-Research/blob/master/smart-contracts/Unlocking%20The%20Potential%20Of%20The%20UTXO%20Model.md)

72. Charles drops a video on the eToro user limitations. It sounds like IOHK knew nothing about this. Interacting with exchanges falls in the Cardano Foundation’s wheelhouse. It’s unclear whether the CF knew anything. He also pointed out it’s very interesting that an old line exchange like Bitstamp has decided to LIST Cardano during this same period. Charles also mentioned that they haven’t seen any regulatory activity on IOHK’s end. eToro is a relatively small source of liquidity for Cardano and there shouldn’t be much of an impact.

78. The minutes from the Fed’s November FOMC meeting have been published and indicate they are ready to taper asset purchases and raise rates to combat inflation.

108. In macro news that could affect all of crypto including Cardano, it looks like Evergrande (one of the largest real estate developers in the world) has finally formally defaulted on its debt obligations. While Evergrand has been stumbling for a long time, this event could mark the beginning of a new phase in global economics.

112. The heads of Circle, FTX, Bitfury, Paxos, Stellar Development Foundation, and Coinbase appeared before the House Financial Services Committee. As expected, the questions from some of the House Committee members belied a misplaced focus on things like terrorist financing while others understood the need to regulate  crypto appropriately so that crypto innovation is not forced offshore. There was significant focus on stablecoins due to the President’s Working Group placing so much focus there. One representative also chose to focus heavily on the energy consumption of Bitcoin mentioning coal power plants coming back on line to fuel Bitcoin mining. The witnesses from the crypto industry seemed to focus on dispelling misconceptions and also pushing for a single crypto focused regulatory body as opposed to the fragmented regulation that is typical in Washington.

personalfinance,Where to Hold Five Figures of Cash That I May Need In a Week or May Not Need for Five Years,"It's a long story, but I saved a lot of cash to get my partner a great watch. The watch is in very limited supply and often takes years to get, but I have no sense of the timeline for when I'll get one as the dealer doesn't maintain a waiting list. The dealer has made it clear that it's possible the watch could come next week and it's also possible it could come in several years. I'll get at most a week's notice. 

It's killing me to see over $10,000 sitting in a savings account accruing such low interest (especially now since interest rates are low across the board). Is there a better place I could stash this where I could access the money on demand but where it also will make more than a nominal amount of interest. I have a strong preference for FDIC insurance or the equivalent.",finance
btc,"Earn BCH with BCH, Support BCH Financial Instruments and Derivatives","With the increasing market value of cryptocurrency and the increasing trading volume, the demand for financial instruments and derivatives is becoming more and more prominent. As the mainstay of cryptocurrency, BCH is not enough in financial services compared to the others. In recent days, smartbch has made breakthrough progress, and the centralized BCH financial services are constantly developing too, including the financial instruments provided by Matrixport a Singaporean crypto finance company.

The first BCH option trading platform was established earlier this year [https://www.bit.com/options](https://www.bit.com/options), however the volume hasn't been prominently increased by now, but the zero break through has brought us a few structured financial products including **Dual Currency**. I had an earlier post about their first BCH Structured Financial product, check out the link for more details [https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/latdh9/the\_first\_bch\_structured\_financial\_product/](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/latdh9/the_first_bch_structured_financial_product/)

Today they just launched a new **fixed income product** that could provide a fixed interest rate to those who would like to earn BCH from their holdings. Besides this they also have **Flexi earnings** with no time frictions and etc., DM me for more details and feel free to download the app with my referral link to get some extra coupons.

CryptoCurrency,Decentralization is not necessarily a good thing,"Usual disclaimers:

- If anyone remembers me from the previous rants, my area of knowledge is in traditional tech and finance; in both respects, I'm very on the side of minimal government involvement and self-sovereignty+censorship-resistance as a way of managing things
- A good bit of my bags include Bitcoin and Monero (bullish on privacy networks in general, actually)
- I'm here mainly for the tech, but also because I believe that Bretton-Woods+IMF and international credit markets continue to disempower and exploit the average person

Now for the rant:

We started with Bitcoin, which is, to say, the most decentralized thing the world has seen since the internet of {TCP,UDP}/IP itself. The first users of Bitcoin were included in the cypherpunks community, who stood for the same self-sovereignty/anti-centralization talking points and were, to some extent, trying to ""escape"" or equivalently ""debase"" the status quo economic system.

However, the Vitalik-generation moved away from Bitcoin b/c of lack of programmability and other technical limitations. Naturally, this gave us Ethereum, which has its own host of technical limitations; but for that, it's plenty programmable, and it's thus ""sane"" to believe that the status quo system that we came here to debase. With that said, the glaring limitations are that Ethereum, as it stands, is pretty shit as a payments system or as a DLT-platform for financial transactions; we ""have"" programmability, but with proof-of-stake, sharding, ZK-rollups, and all these other use cases of the same being blocked by limitations such as gas fees and non-determinism, do we really? Should the system that is one day going to debase Bretton-Woods and the IMF not at least enable people to send each other ERC-20 stablecoins and clear your call-options on memecoins or something?

This is where all the comparisons between centralization and decentralization start. We first have to acknowledge that Ethereum, for all the greatness of its community, is not as decentralized as Bitcoin and probably will not be even after completion of ETH2. Why? Even when/if ETH2 finally drops, we'll still have the 32 ETH requirement to set up a stake pool: What if 1 ETH equates to $20-30K at that point? Will the mom-and-pop stake pool still be able to compete with those run by the likes of Google and Goldman? Was not the whole point of proof-of-stake that mom-and-pop (assuming they were both sufficiently good sysadmins) should be able to help secure the network against whales?

If ETH isn't decentralized enough, then what is? This is where most of the disagreement starts. A lot of this sub is bullish on Algorand b/c it offers proof-of-stake now, makes it easy for everyone to validate the network, offers nice DeFi, and so on; however, Algorand also has some potentially-bearish technical characteristics, including monetary policy (all coins pre-minted and distributed to network participants by the Foundation, which is a legal entity in some jurisdiction) and accounts-based state management (it's like Ethereum in this regard; Bitcoin uses UTXOs, which is a different state-management scheme that is arguably more decentralized but also less programmable; some thoughts from [Vitalik](https://medium.com/@ConsenSys/thoughts-on-utxo-by-vitalik-buterin-2bb782c67e53) on the subject here.) I'm not FUD'ing ALGO by saying this -- in fact, I think it does what it does in a much better way than Ethereum did -- but unfortunately I haven't seen much discussion on this sub about these technical limitations, which worries me.

Now, there are some people argue Cardano, having the same talking points, is suitable for the same task; however, there are just as many people who think that the project is overvalued and underperforming, and there are even more who think that Charles Hoskinson is a scam artist targeting libertarians, as opposed to The Great Silvio of the Turing Award. My opinion on the software, i.e., the collection of protocols, that is Cardano is that it's one of the only implementations of a blockchain that is technically-sound (disclaimer: Not THE only ""sound"" blockchain, necessarily, and this is also a technical opinion; if you don't like my technical opinion, you're welcome to read the code yourself and opine about it on the internet too, which is after all, the ethos of free/libre and open-source software.) With that said, I won't understate that community-building is a big part of blockchain, and the community seems to be ideologically-centralized around Charles in a potentially-unhealthy way.

There's also Polkadot and a bunch of other alternative chains, but none comes to mind as a press-worthy competitor in the decentralized DLT market about now.

That's only for the people who actually want decentralization; some people don't care about all that and just want a way to earn better yield on the Fiat they have lying around. That's a subproblem of the Bretton-Woods+IMF system and the international credit markets, as far as I'm concerned -- if we had fairer credit markets, you'd get a bigger cut out of what the banks were making, and you'd have stablecoin-like yields in your savings accounts -- but you can't tell that to the people who want an institution which guarantees a certain APY to invest in rather than some silicon voodoo where you need to run it on your own computer and don't have the kind of idiot-proofing that the banks gave you.

As depressing as it is, THAT'S the question we should be asking ourselves: How do we serve the people who don't care about decentralization but do care about making money? Most people don't care whatsoever about the differences in decentralization between holding Bitcoin in self-custody, holding Solana in self-custody, and holding USDC in a Coinbase staking account, as long as the yield keeps coming and nobody on social media has anything to FUD about.

The answer to these people's needs: Centralization! What the average Joe is looking for in this ""model"" is someone to secure their money against cyberthreats, make it easy for them to find out what kind of yield they're getting, and also provide liquidity against trades when they want to move their position; decentralization has its place in solving these concerns, but you can't email the CEO of Monero and ask them whether or not you and your dealer are settled for the weed you just bought.

How does centralization solve the above yield-generation problem? Suppose I was building a DEX on Ethereum -- let's call it Uniswap. Naturally, I'd have to get a bunch of funding and hire a bunch of devs, and even then I'd have all these arcane technical difficulties around small things like limit orders that become infinitely bigger/harder when done in a decentralized ledger. The same technical limitations would also necessitate considerations for things like impermanent loss, which my users would never have had to account for in TradFi b/c there's always so much liquidity to spare (thanks to the international credit system). On the other hand, if I were to start my own payment-settlement company (analogously Coinbase/Circle), it wouldn't be that hard to take whatever liquidity I have left over and build a lending pool out of it; the problem would be when I got too close to what the banks do, and Big Brother started questioning whether I have the divine right to lend money to people, but it's technically very possible. For that matter, I could also offer a high-yield savings instrument through staking, but that slips through the cracks b/c it's not technically ""lending"" ;)

The point is that a centralized system has a lot less technical overhead to manage and can thus devote more capital resources towards marketing/sales and community-building, which is what REALLY drives any kind of human behavior: People like to be part of an easily-accessible community where they can interact with and acquire information from any like-minded individual, and society is ultimately driven by the communities that form therein.

I can take this a step further and argue that all celebritism is is an individual trying to build a community around whatever lifestyle they're promoting. Anyone can share their lifestyles and business models with anyone else through content creation and social media; in fact, we spend most of our time either loving or hating the people who did exactly that! I'll wager a guess that none of us (myself included) have ever even met Vitalik or Silvio, let alone Satoshi, and are thus following what is merely an internet phenomenon of gambling on the downfall of existing establishments.

Back to my point about centralization: Decentralized communities can and do organically exist, but centralized communities are unfortunately still necessary for the Karen who wants to speak to the manager when BabySafeCumShibaMoon gets rug-pulled. We're ultimately never going to change the fact that some people don't want to take responsibility for themselves in some aspects (esp. money-management, which people generally like to delegate to institutions b/c they're scared of losing their money), but we can (1) Decentralize the people on the fence, and; (2) Do our part to make sure that points of centralization become more trustworthy over time.

What does this mean for you? Is centralization or decentralization better? Should your money be in USDC or Monero? What should you tell to people talking about it at parties, and what should you recommend for your 50+ y/o mother and your 75+ y/o grandmother to do?

Unfortunately, nobody can provide a fixed answer, only different heuristics. I'm personally of the opinion that Coinbase, CDC, Gemini, and the likes generally have excellent yield-generation mechanisms for people who don't care about decentralization; a #hacker from the #cypherpunk world might bring up the problems with Bitmart and the likes, but that's where the natural bias towards the ""biggest bully on the playground"" helps a person out (e.g., no matter what you say about Coinbase customer service, I'm pretty sure it's still better than something like Kucoin.)

Really, you have to make the decision about whether or not you want to be self-sovereign and responsible for your own money; it's a decision on how to live your life, and as always, there are ""safe"" and ""unsafe"" ways to go on either path. The question shouldn't be whether centralization or decentralization is good, but rather what (or who) guarantees the centralization (or lack thereof); naturally, it's better to be centralized in favor of USDC-staking rather than decentralized in favor of Solana, just as it's better to be decentralized in the blockchain of The Great Genius Silvio Himself rather than centralized towards shitcoins like USD and government bonds.

TL;DR: De/centralization is a spectrum, not a static choice, and the underlying decision is of where and/or with whom to place your trust. We shouldn't be shittalking anything b/c it's centralized or otherwise, but rather helping people achieve the safest and most profitable strategies for their chosen degree of de/centralization.",cryptocurrency

I have been FX trading for around 3 years now and I've been fed up with it for a long time. I am looking to get into crypto but have pretty basic knowledge of it.  
I tried looking into it but got bombarded with technical information I dont really need for trading assets.

personalfinance,Using home equity for mutual funds,"With interest rates set to rise and inflation continuing to rise, I’ve been thinking about making some financial changes. Terrified of repeating the mistakes of the great depression, I’ve been wondering about using the equity that I have built up in my home in order to buy a bunch of mutual funds. We can have our home paid off in four years since we’ve been paying a bunch extra on our mortgage every month. However, we can take that extra away from the mortgage payment and invest it or refinance our debt, extend the term, and take out a big chunk of money to invest. My home debt at 3.65% and my student loans are the only debts that I have right now. 

So which is it: stay the course and pay off the house, pay the house off slower and invest the extra cash on a month by month basis ($500/month), or refinance to get a big chunk of money to invest (50-100k)?",finance
personalfinance,Now the right time to upsize on our house?,"**Edit 2:**  Work was crazy busy the last few days. I am updating the comments now. I appreciate the insight given. I am going to try and convince my parents to not buy the house and instead maybe just renovate their current house and make add a room or something small that won't lead them in bankruptcy. 

More info: Dad makes $40K/ year, Mom makes $52K/ year and I make $45K/ year. They have about 50K saved up for this house now in the bank, like stated below.

**Edit**: I also feel it isn't right because I don't feel it is right to have my parents shoulder this financial burden into retirement. And then there's the financial burden I will most likely take on, which is fine with me but I would like a few years to be better financially before doing so. It has been an interesting last few days.

I posted on here previously and I received decent help. So, I'm hoping that can be repeated.

I am a 25(M) and my parents are looking into upsizing our current home (3 BR, 1 Bath, 1000sq ft.)into a Family home (4 BR, 3 Bath), 1800 sq ft.). My sibling and I do live with our parents but plan to move out in the next year to two years. The main reason for buying the house is that when my sibling gets married and I get married/ have kids we can all be over the house during visits/ holidays, and we can all have more space. Other reasons are that my mom has always wanted a bigger house and now my dad is feeling that itch.

Current Financial situation:

\- Mom (mid-50s) and Dad (Late 50s) have saved about $50K for this

\- The mortgage rate is around 3% (30 Years), more likely 2.89% because they have great credit.

\- I can sign on the loan if I must

Housing prices:

\- Current Home: $150,000

\- Future Home: $480,000 (Doesn't include closing cost/ realtor cost/ taxes)

\*\*My plan for the current house:  I would get a mortgage on our current house when my parents upsize and I would be able to rent it out. I eventually wanna live here in the future with my wife and kids.

Now my question is, is now the right time to buy? It looks like mortgage rates will increase as the FED fights inflation and since post-pandemic looks to be closer. But, homes prices have never been higher. Will home prices decrease? Again, in our current financial situation, I don't feel it is right but it seems like the right time in the market to hit Full Send on this and get that house even though we will pay a $50K or more premium. I would like to know your thoughts?

I will appreciate any feedback I receive and be harsh if you must, honest feedback is much appreciated.",finance

Bitcoin,How I get people to start investing.,"&gt;This strategy is my personal strategy, it has worked incredibly well for me but take everything with a grain of salt. This is how I also get the majority of my colleagues to start investing because it minimizes the risk. I am not a Financial expert, and can't guarantee anything, use this at your own risk.

There will always be people that are looking to start in the world of crypto but they stop themselves due to the risk involved. I came up with this stupidly simple strategy for myself because I was sick of crappy interest rates from the bank, and I wasn't in a good place to be risking the money I had. I will make this short and outline the steps I take, and give to others to get started.

1. Sign up to coinbase and complete as many of the ""earn"" program as you can.
2. Sign up for Blockfi or use a friends referral link to earn $10 in BTC once you deposit $100
3. Convert your altcoins from coinbase to BTC
4. Put your saving you typically had in the bank into USDC (stablecoin, $1 will always = $1).
5. Transfer the USDC &amp; BTC to Blockfi from coinbase.

What this does.

* Your money you would typically has in a bank is now making 9% APY, Paid out monthly in USDC
* You have obtained $30-$40 in BTC for free that earns 4.5% APY, Paid out monthly in BTC
* your BTC holdings, not just value increases over time. You don't have to pay a dime of your hard earned cash to obtain bitcoin unless you really want to or buy the dip!

Hopefully this helps some people get into crypto. Thanks for reading!",cryptocurrency

stocks,(12/13) Monday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,"# Good Monday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Monday, December 13th, 2021-

*****

# [S&amp;P 500 looks set to add to its record close from Friday with futures higher](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/12/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures rose early Monday after the index notched its best week since February at a fresh record close, rebounding from a big sell-off triggered by fears of the omicron coronavirus variant.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures traded 40 points higher, or 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 futures inched up 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.34%.
*****
&gt; Moderna shares were among the strongest gainers premarket Monday, rising 2.4% a day after the White House’s top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci called Covid booster shots “optimal care,” but said the definition of fully vaccinated would not change.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere, Apple moved closer in its quest to become the market’s first $3 trillion company, gaining 1% premarket following an upgrade from JP Morgan.
*****
&gt; Also, chipmaker Nvidia, which has become a signature reopening trade, was up 1.7% on optimism that omicron would not be as disruptive as initially thought.
*****
&gt; The early Monday action followed a strong week on Wall Street as investors shrugged off a hot inflation reading. The blue-chip Dow gained 4% last week, breaking a four-week losing streak with its best weekly performance since March. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 3.8% and 3.6%, respectively, last week, both posting their best weekly performance since early February.
*****
&gt; Investors digested a jump in headline inflation data, which came in at 6.8% in November year-over-year for the biggest surge since 1982. The print was marginally higher than the 6.7% Dow Jones estimate.
*****
&gt; “The fact is that inflation is likely to remain on the higher side for a while and risks of sticky inflation remain, although we believe that the passing of base effects and the easing of supply chain constraints by the end of the first quarter of next year should slowly bring inflation down to more comfortable levels,” Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, said in a note.
*****
&gt; The key inflation reading came ahead of the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting this week where the policymakers are expected to discuss speeding up the end of its bond-buying program.
*****
&gt; Fed Chair Jerome Powell, as well as a parade of Fed speakers, all recently suggested the central bank could end the $120 billion monthly bond purchase program sooner than the current timeline of June 2022.
*****
&gt; “We believe markets can continue take a higher inflation reading in their stride, though additional volatility remains a risk. With Fed policy staying relatively accommodative, the backdrop for equities is still positive, and we favor winners from global growth,” said Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer of UBS Global Wealth Management.
*****
&gt; Stocks bounced back last week as investors bet that the initial worry about the Covid strain is overblown. Many also took solace in the news from Pfizer and BioNTech that a study found three doses of their vaccine provides a high level of protection against the variant.
*****
&gt; As of Sunday, the U.S. was approaching 800,000 coronavirus-related deaths. The new variant has pushed some government officials to reinstate health restrictions to slow the spread.

stocks,Cowen Top 2022 Ideas,"**ALNY**
 ALNY is our top pick for 2022 as it nears a key inflection point: APOLLO-B data of patisiran in TTR-CM (mid- 22). This is set up for success given precedent cardiac subset data from TTR-PN trials. We model $2B+ sales for patisiran/vutrisiran in TTR-CM achievable given current $2B sales of tafamidis. With profitability on the horizon ALNY may be a more attractive strategic asset than ever. We believe ALNY is just starting to gain forward momentum into large -cap biotech status, and stands at the opportune forefront of a transformational 2022 -2023. While almost all investor focus is placed on patisiran/vutrisiran’s blockbuster potential in ATTR -CM, led by the mid -2022 readout of the pivotal Phase 3 APOLLO -B trial, we think large and significant value rests with the platform and the power of the company’s R&amp;D prowess. A rich and growing pipeline addressing 20+ therapeutic areas with a 2022 goal of progressing 11 clinical programs, supported by 2 -4 new INDs, 5 commercial products with 1 new product launch (vutrisiran), is currently underappreciated by investors. 1) January 1, 2022: Inclisiran PDUFA 2) Early 2022: Initial data from cemdisiran Phase 2 in IgAN; Full 18-month cardiac data from the Phase 3 HELIOS -A study of vutrisiran in ATTR -PN; First Alzheimer's patient to be dosed with ALN -APP in a Phase 1 trial 3) April 14, 2022: Vutrisiran (ATTR -PN) PDUFA 4) Mid -2022: Top -line results from the Phase 1 Part B trial of ALN -HSD in NASH 5) Late 2022: Top -line results from the Phase 2 KARDIA -1 trial of zilebesiran in hypertension…

**AGIO**
 Skepticism towards mitapivat’s PKD launch has pressured AGIO shares. We believe Agios has already identified a population of U.S. PKD patients (~400) that are good candidates for therapy and more than sufficient to support 2022 consensus (~$25MM). Therefore we are optimistic that AGIO shares can outperform while PKD launches and the company seeks out label expansion opportunities. Our model's 2022 U.S. sales estimate ($30MM) is modestly above consensus ($25MM in U.S. sales) and we think investors are even more skeptical about both the early and long-term performance of the PKD launch. Guidance provided at a recent investor day implies Agios has already identified ~400 PKD patients that are likely to be eligible for mitapivat. This far exceeds the ~83 patients (assuming our model's $300K net price) needed to hit 2022 consensus. Consultants report that once mitapivat is approved they plan to proactively reach out to their more severe/poorly controlled patients with the remaining patients being offered mitapivat at their next regularly scheduled office visit. Updated data from mitapivat's trials in PKD and thalassemia will be presented today at ASH. Management will host an ASH analyst event tomorrow to discuss these as well as datasets from mitapivat's ISTs in SCD and AG-946's healthy volunteer trial that were made over the weekend. Mitapivat’s NDA for use in PKD has been granted priority review and a February 17th 2022 PDUFA date. Agios also expects to provide additional updates on AG-946's development program potentially including Phase I data in SCD patients is expected in 2022.

**ALLO** 
Similar to the first generation CAR-T candidates allo CAR-T is experiencing the ups and downs of clinical development and a pullback in sentiment has occurred. Led by new data from ALLO’s AlloCAR Ts we expect a rebound in sentiment during 2022 which could push shares back towards prior highs or a 50% gain. The clinical hold should lift shortly and this is a management team worth investing in. Allogeneic do not naturally persist as long as autologous cells, and this likely leads some investors to believe that it will be difficult for allo CAR-Ts to match auto CAR-T efficacy. However, allo approaches allow patients to receive more than one dose due to a more abundant cell source, which could offset the decreased persistence. The other significant factor at play is the ""window of persistence."" The additional flexibility of Allogene's proprietary/protected anti-CD52 lymphodepletion regimen should keep the window open long enough to generate durable responses. We ultimately believe that consolidation dosing combined with antiCD52 lymphodepletion will lead to auto-like efficacy in NHL and in future programs. Updated ALPHA, ALPHA2, and UNIVERSAL trial data will be presented later today at ASH, with updates to continue throughout 2022. The clinical hold should be lifted soon. Additionally, we should also receive ALLO-715 + nirogacestat combo data, IGNITE/ TurboCAR trial data, and potentially initial ALLO-316/CD70 data during 2022.

**AMZN** Target to $4500 
We expect accelerating topline growth starting in 2Q22 as eCommerce comps ease, with the 1 Day / Same Day offering bolstered by historic fulfillment investments since '20, driving higher conversion and fueling potential upside to our forecast. Robust growth at AWS &amp; the adv biz will drive Op margin expansion. We extended model to '27 &amp; modestly changed L-T est. AWS and advertising businesses both reported accelerating revenue growth YTD (through3Q21), though the outperformance at these segments is not reflected in current share prices.
ABNB Airbnb is on track to grow 33% vs pre-pandemic in Q4E while its largest online travel peers are flat to down. While Street sees a major slowdown in 22E on tough comps, we believe this is unrealistic given pent-up demand and the ongoing travel recovery. We are 15% above Street for 22E GBV at $65B, and in our debut 22E quarterly est, expect beats startingQ1E, typically a large bookings quarter. Street projects only 20% y/y growth in 22E which we see as unrealistic in a year where we project overall global lodging bookings of +35% (Airbnb has gained share every year since its inception).
CHPT CHPT is our top EV charging pick for '22 given its market leading position. '21 was defined by challenging equity performance across the EV ecosystem but fundamentals remain strong as accelerating adoption drove charging strength across all channels for CHPT - resi, commercial, and fleet. Momentum likely continues as e-mobility further accelerates in '22 though vol likely persists on hawkish fed. We expect subscriptions revenue to nearly double its share by 2030 (38% vs. ~20% today) as growth in hardware deployment slows, CHPT will continue to benefit from recurring software and warranty payments that come at higher margin - we model 55% in out years. This mix shift helps grow total company gross margin to 40%+ from the mid 20% witnessed today.

**CFLT**
 We think recent growth acceleration shows that new organic vectors are at work: new low-touch cloud adoption, growing open-source conversions &amp; viral networking effects. We think the ramp in sales capacity this year will add to this flywheel next year, creating an even stronger growth engine &amp; strengthening its strategic positioning for data-in-motion. While Kafka may have originally been used more for trad'l middleware &amp; ETL use-cases, it is increasingly being used to power mission critical infrastructure, analytical &amp; transactional systems, and transform how next-gen apps are built. We believe CFLT is positioned to become the real-time nervous system for enterprises that adopt data-driven architectures, enabling them to operate in real-time. This puts CFLT (Streaming) next to SNOW (Analytics) and Databricks (MLOps) in strategic importance in this next-gen data platform innovation cycle.

**LNG** Target to $130 
We believe that LNG offers the best risk/reward within our coverage universe in 2022 with potential 30% upside and limited downside. The company s contracting structure offers stable earnings with the ability to participate in global gas price upside that will enable more rapid deleveraging than guided. Clear path to investment grade plus a new dividend should attract additional shareholders. We see earnings upside to LNG FY21 EBITDA guide of $5.8B - $6.3B given spot exposure to global gas price strength, while valuation could improve as strong earnings accelerates LNG's path to investment grade rating.

**BRZE** Outperform Target to $100 
BRZE has built a powerful next-gen customer engagement platform, designed to be cross-channel and powered by AI &amp; real-time data flows. BRZE is well-positioned to gain share in the B2C Marketing space &amp; become a more strategic vendor in the enterprise. Robust secular drivers &amp; durable land-and-expand model are compelling &amp; at ~15x EV/CY23E Sales against a 40% CAGR, valuation is attractive. With 50% of ARR from $500k+ customers, BRZE has proven it can serve the largest B2C brands in the world and compete well at the enterprise-level. We estimate the market growing at ~20% over the next ~5 years driven by 1) marketing budgets shifting to digital 2) rising direct-to-consumer initiatives 3) privacy regulations pushing more marketers to turn to first-party data, which requires a more sophisticated data/ML platform; and 4) consumers expecting real-time personalized brand experiences across all digital touchpoints

**SG** Outperform Target to $38
 SG is a COVID-19 recovery story and restaurant concept that best marries the two restaurant industry mega-trends over the last decade of guest-facing technology and transparent food sourcing. Indeed, sweetgreen's 68% digital sales mix is the second highest in our coverage universe and our confidence in their 38% 2022-25E revenue growth is largely a function of 25% annual net restaurant growth. We note 86%of ingredients are locally sourced from 200+ suppliers, ahead of #2 Chipotle's 13% mix of produce, with an emphasis on suppliers that promote organic &amp; regenerative farming practices. Story is further enhanced as a COVID-19 recovery play given 76% of the fleet is urban concentrated, while notably 66% of upcoming development will be in the suburbs. Growth plans from 140 U.S. locations today to 364 by 2025 &amp; 1,000 by 2030 are ambitious but achievable given the brand's 40% cash/cash returns that are in the upper half of our coverage universe justify rapid expansion.",finance
stocks,"A near-term pullback, then the third bubble in 100 years is coming, says strategist. Here’s how to get ready","Of the dozens of central bank meetings crammed into this week, the Federal Reserve is seen stealing the show with a tapering start and possible early rate-hike hints. After the “worst inflation call in history” and its credibility shattered, Chair Jerome Powell will need to take the reins hard, says Allianz’s chief adviser Mohamed El-Erian. So we’ll see if a potentially sterner Fed knocks the S&amp;P 500, which glided to a new high on Friday despite nosebleed consumer prices, off the Santa rally path.

On to our call of the day from a team at Stifel, led by Barry Bannister, warning of another bubble for the ages, thanks to “poor monetary and fiscal decisions since COVID-19.” And maybe enjoy any Santa rally while it lasts, as the team sees a near-term correction taking the S&amp;P 500 toward the low 4,000s by the first quarter of next year. And then…“Later in 2022-23E, we believe the ‘behind-the-curve’ Fed might create the third bubble in 100 years, by 2023 to 6,750 for the S&amp;P 500 (Nasdaq \[approximately\] 25,000),” said the Stifel team.

“Populism (which the Fed and Treasury seemingly embrace) leads to poor choices and even worse outcomes. Rate repression may again create a bubble that bursts (always do), followed by a lost decade,” it said. It said investors should look to history for proof this can happen. The S&amp;P 500 dropped nearly 20% in the third quarter of 1998 before the dot-com bubble burst in 1999-2000. A “late arriving” Fed tightening from the second-half of 1999 to the first half of the next year couldn’t stop it, said Bannister and the team.

“The same happened in the Roaring ’20s, with a -10.7% mid\_Dec-1928 drop as rates rose before the Oct.-1929 crash,” the strategists added. The only way to prevent such a bubble would be for the Fed to heed its own financial stability report, where it warned over elevated risk appetite among retail investors and high equity and real estate valuations, and “tilt hawkish.”

“Still, policy may arrive too late, and if the market goes ‘risk-on’ with a falling Equity Risk Premium and if the 10Y Treasury Inflation Protected Security (TIPS) yield remains repressed at -1.0% due to global central banks, a P/E \[price-earnings\] convexity bubble in 2022-2023E may occur,” they said.

While the big one may be a way off, they offer a near-term survival guide. Bannister and his team said if both the S&amp;P 500 and commodities weaken simultaneously — they expect that due to dollar strength, a China growth slowdown, Fed exit signals and tighter global liquidity —investors can take refuge in S&amp;P 500 defensives. So healthcare, consumer staples, utilities and telecommunications are the safety spots of choice, for now.

investing,Debt &amp; credit cycles and the role they play in portfolio strategy,"Hey team,

I manage most of my assets personally and, as a result, I feel an ongoing responsibility to understand the world around me, as this enables me to make the best investment decisions I can.

Recently, I’ve been thinking about how to best allocate my portfolio given the current state of asset valuations, government debt, and general investor sentiment.

Through studying the works of Ken Galbraith, Howard Marks, Ray Dalio and other great investors, I have learned that the single most important variable in determining whether I should be aggressive or defensive with my portfolio strategy is the debt cycle. The ability to understand where we are in the debt cycle, and adjust our portfolios accordingly, is one of the hallmarks of great investors.

I have decided to share my thoughts here in order to get your feedback.

Before diving in, I want to emphasize that these are my views, and that different people have different perspectives. I hope that by sharing my views, I will encourage debate and advance our understanding together.

***TLDR:*** *The debt &amp; credit cycle are paramount in helping me understand how to think about my portfolio strategy.*

# Cycles

At its core investing is making good decisions about the future. To do this well, investors need to form probability distributions of different outcomes to guide their actions.

But it is important to remember that even if we know the probabilities, we don’t necessarily know the outcome.

Howard Marks has a helpful analogy: successful investing is like choosing a lottery winner. The winner is determined by one ticket (outcome) being pulled from a bowl of tickets (many possible outcomes).

Superior investors have a better sense of what tickets are in the bowl, and thus, whether it is worth participating in the lottery. Said another way, great investors don’t know exactly what the future holds, but they have an above-average understanding of future tendencies and probabilities.

This brings us to cycles.

Understanding cycles helps us form a view of future probabilities. It helps us understand how many winning lottery tickets there are in the bowl.

Analyzing cycles is not a precise science. The goal is not to time the market; rather, it provides a directional sense of what has happened, and what might happen. Marks explains this elegantly:

*The superior investor is attentive to cycles. He takes note of whether past patterns seem to be repeating, gains a sense for where we stand in the various cycles that matter, and knows those things have implications for his actions. This allows him to make helpful judgments about cycles and where we stand in them. Specifically: Are we close to the beginning of an upswing, or in the late stages? If a particular cycle has been rising for a while, has it gone so far that we’re now in dangerous territory? Is the market overheated (and overpriced), or is it frigid (and thus cheap) because of what’s been going on cyclically?*

The most important cycle for investors to follow is the debt cycle.

# Credit &amp; Debt

Since we will use the terms “credit” and “debt” a lot, I will quickly define them.

Credit is the giving of buying power. When you take on credit, you exchange it for a promise to give it back; this is called debt.

Credit and debt, in and of themselves, are good things, and little credit and debt can be a bad thing. For example, if there is credit available to build roads, schools, and other essential infrastructure, that is a good thing. If the credit and debt are used to consume goods outside of one’s income level, that is a bad thing.

So, the overarching principle is that credit is desirable when the borrowed money is used productively to generate enough income to repay future debt obligations. If this occurs, good decisions have been made, and both the lender and borrower will benefit.

# Debt Cycles

At the highest level, a debt cycle is the oscillation between credit and debt being easily available and being scarce. \[1\]

When credit is easily available, there is more money in the system. This leads to growth in GDP, asset prices, incomes, etc. and is called an economic expansion, or a “boom.” To prevent prices from growing indefinitely, central banks taper credit, which causes everything to shrink. This is called an economic contraction, or a “bust.” This dynamic has existed for as long as credit has been around, predating the Roman Empire. \[2\]

Debt cycles are nothing more than a logically driven series of events that recur in patterns. Whenever you borrow money, a debt cycle is created.

Let’s explore this in more detail.

A debt cycle has two distinct phases: (1) expansion; and (2) deflation.

**Expansion:**

Every debt cycle begins with widely available credit.

There is a famous line in In Fields of Dreams, “If you build it, they will come”. In the economy, if you offer cheap debt, people will borrow.

When debt is cheap, the threshold for its productive use is lower and skews more toward consumption. Since one person’s spending is another person’s income, higher consumption leads to higher incomes. Eventually, this leads to higher asset prices (stocks, bonds, real estate, crypto-assets, etc.) since there is more money chasing assets.

This has a positive self-reinforcing effect.

As incomes and asset prices inflate, people feel rich and start to take on even more debt.

Creditors look at the increased net worth of their debtors and feel comfortable giving them more debt. \[3\] This strengthens the feedback loop. Risk averseness diminishes, investor sentiment shifts toward optimism, and everyone thinks the good times will last forever. At this point debt is used more recklessly to fund consumption or projects with negative returns.

**Deflation:**

Eventually, to stop the upward cycle central banks taper credit, by making it more expensive. Making debt more expensive has two impacts: (1) people are less likely to take on new debt; and (2) existing debt becomes more expensive, which increases the risk of default and shifts spending away from consumption and investment to debt repayment. This triggers a negative spiral.

A lack of credit creates a liquidity problem. Investors and lenders become more critical of who they lend to. There is less money flowing around and consumption is reduced. Reduced consumption reduces income (remember that one person’s spending is another’s income). Lower incomes and lower asset prices mean lower net worths. Lenders, who were providing credit based on higher income and asset prices feel exposed and tighten credit even more. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle and the downward spiral continues.

**Resetting the cycle:**

To combat the downward spiral, central banks lower interest rates and make credit easily available again.

This marks the end of one cycle and the beginning of the next.

# The Most Important Cycle

The slammed-shut phase of the credit cycle probably does more to make bargains available than any other single factor – Howard Marks

Why do I ascribe such importance to debt cycles?

Because credit, at least, impacts four important economic factors:

* Income Growth: Open credit markets are inflationary for wages. When credit is available, consumer spending is high. One person’s spending is another’s income, thus resulting in higher incomes and tighter labor markets.
* Net Worth / Asset Growth: Easily available credit results in more money chasing the same assets. This leads to higher asset prices and, as a result, higher net worths. Investors feel rich.
* Earnings / Company Growth: Companies need to fund investment in innovation and R&amp;D to grow. Credit makes up the largest part of the capital pool. Cheap credit allows numerous projects to be funded, resulting in higher growth.
* Default Rates: Credit must be available for maturing debt to be refinanced. Entities, like companies, governments and consumers, often don’t pay off debts. Most of the time they roll them over. But if a company is unable to secure more debt at the time that its existing debt comes due, it may      default and enter bankruptcy. \[4\]

When the credit markets are wide open, the cumulative effect of the above is overly optimistic investor sentiment. When incomes and net worths are high, growth rates attractive, and all businesses avoiding default, people think the music will never stop. As a result, the potential risk-reward spectrum of investing is at its least favorable.

But investor sentiment is also a cycle, shifting from overly euphoric to overly pessimistic. When we enter the deflationary stage of debt cycles, the inverse is true.

# Making Good Decisions

The ultimate purpose of this essay is to enable you, the reader, to have a sense of where we stand in the debt cycle and take the appropriate action.

As such, I have outlined some typical signs of an open and cautious credit market.

Signs of an open credit market:

* Fear of missing out on profitable opportunities
* Reduced risk aversion, due diligence and skepticism
* Too much money chasing too few deals
* High debt levels and reduced ability to service debt expense
* High asset prices, low potential returns, high actual risk, and low perceived risk

Signs of a cautious credit market:

* Fear of losing money
* Heightened risk aversion and skepticism
* Shortage of capital everywhere
* Economic contractions and difficulty refinancing debt
* Low asset prices, high potential returns, low actual risk and excessive risk premiums

What does all this mean?

It means that one of the best ways to enjoy superior returns is to get the market on your side. Outcomes will never be under your control, but if you invest when the lottery tickets are biased toward favorable, you will have the wind at your back. Understanding cycles gives you a better chance of knowing when this is and positioning your portfolio accordingly. It helps you understand how many winning tickets are in the bowl and whether you should buy one.

The next logical question is where are we currently in the debt cycle and how should my portfolio be skewed toward the balance between aggressive and defensive?

At the time of writing this, I am leaning toward neutral-to-defensive. \[5\] When uncertainty is high, asset prices should be low, creating high potential returns that are compensatory. However, the combination of money printing and low interest rates has forced asset prices to be the opposite. While I don’t think prices are egregiously high, it is hard to find mouthwatering deals.

*Notes, Inspirations &amp; Additional Readings*

\[1\] Ray Dalio explains that there are two debt cycles we should pay attention to: the short-term debt cycle and the long-term debt cycle. For the sake of this essay, I have ignored this distinction and the policy and political implications associated with them.

\[2\] In Debt: The first 5000 years David Graeber lays out the historical development of debt. The first recorded debt system was in the Sumer civilization around 3500 BC.

\[3\] What I find fascinating is that this seems rational. For example, if you buy a house for $50 in year 1 with $25 of debt your total debt-to-asset ratio would be 50%. The next year, your house is worth $75 on paper, so your debt-to-asset ratio is now 33%. Based on this, you take on more debt to get the ratio back to 50%, resulting in \~$38 of debt. But what if your home price drops back to $50? Then your debt-to-asset would be 76%.

The point here is that the amount of credit one has available is often based on asset value, which is a variable number.

\[4\] Many corporate assets, such as buildings and machinery, are long-term in nature. But they are often financed with short-term debt because the cost of borrowing is lower relative to long-term debt. This mismatch is what drives the default risk that is associated with credit markets drying up.

CryptoCurrency,Tax loss harvesting. One method to legally reduce your taxes (in US),"**DISCLAIMER:**  *This post is not financial or legal advice and should be considered educational only. It is intended to get you thinking about tax loss harvesting but you should consult other resources and not rely on this post alone for financial planning. Tax liability can vary based on circumstances and it is impossible to cover all possible circumstances in a single post. If this is a life changing amount of crypto and thus a life changing amount of taxes I strongly recommend you retain the services of a CPA.*

What is tax loss harvesting?

Tax loss harvesting is simply selling crypto that you want to continue to hold but which currently has an unrealized loss and then rebuying it.  **You sell while you are down and then immediately rebuy.**That ""locks in"" the loss while you still keep the crypto and benefit from any future price appreciation.

In the US taxes code gains/losses are either unrealized or realized. Gains/losses are unrealized until you sell/trade/spend a crypto and unrealized gains/losses do not affect your tax liability for the current tax year. If you are ""up $2,000"" on your ETH holdings but haven't yet sold/traded it that is an unrealized gained. Only by selling/trading/spending crypto do you make a gain or loss realized and thus reported for the current tax year on your schedule D.

As a hypothetical situation lets say so far this year you have $20,000 in net realized gains. When you file your 2021 tax return you will pay taxes on that $20,000. How much will depend on if they are long term or short term gains and your income bracket. Lets assume for this example it is short term gains and you are in the 25% bracket. That means you will be looking at $5K in extra federal taxes (plus whatever your state rate is).

Lets say you also hold some crypto that currently has an unrealized loss (current price is less than purchasing price). For this example you bought 1 BTC at $67,000 (ouch) and right now it is trading at $47,000 so you have a $20,000 loss. You can't deduct that loss from your gains because it is unrealized.

**However you could right now sell that 1 BTC for $47,000 lock in a $20,000 loss for the 2021 tax year and then immediately rebuy it. You still have have roughly 1 BTC** (you will pay fees which will slightly reduce your holdings unless you have some cash available to cover the difference). So for the current tax year you had $20,000 in existing net realized gains plus this new $20,000 realized loss resulting in $0 in net realized gains and thus $0 in capital gains taxes due for 2021.

What about the 'wash sale' rule?

This strategy can't be used for stocks because there is a regulation call the 'wash sale' rule in the IRS code section 1091 which says any sale of a security for a loss followed by a buy of the same security within 30 days does not count as a loss. It is as if the sell and rebuy never happened. You can try to tax loss harvest with stocks but you would need to wait 30 days between the sell and rebuy and the stock could gain significantly while you wait making it problematic and risky.

[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1091](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1091)

However section 1091 specifically limits the 30 day ""wash sale"" rule to ""*stocks and securities*"" (likely because it was written 60 years prior to crypto currencies). The IRS has ruled that crypto is property not a security thus the wash sale rule doesn't apply to crypto and you can sell and rebuy without any waiting period.

[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf)

Changing section 1091 to cover crypto currencies and other non-security assets would require new legislation. Although that could be done by congress at some point in the future, right now in 2021 it doesn't apply to crypto.  **The lack of a wash sale rule on crypto is what makes this powerful technique to delay taxes possible.**

Can I lock in more losses than I have in gains?

Yes. Any excess losses just roll forward to future years where they can offset capital gains. As an example say you have $20K in gains and you create a $30K loss. First the the loss will offset the $20K in gains resulting in no taxes from trading. Next you can deduct a maximum of $3K against your regular income reducing your taxes from income/wages. Finally the remaining ""excess"" $7K will roll forward to 2022 to offset any capital gains. If you have no capital gains in 2022 then it would keep rolling forward to 2023, 2024, 2025 until you eventually have capital gains to offset.

Aren't losses limited to $3,000 on your tax return?

No. This is a common misconception and goes beyond tax loss harvesting.  **Your capital losses are limited to net loss of $3K. That is to say $3K more than your capital gains in a given year not a static $3K.** So if you have $100K in capital gains and $120K in capital losses, then the first $100K in losses wipes out all your capital gains, the next $3K you can deduct against your regular income, the last $17K you can't use this year but it rolls forward to future years.

So tax loss harvesting makes my taxes disappear?

No. It merely delays you paying taxes. Someday you will sell that crypto which you sold and rebought and hopefully it will have gone up in price. So when you sell you will have a gain and end up paying the ""delayed"" taxes as well.

If we look at the example above you bought 1 BTC for $64K and then later sold and rebought it for $44K. You harvested a $20K loss in 2021. However lets imagine in 3 years you sell that 1 BTC for $200K. If you hadn't done the tax loss harvesting you would have a $134K gain ($200K - $64K). If you did the tax loss harvesting you would have a $154K gain ($200K - $44K). Note it is $20K larger gain which is exactly the amount of gains you avoided paying taxes on in 2021.

Wait so if I still have to pay taxes someday how does that help?

Delaying taxes in most circumstances is very financially beneficial. In our example you avoided paying $5K in taxes in 2021 meaning you could buy $5K more crypto this year. That crypto helps to grow your portfolio quicker. Any money not spent today on taxes can be used to improve your net worth.

I would gladly pay the IRS all my 2021 taxes in 2025 if they would let me. There are very few situations where you can legally just delay taxes without interest or penalties which makes this an incredibly powerful technique. Yes someday though you will still have to pay the taxes.

When should I not use tax lost harvesting?

There are some situations where tax loss harvesting could increase your taxes.

1. If your taxable income for the year is less than $40K ($80K if married) you should not harvest to avoid any long term capital gains because they are already taxed at 0%. You can still harvest enough losses to delay any short term capital gains. If you only have long term capital gains and income below $40K ($80K if married) you should not use this strategy at all in the current year.
2. If you currently have a long term realized capital gains that you want to offset and you feel you won't **keep the crypto you are harvesting for at least one year after rebuying it.** Understand that when you sell and rebuy the crypto you reset the 1 year capital gain clock. So if currently you have a long term capital gain taxed at say 15% (most common) and you harvest a loss to delay paying taxes in 2021 but the crypto you sell and rebuy you only hold for six months then the gain when you sell in 2022 will be taxed as a short term capital gain which could be \~25%. Generally speaking delaying the tax but paying a much higher rate is not a good trade. On the other hand if you hold the ""harvested"" crypto for a year (or more) after rebuying it then it also would be taxed at the same 15% you avoided meaning no increase in the tax rate.
3. Related to #2 is you aren't sure you will be able to hold for a year after rebuying or just are concerned that you might not. In that case a conservative way to use this is to pay any long term capital gains (lower rate) now and offset just the short term capital gains. You won't delay all the taxes you could but you won't ever be replacing long term gains with short term gains.
4. You anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in the future. Lets say you are a student right now but will have a significantly higher income in the coming years. You would be avoiding taxes at a low rate today for a higher rate tomorrow. That may not be ideal. Another situation is you are currently single but will be getting married soon and your spouse has a significantly higher income than you. Your tax rates filing jointly are likely to increase. The higher and the more stable your income is now the more advantageous this method is. Anything that could cause your income to rise significantly faster than the rate of inflation or cause your deductions to decline in the future is something to consider.

What if I bought crypto at multiple prices?

This can still be used but gets a little more complex. You are allowed to choose the costing method when declaring trades (FIFO, LIFO, HIFO). You need to ensure the costing method you use will sell the crypto with the highest price that usually means HIFO or LIFO costing method. The IRS allows you to pick the method used to select which coins are sold however you need to keep good records and you need to be consistent. If you are using software to assist you ensure it either allows you to pick the costing method or the costing method it uses will result in your high priced coins to be the ones that are sold. See this article on costing methods:

[https://cryptotrader.tax/blog/cryptocurrency-tax-calculations-fifo-and-lifo-costing-methods-explained](https://cryptotrader.tax/blog/cryptocurrency-tax-calculations-fifo-and-lifo-costing-methods-explained#:~:text=FIFO%20(first%2Din%20first%2Dout)%2C%20LIFO%20)

What about fees?

Exchange fees are a cost to engage in this tax avoidance move. Generally speaking if your losses are small it may not be worth it because exchange fees are usually a fixed percentage. Say your exchange charges 0.35% so 0.70% round trip. Paying 0.70% to delay taxes due to a large loss is likely worthwhile but not for delaying a small loss. In the example above the hodler had bought at $64K and harvested at $44K . If he bought at $45K and harvested at $44K then fees would greatly cut into the potential benefits. In both cases the fees would be $308 (0.7% \* $44K) but in the first case paying $308 in fees would allow you to delay $20K in gains while in the second case it would only delay $1K in gains.

What if it keeps dipping?

You can just keep selling and rebuying. In the example above the holder bought 1 BTC at $64K when it dipped to $44K be sold and rebought it. If BTC crashed further to $28K he could just sell and rebuy it again and lock in more losses. Due to trading fees you likely don't want to do this too often but instead on a significant move downward.

Can I do this at anytime?

Yes although you need to have a realized capital gains for the year and an unrealized capital loss to harvest.  **They also have to be in the same tax year.** If you have $20K in realized capital gains this year you would need to sell and rebuy to lock in a loss prior to January 1st. If you waited until after January then that loss wouldn't apply until the next tax year so it wouldn't offset your gains for this tax year.  **It would be a good idea to review all your gains and losses but realized and unrealized in December to see if there are any last minute harvesting trades to make.**

Could this change in the future?

Yes it could. The SEC is currently fighting a case that XRP is a security not property. If they win (which seems unlikely) that could cause the IRS to offer new guidance that not all crypto is property. It is my belief that even if the SEC wins in the XRP case or some other future case any ruling would be narrowly tailored as in ""XRP is a security"" or ""xyz crypto is a security"" not that all crypto is a security. If that happens then this post should be re-interpreted to exclude any crypto deemed a security by the IRS however as of today no crypto has been deemed a security.

**The other more serious threat would be new legislation.** Understand the wash sale rule on securities (stocks) sales was implemented to prevent EXACTLY this type of tax delaying tactic. This technique can be incredibly lucrative. On a long enough timeline I imagine that Congress will eventually pass legislation to close this loophole. They haven't yet though and even once they do it it would be forward looking not retroactive.

What should I tell my CPA or tax preparer?

Since most people don't own crypto your CPA might not actually be aware there is no wash sale rule on crypto transactions. Just point him towards the wording of Section 1091 of the IRS code (""wash sale rule"") and the IRS guidance (notice 2014-21) that crypto is property not a security or currency.

Is this tax evasion?

No tax evasion is the willful violation of the tax code to avoid paying tax liabilities. Tax loss harvesting is a tax avoidance technique meaning using the legal limits of the tax code to reduce or delay potential taxes as allowed by current law. Remember tax loss harvesting doesn't erase your taxes it just pushes them to a future year. Also keep in mind if Congress wanted to they could remove this capability by revising the wash sale rule in section 1091 to include assets other than securities.

What about countries other than the US?

I have no idea. You will need to see if your country has something like the wash sale rule and if it applies to crypto sales. Many countries tax crypto similar to the US but it really comes down to the exact laws in your country so don't assume this applies to any country other than the US.

How do I know you are correct?

You don't. The point of this is to be educational and get you thinking on the possibilities. You should do your own research. Here are some other resources:

Economics,Now Is No Time to Raise Interest Rates,,finance
algorand,Why Why Why,"She ran away (Algo)... For those who know some oldie tunes. Kidding aside. I want to preface this is just my opinion. I am in no way a financial advisor and take my opinion for what it is worth. 

The whole market is looking bloody red. Do not fear as it is all part of a bigger picture. The Federal Reserve is being forced to raise interest rates (bad for markets). Inflation is NOT transitory as they claim it to be. This is now all being priced into the crypto markets and soon stock markets.

**BAD NEWS**: (Or good if you are filling more bags) The price of just about everything is going to get cheaper here in the short term. Expect the momentum to pick up to the downside even more and short sellers stacking on to it to ride it down even further for quick profits. A lot of fear and panic is over taking the crypto market, so hold on for the ride or if you dare, take your profits and get in at a lower price (much harder to do and creates a tax event, I wouldn't do this myself). 

**GOOD NEWS**: This is just temporary, 1-3 months in my opinion. While these prices get super cheap, whales will start to slowly accumulate again for one last push to the upside before the bear market truly begins. There is ***NOTHING FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG*** with Algorand or most other crypto coins. It is just outside forces acting on it and crypto has a lot of paper hands which induces the wild volatility. 

Again, this is just my opinion and peer speculation. I own a sizeable bag of Algos and have not sold any of it myself and don't plan to anytime soon. I think Algo is way under valued for what it does and will recover FASTER than most other coins, once the selling stops. It just doesn't get hyped like the meme coins which is a huge plus in my book. I believe Algo has real value that will hold up in the future. Real value &gt; Hyped value.  Thanks for reading my opinion piece and good luck. Cheers \^\^",cryptocurrency

As far as I understand this, when bond yield drop that is because investors are buying bonds. When investors buy bonds (more offer than demand) the price of the bond raises, therefore those bonds give lower yield if you purchase them at this value.

So why is anyone buying bonds when it is expected that the FED is going to announce a raise of interest rates sooner than expected this Wednesday? Can anyone explain this to me? If you expect a market crash you keep cash not buy bonds if you also expect a raise of interest rates. It makes zero sense.",finance

CryptoCurrency,The trade-off to institutional money joining crypto is that crypto markets will begin to behave more like the markets institutional money operate in.,"Everyone gets pretty hyped up about news of institutions joining crypto. Perhaps it is a necessary step to move price, since it increasingly takes more money to move price up, as the global market cap grows.

However...

Institutions bring to the table their own set of philosophies and operating strategies. We all know crypto's crazy volatility is, in large part, due to the sheer irrationality of small investors. As Steve Eisman once noted, small investors treat the stock market like gambling (think RobinHood and GME) and we all know this is just as - or perhaps even more so - true in crypto. The ""make it or break it"" mentality of small investors (like us) in crypto is one of the factors that has moved the market either way in the last years and I'm not judging that. I'd be a hypocrite if I did so.

But that is not how institutional money operates. Institutional money has a very strong risk-management mentality. Yes, they can be irresponsible, subject to FOMO and gamble just like we do (2008 is still fresh on most of our memories), but that is not their overall mentality. They have all kinds of risk indicators and statistical models run by an army of quants that are there precisely to mitigate risk. They won't YOLO into a coin for years to see what happens, they operate very differently. Also, they don't need to wait years after buying some risky coin to shoot up in value to become a whale; they already have all the cash they need to buy significant amounts of whichever asset they choose. They can move the market much more easily than we could ever dream.

Also worthy of note is that, wherever institutional money goes, government regulations soon follow, and with a vengeance. We all know Wall Street and Washington have a pretty promiscuous love-hate relationship, and I am pretty certain that all the talk of the SEC or the FED meddling in crypto is, in part a reaction to institutional money joining in. Crypto just can't be ignored anymore because the state no longer feel it is a self-contained internet phenomenon, but something with very real ties to the institutions (Wall street and banking) they are accustomed to deal with. In this case, regulations are sure to follow, either to protect them or punish them, in the classic regulatory dynamic we've already grown bored to watch. This is bound to affect how we, retail, deal with crypto.

So that's my opinion on institutional money joining crypto. It is perhaps a necessary step to wider adoption, but it must be kept in mind that it comes with its very own set of challenges and problems.",cryptocurrency

I’ll get right to it: Currently making ~$30k as a private teacher; I owe $9,200 at an interest rate of 5.05%; monthly payments are currently $95/mo, but I’m eligible for IDR, bringing that down to $0-50/mo. I’m thinking about applying for IDR so I’m required to pay less, but can pay more if I choose, however, I’m worried about interest screwing me. Paying $95/mo is possible, but I live in an expensive area, so being down that amount will be noticeable. I currently prefer teaching privately, but I know if I work with public schools, I’ll be eligible for loan forgiveness, but this very likely means taking a pay cut as well. I also don’t plan to continue with higher education beyond certifications and possibly an associates, so I won’t have much more student loan debt, if any. So, should I drag out the payments and bank on loan forgiveness in 10yrs, or should I pay as much as I can when I can since the loan amount is relatively low and can likely be paid off in 10yrs anyways? Which requires less sacrifice?

I don’t come from a background of great investors, so I can’t help but view loans as throwing money away and I can’t tell what’s more beneficial for me. I live comfortably now as I live modestly, and I know I’ll never be rolling in riches considering I can’t say definitively when I’ll reach a salary of merely $50k, as we all know teachers stay underpaid.

CryptoCurrency,"NFTs in their current form are an obvious bubble, but the potential is so much greater","Right now, it seems like a majority of NFT content is quick cash-grabbing schemes and it reminds me a lot of the ICO hype in 2017. Every other day, some new art project pops up and the discord gets filled with hundreds to thousands of people hoping to cash in and get a fresh mint. Everyone mistakes the hype for some semblance of a demand market when really 100% of these adopters are looking to flip their NFTs for 10x.

The same thing is happening with The Sandbox and Decentraland, with assets and land being scooped up as speculative assets. In my opinion, as the hype and speculation variable fall to 0 over time, these assets will lose a lot of money. What keeps a player base economy alive is a thriving player base, and what keeps a thriving player base is fun and addicting content. In their current state, the only thing that these NFT games have going for them is novelty, which wears off quickly. The creator tools are still not very powerful and may never reach the granularity that you can get in games like Roblox and Garry's Mod

The kings of the future of NFTs are the companies that already have a history creating content. Video game companies, film studios, artists with an existing following, etc. For games, it's a lot more difficult for a small company with NFT experience to create a fun, addicting online multiplayer world than it is for a reputable and experienced game company to create an in-game economy based on NFTs. Think CS:GO weapon skins, Team Fortress weapons, RuneScape cosmetics, WoW armor, etc.  These items have an actual demand market because they have large and consistent player bases and the game content is created to be fun and engaging rather than simply rewarding ownership of any specific NFTs. The NFTs come secondary as a way to preserve the unique-ness of every piece of armor, every weapon, etc.

Why would a game company adopt NFTs for its item economy if it's perfectly able to control the in-game economy using simple, centralized chance based algorithms?

I think a big reason is trust and longevity in the values of in-game item. If I know ahead of time that only 5000 of some in-game cosmetic are going to be minted, then I know that I won't see this item being sold again in the game store and immediately I can assign it some value based on it's scarcity + demand. Even if the game company DOES decide to mint another 5000 of the same item, it will have to be some kind of 2nd gen or series 2 item set and by definition *cannot* be identical to the series 1, which forever exists within the Blockchain. (think gen 1 Charizard cards vs modern ones).

Another reason is the history of items. Imagine being able to look at a ledger and being able to see the entire history of an in-game sword. It could tie into the lore of the world. The value of a certain piece of armor or weaponry could fluctuate depending on if it was previously owned by a famous NPC or player. 

Last but not least, for games where there are fleshed out in-game crafting mechanics, NFTs provide a transparent way to look at the rarities of item sets and ensure that the rarest buffs and attributes that have the lowest chance rates are never indistinguishable from items that may have the same attributes, but were made when chance rates are buffed or nerfed. This creates a kind of symbiotic trust between developer and community, as now there isn't an easy way for the developer to tweak a single variable to devalue the ton of work put into obtaining a rare item or cosmetic. 

This is just me ADHD ranting but I'd like to know what people think of this and how NFTs are going to be adopted into the already existing gaming landscape.

**Edit: TLDR
The future of NFTs that have any value will be filled with content from existing content creators (Blizzard, Rockstar Games, Deadmau5, Damien Hurst, etc) rather than any of these new projects creating NFT based content from the ground up.**",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Advice/Help to get out of the financial mess I created,"Hi all,

**Short Background**: I am 29. As of this morning, I am roughly $40,000 dollars in debt. (About $75,000 total, but about $35K of that is student loans that my parents have graciously agreed to pay when they sent me to college although I am willing to pay that debt as well pending advice from other Redditors). This is currently spread throughout personal loans, credit cards, and some accounts that have since gone to collections. Earlier this year I stopped paying because I had gotten so overwhelmed and depressed because of the mistakes I made gambling in cryptocurrency, taking out loans and advance payments chasing losses to try and gain back what I lost and getting myself into deeper and deeper debt. Additionally, the collections agencies and loans were calling my work and telling them I'm in collections, it was really embarrassing and shameful. I'm not making excuses because I did this to myself when I lost control. I spend time with my college friends and family who are all gainfully employed, starting families, who have no idea what I am going through, and I found myself in my car with about $20 in my bank account, a 500 credit score that is still plummeting as collections endlessly call me, with Christmas rolling around and it all hit me at once that I want out and have no idea where to start.

**Employment**: Currently I work full time (40hrs a week) in the sales/finance industry on a commission plan. I get two minimum wage checks of about $847 on the 3rd and the 17th (roughly), and at the beginning of the month, I usually get anywhere from $2000 - $6000 depending on what I close. I am still learning and getting steadily better as I am learning (two months ago I made a $7000 bonus). I know I must sacrifice and get additional employment as well. Any advice for second jobs? I work 8/9 - 530 M-F most days. With my current job, I have the potential to make usually around $4000 a month and possibly more if I continue to improve.

**Accounts**:

I will update these numbers with interest rates and minimum payment in a spreadsheet but I have several active accounts and collections accounts

Credit Score: 500 - 517 - 509

$12,039 - Lending Club Personal Loan - 20.6% APR - Current - $451 minimum payment

$2,200 - Citibank Credit Card - 0% APR - 90 Days Late

$5899 - Net Credit Personal Loan - 36% APR - Delinquent/Collections

$7000 - Patelco Credit Card - 16% APR - Delinquent/Collections

$1,150 - Negative Venmo Balance - 0% APR

$4500 - Upstart Personal Loan - 32% APR - Delinquent/Collections

$2700 - One Main Personal Loan - 15% APR - Delinquent/Collections

$1,100 - Minto Money Personal Loan - Delinquent/Collections

$450 - Ace Cash Express - Delinquent/Colletions

I am still exploring but there are potentially some other accounts that are in collections I am forgetting so I will be sure to get everything exact after work when I build the spreadsheet.

**Next Steps**: Mentally, I think that's been the toughest part for me is endless calls every waking hour asking money I just don't have alongside my stomach pit thinking about the stupid mistakes I've made. As of this morning, I am using Every Dollar for budgeting (open to other suggestions), and I get paid this Friday that will essentially go to my bills. I am just ready to start this journey of getting out, I want to be financially independent and set my future back on the right track. I graduated and have a job I've just been an absolute idiot with my addiction and spending.

Any help is appreciated and I genuinely appreciate any advice to help me, but I want to preface that I know it really starts with myself. Thank you.",finance

That has come down a bit to 621, but it’s still 100 more firms that can’t bear a rate hike than before the pandemic — certainly enough for a financial sector spinoff of *The Walking Dead*.

At this moment, it looks like a breakpoint which will determine outlook for the next decade. As for me, now FED has 3 choices: 

1. Just raise rates and ""clean"" economy from zombie companies with the price of financial market collapse +  financial distress + raise of unemployment (zombie companies to fire people, their counterparts, and suppliers to follow) + collapse of ""boomers"" pensions.
2. Don't raise rates and prepare to live a long life with a high inflation. It will safe people savings and pensions, but only for those who invest money. Basically, not raising rates will fuel inequality even more and could lead to a major social distress and tensions later on.
3. Raise rates, but buy any close-to-default ""zombie"" company debt on its balance sheet. Basically FED can raise rates, but also can protect companies from mass defaults by buying their debt on its balance sheet. 

Personally, I am a fan of first way. Any crisis could be seen as a healing point. We always learn from crises and crises ""clean"" economy from bad ineffective actors. After Great Depression the USA became the leading World country. After 70s, the USA provides reforms and outbreak the USSR to establish their dominance even more in 80s. Great Recession in 2008-2009 taught us to regulate banks, and now after Basel-3 banks are super solid and safe places for people money and people's debt.

But because pandemic shows that FED by most is scared about unemployment and financial distress here &amp; now, I highly doubt option 1 will be chosen. Especially because now ""boomers"" are retiring and right now destroying their pensions by even 30-40% will hurt a lot and will increase social pressure. I also don't think option 2 will be chosen, as it will mean a lot of political pressure, because non of parties want to be named nearby inequality, especially Democrats. 

It leads to a logical conclusion that FED will go by option 3, and will raise rates, but also support those zombie companies who can't pay their debt. And this decision could mean a start of Corporate Communism in the USA, as it will officially mean, that employment and people salary is more important than corporate health. It will mean that corporates could no longer fight to survive, they will always be safe in the FED pocket. Why do you need to bother yourself with some sophisticated transformations and innovations, if you know that FED will safe your ass?

Think of the USSR. They lost the fight, because their goods were awful and people wanted goods ""from the West"". Why their goods were awful? Because factories had no economical stimulus to produce good quality goods. They knew that Party will always ""buy"" whatever you produce. It kills innovation.

And if FED choose to go this way, it will be a new chapter in ours life.",finance

NFT,"The current state of NFTs is such an obvious bubble, but they can be so much more, especially for gaming","Right now, it seems like a majority of NFT content is quick cash-grabbing schemes and it reminds me a lot of the ICO hype in 2017. Every other day, some new art project pops up and the disc0rd gets filled with hundreds to thousands of people hoping to cash in and get a fresh mint. Everyone mistakes the hype for some semblance of a demand market when really 100% of these adopters are looking to flip their NFTs for 10x.

The same thing is happening with The Sandbox and Decentraland, with assets and land being scooped up as speculative assets. In my opinion, as the hype and speculation variable fall to 0 over time, these assets will lose a lot of money. What keeps a player base economy alive is a thriving player base, and what keeps a thriving player base is fun and addicting content. In their current state, the only thing that these NFT games have going for them is novelty, which wears off quickly. The creator tools are still not very powerful and may never reach the granularity that you can get in games like Roblox and Garry's Mod

The kings of the future of NFTs are the companies that already have a history creating content. Video game companies, film studios, artists with an existing following, etc. For games, it's a lot more difficult for a small company with NFT experience to create a fun, addicting online multiplayer world than it is for a reputable and experienced game company to create an in-game economy based on NFTs. Think CS:GO weapon skins, Team Fortress weapons, RuneScape cosmetics, WoW armor, etc. These items have an actual demand market because they have large and consistent player bases and the game content is created to be fun and engaging rather than simply rewarding ownership of any specific NFTs. The NFTs come secondary as a way to preserve the unique-ness of every piece of armor, every weapon, etc.

Why would a game company adopt NFTs for its item economy if it's perfectly able to control the in-game economy using simple, centralized chance based algorithms?

I think a big reason is trust and longevity in the values of in-game item. If I know ahead of time that only 5000 of some in-game cosmetic are going to be minted, then I know that I won't see this item being sold again in the game store and immediately I can assign it some value based on it's scarcity + demand. Even if the game company DOES decide to mint another 5000 of the same item, it will have to be some kind of 2nd gen or series 2 item set and by definition cannot be identical to the series 1, which forever exists within the Blockchain. (think gen 1 Charizard cards vs modern ones).

Another reason is the history of items. Imagine being able to look at a ledger and being able to see the entire history of an in-game sword. It could tie into the lore of the world. The value of a certain piece of armor or weaponry could fluctuate depending on if it was previously owned by a famous NPC or player. 

Last but not least, for games where there are fleshed out in-game crafting mechanics, NFTs provide a transparent way to look at the rarities of item sets and ensure that the rarest buffs and attributes that have the lowest chance rates are never indistinguishable from items that may have the same attributes, but were made when chance rates are buffed or nerfed. This creates a kind of symbiotic trust between developer and community, as now there isn't an easy way for the developer to tweak a single variable to devalue the ton of work put into obtaining a rare item or cosmetic. 

This is just me ADHD ranting but I'd like to know what people think of this and how NFTs are going to be adopted into the already existing gaming landscape.

Edit: TLDR The future of NFTs that have any value will be filled with content from existing content creators (Blizzard, Rockstar Games, Deadmau5, Damien Hurst, etc) rather than any of these new projects creating NFT based content from the ground up.",cryptocurrency
defi,What is the best way I can start to make $30 a day?,"I'm homeless and live in my car. The only thing I do for money is deliver food and I make about $12k a year from that.

I want to find a way to make $30 so I can eat something other than peanut butter sandwiches all day. I'm tired of it and my stomach constantly feels like it's caving in.

I only have about 40k of crypto to my name and it earns about $30 a week. So that means I am already earning $30 a day for 1 out of the 7 days of the week. Now I need to find a way to earn $30 a day for the other 6 days of the week.

What do you guys suggest?

This is what I'm currently doing:

Earning interest through cefi platforms.

earning rewards through lending on aave. This earns about 10-16%

earning liquidity rewards from sushiswap farms. this earns about 12-20%

I don't have a lot of money on the defi platforms let, but im slowly growing my positions in the defi protocols.

I don't want to join degen yield farms because I don't completely know what I'm doing when it comes to that to be honest. I'm only involved in stablecoin yield farms which is why im only earning 10-20%

my btc and eth are not earning 10% but they are earning the typical interest rate u usually see elsewhere.

so what do you guys suggest?

any ideas?

doesn't even have to be crypto related. do you guys have any online businesses that i can run on my macbook in my car? what opportunities are out there?",cryptocurrency

* NEWBIES’ lesson of the day: What does bullish and bearish mean?

&amp;#x200B;

## Crypto Market Insight: The Bulls and the Bears

Bitcoin (BTC) is strongly testing the 48k-50k support level. A break in this level could further fuel a drop to a 40k support. These next couple of days of news and price action will be vital in what bitcoin price decides.

Bitcoin appears to be a large ascending triangle pattern. This pattern is very bullish in nature and the (relative strength index) RSI is also showing bullish divergence. The last time this occurred was in December 2020 when bitcoin climbed 95% after a rebound.

&amp;#x200B;

[ BTC 1D ascending triangle ](https://preview.redd.it/pv8rikyj4e581.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=483ad2e190b76f11dd5c947e6be6b4064ddce716)

&amp;#x200B;

 Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) is at 42% and is breaking out of a downward trend that has spanned 3 months. This could signal a flight to safety from altcoins and/or it can also indicate an anticipation of a large BTC runup. Nevertheless, some funds are flowing from altcoins into BTC as the overall crypto market shrinks. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I sway on the side of NOT becoming optimistic until the current support has held and the final outcome may not be realized for a few days or weeks. I still believe these support levels are great areas to Dollar Cost Average (DCA). If there is a final test of support,  look for a dramatic final breakthrough followed by a  fast rebound that will form a large pinbar or engulfing candle. An exaggerated move will occur in a final attempt to shake out leverage and retail traders. We saw similar patterns on July 21st and September 30th. The FED meeting and proceedings tomorrow could prove to be a catalyst. Many investors are anticipating a dovish outcome that would benefit the crypto market. A strong change in overall bearish sentiment could occur following an announcement of no rate hikes in the near term. Here is a tweet from Charlie Bilello a well-respected Market Analyst relating to the subject, take a close look at number 6.

## NEWBIES’ Lesson of the day

**What does Bullish and Bearish mean?**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0oh18fb25e581.png?width=474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d110bcf90ddf8559114895e1983403cece76094

 

Being Bullish is having a strong sentiment of upwards price movement. Just like a bull strikes in an upward movement, a bull is someone who believes the price will go up over time. A bull is an individual who opens position by purchasing.

Being bearish means the exact opposite. A bear strikes downwards with its paws. A market bear believes a downward trend in price is in store. A bear is an individual who opens “short” positions by selling.

Timeframe is important when discussing bearish or bullish sentiment. A person may feel bearish now but is a long-term bull. There are individuals out there that are considered perma-bears or perma-bulls. A perma-bear might believe that an asset like bitcoin is continuously overpriced or useless. While a perma-bull might be an overly optimistic that bitcoin price should be a million dollars today.

CryptoCurrency,This Crash Reminds Me of the December 2018 Stock Market Crash,"The crypto market bleeding all in red right now seemingly for no reason for the past couple of weeks, with BTC dropping about 27% from $65K to the current $47K and ETH dropping about 19% from $4.7 to the current $3.8k. It's painful seeing our crypto portfolio's value bleed and it's tempting to sell out. It seems like with Christmas approaching, the price is falling.

This crash/correction reminds me a lot of the stock market crash of December 2018, where the S&amp;P500 index (the weighted average of the top 500 US stocks) plunged about 15% and the MSCI world index dropped about 24% for seemingly no reason when Christmas is approaching just like the crypto market. That crash was particularly painful for me as I was out of cash and was forced to sell my shares at a loss to get by just to see stock price bounce back up soon after; since then I made sure I have a stash of emergency cash as to not go through that pain again.

There was no one big catalyst that caused the stock market to fall in December 2018, but looks like a combination small factors like Trump's trade war with China (I miss Trump's twitter lmao) and rising interest rate. My personal theory is that people are selling stocks for the upcoming Christmas holiday, which caused a price drop, which leads to even more selling as people were panicking especially since Christmas is coming, creating a feedback loop.

The good news is that the stock market quickly bounced quickly afterwards after in early 2019. Interestingly during that time crypto followed a similar trajectory, although the recovery was slower.

What this means for the current crypto market is that if history is any indication, as long there's no catastrophic reason for the prices to crash, the prices will eventual recover. Meanwhile, just sit back, enjoy the show and the heavy discounts.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,PenFed Streamline Refinance,"So, I was browsing PenFed's refi options and they offer a streamline refi where they cover all closing costs.

The original loan was $173,655 and we are down to $167,028. We have been trying to find a VA renovation loan lender, because our low equity hasn't helped our need to do some essential remodeling.

Does anyone have any experience with PenFed and, maybe, this option? Does this make sense to do? To me it seems like a win/win, but am I missing something? Any questions you'd recommend I ask the loan agent?

CryptoCurrency,"Where’s all this, I told you so, crap coming from?","I’m reading all the crypto subs, not all, but here and Bitcoin, and so many people are talking about all the macro issues we failed to pay attention to and if we did, it wouldn’t be too hard to figure out btc was not going to go to $100k by end of year. Ok fine, crypto is underperforming, but wasn’t there also sentiment that crypto was the hedge against all the macro headwinds, like inflation and US dollar being printed to oblivion, and so crypto was the logical answer. And how the stock market was overpriced and the best hedge was to be in crypto because it’s not controlled by the rich and Wall Street, same with real estate. All the rhetoric, or a lot, was about how crypto was the hedge against all the establishment and government crap. Now all I’m seeing is how crypto is a risky asset tied into equities and monetary policy is of course going to screw crypto. Inflation is a problem so the feds will taper and then raise rates and thus there will lower crypto prices. Really? we kinda knew this actually and some of us were betting on crypto as a hedge. However, it is now apparent that crypto is just a risky asset (it always was) and just like everything traditional it is affected by macro headwinds. I don’t know if a decoupling will ever happen, but if crypto were going to replace gold as a store of value and safe haven during economic uncertainty, then let this be the time. Or not, I’m still dca dips.",cryptocurrency

Last week’s CPI data bolstered the growing expectation that the Fed could announce a faster tapering and earlier interest rate hike than initially planned. BTC is testing support at the 200-day MA, and if this expectation is realised, we could see a breakout to the downside and back towards $40,000. 

However, with the RSI approaching oversold territory, any decision that is less hawkish than anticipated might result in BTC prices bouncing as buyers step in to support price at the current levels.

It’ll be interesting to see how the final FOMC meeting of the year impacts the largest cryptocurrency in the world. Of course, all trading carries risk, and either outcome is likely to add a significant amount of volatility to the market.",cryptocurrency

I am angry at myself for helping her. She is a drug addict out there for god knows what.

If I hit the max this month, does my credit immediately go bad?

If I hit the max this month, but continue to make more than the minimum on time payments does my credit still not bad?

investing,Best stocks to fight inflation,"We all know inflation is real and it’s here to stay for the foreseeable future. As inflation picks up, we already know the FED will have to increase interest rates. The question is - how do we invest with this in mind? I’ve been questioning this for months now. 

I’ve heard two theories. The first states that inflation is no real concern for the stock market in general, in fact it states it’s actually good for the stock market. 

The second theory states that as inflation rises there tends to be an inverse relationship to stock market growth, and specifically company P/E ratios. Growth stocks tend to lose ground as P/E ratios come back down to earth. 

I tend to believe the second theory as it makes more sense to me. Low interest rates and easy money for the past decade have fueled a magnificent bull run. As rates go up, and money tightens, I believe we’ll likely see a pullback or correction in the market. To what extent? I do not know. 

So what do we do with this information? Which stocks or sectors do well during inflationary increases? From my research it’s been energy, oil, commodities, and gold. Will this trend prove to be true once again?

solana,Proposing a new Stablecoin lending platform on Solana,"Hi fellow developers! I am currently working on a new DeFi project on Solana. What we want to solve is the reward system of most DeFi platforms. For example, a lot of lending platforms provide reward tokens for borrowers, in order to reduce their net borrow interest rate, which will attract more borrowers to the platform. The problems with the system above are

1. Reward token holds no internal value (There is no reason for people to buy reward tokens)
2. Reward tokens are extremely inflationary
3. The lending protocol is not sustainable

As the reward tokens hold no usage or have a proper valuation, the liquidity will decrease continuously and at some point, the lending platform will not be able to provide the same rewards continuously.

What we are proposing is a stablecoin lending platform similar to MakerDAO on Ethereum.

Here are some definitions that we set

CBS : Abbreviation for ""Collateral Backed Stablecoin""

CBS Collateral Pool : A reserve pool where collateral that backs CBS are stored

[CBS Protocol Figure](https://preview.redd.it/svzpayq2tf581.png?width=981&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f81faf0df5df87da67d88797e56e1d9fadea78ce)

Basically, a user deposits tokens as collateral and mint CBS and borrows them at a 0% interest rate. As long as the collateral value stands higher than the minted value, CBS is backed by overcollateralized assets.

What if the LTV approaches 100%? We have thought deeply about liquidation. Our options were

1. Swap immediately to USDC at third-party platforms
2. Allow users to buy tokens at a discount, basically, we call this an ""Auction Pool""

Below is the process of liquidation (We set third-party as 1Sol for now)

&amp;#x200B;

[Liquidation Process](https://preview.redd.it/35fnt957uf581.png?width=1400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87323e4824c9ced0d9ddd797060a4164a512d356)

Basically, tokens that should be liquidated are sold at a 5% discount at the auction pool and the USDC/USDT are transferred back to the CBS Collateral Pool to secure the value of CBS. If there are remaining tokens that should be liquidated, they are swapped at third-party platforms and transferred back to the CBS Collateral Pool. Buy this, we can attract yield farming users as well as borrowers, where two entities support each other to gain profit.

The last part, which we want to highlight is the reward token or our native platform token. Below is our token stats, and we define it as LPFi token for now.

1. Initial Supply : 500M
2. Inflation Rate : 0.00809%/day = (2.98%/year when compounded)
3. Max Supply : Unlimited

This seems like an inflationary token, but it is actually not. LPFi token's main feature is that it can earn rewards when locked in CBS Collateral Pool, unlike other tokens. Basically, newly minted tokens are proportionally distributed to the locked assets, which means users can earn 5.96% APY if 50% of total LPFi tokens are locked.

The equation can be calculated as follows

&amp;#x200B;

Now, what makes the token deflationary?

1. The rewards are distributed to the locked assets, meaning it is not released as a market supply. Yes, users can withdraw the rewards and sell them, but reward tokens lower the LTV, which lowers the risk of borrowers. It makes it hard for users to sell the rewards.
2. Imagine you can simply buy a token, lock it, and borrow stablecoins at a 0% interest rate. Plus, you earn 6% APY on your locked tokens. Why would you sell it? If more users lock their tokens, the market supply will decrease rapidly.
3. It is hard for users to sell tokens that are locked as collateral. Most crypto investors who take loans, do not repay their borrowed amount. They basically HODL their tokens in the form of collateral and buy more with their borrowed stablecoins. To withdraw the locked collateral, user should close all positions, repay, and withdraw collaterals, which most users don't.

As explained above, the correlation of LPFi token and our CBS Protocol makes LPFi token deflationary despite its inflation rate.

This completely solves the problem we mentioned about lending platforms that offer reward tokens that have no value.

Following is the main services that our platform will provide

1. Borrow at 0% interest rate
2. Yield Farming by liquidating assets
3. Earn rewards by borrowing against platform token

This was our base idea on the new platform we are building, and we firmly believe this will be the new sustainable DeFi.

defi,Proposing a new Stablecoin Lending Platform on Solana,"Hello guys! I am currently working on a new DeFi project on Solana. What we want to solve is the reward system of most DeFi platforms. For example, a lot of lending platforms provide reward tokens for borrowers, in order to reduce their net borrow interest rate, which will attract more borrowers to the platform. The problems with the system above are

1. Reward token holds no internal value (There is no reason for people to buy reward tokens)
2. Reward tokens are extremely inflationary
3. The lending protocol is not sustainable

As the reward tokens hold no usage or have a proper valuation, the liquidity will decrease continuously and at some point, the lending platform will not be able to provide the same rewards continuously.

What we are proposing is a stablecoin lending platform similar to MakerDAO on Ethereum.

Here are some definitions that we set

stocks,Stocks’ Rough Patch Could End Soon. The Fed’s Next Move May Be Priced In...,"Stocks appear to be almost through a difficult stretch brought on by news that the Federal Reserve is removing support from markets and the economy. History tells us that a sustained rally will likely begin soon.  As of Dec. 1, the S&amp;P 500 had fallen 4.1% from the record high it reached on Nov. 18, only to rebound 4.4% to a new closing high of 4712.02 on Friday. Monday, it was slipping back, with a loss of 0.6% by midafternoon.

The volatility centers on the Fed’s effort to fight inflation by moving away from the aggressive efforts to bolster growth it put in place as the pandemic ravaged the economy in 2020. Not only is the central bank already reducing its monthly bond purchases by tens of billions of dollars a month, but Chairman Jerome Powell recently indicated even more cuts are on the way. Within months, the Fed will be buying zero dollars in Treasury bonds, compared with $65 billion a month as recently as November.

That could drag bond prices down, lifting their yields and making it more difficult for households and businesses to borrow money. Not only would that likely slow economic growth, but it also would mean less money will be flowing through financial markets, leaving less capital available to bid for stocks and other risky assets. And once the Fed has ended its bond-buying program, it will turn its attention to lifting short-term interest rates. But it is increasingly looking like the stock market has already factored in those moves. “The market began to discount eventual Fed tightening once supply chain effects became clearer this past spring, and as inflation compares began to accelerate,” Scott Chronert, global head of exchange-traded fund research at Citigroup, wrote in a research note Friday. “Selling the uncertainty ahead of a hawkish Fed change can often lead to buying on the alleviation of that uncertainty.”

personalfinance,What to do with house down-payment now that I'm not buying a house soon,"Decided to pause trying to save/buy for a house for several reasons. (Originally wanted to buy within the next 6-12 months).

 The first is that I'm not ready to commit to a location (job vs family vs school districts) for my future. This is the main factor currently. I also like where I rent and my landlord is great.

Second, I know the housing market can either keep inflating or come down over the next few years. I don't want to force a purchase just because interest rates are low, though. 

Third, recently engaged with a 2023 wedding. I'd rather wait now until we're legally married to purchase a home based on advice from this sub.

Fourth, I'd rather take time and save up more. I have 40k saved with housing in my area at (an inflated) 300k minimum right now for a fixer upper.  And I just recently learned from my friends who are first time buyers just how expensive maintenance can be.... (new roof, plumbing, etc). It'll also give more time for my FH to save more on his end.

I still plan on buying a house in 3-5 years. Should I keep this down payment money in a HYSA or is there another vehicle that's better?

I want to clarify that this 40k is not including retirement, emergency funds, or a ""regular"" savings account for things like vacation/Christmas gifts/etc. This 40k is strictly extra money aside for a down payment.",finance
CryptoCurrency,"We’re about to find out who in crypto is really ‘in it for the tech’. Gotta ask in times like these, who is in it for tech or the money...or both ? or none ? What's the main reason you are in this space and do a few weeks in the red change anything in your mindset ?","Since we are a few weeks into the red, there is an article back from the May 2021 crash that came to my mind. 

In an article by Joe Weisenthal after he stated that: 

""There’s a recurring joke on Crypto Twitter where everytime there’s a plunge, people say they’re “**in it for the tech**.” Basically in boom times, everyone’s excited about making insane amounts of money day after day after day. But when the line goes down, **suddenly people pretend to care more about abstract ideas of decentralization, sound money, fighting the Fed, censorship-free transactions, human rights and so forth.""**  


He further depicts **three categories** of Crypo Investors: 

""This is really the spectrum. There’s a lot of extremely ideological Bitcoin people. People who dislike fiat currency. People who believe that individuals should have the right to transact with each other on an Alice-to-Bob basis, without some third party saying it’s not allowed. People who, above all, want to hold an asset that’s free from seizure or debasement. **That’s category one**.

**The third category,** Meme Coins, is what I wrote about yesterday. There’s almost no discernable ideology there other than gambling and making money on an unregulated market that’s somewhere between a casino and a pretend stock market -- except with real money. These are pure YOLO traders, in it for money. And maybe for the fun. But they’re not “in it for the tech” in some obvious way.

  
And then that **middle category** is a blend of both. This is the world that’s mostly being built upon the Ethereum platform, and there’s all kinds of cool stuff in terms of market structure, lending, staking and different ways of conceptualizing governance. **But also there’s a lot of gambling there too. The recently launched Shiba coin, which rocketed towards billions of dollars in value, simply as a parody of Dogecoin, was launched on Ethereum and traded on Uniswap.**""

In the end he sums it up with: 

""Of course there's no obvious bright line between someone who’s in it for the technology and someone who just wants to make money and the reason for that is the people who are in it for the tech have made unbelievable gobs of money over the last decade, so you could be into both. And although there's a spectrum, **participants of all kinds exist on both ends**.""

CryptoCurrency,Guide to Algorand and New Developments,"Well, the best way to find out is to research and experience the ecosystem first hand. So I wanted to provide a snapshot into my experience along with some interesting developments. There is a fine line between shilling and sharing, so I'm going to do my best to share for those who want to explore it.

The first step would be to set up a My Algo desktop wallet, and for the sake of repetition: don't lose or share your seed phrase. You could easily get started with like $5-10 worth of Algo. Since the fees are so cheap, you could make a lot of trades and explore without losing much.

From there, [https://tinyman.org/](https://tinyman.org/) is the swap. [https://tinychart.org/](https://tinychart.org/) is where to view the ASAs (Algorand Standard Assets) and prices. I like the general feel that many of the use cases are attempting to be helpful in nature, with things like Planet Watch or Clean Ocean Token. Even their animal meme coins like Kitten Coin donate to shelters. There are rug pulls or projects that won't pan out, but in general the community tries to be on top of things like that and call them out when they see them.

The two ASAs I like the most are Choice Coin [https://choice-coin.com/](https://choice-coin.com/) bringing voting to the blockchain and Chips [https://algo-casino.com/](https://algo-casino.com/). Both very new and highly speculative but I like where they are heading and the developments so far.

Yieldly [https://yieldly.finance/](https://yieldly.finance/) is another big part of the ecosystem where you can stake yieldly or other assets at fairly high yields. Choice coin is currently at 840% APY, which is obscene. It will go down once more people pool, but for now it is just nuts. There is no locking period, daily rewards, and the cost to claim rewards is 0.002 Algos.

What else. Algofi [https://www.algofi.org/](https://www.algofi.org/) is launching this Friday. Its a lending market, earn interest, borrow, etc., like Aave. Lofty is also pretty cool [https://www.lofty.ai/](https://www.lofty.ai/). You can pool money to buy real estate, which isn't a new concept, but new to the blockchain.

The first governance period is ending this month, so in the next couple weeks would be the time to stake Algos for round 2. Next year they plan to phase out staking rewards for simply holding Algo in your wallet, so this would be the way to go for rewards. This also keeps Algorand forkless and give the community a voice. [https://governance.algorand.foundation/governance-period-1](https://governance.algorand.foundation/governance-period-1) Gotta hold the whole time to claim the rewards at the end.

Decipher recently ended which was a 2 day event outlining the future of Algo. Much of their roadmap looks promising, particularly their work with Latin American governments. Some of it is speculation right now, but I like how the Chivo wallet was built on Algorand. Hopefully more to come.

If you are new I hope this helped, if you're an algonaut please add to anything I missed, and if you are involved something like ONE or MATIC and just don't care about Algo then props to you, cause those projects are also pretty dope.

Edit: I forgot about Algomint! We now have wrapped BTC and wrapped ETH. It’s about as good as a duck stuffed in a chicken stuffed in a turkey.",cryptocurrency
altcoin,CryptoQuestion - Weekly Staking and Yield Farming Review — 9th December 2021,"I've copied and pasted in CryptoQuestion Weekly Staking Review. Very interesting, take a look

CryptoQuestion - Weekly Staking and Yield Farming Review —  9th December 2021

The world of DeFi has been abuzz with talk about regulation recently.

Here is a quick overview of what has been happening and what implications this will have on investors.

The influential FATF (FinancialAction Task Force) **wants governments to hold the people behind DeFi protocols accountable**. This will send the shivers down the backs of the many platforms that have decided on anonymity. This proposal is not likely to come in for some time but it is something that we can see being implemented and ruthlessly enforced.

In another attack on the DeFi space. BlockFi, which offers high interest rates to investors, is being **investigated by the SEC**. The SEC considers that BlockFi’s interest accounts represent the offering of unregistered securities, something that no doubt the SEC will use to target many other high profile yield farming platforms in the near future.

eToro announced it was **delisting Cardano** by the end of the year for US customers as it believes the coin could represent security.

A few weeks ago we revealed the SEC’s inquiry into Uniswap. That alone has massive implications for the rest of the industry with the likes of Pancakeswap likely to be on the SEC’s radar.

The best action investors can do right now is avoid investing in DeFi projects which are conducting investment business within the US. These are likely to be targeted by regulators and that will have a significant impact on their tokens value.

As far as staking and yield farming is concerned investors would be wise to keep any bets to the short term avoiding any long term Certificate of Deposit type arrangements and other long term crypto investment plans.

This week’s APRs from leading staking and yield farming platforms [https://cryptoquestion.tech/staking-and-yield-farming-weekly-review/](https://cryptoquestion.tech/staking-and-yield-farming-weekly-review/)

This week saw a return to normality for Pancakeswap and Sushi who’s platforms in the previous few weeks were offering returns of thousands of percent.

**CAKE’s** [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pancakeswap/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pancakeswap/) highest return was Eternal-BSB with an APR of 686%. Eternal is a $70 million play to earn game.

The highest APR on **Sushi’s** platform is 373% from ATTR-WETH. ATTR is a $31 million project that can be used to track any asset on any blockchain in the crypto space.

Pancakeswap is offering a generous 75% for staking its own currency CAKE, which compares to 25% for staking SUSHI on Sushi’s platform.

It was pleasing to see a new easier to use UI on **Yearn’s** platform which clearly displayed its highest APRs among one of its most prominent features.

**Auto** is offering what appears a very attractive 998% APR by staking WBNB-CAKE. This is worth further investigation.

Finally **Venus’** 49% APR for staking BNB seems an attractive proposition if you are a holder and fan of BNB.",cryptocurrency

# [Stock futures slip lower ahead of key inflation data, Fed meeting](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/13/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock index futures were marginally lower during morning trading Tuesday after the major averages started the week in the red as Covid omicron fears hit sentiment.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the S&amp;P 500 futures declined 0.13% while and Nasdaq 100 futures were off by nearly 0.5%. Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average bounced between gains and losses.
*****
&gt; Tesla shares were among the biggest early droppers on the S&amp;P 500, falling 2.3% premarket after CEO Elon Musk announced that that he has sold another $906.5 million in shares.
*****
&gt; Fellow automaker Ford also fell, down 2.2% following news that by 2030 Toyota would be investing $35 billion into battery-powered electronic vehicles, a space where Ford has sought to establish itself as a leader. Toyota itself declined even more, with shares off 3.4% premarket.
*****
&gt; Pfizer shares rose nearly 1% after final results of tests on its Covid drug showed it reduced hospitalizations and deaths by 89% in high-risk patients.
*****
&gt; The market will get fresh inflation data Tuesday when November’s producer price index number is reported. Economists are expecting it to show that prices rose 0.5% for the month, according to estimates from Dow Jones. This would be a slight slowdown from October’s 0.6% increase.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve also kicks off its two-day meeting on Tuesday. The central bank will release a statement on Wednesday with quarterly projections for the economy, inflation and interest rates. Chairman Jerome Powell will also hold a press conference.
*****
&gt; Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman told CNBC on Monday that he thinks the central bank should start raising rates soon.
*****
&gt; “The Federal Reserve would be better off storing away some of rate increases, so when the inevitable turn down comes, you’ve got some ammunition to fight with,” he said. “At the moment, at zero interest rates, we have no ammunition.”
*****
&gt; Investors will be watching closely for commentary around if the Fed plans to accelerate the end of its bond-buying program. At present, the central bank’s asset purchase program will end in June 2022, but several officials have spoken about ending the purchases sooner.
*****
&gt; “So far the bond market has given the Fed a pass on inflation — whether it will continue to do so is in doubt,” noted Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at All Star Charts. “The real fireworks coming from the meeting are likely to be around expectations for rate hikes in 2022,” he added.
*****
&gt; The latest CNBC Fed Survey showed that investment professionals and economists expect the Fed to wind down its asset purchases by March and begin rate hikes in June.
*****
&gt; During trading Monday, the Dow slid 0.89%, or 320 points, while the S&amp;P 500 dipped 0.9%. The Nasdaq Composite fell 1.39% as investors rotated out of technology stocks with high valuations.
*****
&gt; Shares of airlines and cruise line operators declined amid fears that the omicron variant could slow travel.
*****
&gt; While equities fell broadly on Monday, growth areas of the market underperformed. The iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF dipped 1.22%, while the iShares Russell 1,000 Value ETF declined 0.45%.
*****
&gt; Despite Monday’s decline for equities, the S&amp;P 500 is roughly 1.6% below its Nov. 22 all-time intraday high. The Dow is 2.5% below its record, while the Nasdaq Composite is about 5% under its high-water mark. The Russell 2000 index is down a sharper 11.3% since its Nov. 8 high.
*****
&gt; Looking forward, some strategists, including LPL Financial’s Ryan Detrick, believe there’s upside ahead for equities.
*****
&gt; “We believe pent-up demand, gradual improvement in supply chain challenges, solid labor force growth, and productivity gains will all contribute to another year of above-trend economic growth in 2022,” he wrote in a note to clients. “COVID-19-related risks remain and the potential for a policy mistake may be elevated as the economy moves towards normalization, but we think the overall environment will be supportive of business growth and ultimately equity markets,” he added.

personalfinance,"Tell me my plan sucks, but also tell me if it will work!","Alright, 

The Situation: 
Current Gross Income: 46k/yr individual, 100k/yr joint with my Wife
Individual current total debt: $19783. 

My wife and I are both moving at the end of the year for me to attend schooling for a new career. I say ""school"" but this is more of vocational training. No Degree is awarded, and it is not through a degree-awarding institution or university, so unfortunately no federal aid, or private ""school"" loans are avilable... (If you know of a lender that will provide deferred loans for a student of a healthcare institution that is not degree-awarding please let me know!)

Wife has job at new location making 65k/yr, and due to the nature of my training I will not be able to hold any formal job. I am going to try to work uber eats or something as much as possible, but no formal job can be held by me unfortunately. Wife has agreed to pay for housing, most living costs etc... I'm just going to help when I have a few extra bucks. 

My creditors obviously don't care about me going to school, and they still want their money. 

School is 18months at the end of which I can expect to begin working right away with an individual starting salary of about 100-115k/yr depending on which area of the country we move to. 

Current total monthly payments toward debt: 760/mo
Averaged Interest rate of debt: 15.43%, which spikes to 19.8% upon the expiration of two promotional periods which end while i'll be in school. 
Credit utilization average: 65%
Credit Score: 720s-730s

The Plan: 

I have been offered a debt consolidation loan for 20k at 8% for a term of 6 years. Monthly Payments expected to be about $350. Loan is unsecured and no early payment penalties. 
I've calculated that if I were  to only make the minimum payments for the full term, the loan would cost me just over 25k total. 

Additionally I'm getting a 5k family loan from my dad. 

What I am thinking of doing is consolidating all of my debt onto the consolidation loan, and paying the monthly payments using the family loan for the 18 months I'm in school. The 5K will only cover about 14 of those months, so i'll need to come up with an extra $1400, but I have faith I can do that somehow. 

Once I'm out of school, I'll have 4.5 years left on the consolidation loan to pay back essentially 25k, and 2 years to pay back the 5k family loan which would be just under $700/mo, which should be doable on a 100k/yr salary. 

During these 18 months I'm well aware that I'm not actually paying off any of my debt, however by doing this plan, I can guarantee that I wont default on any of my creditors and ruin my financial future, and secure an interest rate nearly half of what it is now. 

Essentially I'll be paying 5k in interest to do a ""backdoor"" deferment on my debt for a year and half. The benefit to this is coming out with a new/better career making over 2x my current salary starting, and the potential to make over 3x my current salary at my career midpoint. 

Can anyone see any holes in my plan or come up with something better? 

Thank you in advance!!!

TLDR: Want to take a consolidation loan to create a backdoor deferment of my debt for 1.5 years. Will cost me 5k in the long run, but lead to 2-3x my current salary.",finance

As a result, I am receiving money. The money is nothing crazy but it’s about $90k but it definitely helps my financial situation. I currently only make around $XXk/year.

The ESOP money was intended for retirement purposes. However, I am a 20 something single person with debt. Currently, I have around $37k in student loans, $115k mortgage (didn’t put 20% down payment so I pay PMI) both around 3% interest rate. I have $730 remaining on my car loan at 7% interest. I financed $4.5k in furniture at 0% interest and am paying  $139/month.

I only have about $5k of an emergency fund. 

For tax reason’s, it would be smarter to roll the ESOP payout into Roth IRA or my 401k. I have the option to rollover into a retirement account, take a lump sum, or take a partial lump sum.

Would it make sense to take some of this money to put towards my debt or increasing my emergency fund?

I’m not concerned about the furniture debt since it is 0% interest or car loan because that will be paid off in the next couple months. My main concerns are eliminating PMI, increasing my emergency fund, &amp;amp; eliminating student loans.

Summary: 

A wave of programs intended to boost loans from European banks has has left Euro banks flush with cash and little opportunity for investment. The situation has driven the same banking institutions to look over seas for places to park cash.

The process has caused a significant demand for USD as European banks move Euros to Dollars  to earn 0.05% in deposits with the Fed. even with a strengthening dollar and paying a premium for euro cross-currency basis swaps, the opportunity continues to look attractive to European banks whom were able to borrow from the ECB at -1.0%.

Analysts expect this trend to diminish after the first of the year once banks year end balance sheets are set and in anticipation of additional treasury supply following the Feds tapering &amp; increased debt ceiling.

The relative recent strength of the USD and the potential for slowdowns in Dollar demand from Europe could provide an opportunity to rebalance existing US Equity/Int'l Equity positions that have become out of sync due to dollar strength and the relative equity performance over the past year.",finance

stocks,"Do you believe the yield curve will invert in 2022, and what are the implications for the market if it does?","We're in strange times with the pandemic and unprecedented levels of stimulus in the economy. Over the the last week I've started hearing people talk about the yield curve again, and some have even gone so far as to suggest an inversion is now likely.

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y

Historically the yield curve has been one of our most accurate predictors of recession and although it briefly inverted in 2019, it quickly steepened after the FED stepped in to support markets in late 2019, and again during the height of 2020 pandemic.

However, over the course of 2021 the yield curve has once again started to flatten and is now beginning to edge closer to a potential inversion. And unlike in 2019/2020 I would assume there is far less the FED can do to support markets today given the need to control inflation.

My wife and I also have $150k in federal student loans, but we're both on PSLF. She has about 4.5 years left and I have about 8. We are recently debt free besides the student loans and a mortgage and have decided we want to start putting away for our daughter's college fund.

So... we DON'T have IRAs or 403(b)s funded currently because we have a pretty lucrative pension that we pay into. It's notoriously one of the most generous in the state and needless to say, we won't need any extra retirement accounts. Having said that, we're likely going to be opening an IRA for additional savings since... ya know.... why not?

But here is our question: Does it even make sense to start investing in a 529 before we max out an IRA and 403(b) from a tax standpoint? Like... By the time my daughter will be in college, I'll be 46, so obviously still a ways off from the 59 1/2 needed to start withdrawing from an IRA, but like... would it make sense to still just contribute to the IRA, take out student loans (as needed... and just federal and Parent PLUS), pay the standard repayment on those until I either (a) pay them off or (b) hit 59 1/2 and just take out the IRA money and pay it off.

a 529 is obviously more geared towards what I want to do, but maybe the tax benefits of an IRA are too good to pass up?

personalfinance,"First time home buyer, in family purchase","Hello /r/personalfinance!

Long-time listener, first-time caller.  

I come to you today seeking advice.  My brother and I are looking to purchase a townhome from our other family members.  The townhome was originally owned by my grandfather, who passed away some years ago.  The home is currently held in a land trust, where my father is the executor (is that the right term?  he has all the power).  There are additional beneficiaries associated with the land trust in addition to my father, which would be my uncle and some of my cousins.  

The home has a rough appraisal of $215,000-$230,000.  My family members have been nice enough to agree upon a final sale price of $194,400 to my brother and me.  My father has also been kind enough to gift us his share of the proceeds of the sale - a tidy sum of $64,800.  My intent is to use a portion of this $64,800 as a downpayment for the home purchase and to cover some of the closing costs and cut down on the mortgage payment a bit.

I have been discussing this purchase with a loan officer at my bank (PNC).  To avoid PMI, we would need a minimum downpayment of $38,800.  He provided an itemized list of estimated closing costs at $7,930.  The closing costs are unavoidable, I think, so let's take those off the top of our lump sum.  This leaves a remainder of $56,870.  

The loan officer originally suggested this scenario:

* Sales price  $225,100
* Equity gift  from seller $25,100
* Seller paid closing costs for buyer $5600
* Seller nets $194,400 after equity gift and paying buyer closing costs
* Loan amount $180,080 (80% loan-to-value ratio, no MI)
* 3.125% interest rate - no points


This seems like a roundabout way of cutting down on the downpayment needed for the purchase.  My questions are:

* Is there a better way to structure this?
* The closing costs seem high to me, but of course I have very little experience on the subject.
* Is PNC a good choice?  I have also been speaking with Rocket Mortgage, but they seem a bit shady and very aggressive.

""Bond investors have digested the Fed’s policy pivot on inflation by pricing a speed-up in tapering, earlier rate hikes and a quashing of the “terminal rate”—the fed funds rate at which tightening ends. Low terminal rates should keep equity valuations aloft, especially for high growth companies. Though bond investors seem to back the Global Investment Committee’s (GIC) call for a hotter-but-shorter cycle, they fail to recognize that growth is apt to be better than average and inflation is likely to moderate. Specifically, the currently discounted 2.0% terminal rate ignores favorable demographics, increased capital investment, stronger household and banking system balance sheets, and sustained fiscal spending. In our view, the terminal rate is 2.5%, the 10-year US Treasury yield approaches 2.1% by year-end 2022 and equity market leadership shifts to value-style and cyclical stocks. Fed policy divergence versus other central banks is driving up the dollar, which should cool inflation. Consider using market strength to reposition away from long duration and growth/rate sensitive stocks to quality cyclical growth stocks at reasonable valuations. Sell high, buy low.""",finance

The stock market edged lower again on Tuesday, though showed some signs of life in the last two hours of the session as market participants digest new inflationary data and look ahead to the Fed’s final monetary policy meeting decision of the year tomorrow. 

**Notable Numbers Today**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -0.68%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -1.04%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.25%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.84%
* Volatility Index (VIX): +1.25%
* Microsoft (MSFT): -3.22%

A new report by the Department of Labor showed the wholesale prices were up a record 9.6% in November from a year earlier. This follows the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which rose 6.8% from a year earlier.

After a two day meeting, The Fed will release their monetary policy statement, a press conference with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and an updated Summary of Economic Projections (first update since September of this year). This outlines member’s expectations for economic conditions and interest rates over the next few years. 

Economists are expecting the Fed to increase the rate of tapering of their asset-purchasing program (known as quantitative easing). For more than a year-and-a-half during the pandemic, the Fed bought Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) at a clip of $120 billion per month, with this program comprising a key tool in supporting the virus-stricken economy. Last month,[ the Fed began winding down this program, ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-fomc-monetary-policy-decision-november-2021-140503059.html)slowing its purchases by $15 billion per month in each of November and December as the economy showed signs that it could continue to recover from the pandemic without the added monetary policy support. 

Deutsche Bank economist Matthew Luzzetti said, “We expect the Fed to announce a doubling in the pace of tapering at the December FOMC meeting, bringing the monthly drawdown to $20 billion and $10 billion per month for Treasuries and MBS, respectively. This would conclude the tapering process in March and open up greater optionality for an earlier liftoff.”

Moody’s, one of the main American credit rating agencies, said ""The Federal Reserve is leading the charge with more aggressive asset tapering on the back of inflation being less transitory than initially thought. The first hike in the federal funds rate is expected by September 2022.” 

PIMCO managing director and portfolio manager Sonali Pier said that the firm expects to see two hikes in 2022, three hikes in 2023, and potentially four in 2024, with the Fed trying to bring the policy rate to neutral.

A lot of new economic data due this week. November retail sales, which are expected to show a +0.8% increase and new housing market data will be released Wednesday.

personalfinance,I think my mom might have misunderstood some things with her new mortgage,"EDIT: Problem solved. Long story short, if the math I presented below *was* correct, then yes, she shouldn't go through with the refinance, but others were better at math than I am and realized that the $550/month payments would mean she had 20 years left on the loan. When I asked her about this, she finally went and looked through the paperwork, saw this was the case. She then remembered this would be her *second* refi on the mortgage. The first one was 10 years ago (and was another 30 year loan. So she still has *20* years left on it, not 15 like I'd thought). 

So TLDR, it seems that yes doing this new refinance will actually work in her favor...just not for the reasons she thought. Thanks so much, y'all!! 


Hi all,

So my mom told me today that she just signed the paperwork to refinance her mortgage to a lower rate. Seemed fine. But then she told me what her monthly payments were and I think something doesn't add up, so let me walk you through it. I'm curious if I'm missing something or if she's now going to pay more. 

For reference: I'm going to use the phrase ""current mortgage"" for her existing mortgage and ""new mortgage"" for the refinanced mortgage paperwork she just signed (which she apparently can cancel within 3 days).  ​

She has been paying her current 30 year mortgage for 15 years (15 years and a few months actually). She still owes $86,993. The interest rate is 4.5%. Her monthly payment is $550. 

She saw that interest rates are lower, so opted to refinance. She chose a 15 year mortgage at a rate of 2.85% She would owe $92,600 on it (my understanding is that the costs of the refinance were put into the loan). The monthly payment would be $633. 

*See tables below* 

So here's where I'm confused. At first, she claimed that she would be saving money because a 15 year loan would mean she'd pay less in the long term. However, I said that, because she's already paid 15 year of the 30 year loan, all she'd be doing by switching to the new loan would be to raising her monthly payments, which will inevitably mean she pays more in the end. 

She then said that, when she compared it (I believe based on a online calculator or the lender's site), it said that her current 30 year mortgage would cost her more overall. I then asked if the that was over life the of the loan (so, 30 years) or took into account that she's already halfway through the 30 year mortgage. She didn't know. But then she looked at the monthly math and now thinks I'm correct. 

Please assume that, with whichever option, she pays the minimum payment each month. We've discussed her making additional payments, but that's another conversation. 

**So, am I right? In this case, would she pay more if she continued down this refinance path with the new mortgage? Or am I missing something here?** 

Thanks in advance to all for reading and giving feedback! 

**Current Mortgage**

* Amount remaining: $86,933

* Interest Rate: 4.5%

* Remaining payments left: ~180

* Monthly payments: $550

personalfinance,Refinancing Federal student loans before deferment ends,"Hi all, with the help of my parents, I screwed myself over badly with loans for an undergrad degree.

With deferment ending next month, I was looking to refinance those fed loans into my private loan consolidation. I am using SoFi Mohela, and without doing a hard pull on my credit they offered me a 4.13% rate for the full principal of $66k. 

Is the 4.13% because of my increased income, the increase in principal, the current interest rates of 0% on my fed loans, or a combination of each?

investing,The Market Outlook in 2022,"I'm interested in everyone's expectations in the market next year as we enter into an interesting situation with inflation, supply constraints, constant pent-up demand, interest rate hikes (later), and faster tapering.

I'll give my expectations here first

I think that inflation will remain fairly high through 2022 but it won't be at the levels that it is now, maybe around 3-4%, which puts most bonds at negative real rates right now, forcing investors if they want a real return to go into the equity markets and/or chase high yield bonds.

When the federal reserve starts hiking interest rates I personally don't expect that they will raise them at a very fast pace however if inflation doesn't start taming down they might. When rates rise the risk-free rate rises and its effect on equities is usually bad. As the discount rate rising the price that investors are willing to purchase a security will decrease or at least for institutional investors won't which of course make up most of the market. I think that may not be the case next year however because if investors still need to go into the equity market to chase real returns, the equities should still rise. I'm worried that equities are already in a slight bubble and that another year of these returns could show a market correction back down. If I was a betting man I would assume that within the next 1-3 years there will be a negative return in the S&amp;P500 which has only happened once in the last 12 years.

Investors still can't enter into the bond market without giving up a return. Sure an investor can buy futures contracts on treasuries because they expect an upward shift in the yield curve, which I expect to happen, to get a higher yield and decrease their interest rate risk. However, if you cannot accurately predict when the fed is done raising rates then that won't help you as when you are obligated to buy those treasuries you will have interest rate risk issues. Buying short-term bonds to help with duration would help that problem but those also will more than likely result in a negative real return anyways if inflation doesn't cool off and the equity should've been the move anyways.

I would say that the Financial Services sector will benefit from the rising yields especially as corps and people demand large purchases as demand is hot.

I would also say that Industrials and Cyclicals will outperform as demand will drive the Cyclicals and the Industrials from infrastructure and servicing the demand in Cyclicals.

I think that elevated Materials prices will fall, hurting that sector.

Staples could be a hedge against a downturn in the market which I expect in the coming years.

Technology and communication services may have a bumpy road ahead with rising rates because the discount rate increasing hurts them the worst. Comm services wouldn't be as greatly affected but because of high tech companies in the space. More value may be the direction to take.

I'm always bullish on healthcare as innovations and rising populations will always benefit that sector. I may change my focus away from Biotech and into more stable earning healthcare companies.

Personally, I think Value over Growth or at least blend.

And this is of course not financial advice just my personal opinions on the market next year.",finance

This topic is important for you to address with your elders and doubly important if you don't want to leave an eff'n mess for your kids.

1) My wife had Power of Atty for her mom. This expired immediately upon her death... and the only original copy of her will was in a safe deposit box. That took an audit with the bank and a MONTH to resolve. Make sure your executor has an ORIGINAL, NOTORIZED copy of your will.

2) Beneficiaries, as FIREful mentioned, are OUTSIDE of the estate. Make sure these are correct.

3) GET YOUR POWER OF ATTY AND HEALTHCARE POWER OF ATTY IN PLACE. My dad didn't have the healthcare power in place, but he was in such bad shape the hospital was glad to have anyone say ""I'll be the responsible party"". If anyone could have shown up to challenge my decisions it could have been even worse that it was (and making life/death decisions for a parent you love is awful enough).

5) Finances, accounts, passwords. DON'T make someone try to figure out where everything is. Make an end-of-life document that you update yearly to let your executor know everything they need to know. If you have a password manager, put the master password in your safe/safe deposit box/etc so your executor can get to everything. If you put it in a personal safe, make sure your executor knows the code or at least gift them a seriously large DRILL.

personalfinance,VA Car Dealer States Lender Refuses to Abide by Previously Agreed Terms,"Good Evening, r/personalfinance

Looking for some advice, tips, or potential recourse to the issues I am having with my recent car purchase.

TL;DR at bottom if you choose not to read the full thing.

For some background, I was in the market for a new car after the car that I had was totaled in an accident in October. I was searching around for a new vehicle pretty much the rest of the month. 

Through my research, I received a pre-approval from Westlake Financial on a used, 2017 Fiat 124 Spider that was located at a used car dealership (non-Fiat dealer) in Virginia. The pre-approval had noted that the down payment was $1400, for a 23.29% rate, on a 72 month loan. Before I go on, let me just say that, yes, I am aware this is absurd, but I have prior credit issues that result in these high rates. I am the kind of person who doesn't mind a high interest rate at long as the payment is affordable compared to my monthly budget, so please spare any comments or remarks about ""fix your credit and try again"" or ""debt consolidation works wonders"" or ""you're just paying more money to the bank, and that's BAD.""

 That's not the point of this post, the point is the myriad of issues with the deal AFTER receiving those terms...

&amp;#x200B;

The dealership called me later that day to have me complete a finance application on their website, and to send over documents for the lender, such as my DL, 4 references, a couple of paystubs, and proof of insurance. No problem, forwarded these over within 20 minutes of that call, and the dealer went to work. 

The dealer then called me a couple days later and stated that the lender would not approve the deal with $1400 down, but WOULD approve the deal at $1500, with the same interest rate and payments, as well as the length of the loan. They said that this wasn't the lender being ""petty"" but just happened to be the ""financing tier"" that I fell into. Fine, no big deal, let them know that I am okay with the extra $100 down as long as everything else is the same, and told the dealer that I would fly up the following Friday (I live in FL) to take delivery of the vehicle, IF everything was approved, and then drive back home. The dealer said they would get it done, since those were the terms the lender came back with. Purchased insurance for the vehicle accordingly the next Monday, and called the day before my flight to confirm everything was good. Dealer states that everything is approved, and the car will be ready for me to pick up when I get there. Flew up, got to the dealer, signed all the paperwork with the original terms that were communicated by phone, and drove back home. I signed everything on November 5th, and drove home that same night. 

Fast forward to the day after Thanksgiving (21 days after the contract was signed) when I am inquiring with the dealer about not having received my permanent registration yet, the dealer informs me that the lender has rejected the terms, and states they are ""not good enough"". I tell the dealer to renegotiate with the lender and to send me whatever they come back with so I can review, and either approve or deny. The dealer sends a new contract to my email through Docusign, which I review. The loan TERM has been changed, to 66 months instead of the originally agreed upon 72 months, which has now bumped the payments up about $20, but the interest rate remained the same, at the same 23.29%. This also pushed my first payment out to January. No problem, $20 isn't going to make or break my budget or ability to pay, so I sign where needed and forward it on. 

The dealer contacted me again today (December 14th, over a month since the original deal was negotiated and signed) to let me know that the lender has AGAIN refused to proceed with the deal, and that after negotiations between the dealer's ""head of finance"" and ""the VP of Westlake"" (THE VP, mind you. Who that is, I have no idea) that Westlake has refused to proceed with any further negotiations, and won't process the loan due to ""unacceptable terms"" and the fact that the ""original approval has now expired"". Keep in mind, this is the same approval that the same lender provided earlier, when the dealer had stated everything was approved and all I had to do was sign.

The dealer followed up later in the day to see if I can get a cosigner within the ""next day or two"", otherwise I will need to either:

 A. Return the vehicle to one of their FL stores, which ""based on your address are only about 90 minutes away from you"", or 

B. Have them come pick up the vehicle if ""transportation from one of our FL stores proves to be difficult for you after you return the vehicle"". 

I know situations like these can sometimes be legit, but other times are complete scams (yo yo financing), but something about this doesn't seem right to me, given that the lender had revised the deal twice, and then reneged on their own approval, and refuses to do anything else. 

Any tips, insight, or advice you guys can provide would be much appreciated, as I am looking and open to all options. 

Thanks!

TL;DR - Virginia car dealer stated I was approved for certain terms after I had provided them a pre-approval from a lender. Took a day off work and flew to VA to sign and drive the car home to FL. Dealer then later states (after a month of having the car) that those terms are no longer acceptable to the lender. New agreement is negotiated with slightly higher payment due to a shorter term, but same interest rate. This agreement is then reneged again today by ""the lender"", who refuses to do any more negotiating, and the dealer is now requesting a cosigner within the ""next day or two"", or return of the vehicle.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Lawmakers are torn about how to regulate cryptocurrency. But that hasn't stopped some members of Congress and their senior staffers from investing in it,""" At least one senator and four US House representatives have bought stock in cryptocurrency-related companies or invested with brokerage firms that work with this emerging market, according to an Insider analysis of federal records detailing the lawmakers' personal finances for 2020.

""Meanwhile, Congress has been introducing legislative proposals aimed at better regulating crypto. "" and trying to get us to pay unrealized gains!! How does that make sense?

personalfinance,"I returned an expensive purchase and was given the amount back as a credit, but now I need that credit back into my checking account. The bank refused, but is that legal?","I bought an expensive laptop in October on a credit card and the amount went on my statement when it shipped in November as expected. My bill was due the first week of December, but I decided to go with another model instead, ordered that, then waited to return the first laptop until just after I paid off my card (I expected there to be a delay in the refund and didn't want to get hit with interest so I thought it'd make more sense to pay it off first to avoid that). 

Fast forward to now, I returned the laptop on Friday and get the refund posted to my account on Monday evening. I assumed there would be a process to then transfer this 'credit' back into my checking account, but when I couldn't find an easy option in my banking app, I did some googling and then called my card issuer (same bank as my checking account). After some back and forth I was told point blank that they will not transfer it to my checking account or write me a check for the amount, rather it will stay there as a negative credit (which even sounds confusing) until I spend it down over the next several months. It's a huge amount, which is ridiculous, and I can't easily pay off other cards with it which is a huge headache.

However, from what I've read, their refusal seems like it may not be legal? [Here is what Experian has to say](https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/how-do-credit-card-refunds-work/) which describes my situation well:

&gt; What if you have a really big negative balance? For example, suppose you normally spend $50 a month on a credit card, but one day you use it to buy a $2,000 sofa that you decide to return. Using up the $2,000 credit from the return could take a long time if you don't normally spend much on that card. If you'd rather have the cash in hand, you can ask the credit card company to issue a refund via check, direct deposit or money order. Under federal law, the credit card issuer is required to honor this request; however, some companies will ask you to make the request in writing. 

And [here is the law in question from the CFPB:](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/regulations/1026/11/)

&gt; (a) Credit balances. When a credit balance in excess of $1 is created on a credit account (through transmittal of funds to a creditor in excess of the total balance due on an account, through rebates of unearned finance charges or insurance premiums, or through amounts otherwise owed to or held for the benefit of the consumer), the creditor shall: 

(1) Credit the amount of the credit balance to the consumer's account;

(2) Refund any part of the remaining credit balance within seven business days from receipt of a written request from the consumer;

Is this law applicable in my situation? If this was like $100 in credit, then I wouldn't bother with it, but it's several thousand and I really need to be able to do with this money as I please, without a bank transfer fee.",finance
personalfinance,Question about paying the mortgage off early,"I'm playing around with numbers in regards to paying off my mortgage early, and I'm wondering if this would be a good idea, or a bad financial decision.  

I own a multi unit that I live in.  There is roughly still 27.5 years left on the mortgage. I'll be 34 in January.  It is my first home, and because of restrictions at the time buying it, I didn't put down much to purchase (5%) and did a 30 year mortgage.  It was a pre-covid purchase, so the interest rate is 4.5%, which I know is high compared to what is available right now. I'm in that weird limbo being that since it is a multi unit, I need to have 30% of the home value paid off before I can refinance, which I could do in about two years time, but there is no guarantee interest rates will still be this low.  If they are, obviously I will go that route. 

I did some math, and if I use my Christmas Bonus each year, and pay a lump payment of $10,000.00 each January, and an additional $100.00 each month in between, I could have the mortgage paid off in exactly 12 years (technically, year 12 would be a lump payment of about $7,000.00 to finish everything off.) This is, of course, a lot of money to throw at the house each year, and if refinancing to a 15 year mortgage at a later date would be more reasonable, I would of course go that route. 

Is this a stupid idea? I would have the house paid off for my 46th birthday at the absolute latest, my son would be 22 and finishing up college (most likely), and I could start saving so I could help him buy his own home.  I have roughly 80K in retirement, and 6K into a 529 for my son, who is 9, and 10K in regular savings (I just bought another property, so this will start replenishing) all accounts are contributed to bi-weekly.  I just acquired a second property that has a 10 year term, roughly 45K loan.  I gain income on that monthly, which I intend to throw whatever the balance left over each year on the loan to pay off early as well.  I keep it separate from ""home"" finances.

without breaking things down too hard, after taxes, I take home roughly 80K each year, not including the building.

I could make this payment each year, and I wouldn't miss it much, I live well within my means.  And since this is a bonus each year, I just look at is as a yearly windfall to pay off anything extra I bought for Christmas and to go into savings.  

I grew up pretty poor, so even considering this feels uppity to me. Like, I didn't have clothes or food on the table, and I'm talking about throwing 10K at the house each year. My son has all his needs covered, I just want to be able to make sure he's stable as an adult too, and I feel like not having a mortgage then would help him out immensely.  The extra income from the other building I purchase will go towards his college fund once that building is paid off, which will be in roughly 5-7 years.",finance

Im working toward paying off my loans and keeping up investments to take advantage of the incredible interest rates right now, but keep feeling like I’m behind all of my peers.

EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION: 
We have a 32k emergency fund saved up (goal is 36k and have been putting 4k into this each month). Our equity in our home is only about 50k since we have only lived in our home for a short while. We previously rented and got our credit up to purchase (now at 793).

We also spent the last few years paying off student loans and one auto loan as well as significant medical bills. Our second car was a beater that we just drove into the ground (16 year old car with 300k miles) and purchased a car for 40k. We will continue to pay off our medical debt as well. 

Our expenses are low to average. We have only made these high salaries for just over a year, so maybe that’s why it seems like we can’t get it together. We not only don’t want to squander our newfound financial opportunity, but would like to come out ahead!

My question I want to bring to y’all is, what do you see happening if/when the FED decides to raise interest rates and will that loose correlation continue? Or will we see a break of the correlation?

personalfinance,Merchant gave me a refund that I never requested. What to do?,"About two weeks ago I ordered a $600 laptop on Microsoft Store. A day later it was updated as ""shipped"", but on the day of delivery there was still no update on FedEx website, so I chatted with an customer service agent to see if the item is actually out of their warehouse. The agent said they would escalate the issue and contact me. I actually got the laptop later that day, so I figured maybe the tracking information just did not get updated. I started using the laptop and totally forgot about the chat. I never got contacted by anyone.

About a week later, I received an email that says the purchase was refunded in full. I was very confused and started a chat. Then I learned that they thought that my package was lost, so they gave the refund. Which is funny because the tracking shows ""delivered"", and I even received an automated email from Microsoft Store that says the laptop is delivered. Then I realize maybe the previous chat somehow made someone think that the package is lost, and they did not even bother checking the FedEx tracking. This agent said they would ""escalate the issue"" and I would hear back ""within 48 to 72 hours or sooner"". I never got anything so far. Yes, terrible customer service from Microsoft store.

The refund is now posted on my credit card. The website says the order status is ""refunded"".

So what should I do now? I have enough money that I feel comfortable with paying back that $600, but on the other hand I certainly do not mind keeping the laptop. But I am not going to mail a $600 check back to Microsoft (assuming they care and want me to do this), because I want to be able to actually still return the machine if I decide to within the remaining of the 30-day return period, and I want all the proof for warranty in case that comes up. And I do not want to waste any more time with the incompetent customer support -- it feels as if I am begging to give the money back. In fact, I seriously doubt if Microsoft cares about that $600 at all, and I should not even bother thinking about this. One thing I do not wish to happen in any case is that Microsoft decides to suspend my account for this -- too many emails and xbox games on that account

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

* I received a full refund for a laptop I purchased and still physically possess because somehow the merchant thought the package was lost
* I am ok with paying back the money but do not want to actively pursue this and go through the hassle due to terrible customer service. I also want to be able to actually return the machine and claim warranty if I did that
* I would be glad to keep the machine if the merchant does not care
* Bottom line is that I do not want to lose the associated Microsoft account

CryptoCurrency,"If coins were rated solely on their names, who would win?","This is part in jest and part in seriousness. The current variety of names of new coins/tokens is more reminiscent of stuff you find in a candy store than something to be taken seriously. 

Bitcoin is a great name imho. It conveys “digital” and “currency” and it has a nice ring to it phonetically. 

Another good example is Tezos, sounding like the FIAT currency “Pesos”.

But from there it rapidly goes downhill. 

The obvious names to bash would be the meme coins, but even more established names are pretty bad: LiteCoin, Terra LUNA, Polygon, Algorand, Stellar Lumens and what have we… 

It’s like they’re leaning way too hard into pop culture with the names. 

If I were to name a new token, I’d probably call it something dull that prioritized seriousness - such as “Crown”; fx. “CrownChain” or the obvious “BitCrown”. 

I guess I’m just fed up with weird geeky names for something people invest large sums of money into. “Yeah I put $20,000 into a crypto currency called Elrond, lol”.

investing,Non warrantable Properties,"Why should it matter that a large percentage of condos in a community are investor owned? If their mortgage payments are on time, then why would a lender care? If the borrower has stellar credit and shows they can actually pay for the unit in cash, then why does the lender not focus on the borrower's financial ability and credit worthiness instead of something like:

* Allow single person or business to own more than two units in a development (for developments with 20 units or less) or 20% of all the units in a project (for developments with 21 units or more).

Why do lenders not offer fixed rate interest rates for non-warrantable properties? It seems an ARM would increase the lender's risk.

CryptoMarkets,"Bitcoin Price Continues To Consolidate Sideways, Awaiting What the Fed Will Announce Today. The current uncertainty will end in a few hours.","The price of Bitcoin continues to consolidate by moving sideways. The $46k-$52K area is where Bitcoin has been moving since the leverage flush of December 3 to 4, 2021.

Fear remains, and many investors forget that the price of Bitcoin is up +60% since the beginning of the year.

The price of Bitcoin never moves in a straight line. Volatility is part of the game, and the price of Bitcoin moves in successive upward waves interspersed with more or less pronounced corrections.

We are currently 30% below the ATH of November 10, 2021. There is nothing to be worried about, as this is nothing extraordinary in the world of Bitcoin.

The reasons to be worried totally vanish if you look at the fundamentals of Bitcoin, which are excellent. The on-chain data is bullish for what lies ahead.

personalfinance,Different bank accounts - what model is best to keep the budget overview?,"Hi reddit.   
Since about a year I'm ""adulting"" - have a work, apartment etc.  
Because its my first job + apartment, I basically started with 0 because all the deposits took up all my savings. Since Febuary my husband (then boyfriend) moved in.   
We are really lost on how to best care for our money, keep a good overview and all.   


Currently this is our layout:

\- Main account (salary goes here, all bills get taken from here)  
\- Main savings account (self-explanatory, this is where we put the money we are saving)  
\- Pocket Money for me (we agreed on a set amount of money to spend freely each month)  
\- Pocket Money for my husband

Our issues: 

\- we quickly loose the overview, which bills are open, pending, already taken etc  
\- we have no idea if we are in or over budget (we do have a budget plan, but its hard to keep track)  
For example: we think we are in budget and treat ourselves to dinner and then realize we f'ed up...  
\- also we both are quite the impulse buyers but thats a seperate issue x)

&amp;#x200B;

How are couples dealing with money? How could we manage to keep to the budget better?  I'm just at the end of my wisdom...",finance

But... the FED meeting is this afternoon, i believe at 230 pm EST, and it is also the 15th, my DCA day as I get paid today. I am trying to decide if I should buy this morning or wait til some shock after the FED'S meeting? Yes, i know that defeats the purist and the purest sense of DCA, but still, some wiggle room on my DCA today.

What are your thoughts? Expect red or green after the press conference? Mooning or mining?

CryptoCurrency,"Bitcoin Price Continues To Consolidate Sideways, Awaiting What the Fed Will Announce Today. The current uncertainty will end in a few hours.","The price of Bitcoin continues to consolidate by moving sideways. The $46k-$52K area is where Bitcoin has been moving since the leverage flush of December 3 to 4, 2021.

Fear remains, and many investors forget that the price of Bitcoin is up +60% since the beginning of the year.

The price of Bitcoin never moves in a straight line. Volatility is part of the game, and the price of Bitcoin moves in successive upward waves interspersed with more or less pronounced corrections.

We are currently 30% below the ATH of November 10, 2021. There is nothing to be worried about, as this is nothing extraordinary in the world of Bitcoin.

The reasons to be worried totally vanish if you look at the fundamentals of Bitcoin, which are excellent. The on-chain data is bullish for what lies ahead.

The current distortion between the price of Bitcoin and its fundamentals is due to the current uncertainty. Markets hate uncertainty, and Bitcoin is no exception.

Everyone is waiting for what the Fed will announce in a few hours. Once Jerome Powell puts this uncertainty to rest, the price of Bitcoin can resume its rise.

Let's pump Bitcoin, Jerome!",cryptocurrency

For everyone freaking out about the fed meeting today, just remember this isn’t the first time in Bitcoin’ history that this has happen. The last time was in 2015 and went into 2018. During that time period we saw Bitcoin go from $465 to $20,000. 

What you are seeing right now is purely FUD, don’t buy into it. This won’t crush crypto. If anything, it should be a bullish sign for crypto. The fed is finally admitting that inflation is a serious problem. It is no longer transitory and it has run significantly hotter than the Fed projected.

Also, the news is already baked in. Unless they do something insane, we already know that they are going to likely decrease bond purchases earlier and possibly hike rates earlier. This Fed is very market friendly, always have been. Their biggest fear is shocking the market which I why I believe they will change policy less than people are forecasting.

stocks,(12/15) Wednesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Wednesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Wednesday, December 15th, 2021-

*****

# [Stock futures are little changed ahead of key Fed decision](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/stock-futures-are-flat-ahead-of-key-fed-decision-.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were little changed in early morning trading on Wednesday as investors readied for Wednesday’s highly anticipated Federal Reserve decision.
*****
&gt; Dow futures gained 8 points. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat, and the Nasdaq 100 futures were down 0.1%.
*****
&gt; The Fed will conclude its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday and the public will hear from central bank Chairman Jerome Powell at a 2:30 p.m. ET news conference.
*****
&gt; The Fed is grappling with the highest inflation level in 39 years and the central bank is widely expected to announce an acceleration of the tapering of its bond-buying program, which was put in place during the pandemic to prop up the economy.
*****
&gt; “Investors remain on a buyers strike in front of the FOMC meeting,” Fundstrat’s Tom Lee wrote in a note. “Tapering is not the ‘hawkish pivot’ that ends bull markets, but it is a hawkish pivot relative to the massive easing since the pandemic started. So we think this buyers strike in front of FOMC could turn into a ‘buy the event.’”
*****
&gt; This sets the stage for a dramatic policy shift that will clear the way for a first interest rate hike next year.
*****
&gt; A CNBC Fed Survey predicts the Fed will double the pace of the taper to $30 billion at its December meeting, which would end the $120 billion in monthly asset purchases by about March. The central bank will then hike rates three times in each of the next two years, starting in June 2022, the survey respondents predict.
*****
&gt; “While the chairman is not likely to suggest any specific timeframe for when the funds rate will begin to be lifted, he probably will confirm that some members do want to move more quickly than previously announced in raising interest rates,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Leuthold Group.
*****
&gt; “I would not expect the Fed to say much that is not already anticipated by the financial markets,” Paulsen added. “Some of the recent stock market volatility may lessen after this two-day meeting and its press conference is finally concluded.”
*****
&gt; On the political front, congressional Democrats passed a bill raising the debt ceiling, sending it to President Joe Biden early Wednesday just under the wire for when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the government would run out of spending power.
*****
&gt; On Tuesday, the major averages slipped, exacerbated by selling in software names like Microsoft and Adobe. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 106 points. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.75%.
*****
&gt; The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite was the relative underperformer, dipping 1.1% as Facebook-parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet all closed lower.
*****
&gt; Also hurting sentiment Tuesday was the hotter-than-expected inflation reading for November’s producer price index showing a year-over-year increase of 9.6%, the fastest pace on record. This was above the 9.2% expected by economists, according to Dow Jones. The index rose 0.8% month over month, above the 0.5% expected.
*****
&gt; While the Fed meeting is in focus, investors are also monitoring the new Covid variant omicron. The World Health Organization on Tuesday warned the new Covid-19 omicron variant is spreading faster than any previous strain, and is likely in most countries of the world.
*****
&gt; November’s retail sales data is slated to release at 8:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday. Economists polled by Dow Jones are expecting that retail sales rose 0.8% in November, compared to October’s growth of 1.7%, according to the Commerce Department.

These loans cover 100% of my cost of living and tuition throughout the entirety of school. All of my loans are federal unsubsidized loans.

I currently work a few hours a week remotely and make about $300 a month and plan on increasing this, and starting in January will be getting a $2,800 stipend for a TA position. With my hourly income, I put 100% of my paychecks towards my loans with the highest interest rate and have been making monthly payments since my freshman year of undergrad. 

I currently have a monthly budget of $1,700 and have $12,000 in personal savings that are not factored into covering my cost of living. I additionally have $6000 leftover from my loans from this fall semester (I got a larger scholarship than anticipated after accepting the loans) and will be getting the remainder of my year one loans refunded in January ($12,000) that will entirely cover my cost of living until the next loans are issued.  

The fourth year of my graduate program is a full-time externship, and I will receive a stipend but it will likely not be enough to cover my cost of living. Tuition will be extremely cheap this year. I am also in a state that provides an option for a forgivable loan of $15,000 if I stay in the state for one year after graduation, which I plan on taking advantage of. My field also has PSLF opportunities, but I don't know too much about this. 

Essentially I feel that this leaves me with a lot of accessible funds considering my living is going to be covered and I am in so much debt. I am unsure of whether or not it is smart to go ahead and make a very large payment to the loan and if so, what amount. I also am unsure if it is smart to go ahead and put so much money into the loan when many have told me PSLF will be my only way out. Would this not be wasting money? I have been worried to get rid of the comfortable savings I have, for future emergencies (I will likely need another car within the next 3-5 years) but know that with my loans I am also getting buried further by holding onto this money. Any advice on how to allocate this money to benefit me going forward is welcome.",finance

Banking,SECNY Federal Credit Union Fraudulent Charge Issue,"Hello, first time here.

&amp;#x200B;

My girlfriend's card was used somehow (even though she still has it) and a charge was made. Her credit union called her to tell her they might have caught a fraudulent charge and for her to verify the charge. She did not recognize it and told them it wasn't her. Great.

&amp;#x200B;

So now they're requiring her to go to the place the charge was made (some car shop for an oil change) and talk to them and have them sign something? This place is an hour away and I've never heard of this before. I have Bank of America and the few times something like this happens I talk to the bank and they take care of it.

&amp;#x200B;

They're also requiring her to get some paper work notarized and she has to send that paper work back to them. She also has to fill out a separate form to get a new debit card.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this normal with a credit union? This is so backwards to me as I've never had to go through this much trouble to get this sort of issue resolved. What if the charge was in Florida? (We're in NYC) Would she have to drive to the place in Florida that the false charge was made? What is going on??",finance
Bitcoin,"Bitcoin Price Continues To Consolidate Sideways, Awaiting What the Fed Will Announce Today. The current uncertainty will end in a few hours.","The price of Bitcoin continues to consolidate by moving sideways. The $46k-$52K area is where Bitcoin has been moving since the leverage flush of December 3 to 4, 2021.

Fear remains, and many investors forget that the price of Bitcoin is up +60% since the beginning of the year.

The price of Bitcoin never moves in a straight line. Volatility is part of the game, and the price of Bitcoin moves in successive upward waves interspersed with more or less pronounced corrections.

We are currently 30% below the ATH of November 10, 2021. There is nothing to be worried about, as this is nothing extraordinary in the world of Bitcoin.

The reasons to be worried totally vanish if you look at the fundamentals of Bitcoin, which are excellent. The on-chain data is bullish for what lies ahead.

The current distortion between the price of Bitcoin and its fundamentals is due to the current uncertainty. Markets hate uncertainty, and Bitcoin is no exception.

Everyone is waiting for what the Fed will announce in a few hours. Once Jerome Powell puts this uncertainty to rest, the price of Bitcoin can resume its rise as I explain in detail in the latest issue of In Bitcoin We Trust Newsletter: [**https://inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/bitcoin-price-continues-to-consolidate**](https://inbitcoinwetrust.substack.com/p/bitcoin-price-continues-to-consolidate)",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,A Technological Moon Landing,"In the 1900s, possibly one of the greatest achievements was landing, walking on the moon, and returning safely. Man had conquered the Earth and now have ventured out into the unknown and made it's mark. 

I was talking with my dad last night and his middle name is Armstrong after Neil Armstrong since he was born on July 20, 1969, the moon landing date. He was telling me about conversations he had with his parents (never got to know my grandparents since they passed before I could get to know them) and how they were absolutely blown away looking up at the moon and knowing there were people walking up there. 

I began to wonder, what will be the 2000's ""moon landing event""? Could it be more space travel? Actually having people live on the moon or when or if we set foot on Mars? Flying cars? Teleportation? Could just be some sci-fi dreams, could be reality one day. I think our Moon landing will be something different and cryptocurrency technology can lead the way. 

I don't know about you but I am beyond annoyed whenever I hear boomers in Congress/Parliament/Governments or old farts in the banking industry that are so anti change. I'm sure a large portion of it is that there is money getting fed into their pockets to keep things the way they are but one day I hope and pray that this changes. 

I am far from a crypto expert but what I do know is that this technology can and will make the world work 1000 times for efficiently. I believe the next Moon Landing will be an efficiency revolution of change. Banks not robbing people, outrageous interest rates from mega corps keeping people in debt, global inflation, lack of ownership, instantaneous and near feeless money transactions, data privacy and efficiency storage, the list goes on and on the usage of cryptocurrency technology. 

I hope in my lifetime I can see this revolution of change for my children and their children but who knows, maybe I'm just day dreaming as well. 

What do you all think will be this centuries ""Moon landing""?",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin Market Enters ‘Extreme Fear’ Territory Ahead Of Fed Meeting,,cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,My opinion on cryptocurrency.,"Everyone is very pessimistic about everything in the crypto market at the moment. I think that the contraction in disposable income due to inflation is part of the reason why the market is behaving the way it is right now. Retail investors and the amount of money they can put into the market has decreased. The year-over-year rate of change in the Fed's balance sheet is also a factor, but the risk from this factor didn't manifest itself in the last market cycle. The main reason, I think, is that many institutions need to close out their positions and rebalance their portfolios at the end of the year - after all, they have had a very good year of taking on a high level of risk. And of course they have to make tax provision. But my view is that the fundamentals of the industry have not changed. The last round of bears and bulls caused 'trauma' for many people, leading to the conviction that the end of this year is when the BTC halving cycle will reach its peak. This 'trauma' has caused many to become overly cautious in the face of this cycle. But clearly, we are going through an extended market cycle. So far, we still haven't seen record-breaking high levels of market participation. There has been a fairly large speculative boom in the NFT market, but the participants are still mainly those who already have a lot of ETH and can afford to splurge. Large-scale funds will allocate new, mandatory portfolio space to the crypto market in the first quarter of next year. If this drives prices up significantly, it will lead to even larger market participation: record-breaking new wallet addresses, long-time holders moving assets to deals in large numbers, and so on. Keep in mind that digital assets as a whole haven't changed much since May, unless you were extremely lucky to catch the second half of the year on the rebound. The market's rally from the July lows still hasn't allowed most digital assets to make new highs. But the really meaningful and impactful popularity of big institutions is already starting to happen, along with the exponentially growing new usage scenarios that accompany the crypto market. In addition, artists, musicians and big brands are starting to realize the importance of Web 3.0. There are speculators among them, but most of them are serious. We've reached a critical market tipping point. I think the market will start to accelerate towards the end of this month and continue until the middle of next year, when it will really bubble up ...... This is what is currently happening. Please sit tight and fasten your seat belts, cut back on overly speculative assets and move them to higher quality. Don't blindly chase the highs either, by the time you do, it will be too late. And, unless you're an expert... (I'm not), add some more small premiums to your options if you're going to use leverage. High quality Layer 1s like BTC, ETH, Luna, AVAX and SOL can be better core assets. Most NFTs are overly speculative, but also rapidly iterating, so you can hold a little. Most importantly, if you're in it for the long haul like I am, don't let short-term volatility affect you too much. If that's where your stress comes from with these short-term fluctuations and start tweeting for answers, it means you've invested too much to the point where it's affecting your life. There's more to come, and just because BTC is flat after a 50% drop doesn't make it any less fair. While we don't know how the market will perform in the short term, we do know which direction it will most likely go in the long term. Putting in the long term means tweaking your portfolio, looking at the charts for fun, and never caring until speculation is rampant (at which point you can liquidate 50% or more and make a stablecoin gain). The next phase of the market is the shift from retail to big institutions. The whole of 2021 is building the foundation for this, and 2022 is when these 'big players' will really arrive.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,We are not in a Bear Market: Here’s Why,"I think many people are confusing this most recent downtrend with a bear market, but they couldn’t be further from the truth and even worse, could miss out on some big gains:

1) We have to realize that crypto has gotten big. It has caught the attention of institutions now, which means it will be TREATED LIKE AN ASSET ON THE BALANCE SHEET OF BIG INSTITUTIONS. I think we can all agree that crypto is considered a high risk asset class compared to other asset classes. During times of fear or uncertainty (“risk off environments”), institutions will rebalance their portfolios where they will sell off risky assets (crypto, tech stocks, growth stocks) and move towards more conservative investments like value stocks. Can we see evidence of this? Of course. The same sell off we’re seeing in crypto over the last month or two is the same we’re seeing in tech/growth stocks like Tesla, Netflix, etc

2) Why is there all this fear and uncertainty in the markets? Multiple reasons: fears over monetary tightening, rising interest rates, evergrande fallout, potential delisting of Chinese equities from US exchanges, etc

3) Bitcoin crashes and Altcoins COLLAPSE during bear markets. When I say collapse, think of a balloon totally deflating into a thin piece of rubber. Bear markets look totally different than what we’re seeing. Projects like ADA and Algorand still being &gt;$1, ETH still above $3,500, MATIC &gt;$2, and so on show us that altcoins have not even come close to collapsing. Go back and look at what prices of these coins were like in the 2019 bear market.

4) Sentiment will be absolutely devastated in a bear market. Posts in this sub will hardly get any attention. The suicide hotline will be posted. People who once were so bullish and enthused about crypto will eventually succumb to the fear narratives and forget about the space. 

Are we there yet? No. We are in a downtrend and not a bear market.the crypto markets are so short memory that they’ve already forgotten we just went through the same type of period in June….

personalfinance,Refinancing mortgage to pay for home addition and car loan?,"Since I purchased my home in 2017, the value has increased by ~135k.  I plan on putting on a second floor addition next year so I was going to refinance and use the equity from the increased value to pay for the addition.  


According to my mortgage company I can take out 100k and reduce my interest rate from 3.875% to 3.625%.  My monthly principal and interest will increase from $1299 to $1566.


The 100k number was just a high ballpark number and is larger than what I need.  My car lease is also up in march and the buyout is 23k.  I have not found a single auto loan that is anywhere near under 4%.  


Is there any reason that I shouldnt use 23k from the 100k and lump my mortgage and car payment into one?  I currently pay $379/month for the lease and financing it for 5-7 years would be well over $500-600/month.  Even just using the lease monthly payment and my current mortgage payment thats 1299+379=1678 which is only $112 more per month than what i am currently paying.  


I know people tend to not want to pay off their car loan with their mortgage but considering the interest rate and monthly, I dont see why thats a bad option?  I could also pay the assumed $500-600/month for the auto loan towards the mortgage payment and chunk it down quicker while ""paying off"" the car portion.


Are there any other options that I am overlooking that would be more beneficial/detrimental to my situation?",finance
investing,Will a BoE avoid a rate hike for now?,"Tomorrow, the 16th of December, is the time for the Bank of England meeting to discuss its interest rate decision. It's going to be an essential meeting for many investors to see how the BOE will answer to increased inflation. However, hopes seem to be turning down as the broader expectation is that the central bank will hold off on a rate hike until February. We could have hoped for better expectations but that would be impossible with the arrival of Omicron at this time.

In November, when the labor market was finally able to add 275,000 payrolls and at the same time had a lower unemployment rate at 4.2% and lowered unemployment claims by 50,000. When Omicron arrived, Boris Johnson became more hesitant to hike rates to combat inflation. Once Plan-B was announced, the UK Consumer Price Index jumped to 4.2%, the YoY in October was the highest in a decade. Inflation definitely doesn't seem transitionary anymore. 

However this turns out tomorrow, it is important to remember that all trading carries risk, so it will be important to fully understand everything that is said tomorrow before making any decisions.",finance

CryptoCurrency,A beginners Guide to Cryptocurrency,"**What is a blockchain?**

It is an “immutable ledger.” Think about it like a book that lives in the sky. Every time something changes, its written down with magic ink, that when dries, never changes. And there are thousands of copies of these books, all getting updated at the same time. If one is ever messed with, the other books would wipe out the problem and replace it with the correct entry.

**What is proof of Work?**

First generation crypto currency worked of the concept of Poof of work. There, it is a race to solve a complicated math puzzle, and perform the block write operation. And as a reward get coin. “Mining.” Mining is slow. Bitcoin can only do 7 transactions a minute.

Of the thousands and thousands of machines out there racing to win the next block, only 1 at a time wins. That means the others have literally wasted their energy via compute CPU and GPU cycles. Bitcoin used more energy than Argentina last year.

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp)

[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952)

**What is proof of Stake?**

Proof of Stake works on different types of newly developed “Consensus” algorithms. Ouroboros protocol, created by IHOK and Cardano, along with a team of PHDs and mathematicians, is the first of its kind. They created a secure “lottery” consensus mechanism to “elect” the next “slot leader” to write the block. Here each Stake pool can get a chance to be elected by winning the lottery. Each Ada coin represents 1 lottery ticket. When you delegate to the pool, you give that pool your ticket, not your coin. If the pool wins, you get the reward along with everyone in the pool, and the operator. Because there is no more complicated math puzzle, and no more computers racing to solve the puzzle, its much much faster, and much much cheaper. Cardano nodes can be run on Raspberry Pi.. A lot of nodes out there run on Solar energy. It’s so good, Ethereum, who is proof of work currently, is moving to this model as part of their ETH 2.0 migration. In efforts to reduce gas fees and energy concerns. Pokodot created its own Consensus algorithm. Called Grandpa. I’m still coming to up speed on that one. Same with ETH 2.0 “validators.”

Each other their own way of doing things. But “gen 3” is not Proof of work.

What you should remember is that for both POW, POS, and others, they are all a means of incentivizing the actual people that run the computers hosting the blockchain code. Without them, there is no “decentralized network of immutable ledgers.” Which is because that’s just fancy talk for machines running our code for free.

**What is Market Cap and coin supply and why should we care?**

Market Capitalization is equal to Price of Coin times Supply of Coin. That is, it. But very important.

BITCOIN has a fixed supply. It is not all mined yet. Not until 2140. But it does have a finite amount, 21 Million.

Here is why you can see a 65K or even 100K bitcoin, but you’ll probably never see a 100 dollar DOGE, or even a 30 Dollar Ada (not soon anyway)

Currently there are 18,901,725 BTC out there at a cost of 46,988.51.

That means, the market cap is 46,988.51 x 18,901,725 = 888,163,894,179.75 (881B)

Cardano, has a fixed coin supply as well. But it is 45 Billion. There are currently 33,443,243,907. So you see the max is 2500x more. Likewise, with 130B DOGE vs 18M BTC - it’s \~6700X more. DogeCoin also makes 10,000 new coins a minute.

At a price is 1.22 that means the market cap for Cardano is 1.22 X 33,443,243,907 = 40,800,757,566.54 (40B)

You’ll need 136B market cap to reach a 1-dollar DOGE in the next year.

130,926,176,669 + ((10,000\*60\*24\*365) = 136,182,176,669 (Supply of DOGE in 1 year from now)136,182,176,669 \* 1 = 136,182,176,669

You'll need an almost 1 Trillion Market Cap for Cardano to hit 3032,127,627,594 \* 30 = 963,828,827,820

To give you some reference. Here is the Market cap of some big names.

Visa – 499B

Adobe – 250B

Amazon – 1.7T

It’s very confusing because every coin has their own supply. Their own way of creating coins and at what cadence. Some even “burn” coins. So, know what yours does and how it works.

**How can I “get in early?”**

First. We are all early. You might not have gotten in on the first floor, but we’re only halfway up the stairs to the second flight.

Global wealth is estimated at 1 quadrillion. All the Market Cap in crypto is at 2.12 Trillion. That’s only 0.21% of the world’s wealth.

When looking for “what could be the next big thing” find something with a low market cap, regardless of coin price, that has a strong chance of doing well because of team and tech, the two Ts.

Also ask yourself.

What are these coins use cases?

Who is their target audience for adoption?

Who is funding them?

Who is their team building it? What is their history?

Do they have a good plan?

**What are your goals?**

Crypto is really split into 4 worlds.

Day traders, H.O.D.L.’ers, Whales, and weak hands.

Day traders realize that this market is very volatile, now, and historically. Good ones, can capitalize on quick gains by buying low and selling high, waiting for a dip, then buying back in, and selling high again, cyclically.

Then there are those that “Hold On for Dear Life.” These people tend to find something they really are passionate about, and never sell. They keep buying. If they see their coin dips, below at what they bought it at, and have some extra funds, they buy more, to ""Average Down."" Or Dollar cost average (DCA) by buying a set amount on a regular cadence. They only “take profit” buy selling a small portion when price is really high.

Whales, are investors that come in with millions and billions of dollars. They often “test” the market buy either buying or dumping millions and billions in hopes to manipulate the market to their advantage. If you’re reading this, you’re probably not in this category, but you should know they exist and effect this marketplace.

Then there are “weak hands.” Do not pick this one. These people buy high and sell low. They only invest based on emotion, and nothing else. When things start going bad, they panic, and sell at a loss. Its much better to let your coin go to .000000001 cents, and just hold on to it in the hopes of a rally years later, then it is to ever sell at a loss. Never do this. Never.

Each has its own risks and rewards.

Day trading can rack up dollars quick, but you can lose them just as quick. And there are tax implicates with trades. Some unknown, and constantly changing.

HODL, might take years, but if you do, the chance of your Return on Invest improves significantly in crypto.

Pick what works best for you but have a plan.

**What is the difference between storing on an exchange or in a wallet?**

A lot.

First, you must remember what the dream of crypto is really offering.

Its offering a way for us to break away from banks. Forever.

Centralized banks that can print money, is a problem. Blockchain solves this.

But not if the new bank ends up being Binace or Coinbase. In fact, keeping your coin in exchanges puts us all at risk of market manipulation by them.

When a certain 1 person or group owns too many nodes, they can make choices that would benefit them. The attack vector is called a 51% attack or sybil attack.

Today however, you need exchanges to on ramp and off ramp FIAT. FIAT money is government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver.

But it will not be like that forever. Chains like ADA and DOT will be interoperable with legacy banks and will eventually cut out exchanges.

Personally, I despise BNB coin and binace. They already take high fees, and now they want the control and the rewards too. Coinbase isn’t much better. Again though, a necessary evil, for now.

But more important than the “dream” is that they can be hacked.

They are a website. Not a blockchain. They hold the keys to your wallet, and let you use them with a weak password and no mfa if you like. Its literally like storing your money in a bank. So know your bank. Good thing, like a bank, SOME, are federally insured up to a certain amount. But some are not, and people have lost millions and billions in the past this way.

Lastly, there is the notification of “passive income” and “interest.”

With POS systems, delegators are incentivized to “stake” their coin by earning interest.

With POW systems, like bitcoin, you’d have to stand up your own machine, configure it, and let it use your energy in your house. With withs like Cardano Ada, and ETH 2.0, you can now pull your coin off the exchange, put it in a wallet, delegate to a pool, and earn interest. All while maintaining full control of your coins.

**What are Smart Contracts? (This one will blow your mind if you are a developer)**

First let us start with what most people say.

“Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code.”

Which is true for sure. It helps build trust and removes the cumbersome third party “trusted agent” like a bank.

But what smart contracts really are is “ANY Code” that can be written to a blockchain and NEVER be changed, forever.

ANY CODE. You can write your own coins and put them into the block. It happens a lot.

**What are NFTs?**

NonFungible Tokens are the first versions of Smart contracts. They are essentially images that are written to the block as a token, that can then be stored in a digital wallet with a certain policy retention.

So what’s the big deal? I can upload a gif to the internet today.

The big deal is twofold.

First, you are not uploading anything to the “internet.” That whole thing we call the internet is flawed. Tracked, centralized, monitored, and gated.

What you are doing is creating an EARLY entry, in a book that will never change for the rest of time.

Let us sit and think about that for a second.

De Beers is going to have to get new slogan. “A ~~diamond~~ NFT is forever”

Right now, it is some awful GIF of a dogecoin. But it is not what it is. It is what it represents.

It is the next chapter in Art history. What is created will last longer than the Mona Lisa. Someday you will have blockchain archaeologist that comb though chains.

Plus, taking away the cool factor, they create a place that you can now prove you did it first.

Artist could upload lyrics as an NFT, and later sell them, without the fear their art might be stolen before a contract is in place. People could attach their house deed to a chain, and ever again dispute who owns the land after a conflict.

Besides gaming, NFTs are frequently used to sell a wide range of virtual collectibles, including NBA virtual trading cards, music, digital images, video clips and even virtual real estate in [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/), a virtual world.

The Federal Reserve is expected to announce a more rapid transition away from its easy policies after its meeting Wednesday, as it sets the stage for the first interest rate hike next year. (Interest hike for who?)

The Fed is also likely to provide a new description of how it views inflation, and acknowledge that it no longer views it as transitory. (What does this even mean?)

One wild card that market pros are watching closely is what the Fed says about its $8.7 trillion balance sheet and whether it tips or when it might start to shrink it. (Why is this relevant?)

stocks,Pelosi rejects stock-trading ban for members of Congress: 'We are free market economy. They should be able to participate in that',"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday rejected the idea of banning members of Congress and their spouses from holding and trading individual stocks while in office.

""This is a free market, and people — we are a free market economy. They should be able to participate in that,"" Pelosi said when asked by Insider at her weekly press conference.

Insider also asked Pelosi about ""Conflicted Congress,"" a 5-month-long investigation by Insider that found 49 members of Congress and 182 senior congressional staffers have violated the STOCK Act, a law to prevent Insider trading.

The Speaker said she had not yet seen the project, but said that it's important that members are complying with the law.

""If people aren't reporting, they should be,"" she said.

Pelosi's position puts her at odds with the likes of progressives like Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, both of whom have called for banning members of congress from trading stocks while in office.

""It is absolutely ludicrous that members of Congress can hold and trade individual stock while in office,"" Ocasio-Cortez recently wrote on Twitter. ""The access and influence we have should be exercised for the public interest, not our profit. It shouldn't be legal for us to trade individual stock with the info we have.""

And on Tuesday, Sen. Warren told Insider that she had seen Insider's investigation, calling out the ""brazenness"" of members and staffers trading stocks even while having access to privileged knowledge.

""We need both tougher laws and enforcement of those laws,"" the Massachusetts Democrat told Insider. ""The American people should never have to guess whether or not an elected official is advancing an issue or voting on a bill based on what's good for the country or what's good for their own personal financial interests."" 

Asked about progressives' position on the issue, a spokesman for Pelosi signaled that the speaker prefers a transparency-focused approach to insider trading.

""The STOCK Act exists to shine a bright light on trades by members of Congress,"" said spokesman Drew Hammill. ""Sunlight is the best disinfectant.""

""The speaker does not own any stocks,"" he continued. ""As you can see from the required disclosures, with which the speaker fully cooperates, these transactions are marked 'SP' for spouse. The Speaker has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions.""

Pelosi's husband, investor Paul Pelosi, frequently trades significant numbers of stocks. With her husband's assets considered, Pelosi ranks among the wealthiest members of Congress, according to an Insider analysis.

Insider has identified numerous examples of federal lawmakers trading stocks in industries they oversee as part of their congressional committee assignments, including within the defense, healthcare, and energy industries.

CryptoCurrency,Federal Reserve Will Pull Back Economic Help More Quickly as Inflation Accelerates,,cryptocurrency
stocks,"Fed will aggressively dial back its monthly bond buying, sees three rate hikes next year","The Federal Reserve provided multiple indications Wednesday that its run of ultra-easy policy since the beginning of the Covid pandemic is coming to a close, making moves that were even more aggressive than markets had anticipated.

The Fed will be buying $60 billion of bonds each month starting January, half the level prior to the November taper and $30 billion less than it had been buying in December. The Fed was tapering by $15 billion a month in November, doubled that in December, then will accelerate the reduction further come 2022.

After that wraps up, probably around March, the central bank expects to start raising interest rates, which were held steady at this week’s meeting.

Projections released Wednesday indicate that Fed officials see as many as three rate hikes coming in 2022, with two in the following year and two more in 2024.

The Federal Open Market Committee’s moves, approved unanimously, represent a substantial adjustment to policy that has been the loosest in its 108-year history.

Both moves came in response to escalating inflation, which is running at its highest level in 39 years for consumer prices. Wholesale prices in November jumped 9.6%, the fastest on record in a sign that inflation pressures are becoming more ingrained and broad-based.

For one, the Fed said it will accelerate the reduction of its monthly bond purchases.

Fed officials long have stressed that inflation is “transitory,” which Chairman Jerome Powell has defined as unlikely to leave a lasting imprint on the economy. He and other central bank leaders, as well as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, have stressed that prices are booming due to pandemic-related factors such as extraordinary demand that has outstripped supply but ultimately will fade.

However, the term had become a pejorative and the post-meeting statement eliminated it. Powell telegraphed the move during congressional testimony last month, saying “it’s probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we meant.”

For the Powell Fed, tightening policy now marks a dramatic pivot off a policy enacted just over a year ago. Known as “flexible average inflation targeting,” which meant it would be content with inflation a little above or below its long-held 2% target.

The policy’s practical application was that the Fed was willing to let inflation run a little hot in the interest of completely healing the labor market from the hit it took during the pandemic. The Fed’s new policy sought employment that was both full and inclusive across racial, gender and economic lines. Officials agreed not to raise interest rates in anticipation of rising inflation, as the central bank had done in the past.

However, as the “transitory” narrative came into question and inflation began to look stronger and more durable, the Fed has had to rethink its intentions and change gears.

The asset purchase taper began in November, with a reduction of $10 billion in Treasury purchases and $5 billion in mortgage-backed securities. That still left the month buys at $70 billion and $35 billion respectively.

However, the Fed’s $8.7 trillion balance sheet increased by just $2 billion over the past four weeks, with Treasury holdings up $52 and MBS actually reduced by $23 billion. Over the past 12 months, Treasury holdings have expanded by $978 billion while MBS have risen by $567 billion.

Under the new terms of a program also known as quantitative easing, the Fed would accelerate the decline of its holdings until it is no longer adding to its portfolio. That would bring QE to an end in the spring and allow the Fed to raise rates anytime after. The Fed has said it likely would not raise rates and continue buying bonds simultaneously, as the two moves would work at cross purposes.

From there, the Fed at anytime could start reducing its balance sheet either by selling securities outright, or, in the more likely scenario, begin allowing the proceeds of its current bond holdings to run off each month at a controlled pace.

CryptoCurrency,I'm currently moving forward with a Lawsuit against my Parents for losing my Cryptocurrency.,"Some 3 years ago in 2018, I had a Desktop comp i used to trade, and dabble with various Lower cap coins using left over dust from an extraordinary amount of shit exchanges I joined.  One being Cryptopia. 

 $20 here $50 there.   Anyway. I stumbled across unibright when it was stupid low. I did some quick research and found decent potential.   I decided to compile capital for a few shitcoins I had, and i dumped $400 in at around $0.03ea     I let it rot.   I had the PKs to my wallet on a small notepad file hidden in a folder. 

Anyway, fast forward to Dec 2019,  I was moving to my first home, and needed to keep some stuff at my mom's house.  Brought a couple boxes of sentimental things , my weight set, and my Desktop over for safe keeping.     I was in a fleet of text messages with my step father about the move, work life etc, and I have multiple messages confirming I can keep the desktop there for as long as I need after explaining that I also have 2 years of Google analytic research and multiple files of coding for a website I was creating.   I stressed the importance of keeping it safe.    I was told to put it on the shelf of a closet.      

 Sometime later my mother texted me to tell me. ""Don't worry about it, your items are safe here"". 

Anyway. When I found out my Unibright mooned to $25K, I was thrilled with joy.  Right now its about $20K worth.      I didn't immediately go back home and grab the desktop. It was still going up.  I was content.    

One day during the lockdowns. I get a phone call from my mom.  ""I have $50 for you"" 

For what?, I asked. 

Step father was cleaning out the basement and sold your weights $50 to someone on marketplace. 

""WHAT???"".   

The douchebag sold $1600 worth of weights. At a time those were mooning because gyms were closed.   

I was pissed.   I went there to pick up my other items. 

Turns out they threw the desktop in he garbage weeks prior without telling me.  

Years of research, and $25K in crypto after telling me ""it's safe, you can leave it here""

I was met with backlash.  ""You shouldn't have just left all your stuff here for us to take care of""

""I didn't think you needed that stupid computer, it was sitting on the closet shelf not being used for 5 months""

*""It's not my responsibility you lost ...""*



All things said, I was given permission to leave it there and was assured it would be safe.

My mother, and step father never did anything like this before so I had no warning signs. 

Anyway, I'm in though times and they have ability to help after bragging to me that they just got $50,000 more than they asked for selling their home as they retire in another state on Beefed up pensions while I struggle with a gloomy future possibly having to leave my first home.  


I have text messages proving their agreement, assuring me it will be safe, and proof they threw it away without informing me.   I also have proof I owned the crypto.  I have records of that.  My lawyer said the case is very winnable and is likely to be settled without going to court. 

I'm being generous and asking for $16,000 plus lawyer fees, and time off work. $20K total if settled out of court.    My lawyer said I was able to get $28K because of the weights too, but in not.   They bragged they got an extra $50K in a sale they originally bragged that they would he happy with the original price.    Time to pay up.  If they refuse to settle I'm going for the top amount.",cryptocurrency
bonds,Interest rates and tapering asset purchases,"Just about all the discussion I hear regarding the Fed, interest rate hikes and tapering the asset purchase program seems to completely divorce the latter two -  interest rate hikes and tapering the asset purchase program.

I then say to myself:  Wait a minute.  One way the Fed sets the interest rates is through certain asset purchases like government bonds and mortgage backed securities (but in normal times, not necessarily corporate bonds).  It's my understanding that the corporate bond purchases were instituted to provide liquidity at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Fed provided a demand for these bonds which increased the prices, which in turn lowered the yield.  Corporations offering new debt were then able to offer the debt at the lower rates consistent with the lower yields in the market.

Now, in my mind (and maybe I'm not seeing this correctly) ""interest rates"" in general are coupled to the asset purchase program.  The two levers, interest rates and asset purchases, are not independent and rather tightly (?) coupled.  

I guess the question could be summarized as:  Are the Fed setting the interest rates and the Fed's asset purchase program two sides of the same coin?

At the time I was heavy into boomer stocks on our ASX (stock exchange) all my portfolio turned red, I was up a little and thought this aint good I’m out. Anyway as time went on from Jan to march it bled even harder with lockdowns etc taking place. Then all these financial support packages started coming out here in AU and we saw the US fed starting to print Trillions of dollars and again I thought, this is irrational inflation gonna go through the roof, this can’t be good. I turned bearish as hell literally hating on the markets thinking anyone getting it now has a gambling addiction and many people felt the same, but there were some that saw this as buying opportunities and my mind was already hardened with the bearish disease and being a “rational” man it was easy to be bearish. Covid, Job losses, companies shutting down, shops closed, lockdowns, schools shut down and trillions globally beginning to printed like it grew on magic money trees. Well it turns out I and many others just don’t know shit about duck and what that taught me was bad news is good news in this irrational economy. I missed out on literal life changing gains that could of paid for homes outright and early retirement if I had of 1. Gone with my gut not online dickheads with bearish foresight, essentially stay out of forums and news sites with “experts” that don’t know shit, and 2. Looked at the bigger picture. 






Long story short, TL:DR. Just work to the sense that you don’t shit, if you see people behaving bearishly online, the more the better is a buy signal, if the Fed or your government's printing money to bubble up and hold up the economy that’s another buy signal, because chances are more than strong that you will most definitely see gains, big gains. When things don’t make sense. And it will cost you money when things start to line up with your “bubble, inflation, bearish” mindset.

personalfinance,"Move, refinance or .. wait?","Trying to keep this short. Bought $500k house about 5-6 years ago with 30 year mortgage @ 3.75%. I only put 10% down but had the PMI removed at year 2 due to appreciation. Have always just paid the amounts due, never more. Current balance is about $400k and total monthly payments of $2500 with tax/insurance. 

The major metro market I’m in has appreciated substantially, and realtor now thinks the house could sell for $800k. I’ve done no major repairs or anything. Unfortunately, other houses have also been going up 😝

We have a new kiddo, and while we could stay in our current house for a few years, I think ideally we would move in the next 1-3 years into something larger that we could stay in for the long haul, absent a major change in circumstances. This would likely require us moving up to the $1.1m or $1.2m range. That’s gonna hurt but I think it’s doable if we take 20% from the sale proceeds and save the rest.

We’ve been looking off and on for about a year now but the market is really hot and inventory is low. Basically I put off refinancing last year because I thought we could find a new house instead. Now I’m just not certain when that is going to happen.

I don’t necessary want to pay the fees associated with a refi to a lower rate now if we will be moving out in the next year or two. But then again it seems like interest rates are going to go up again soon, so I may miss my window to do so. Also, part of me is wary to buy right now because the market is just so so hot that it seems unsustainable. But then again people have been saying that it is going to crash for years and it hasn’t yet..

Any thoughts or advice on how to help think this through would be appreciated!!",finance

CryptoCurrency,"Lyra Finance, Options Protocol AMM","We’re excited to introduce [Lyra](https://lyra.finance/), DeFi's first complete options AMM. Options are an integral part of the financial system, allowing traders to manage risk, obtain leverage, and construct any payoff structure. However, despite the recent growth of DeFi, they have yet to find any real traction on-chain. This is for a few reasons:

* **Impermanent Loss**

Options are difficult to price, especially with the constraints of L1. Because of this, many existing protocols use static volatilities and imprecise pricing, leading to consistent losses for LPs.

* **Extreme Risk**

It’s no secret that options are some of the riskiest financial instruments out there. As a result, any competitively priced options protocol without native hedging runs a high risk of LPs losing all of their money over time. Existing options AMMs often aren’t able to purchase options (meaning that LPs are simply naked short volatility), let alone hedge risk.

* **Low Liquidity**

This combination of IL and high risk is unattractive for LPs, so liquidity has remained low. Existing protocols which have some liquidity offer sky-high prices as a way of sidestepping the complexity of the options pricing problem. These uncompetitive prices naturally lead to little trading volume.

Is it even possible to solve these problems on-chain? Well, it all begins with a deep understanding of options to price and manage risk. Applying this knowledge is computationally intensive, so it requires a scalable compute layer. Finally, you need a place to actually hedge risk for your LPs.

With the advent of L2 and liquid spot markets, it's become possible to build a complete options protocol. Lyra combines the best of traditional options market making (tried and tested pricing and risk management) with crypto’s two biggest strengths right now, scalability and composability. Here’s how we get it done:

# Designed for L2

DeFi users will be all too familiar with the benefits of L2; instant transactions and low fees. However, L2 isn't just about being faster and cheaper. Designing a protocol for L2 means redefining the scope of what's possible on-chain.

In Lyra's case, this means automatically managing risk for LPs. The quantification and hedging of risk undertaken by Lyra are achieved by frequently running computationally intensive algorithms. This process would be too expensive to operate within an L1 environment due to gas costs. L2 has enabled Lyra to bring sophisticated hedging techniques on-chain to the benefit of both traders and LPs.

# Proven Pricing and Risk Management

Lyra uses market demand and supply to map the implied volatility surface per expiry. This surface is then fed into the Black Scholes pricing model to determine prices for all listed options, yielding performant pricing for traders and steady returns for LPs.

Lyra’s AMM actively hedges the delta risk incurred by LPs by composing with DeFi spot markets to trade in and out of the underlying asset. Vega (volatility) risk is quantified and is at the heart of its fee structure, allowing it to incentivize risk-reducing trades. These innovations increase the alpha and improve the[ Sharpe ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio) of the AMM. See our [whitepaper](https://lyra.finance/files/whitepaper.pdf) for more details. In a virtuous cycle, increased alpha leads to more liquidity, driving more volume and yielding more fees for the protocol.

# Composable Hedging

Lyra uses Synthetix to hedge the delta risk of its LPs. As trades occur on Lyra, LPs take on exposure to the underlying asset. To protect our LPs, Lyra automatically trades long/short on the underlying asset via Synthetix.

By building on the shoulders of leading protocols in DeFi, we believe we will offer our users an authentic trading experience that leapfrogs the challenges of competitors, positioning us as the new leaders in the ecosystem.

V1 of Lyra will support European calls and puts on ETH and BTC, with automatic cash settlement on expiry. Traders can both buy options from, and sell options to, the AMM. In the future Lyra will support more sophisticated positions, combining both spot and options trading, as well as spreads, straddles, strangles, and much more.

stocks,$BBAI - This AI Pure Play Is Very Close to Run a Lot Higher.,"Silver line: $BBAI is a pure play AI company that is 3 times cheaper than the notorious $AI while making the same revenue, has more military contracts, grows faster and it is at sharp discount after the. Also the abnormal low float might make it a lot more expensive, very fast.

You can search for the reason just by google $BBAI.

Wait, but **Who is $BBAI**

Big Bear AI (aka $BBAI) provides decision dominance (as they say) to intelligence communities, national defence and global corporations. Simplisticaly put: they analyze huge volumes of data, use a smart machine and can predict enemy moves, supply chain problems, predict the outcome of naval battle even before jumping in. etc.

The bigger that volume of data and the longer the built of the AI, the better the results.

**Let's see just how valuable is $BBAI and what can move it higher faster.**

I. **They outperform the AI market and that market is growing really fast**

**AI market is booming and everybody knows that.**

BBAI is not only in the right market but also outperforms that market.

The global Artificial Intelligence (AI) market size is expected to gain momentum by reaching USD 360.36 billion by 2028 while exhibiting a CAGR of **33.6%** between 2021 to 2028.

BigBear.ai’s is growing even faster: Customers is booming: **U.S. Intelligence Community, Department of Defense, and U.S. Federal Government, space companies, logistics companies, etc.** Some MOU with UAV Factory and Redwaire is building for new lines of business as well.

**Added more than $150 million of new contract awards in the third quarter only bringing total backlog to approximately $485 million as of September 30, 2021. Only in this Q3 only:**

* Entered into a one-year contract with the Defense Intelligence Agency to develop a force element tracking and identity platform utilizing Machine Assisted Rapid Repository Services (“MARS”) solution.
* Awarded the five-year, single award TACTICALCRUISER contract by the United States Cyber Command.
* Awarded one of two Global Force Information Management Phase 1 Prototype contracts by the United States Army.
* Entered into a three-year commercial partnership with Terran Orbital to support manufacturing and supply chain optimization, constellation tasking optimization, space situational awareness analytics, and sensor exploitation to identify relevant insights.

**Also this September BBAI has been selcted by Virgin Orbit to provide AI support for their launcing missions.**

[https://virginorbit.com/the-latest/bigbear-ai-enters-into-transformational-commercial-partnership-with-virgin-orbit-to-deploy-ai-powered-analytics-platform-for-end-to-end-responsive-launch-solutions/](https://virginorbit.com/the-latest/bigbear-ai-enters-into-transformational-commercial-partnership-with-virgin-orbit-to-deploy-ai-powered-analytics-platform-for-end-to-end-responsive-launch-solutions/)

As you can see their contracts get bigger and thier customer base is growing with famous names.

II. **Second reason to bet on BBAI:**

**Leadership that have the right connections and the right knowledge**

Defence and intelligence communities are hard difficult to penetrate unless there is some trust built in years. I;ve selected 2 key pple that you should know about:

**Reginal Brothers - CEO**

**""Reggie"" Brothers has deep connections and knowledge with in the military and intelligence R&amp;D**. Beside being former CTO at Peraton, Dr. Brothers served as **Under Secretary for Science and Technology at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security** (DHS) (**Obama nominee - yup**) where he was responsible for oversight of **Department of Defense (DoD) laboratories and helped ensure the long-term strategic direction of the Department’s Science and Technology programs.** Dr. Brothers has also held senior roles as Technical Fellow, Director of Mission Applications and Director of Advanced Programs and Technology at BAE Systems, Program Manager at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (**DARPA**) etc.

**Sam Gordy - a recent addition and meaningful one:** the new president of federal and chief operating officer of BigBear.ai can quickly rattle off the big numbers behind some of the lines of business he ran at **Leidos ($1.5 billion)** and at **IBM ($2.5 billion.)**. BigBear.ai is not at the same scale at $150 million in annual revenue today, but Gordy says the potential is huge and was one factor in his [decision to join the company on Nov. 1](https://washingtontechnology.com/blogs/editors-notebook/2021/11/bigbear-new-hires.aspx) 2021.

The list is bigger - but with only this 2 leaders of the company $BBAI have knowledge and access to some of the biggest move in the industry - either from the Federal Gov, military or from the corporate world.

III. **Third catalyst for BBAI: The right partners and the list os growing**

**Just 3 weeks ago BBAI announced the partnership with the king of inteligence data - Palantir.**

Either you like or not Pether Thiel, you have to admit he is a pretty smart and influent guy arround tech world - especially when is connected with the intelligence community.

""As part of the integrated product offering, Palantir’s Foundry platform will be integrated with BigBear.ai’s Observe, Orient and Dominate products, creating powerful machine learning extensions for the Palantir ecosystem that will provide global data collection, generate actionable insights and deliver anticipatory intelligence at enterprise scale to address high-growth federal and commercial verticals including space, retail, logistics and energy.""

In short - a lot , **really** a lot more customers for $BBAI - this exactly the part that I like from their partnership : BBAI capabilities are added as an extra to the Palantir Foundry - meaning 2 things: Palantir recognizing the value and uniqueness of BBAI platform and BBAI getting a lot more customers from Palantir.

Beside that you can see a list of partners on [bigbear.ai](https://bigbear.ai/) website even though, due to the nature of intelligence and military contracts (secrecy) they don't provide much details.

Sufice to say that among those partners you can count: Amazon, Microsoft Azure, Knime, Apian, etc.

IV. **How $BBAI stands in regard of valuation? Is it realy cheap at this price?**

So, [Bigbear.ai](https://bigbear.ai/) is the second pure play stock on Artifial Intelligence. You probably know the first one - $AI ([C3.ai](https://c3.ai/)) jumped some 200% after IPO and stayed in the headlines for months.

Let's compare this two, even if $AI is now a lot lower than it used to be.

**OK, let's see the valuation:**

$AI Market cap - 3.5B

FY2021 (they close reporting year in June) - they had 182M revenue

For 2022 - (June 2021 -june 2022) they expect 243M.

$BBAI Market Cap - 1.1B

**Full-year 2021 projected revenue between $160 million and $185 million**

For BBAI the reporting yesr ends in December.

You see revenues are pretty much in line with some 10% higher for $AI as they closed financial year 2021 in june. For 2022 $BBAI for example expects **260M.**

So, **$AI has now a 3.5B market cap. After IPO has spiked to almost 10B so this valuation now is a conservative number.**

**$BBAI has now 1.1 B market cap - 3 times cheaper whle playing in the same field, getting a lot more military contracts and growing faster.**

**Hey but $AI is making headlines while $BBAI is not**

**V. News/raly potential - some pretty cool stuf**

Here is what BBAI is doing and judge by yourself what are the ods we will see BgBearAI in th news headlines pretty soon:

In short , [BigBear.ai](https://bigbear.ai/) is using artificial intelligence to process some 160B data sources to generate real time predictions. They have 500M in back log contracts and made this year alone some 160M from contracts with the DoD (military), the navy, intelligence community.

**Want some examples: They have predicted Russia invasion of Crimea, routes for oil smugling in Mediteranian Sea and they are helping right now with strategies to engage Iran.**

**Very recent they have predicted China's moves in Twain airspace. (search ""china"" in this article to learn more)**

[https://washingtontechnology.com/blogs/editors-notebook/2021/12/bigbear-path-forward.aspx](https://washingtontechnology.com/blogs/editors-notebook/2021/12/bigbear-path-forward.aspx)

**Imagine how valuable is this for the National Security and mostly for the Defence Budget ;)**

**For the intelligence comunity they predict change in behaviout at hime and abroad. They have save 100years of human work (qualified and expensive intelligence work). Imagine how much value they created there.**

**For maritime comapanies they have predicted weather paterns, discovered new routes and new customers. Maritime shipping has been at the core of supply chain disruptions and there are billions there ready to grab if you can offer efficiency and results.**

So, with less attention and glamour today, $BBAI is a good candidate with high growth, strong moat and riding one of the most influential tech revolution of the century.

And yes, you might want to check the float and the redemptions as that might make BBAI a lot more expensive very fast before you have a chance to buy it. You can read more on that if you just google itor on twitter where this play is starting to trend.

But that is what I think. What do you think ? Open to any bear or bull reply.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Very important week for Stock and Crypto markets! Outlook into 2022! 15.12.2021 Update!,"# **BEGINNING OF THE MONTH.**    

*01.12.2021: **ADP report and Powell speech**    

So, Powell talked about the monetary and fiscal policies, it gave the market hints towards the fact that a taper might occur faster then expected, where he stands on inflation and retiring the word **transitory**.    

*03.12.2021: **Nonfarm Payrolls and Unemployment Report**    

Unemployment dropped to 4.2%, not bad buy still not what was expected. It was expected that we add around 500.000 new jobs ad only 200.000 were added.    

*08.12.2021: **JOLTS Report**    

The US is sitting at around 11 million jobs with no one to fill them. Not a good outcome.    

*10.12.2021: **CPI &amp;amp; CORE CPI and The Inflation Report**    

As you already read everywhere the consumer price index numbers were not good, they came in hot at  6.8%, numbers not seen since 82’.    

## **THIS WEEK.**    

*14.12.2021: **PPI &amp;amp; CORE PPI and Inflation Report**    

Now the consumer price index did not look good. We are looking at producer price index to understand the manufacturing costs and what the businesses are paying for raw materials.    

*__15.12.2021:__ **FOMC MEETING, FED Rate Decision and SEP**     

So, The Federal Open Market Committee meeting is coming with a Summary of Economic Projection (SEP) that basically will wrap up 2021 and also give us a clear look (I hope so) into what is the FED planing to do in 2022 regarding inflation,interest rates, GDP and unemployment. It will all be wrapped up with a speech from Mr. Powell which I am sure everyone is going to take it way to literally and hang on to every word.    

*17.12.2021: **Quadruple Witching Day**.    

No, halloween is not back, it is just a very specific Friday that only happens 4 times a year when a lot of derivatives of stock index futures, stock index options, stock options, and single stock futures expire simultaneously. So expect some volatility in the market!    

###**OUTLOOK**    

In the coming week, The Federal Reserve could decide to speed up the end of its bond-buying program and signal that it expects to start hiking interest rates in 2022.    
That is already widely anticipated by investors, ahead of the Fed’s meeting. Strategists don’t expect much market reaction , unless the central bank’s messaging includes a surprise or it’s forecast for interest rate hikes is more aggressive than expected.    
Also the FED dot-plot chart of inflation forecasts show that **half of FED officials expected one or two rate hikes next year, but there was no consensus for a hike**.    The first hikes were in 2023. So now people are expecting possibly two hikes penciled in for next year. Anything more and the markets will freak in my opinion.    

####**SUMMARY**    

If the fed decides to to increase their bond purchases to over 30 billion per month that means that rates increase might happen sooner than expected.    
If the FED pencils in more than the expected two hikes for next year, that would also be new information that the market needs to price in.    
What does it mean for crypto? Well if the FED remains dove-ish we might actually see the market start to rally a little next week but if the FED turns hawk-ish we expect crypto to bleed more until the news is digested and gets priced in.

*14.12.2021 **Update**    

So basically Wholesale prices rose 9.6% from a year ago, the highest level going back to November 2010. The pace was even faster than the 9.2% estimate. The core producer price index increased at a 6.9% pace, a bit slower than estimates but still the fastest ever in records dating to August 2014.    
In conclusion things are bad but they were expected to be, no shock to the markets as of today. We are looking to tomorrow to see what Mr Powell and Gang will bring us for Christmas.     

*15.12.2021 **Update**    

So as expected the FED increased the bond purchase to an expected 30 billion per month and that puts the interest rates to **0%** until March or May 2022. Easy to borrow money means happy investors. 3 rate hikes instead of the expected 2 but honestly the markets did not seem to mind. I have to say the Mr Powell came across as very honest and opened and the markets liked that. No cryptic language left for interpretation just straight facts. Yes we have an inflation problem and it persists longer than expected because Covid persists longer than expected, with 2 variants still plaguing us. No point in going into a ton of details, markets are happy and no surprises to scare investors, that was all we needed. Unless a 3rd variant appears I think we will have a nice Christmas!",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Understanding the Benefits of Bond Funds,"I am in the process of designing my investment portfolio and I am leaning towards an 80/20 or maybe 90/10 asset allocation between stocks and bonds. 

I am struggling to understand the benefit of holding a bond fund in a portfolio. I understand that they are meant to reduce volatility of the portfolio but it seems that a single bond (I know its less diversified) or a Target Maturity Bond would do a better job. 

Taking the vanguard BND fund as an example - the asset value of the ETF dropped around 13% during the COVID crash. Sure it quickly recovered, but so did the S&amp;P.500 If the bond fund is still volatile why should I hold it? 

If I simply bought and held until maturity an investment grade bond with similar yield (or better) as BND has right now (~1.6%) wouldn't that be much better for de-risking my portfolio?  

To be honest, I'm struggling to understand why I should hold bonds at all considering interest rates aren't much better than dividends on stocks (1.6% yield on BND vs 1.25% yield on VOO) but that's a different conversation. Right now I'm trying to understand the benefit of bond funds.",finance
personalfinance,Canceled VSA and GAP insurance three months ago but still not reflected in my balance,"So I bought a car three months ago as my old one died on me. When I bought the car I didn't do enough research and ended up buying the VSA (Toyota vehicle service agreement) and GAP insurance that the finance guy offered. Fast forward a few days after buying the car and I decided I didn't need nor want the VSA and GAP insurance. So I scheduled a meeting with the same finance guy at the dealership I bought the car at and asked him to cancel it. I signed a cancelation form requesting VSA and GAP for cancelation and I assumed he sent it off. That same day he told me that I would take three months for it to be reflected on my balance and by three months if it still isn't credited then I should come back for him to do it manually.

Today has been three months and I still haven't been credited a refund of the two services I wanted canceled. So I scheduled another meeting to cancel today. During the meeting he had me sign the same form again but GAP was not checked and when I told him that I also wanted that canceled he said to cancel one thing at a time or else things will get confusing for them to cancel???? And then he said he'll fax the form in. Before I left he gave me a number I could call to get updates on the status of the cancelation. So when I got home I called the number as I had been very suspicious of this entire process. The man on the other line confirmed what I suspected. That there was no cancelation submitted/requested three months ago... Nothing went through. And to cancel now I would only get a prorated amount refunded back BUT I can get the full amount back if the dealership sends in a backdated request canceling the services I wanted canceled. I then went right back to the dealership to talk to the same finance guy and asked for both GAP and the VSA to get backdated and canceled. So he printed out another form (same as the one I signed earlier in the day) but hand checked GAP as well. He also showed me a quick email he typed asking for it to be backdated, though I was unable to even see what or who the email was even going to and he was basically rushing me out now that I was being adamant about backdating my cancelation requests.

Now I have to wait about a week to check up on the status of the cancelation and see whether it actually is backdated and whether GAP was also included.

So my question now is whether there is any place I can put in a formal complaint about this? I doubt this tactic of telling a customer that they'll cancel a service but not canceling is illegal but def a shitty thing. If things still don't get figured out then I will def be going back to him and making sure I get my full refunds. But could I help escalate the process by putting in a formal complaint with the Better Business Bureau? Or the Consumer financial protection Bureau? Or the Federal Trade Commission?

If it matters I bought the car in Maryland but live in Virginia.",finance

The stock market opened the day but reversed course and bounced today as investors digested the Federal Reserve’s final monetary policy decision of 2021 and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech against a backdrop of persistent inflationary pressures. Bond yields rose up in the immediate aftermath of the Fed’s announcement, rising above 1.46%.

**Notable Numbers Today**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): +1.56%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): +2.28%
* Dow Jones (DIA): 1.02%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +1.59%
* Volatility Index (VIX): -6.84%
* NVIDIA (NVDA): +7.81%
* Apple (AAPL): +2.85%
* UnitedHealth (UNH): +3.11%

Today, the Fed announced it would double the pace of tapering and signaled a strong likelihood that there would be an interest hike, probably around August-September (according to the Fed’s dot-plot), the first since rates were slashed to near zero in March 2020. This was largely the expected outcome of this meeting. 

Since the depths of the pandemic, the Fed has added trillions of dollars in U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities to boost liquidity during a time of crisis and prevent a credit crunch. In November, the Fed started to taper the pace of those aggregate purchases by $15 billion per month, and will now double that pace to $30 billion per month.

A statement by the Fed said, “In light of inflation developments and the further improvement in the labor market, the Committee decided to reduce the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $20 billion for Treasury securities and $10 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities.”

The new pacing would bring all asset purchases to a full stop by March 2022, faster than the course set forth in November that originally sought to end purchases by the middle of next year. The decision had unanimous agreement.

A quicker taper gives the Fed room to move earlier on interest rate hikes. All of the 18 members present at the meeting said they could see the case for at least one rate hike next year, a noticeable revision up from [September projections showing a 50-50 split on a 2022 rate hike](https://news.yahoo.com/fed-fomc-monetary-policy-decision-september-2021-141145429.html).

The updated dot plots, which map out each of the FOMC members’ projections for where rates will be in coming years, shows the median member of the committee projecting three rate hikes next year, another three in 2023, and another two in 2024. Link for dot-plot below

The Fed said, “Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to elevated levels of inflation.”

The median expectation of the committee sees core personal consumption expenditures, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, 

clocking in at 2.6% in 2022 (compared to 2.2% in the Fed’s September projections). Core PCE came in at 4.1% in October (data for November core PCE comes out December 23.

The next Fed meeting is scheduled to take place Jan. 25 and 26.

Art Hogan, Chief Market Strategist at the National Securities Corporation said, “When you have an anticipation of higher interest rates, growth stocks or long-duration growth stocks certainly get hit the hardest. When you do that net present value calculation with a higher interest rate, that implied multiple or ascribed multiple to growth names comes in. So a lot of that's been priced in. When you think about some of those real ‘growth-y’ names and momentum names and risk assets, they've seen a lot of carnage already.""

He continued, “What the market is trying to tell us here is that when you set your asset allocation plan for next year, you want to have a barbell approach with growth on one side — you want to have those growth names that are actually valued at a multiple to earnings, not a multiple to revenues or a multiple to cash flows or a multiple to sales. We anticipate 2022 is going to be very much like 2021, where you really want to have a balance between growth and value.""

I broadly agree with this perspective, 2021 was a hard year for a lot of people who went too heavy into growth after an insane 2020. It’s always important to have a good mix between growth, value, and I’ll add safe ETFs.

**Highlights**

* Shares of Pfizer (PFE) jumped to a fresh record intraday high on Wednesday amid optimism over the company's COVID-19 pill, called Paxlovid. President Joe Biden said Tuesday that the White House had ordered enough of the antiviral pills to treat 10 million Americans, and that he was ""encouraged by the promising data"" that the drug-maker released on the pill. Pfizer's data showed earlier this week that the drug decreased the risk of hospitalization or death by 89% for high-risk adults. 
* Amazon's web hosting platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced connectivity issues Wednesday morning, triggering outages at platforms from Zoom Video Communications to Amazon-owned Twitch and other online services. 
* Retail sales were up 0.3% in November compared to October, [the Commerce Department said on Wednesday](https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf). This came in below the 0.8% monthly increase consensus economists were expecting, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. In October, retail sales rose 1.8%, which was upwardly revised from the 1.7% increase previously expected. 
* The office of the U.S. Trade Representative is concerned with Canada's announcement that it will continue to pursue a unilateral digital services tax, a USTR spokesperson said in a statement on Wednesday. “If Canada adopts a DST, USTR would examine all options, including under our trade agreements and domestic statutes,” it said.
* Food safety issues were found at over a dozen Starbucks outlets in the eastern Chinese city of Suzhou, regulators said on Tuesday, a day after the U.S. coffee chain was criticized for violations at two other outlets in another city.
* The Digital Markets Act (DMA), unveiled by EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager last December, sets out a list of dos and don'ts for U.S. tech giants designated as online gatekeepers with fines up to 10% of global turnover for violations, a global first.",finance

personalfinance,What are my options if mortgage rates rise while building a home?,"After the news from the US Federal Reserve that interest rates will happen at least 3 times in 2022, I would like to know from this community what to do in the event you are in the middle of building a home. 

I think the earliest you can lock in a mortgage rate before your home is built is 60 days maybe even 90 days if the lender is generous (i think 90 days is rare). However these days are just numbers I have heard from lenders in past discussions. 

If you agree to a home price with your builder and then interest rates rise would the builder adjust the price because of rising interest or is that a conversation where it is not worth it?

If interest rates rise while the house is built the mortgage goes up higher so is there anything that can be done to offset this? Is there any rules or tricks lenders can employ to combat this? 

It’s just been a long day with everything else going on so I am sorry if this is a dumb question. This is a new experience and maybe someone else has the same question and are afraid to ask. I appreciate the responses ahead of time and if there really is nothing that can be done could anyone share any positive outlooks.

Some limitations to be aware of, can’t buy used as the homes in my area area are in quite a need of repair and would prefer a new home. Prices are really inflated and I’m not sure I can risk the gamble of waiting to buy and see if prices go down which many people say prices for new builds are not going to come down. 

Thanks for your thoughts!",finance

Democrats were united in support of the measure, which passed the Senate 50 to 49 along party lines on Tuesday afternoon and then cleared the House in a 221-to-209 vote shortly after midnight on Wednesday. Republicans opposed the legislation en masse, with only one, Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, voting in favor. The bill now heads to President Biden, who was expected to quickly sign it.  


 “The American people can breathe easy and rest assured there will not be a default,” Mr. Schumer said in a speech on the Senate floor. He thanked Republicans, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, for their help in setting up the process and resolving a must-pass piece of fiscal legislation before the end of the year.

stocks,Cathie Wood sells ARK's high-conviction names even as she implies it's time to buy them. Such moves aren't necessarily illegal layer says.,"* Ark  Invest's Cathie Wood said in a recent interview that when her firm's  funds are losing ground, Ark looks to gear its positions towards the  company's highest-conviction stocks. However, Wood's voluntary trade disclosures shows that she's actually been  dumping some of her high-conviction names in recent days instead of  buying them.
* Wood told Bloomberg TV in an interview last week that  ""especially in periods where our style is out of favor... what we  usually do is consolidate our holdings towards our highest-conviction  names. \[Those\] are the names in our top 10 -- so the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), the Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC), Square (NYSE:SQ), Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and so forth.""
* However,  a review of trading records that Ark voluntarily releases every day  shows that Wood hasn't actually been buying any of the high-conviction  names she mentioned other than ROKU, and has instead dumped shares of  TSLA and SHOP:

**Ark Funds Have Been Falling**

* An  Ark spokeswomen didn't immediately have any comment on the firm's  moves, but the trades appear to go against what Wood told Bloomberg her  strategy is for periods where Ark funds are sinking.
* From Dec. 9-14, ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK) is -7%, ARK Autonomous Technology &amp; Robotics ETF (BATS:ARKQ) lost 4.7%, ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKW) is down 9.1%, ARK Genomic Revolution Multi-Sector ETF (BATS:ARKG) shed 3.3%, ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKF) is -8% and ARK Space Exploration &amp; Innovation ETF (BATS:ARKX) -2.6%.
* Wood's  interview with Bloomberg TV seemed to imply that in such down periods,  Ark will buy more of the firm's high-conviction names instead of selling  them.
* “When traditional asset  managers are managing their portfolios in a risk-off situation, they’re  diversifying to get closer to their indexes,"" the Ark chief said.  ""They’re buying index stocks and they’re selling our \[high-conviction\]  stocks, so we are there to pick up the pieces.”

**Such Moves Aren't Necessarily Illegal**

* Rachel  Spooner, a Boston College Carroll School of Management securities-law  professor and a former federal prosecutor, told that Ark  can sell stocks that Wood implied she was buying without necessarily  breaking any statutes.
* Spooner  said that as long as Wood is showing good faith, prosecutors wouldn't go  after Ark for such a short window of seemingly contradictory trades.
* ""If  she's acting in the best interest of her investors and that compels her  to change her mind, it's OK if she's being inconsistent with what she  said before.""
* But ironically, Wood's remarks came during an interview about ARK's new ARK Transparency ETF (BATS:CTRU), which focuses on companies with good transparency about their operations.
* Wood  said that ARK considers transparency important for its own operations,  telling Bloomberg that ""we call ourselves' radically transparent.'""
* Meanwhile, Wood continues to defend her belief in long-term deflation despite U.S. consumer prices recently recording their largest jump in 39 years.",finance
personalfinance,Is paying off student loans (or debt in general) not that big of a deal?,"Since finishing paying off my private sector student loans a couple months ago my credit score has gone down 10 points and I still get billing statements from Sallie Mae for $0.00 and *accelerate* credit card promos for Cashback on purchases to count towards my student loans. Is this normal? 

I finished paying off my privately held student loans this year. I graduated college in 2016 with about half my debt belonging to the DoE and the other half to Sallie Mae. I haven't done anything with the federal loans since they were put in forbearance in 2020 on favor of getting aggressive with the (much higher interest) Sallie loans. I made the final payment on the Sallie loans about 2 months ago so the only debt I have currently is from the federal student loans (which are up to date on payment). Since the start of the year my debt has been cut by about 50%. 

The Sallie Mae loan was my first line of credit and I got my first credit card in 2018, so now my oldest line of credit has halved and my average account age has plummeted. According to the TransUnion and CreditWise apps that I get access to from my credit card apps, the biggest contributors holding back my score are lack of first mortgage and oldest/average account age. 

My score is now the same as it was in January of 2021 despite eliminating half of my total debt, having no more privately held debt (outside of rolling balance on credit cards which are payed off in full every month) and having available credit up to twice my total debt (and about half my income for what that's worth). 

Is eliminating debt just not that big of a deal as far as credit rating goes? I understand why account age is such a big thing but I'm hoping to be gearing up towards my first mortgage at some point here and the lack of improvement relative to how hard I've been working at this is incredibly disheartening. Is it just a thing I have to wait another month on until it's properly reported by Sallie Mae or smth or is this just how it is?",finance

CryptoCurrency,First Tokenized S&amp;P Index Funds Launched on Securitize Markets. Tokenized using the Algorand blockchain. BULLISH.,"NEW YORK, Dec. 15, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Securitize, the leading firm using blockchain to expand access to the capital markets, announced today the launch of two new tokenized funds tracking two of the most innovative indices from S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, the world's leading index provider, a major milestone in institutional innovation and adoption of blockchain.

The S&amp;P indices being tokenized and offered by Securitize are:

* The [Securitize S&amp;P Cryptocurrency Large Cap Ex-MegaCap Index](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3390973-1&amp;h=335945494&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fsecuritize.io%2Finvest%2Fsecuritize-capital-funds%2Fspglobal-cryptocurrency-large-cap-ex-mega-tokenized-fund&amp;a=Securitize+S%26P+Cryptocurrency+Large+Cap+Ex-MegaCap+Index), and

\- ADVERTISEMENT -

The news is particularly significant because these are the first indices from S&amp;P DJI -- and the first funds based on indices from a major index provider -- to be tokenized, demonstrating growing interest by leading financial institutions and demand from investors in adopting the benefits of blockchain technology, including easier access, greater efficiency, and much lower trading fees. The move is also in line with recent fund announcements and regulatory actions indicating that the tokenization of these funds is expected to be the beginning of a wave of fund tokenization over the coming year.

Accredited and institutional investors have access to S&amp;P DJI's indices in a tokenized format for the first time, at a low management fee of just 0.5%. The funds will be offered through Securitize's digital asset management arm, Securitize Capital, and available on its alternative assets marketplace, Securitize Markets, alongside Securitize Capital's existing Bitcoin and USDC yield funds. The funds are open for investment immediately and are tokenized using the Algorand blockchain protocol.

""S&amp;P DJI's innovation and leadership in tokenizing its indices is a major sign that institutions understand the many advantages of tokenization--from efficiency to easier investor access--and, I anticipate will be the start of a wave of tokenized funds over the coming months,"" said Scott Harrigan, CEO of Securitize Markets. ""Securitize Markets offers institutional, accredited and retail investors a diverse and growing range of tokenized investment opportunities under one roof, from equity in private businesses to yield funds to, now, index funds, and we couldn't be more excited to work with S&amp;P DJI.""

""S&amp;P DJI is the world's leading index provider, making the launch of these first tokenized S&amp;P funds today a bold and important signal to the markets that S&amp;P DJI intends to continue its leadership as traditional finance is quickly becoming digitized,"" said Wilfred Daye, Head of Securitize Capital. ""The new tokenized funds provide investors exposure to a diverse blend of cryptocurrencies and emerging technologies. In particular, they are a new, efficient option for family offices, institutions and accredited investors looking for exposure to promising cryptocurrencies and exposure to disruptive global companies.""

""We are excited to work with Securitize in tokenizing two of S&amp;P DJI's most innovative indices, the S&amp;P Cryptocurrency Large Cap Ex-MegaCap and S&amp;P Kensho New Economies Composite indices,"" said Peter Roffman, Global Head of Innovation and Strategy at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. ""These innovative benchmarks provide market participants with needed transparency into some of the most exciting emerging asset classes in cryptocurrency as well as companies propelling the fourth industrial revolution.""

The funds offer investors exposure to top-performing cryptocurrencies and emerging technologies.

The Securitize S&amp;P Cryptocurrency Large Cap Ex-Mega Tokenized Fund is a tokenized version of the [S&amp;P Cryptocurrency Large Cap Ex-MegaCap Index](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3390973-1&amp;h=3236140368&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spglobal.com%2Fspdji%2Fen%2Findices%2Fdigital-assets%2Fsp-cryptocurrency-largecap-ex-megacap-index%2F%23overview&amp;a=S%26P+Cryptocurrency+Large+Cap+Ex-MegaCap+Index), offering investors exposure to a diverse blend of top-performing cryptocurrencies, which rebalance based upon performance.

personalfinance,Would this credit profile be denied a mortgage loan in underwriting?,"I have a relative who is  trying to buy a home right now despite having no down payment, low credit, and high debt. I keep telling her that with her profile she has a slim to none chance of mortgage approval. 

* Credit Scores: EX 660 EX 666 TU 679
* Income: $70,000
* Student Loan: $172,000 (mostly federal loans, on an IDR plan not sure of the exact number)
* Car Note: $409/month (paid off in full in February 2022)
* Wedding Loan: $219/month (11% interest!)
* Credit Card 1: $1790 (Limit is $1800) She pays the minimums on both cards and then runs the balances back up, thus never paying off the cards in full.
* Credit Card 2: $2998 (Limit is $3000) Both cards have 24.99% APR.

She is awful with money. For context, she constantly has overdrafts on her bank account on a weekly basis. Her bank account is frequently in the negatives. She has overdraft protection through her bank but because she is paid semimonthly, when she gets paid her overdraft fees eat away her paycheck and other transactions cause her to frequently end up with a negative balance. She has not gone a single month with zero overdrafts this entire year. She said that she got a preapproval for $300,000 but I am doubtful that she can pass underwriting and get a clear to close.

I have tried educating her on the mistake she is making looking for a mortgage when her profile sucks but she cannot be convinced. I told her that her dti is too high, her credit score is too low, and that since she has no down payment and several NSFs on her bank account that no bank would approve a loan. I am worried that she will attempt to get a mortgage through a subprime lender or do some kind of shady lease to own option.

CryptoCurrency,"“There may not be a crypto bear market at all” and BTC will get flipped” , Says Multicoin Capital Exec.","While the crypto economy has tumbled in value during the last two weeks, the managing partner at Multicoin Capital, Kyle Samani, recently shared his views on why he thinks the “next bear market will not be like the last one.” In fact, Samani remarks that there may not even be “a bear market at all.”

Multicoin Capital Executive Claims the ‘Next Bear Market Will Not Be Like the Last One’
One thing is for sure, cryptocurrency investors are fearful of a full-on bear market like the past two crypto winters that shaved digital currency prices by more than 80% in value after each top. Currently, anywhere between 25% to 30% of the value since the crypto price highs on November 10, have been lost and bearish sentiment has put pressure on the crypto economy as a whole. However, despite the 30% drawdown in market values, Multicoin Capital’s managing partner Kyle Samani shared his thoughts in a recent Twitter thread published two days ago.

“Why the next bear market will not be like the last one,” Samani said. “And in fact, we may not have a bear market at all. Or we may have half a bear market, depending on your perspective.” Samani further says that broadly speaking, there are two types of people in crypto: “money crypto” and “tech crypto.” In recent times, or since 2017, Samani claims that the tech crypto group has dominated. “Since 2017, tech crypto has come to dominate the zeitgeist,” Samani stressed.

Samani remarked that these days, it is clearly evident that tech crypto dominates and he says “there are still lots of people who just think about BTC as an inflation hedge, but they represent an increasingly small [percentage] of press, social media, conference speaking, etc.” The Multicoin Capital executive added:

Money crypto people think primarily about interest rates, the politicization of central banks, etc. Tech people care about building. Inevitably, politicians/CBs will do stuff that is bad for BTC as an inflation hedge. Whether that’s banning it (or trying to), or just raising rates, or whatever. There is a natural ebb and flow to the actions of these institutions, and BTC-USD will naturally respond to it.

Samani further stated that tech people don’t care about those types of things and that “they just want to build cool new things.” If bitcoin dropped by 50% because of government enforcements, Samani claims tech people will continue to build and investors will “invest in tech crypto.”

“It’s possible that crypto is still a few years too early from truly breaking into the mainstream,” Samani noted on Sunday. “But I think at this point, that no longer matters. The train has left the station: all of the tech builders and investors have underwritten tech crypto as having a meaningful probability of reshaping commerce, finance, and the fabric of society at large. And they are comfortable meeting on that and holding for years,” the Multicoin Capital executive said.

economy,Correct me if I’m wrong,"Okay allow me to try and implement what I just learned in macroeconomics this past semester lol. 

Less bond purchases by the fed means decrease in money supply. Decrease in money supply means higher equilibrium interest rates. Higher interest rates calls for lower planned investment and therefore less aggregate expenditure. Overall aggregate demand decreases meaning short term lower inflation and lower output. 

1) How long will it take for price level to decrease as a result of this monetary policy? 

2) With supply chain bottlenecks still in place, will the lower output cause problems for consumers? (Shortage)",finance
CryptoCurrency,These no-coiners just don’t get it,"I very rarely try to explain crypto to people. I resist the urge to talk about these things because most people are just so close minded but today I tried to tell a cousin about crypto and blockchain technology. At first they said “yea I heard about those coin things it’s so stupid” which nearly gave me an aneurysm so I insisted on ranting about the intelligence of it all. 

First of all how do the words “decentralized, trustless, borderless”, in some cases “deflationary” “permanent and unchangeable ledger system protected/built upon hitherto uncrackable encryption” mean so little to these no coiners? The reason you might want to own crypto (aside from profits) is the same reason you might want to own a gun. It puts the power in the people’s hands!

“But it’s so volatile” Btc is up 46,800% since August 9th 2013 in this very moment! Short term volatility is a weak argument against it unless you’ve invested more than you can afford to lose! 

“But NFTS really are stupid” Well maybe a little stupid right now, buts it’s cause they’re in their infancy. They have the potential to completely change the way we claim asset ownership. They could make documents unforgeable. Commercial and government issued identification or proof of ownership could be fool-proofed with this technology! 

“But there is no tangible value in it” The blockchain behind it is the value! Blockchain technology, aside from a currency being linked to it, is a revolutionary and fool-proof way of storing data. All the data leaks that happen these days wouldn’t be happening, and if they did, you would know that it was an inside job, or poor security practice on the key keepers part.

This information should be absolutely blowing these no-coiners minds! Some of them it does, and the others will be playing catch up in a few years.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Bond fund prices - beyond just the theory,"I know all of the theory, bond prices move inverse to their yield… and for every 1 year of duration, a 1% price decline will result from a 1% rate hike.

But nobody seems to be able to explain the reality, what is really going on when bond fund prices move. 

As best I can tell, bond fund prices seem to “bake in” future interest rate expectations, much like stock prices do with future earnings expectations. Either that, or maybe it’s the mix of redemptions and new issues to the fund that are messing with the price?

There is also a clear impact to price from supply &amp; demand by investors on bond prices during times of market distress. This was clearly seen during March 2020 when bond fund prices detached from their NAV. That is an important consideration when you are trying to rebalance your portfolio during a downturn, but nobody seems to talk about it. Am I wrong?",finance
personalfinance,"How does state tax work for nomadic, retired people","Let's say I am lucky and can retire early in the US. Every year, I pull out money from an Index fund, and I pay long-term capital gains tax on it. I pay 15% (or 20%) tax federally. That makes sense. State tax gets confusing to me. 

Let's say I want to travel the world after early retirement. I will set up a some scenarios just so I can understand how it plays out.

Scenario 1: I travel all through Europe for a year. I am barely/never in the states. Do I pay state tax at all and if so where? 

Scenario 2: I move to a different state every 2 months to explore. Do I pay state tax in 6 different states?

Scenario 3: I spend 7 months in Washington (0% state tax rate) and 5 months in California (13+% state tax rate). Do I pay tax in both states (so like 7% state tax)? Or just Washington because I stayed longer (so 0% tax)? Does it matter what state I was in when I specifically pulled the money out from Index funds, assuming it was just one lump sum? 

Thanks for the help! You don't have to stay within the scenarios...I just made them up because I thought it might be easier that way.",finance
personalfinance,"One house, two choices. Rent or Buy?","Hey Reddit, hoping to get some additional perspectives on a rather large personal and financial decision I will be making shortly.

I currently have the opportunity to buy or rent a single family home I have been sharing with a family member who is moving out within a few months.  The house is in a (supposedly) top ten real estate market in the northeast US.  If I buy I can expect mortgage and utilities to be ~45% of my take home pay (am prequalified and can avoid PMI). If I continue to rent alone it will be ~25%  of take home pay (cover current mortgage and utilities).  I’m sure the option to buy would be available further down the road as well, but I’m concerned the home may appreciate significantly or interest rates sill jump.

I’m confident that I could manage either  payment easily, as I have been budgeting that mortgage/utility amount into investments to this point without feeling limited in my other spending.  I have stable employment close to the home with a short commute.

My question mainly revolves around whether it is worth committing a larger portion of my income in order to lock in low interest rates and start building equity.  I’m aware the %cost is edging towards house poor status, but I believe that this is a market with nowhere to go but up and it may be wise to enter it asap.

 Would also appreciate perspectives from single guys in their 30s who own a home… do you feel restricted by your home ownership? Do you regret giving up the increased degrees of freedom of renting?  I would appreciate any insight from the personal perspective as well",finance
personalfinance,Auto loan advice/emotional advice,"After reading this you’re going to think something is wrong with me, and there probably is. I’m keeping this straight to the point.

I’m living out of my Mercedes Benz, I need to know how I can get rid of this financed car. My payments with insurance are about 900 a month and probably will increase because I got into an accident. As of now I owe 22K but I have a high interest rate so that’s just going to increase unless I start making big payments or crash it and have GAP pay it off. KBB is saying it’s worth 18K so I’m like 4-5K underwater but I just don’t have the means to make an 5K payment right now. 

I make 5K a month and plan on getting a weekend job which I’m seeing will get me to about 5,700-,5800 a month. If you’re wondering how I got into this situation- I work 80 hours a week already. I didn’t want to sign up for another lease because I spend to little time at home with working all this hours and hotel on weekends because I usually go out. I wanted to try living out of a car so save money and will be easier for me during the week. I kept running late doing both jobs from sleeping, driving, and traffic, with this new situation I haven’t been late to work because I’ll go from one job to another then Go back to the first job area and sleep until my shift. I really didn’t want to get a lease so I thought I’ll get a nice car to live in. I do enjoy this lifestyle but it’s kind of getting to me because I feel like a homeless person. This feeling is like no other, I feel outside of society and just more messy and my minds all over the place. I feel like everyone knows I’m homeless and thinks I’m stupid, I just feel ridiculous. 

I didn’t know how expensive this Mercedes will be. I’m good with payments and maintenance but I did research with repairs and I’m not ok spending over 3K every 7 months on repairs. It’s a 2016 c class, very nice but my anxiety eats me alive everyday wondering what can go wrong and just being homeless finding places to park and sleep on the weekends and the heat is getting to me. 

It’s been like 10 months and I’m now seeing how I trapped myself in these long work hours due to this car. I have 14K in savings, I had 20 K and blew it. I suffered a car accident my fiancé dying and a health condition that really just made me miserable and I jumped into this lifestyle and I’m starting to regret it. I miss having spare time. Before this I worked 60 hours and had spare time and my own place. 

I have a Honda as back up so getting a new car isn’t really an issue, it’s the getting rid of this one. I don’t want to hurt my credit my credit had rose 110 points with taking this loan out somehow.  I wish I could roll over the equity onto something that doesn’t require me to get another car but I don’t think that’s possible. 

I make enough to pay it off in like 4 months but I can’t have all my money go towards it, I need an  emergency fund. I need to keep and save as much money as I can. I have bad ADD and anxiety like my mood just changes a lot just last week I was very content with my situation and now I’m getting anxious about it. I don’t know what the f I’m doing. I feel so alone and isolated.




I go back and fourth with whether I like living like this. I posted this then 6 minutes later I’m like I don’t mind living like this. I just can’t live like this with this car as it traps me to live like this. I can’t function with this anxiety of if something goes wrong with this car how much it’ll cost me, that’s really the issue I have.",finance
stocks,Bonds in a retirement portfolio,"Let me briefly explain my understanding of bonds, but by no means, I claim to understand this completely. A bond is a sort of a loan that investors give to the borrower and the detail of the bond include the date that the principal is due to be paid to the bond owner and also the terms of the variable of fixed interest rate. The value of the bonds rises as interest rates decline as the current bonds become more valuable compared with the newer ones with lower interest rates. 

Given that interest rates have been historically low even well pre-covid, my question is whether any retirement portfolio (20-25 years horizon) should include any bonds like FTLTX or FIFZX? Given that the price for these bonds is at almost its highest ever and with the interest rates going up the bonds will go down (?) should I sell the 10% bonds in my portfolio and put it into something like the total market? Again, I don't consider Reddit posts as financial advice but rather as comments to help improve my understanding of these investment instruments.",finance

# Market Insight: The FED announcement

&amp;#x200B;

The Federal Reserve announced the scale-back of aggressive monetary policy that began pre-pandemic in direct response to rising inflation. This past report covers the CPI rate of 6.8% announced in early December. The FED stated they would begin tapering bond purchases by 30% followed by rate hikes that are projected to begin in early 2022. The FED predicts inflation will reduce by 50% by the end of next year alongside improved economic numbers. Omnicron was noted as variable.  

**What this means for crypto**

There lies a possibility that rate hikes could trigger the end of the crypto bull run. Their delay would be the best scenario. The rates will likely be 0.0% until March or May but a few factors such bad economic results or Omnicron could alter this stance.

Lower rates allow market participates greater access to debt. More debt equates to greater sums of money in the market, and this permits traders to take on greater risk. Traders will be inclined to take less risk if the money supply decreases. Crypto is an on-risk asset because of its high volatility and will be highly affected by rate hikes. The March and May FOMC meetings will hold the utmost importance for crypto.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**FOMC scheduled meetings:**  
January 25-26       (likely decrease in bond purchases by another 30%)  
March 15-16         (likely completion of bond purchases, possible rate hike)  
May 3-4 (Likely rate hike)

&amp;#x200B;

The drawdown in Bitcoin was related to the FED’s hawkish stance following the CPI inflation mark. **Crypto has a higher probability of correcting now that a not-so-aggressive policy change has been absorbed.**

All in all, this is the best news for crypto. Between the high inflation numbers and the political scrutiny, it was probable the FED would increase tapering. The crypto market will encompass a favorable 2-3 months of 0.0% rates and it could be **indicative of a strong January and possible EOY run.**

# NEWBIES’ Lesson of the day

**The effect of leverage on crypto markets**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ys3qwlg5kt581.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cf3b4c29c67b28d21488fd5d92bfecbcf0ee148

&amp;#x200B;

[*This lesson goes in conjunction with the NEWBIE lesson on yesterday’s report.*](https://medium.com/coinmonks/crypto-market-update-and-investing-report-12-14-bitcoin-on-chain-metrics-15a01d2c932e)

Leveraged positions have a strong effect on the crypto market. The more leverage there is, the more volatility will increase. Volatility is the velocity of up and down movement of price.

If a trader holds a leveraged position of 10:1, he essentially is opening 10 positions. This is a common leverage available to anyone who can access an exchange. Leverage can be as high as 150:1 on some trading platforms. That means you can open 5.5 DOT positions with one dollar! If this seems ridiculous and risky, it’s because it is. Exchanges earn notable profits on leveraged trading fees and since bots control the stop losses, they pose little risk to the exchange.

Stop losses for leveraged positions are typically close to the current price of any asset. If price moves aggressively in one direction, many leveraged positions tend to be stopped out. If 100 open trades with 100:1 leverage (100x100) are being stopped out, that is 10,000 positions being closed at once. This puts tremendous pressure on price to move quickly (volatility) while attempting to close all positions.

The risk is bidirectional whereas leveraged positions can be opened long or short. Longs are buyer that want the market up and shorts are sells that want the market down.

Most holders don’t want an excess amount of leverage in the market. Holders prefer a spot-driven market opposed to a leverage-driven market. The volatility in a leverage-driven market contributes to a lot of traders selling dips exaggerated by leverage.

* *Leveraged positions add volatility to the market*
* *Leveraged positions hold a lot of risk*
* *Leveraged positioned are near the current price*
* *When there are high numbers of directional positions, the risk lies in that direction*
* *When the market moves quickly in a direction, it will be exacerbated by leveraged positions*

Tomorrow I will show you how to spot leverage in the markets, now that you have a better understanding of leverage. It will be another valuable tool in helping you make future decisions in these wild crypto markets.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I hope everyone enjoyed being trillionaires for a few hours last night during the CoinMarketCap glitch. If we hodl long enough, maybe it will be real one day!

Thanks for reading fam!

Put $5k down and my credit sucks so my rate is 6%. I’m realizing I will barely be able to afford the payments now that student loans are restarting and some other expenses are rising. Yes I can make them but it’s gonna make everything tight. 

So what’s the smartest thing to do? Sell to carmax right away and get a $5k car off Facebook? Just keep making payments and refinance in a year or two? Or just keep the car until I pay it off?

personalfinance,What to do with $4500 CD,"Hello. I have a CD from when I was younger that I am trying to figure out what to do with.

I am 24 and live in a HCOL city, however, I live at my parents place so I do not have to pay rent and I do not have any large expenses in the foreseeable future.

I work at a job paying 60k/year, I am maxing out my Roth IRA and contributing everything I can towards my 401k and taxable brokerage account.

I have $4500 in a CD maturing in 2025 with a 1.1% interest rate but I am wondering if I should break the CD early, pay the penalty of $52 and use the money for something else.

It feels bad having that money inflate away because its earning such a low interest rate. I shouldn't have allowed the money to be put here in the first place but I was younger and following the advice of my parents.

I’m trying to decide between buying I bonds with the money so that in a year when I am able to redeem them they could function as an emergency fund, investing the money in my brokerage account, or just leaving it in the CD for four more years and hope inflation goes down. Thoughts?

Thanks",finance

ethereum,An open letter to Vitaly Buterin (Financial Internet),"Good afternoon, Vitaly.

I highly appreciate your work in the development of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in general. It seems to me that you have a systematic approach and that is why I am addressing you with the idea of becoming an inspiration or creator of the global financial Internet. The Financial Internet is a decentralized network of the 1st level, for the exchange of means of payment, cryptocurrencies. It does not imply tokens and transaction fees. This is just a protocol that allows you to make transactions and create smart contracts. At the same time, it allows you to send any cryptocurrency to any person with an electronic wallet inside the network. For all cryptocurrencies, one wallet will be needed. Now the Ethereum network also reflects all tokens created on its basis. This is very important and convenient. I can send any cryptocurrency to my supplier by agreement with him and this will not require additional actions from him. A single protocol allows you to organize an exchange more simple and convenient, from one cryptocurrency to another. Miners in this network will not be required. This network will require significantly less energy resources and the methods of issuing cryptocurrencies will be completely different. And the most important difference is that this network is created and tied directly to the needs of the economy.

Providers will support such a network, now miners perform this role in many cryptocurrencies. These providers will act as financial emission centers that launch their cryptocurrency based on the financial Internet protocol. This cryptocurrency will be in circulation on the market and traded on the stock exchange. This is how Ethereum now allows you to create your own tokens using smart contracts. The issue of such cryptocurrencies will be tied to market demand and will have a lot in common with the issue and additional issue of shares. Since many people will need their cryptocurrencies, there will be many financial centers that support the Financial Internet protocol. A network of providers can be conditionally called a level 2 network, and their tokens are level 2 cryptocurrencies. These providers and at the same time financial centers will act as a new generation of Banks and create applications, electronic wallets and other infrastructure or environment for entrepreneurs, for the subsequent creation of a level 3 network and level 3 cryptocurrencies. Entrepreneurs based on applications of financial centers and their smart contracts will be able to create their own stablecoin with a fixed nominal value tied to the national currency without deep knowledge and some serious equipment or staff. These tokens will allow them to sell their goods and services to end consumers for these tokens, including on credit, but again for these tokens. Stablecoin will have a lot in common with the bonus system that many companies now have. Their issue will occur at the time of the exchange of Fiat for these tokens. But unlike bonuses, an entrepreneur will have the opportunity to sell his goods or services on credit and, through promotions, make the exchange rate of his token float in relation to fiat, increasing its attractiveness and thereby stimulating demand. Conditionally, a product worth one dollar, he can sell for 95 cents in his tokens. Such tokens can be stored for some time in the buyer's electronic wallet without movement. This will allow the entrepreneur to receive an interest-free loan from them for his not yet sold goods or services. In fact, this will be equivalent to making a Pre-order on the part of the buyer. Moreover, the algorithms make it possible to implement the idea of free money by Silvio Gesell, when their nominal value will fade over time, which should increase the speed of circulation of this money. In general, an entrepreneur will have new tools to develop his business and stimulate demand. To create such stablecoins, level 2 cryptocurrencies will be needed, which will be ""locked"" in smart contracts and will be conditional collateral. Accordingly, the more attractive the environment and infrastructure created by the financial center for entrepreneurs, the greater the demand for its cryptocurrency will be and the higher its exchange rate on the exchange. There will be competition between providers. At the same time, their number is not limited. There will also be competition between entrepreneurs, and therefore they will also try to make their tokens attractive to consumers. As the previous international economic practice has shown, such local currencies in closed local economic circuits, such as producer-shop-employee and consumer, stimulate all links of this circuit very well and increase the turnover rate of such money, thereby solving the problem with liquidity in the economy. Competition between entrepreneurs will grow and push the economy to develop. The interest for the loan from all entrepreneurs will be floating, and it will also be a tool for attracting consumers (buyers). Conditionally, I can buy the same product on credit from different entrepreneurs, but with different interest rates. In general, the financial Internet and such a global network launch a mechanism for creating private money and their competition, as Nobel laureate Friedrich Hayek wrote in his book ""The Denationalization of Money"". This will give the entire global economy new tools for growth and development. The well-known economist Thomas H. Greco, Jr. called such a network VITA (life). It really should give life to the economy.

Добрый день, Виталий.

Высоко оцениваю Ваш труд в развитии криптовалют и блокчейн технологии в целом. Мне кажется, у вас есть системный подход и именно поэтому обращаюсь к вам с идеей стать вдохновителем или создателем глобального финансового интернета. Финансовый Интернет это децентрализованная сеть 1 уровня, для обмена платежными средствами, криптовалютами. Она не подразумевает токенов и комиссии за проведение транзакций. Это всего лишь протокол, который позволяет совершать транзакции и создавать смарт-контракты. При этом он позволяет внутри сети отправлять любую криптовалюту любому человеку с электронным кошельком. Для всех криптовалют, будет нужен один кошелек. Сейчас в сети Ethereum тоже отражаются все токены созданные на ее базе. Это очень важно и удобно. Я могу своему поставщику отправить по договоренности с ним любую криптовалюту и это не потребует от него дополнительных действий. Единый протокол позволяет и обмен организовать более простой и удобный, одной криптовалюты на другую. Майнеры в данной сети не потребуются. Данная сеть потребует значительно меньше энергоресурсов и способы эмиссии криптовалют будут совершенно другие. И самое важное отличие это то, что данная сеть создается и привязана напрямую к потребностям экономики.

Поддерживать такую сеть будут провайдеры, сейчас эту роль во многих криптовалютах выполняют майнеры. Данные провайдеры будут выступать как финансовые эмиссионные центры, запускающие на базе протокола финансового Интернета свою криптовалюту. Данная криптовалюта будет находиться в обращении на рынке и торговаться на бирже. Это как сейчас Ethereum позволяет с помощью смарт-контрактов создавать свои токены. Эмиссия таких криптовалют будет привязана к спросу на рынке и будет иметь много общего с выпуском и дополнительной эмиссией акций. Так как потребность в своих криптовалютах будет у многих, то и финансовых центров, поддерживающих протокол финансового интернета будет много. Сеть из провайдеров условно можно назвать сетью 2 уровня, а их токены криптовалютами 2 уровня. Данные провайдеры и одновременно финансовые центры будут выступать как Банки нового поколения и создавать приложения, электронные кошельки и другую инфраструктуру или среду для предпринимателей, для последующего создания сети 3 уровня и криптовалют 3 уровня. Предприниматели на базе приложений финансовых центров и их смарт контрактов смогут без глубоких знаний и какого-то серьезного оборудования или штата создавать свои stablecoin, с фиксированным номиналом, привязанным к национальной валюте. Данные токены позволят им продавать конечным потребителям свои товары и услуги за эти токены, и в том числе в кредит, но опять же за эти токены. Stablecoin будут иметь много общего с бонусной системой, которую сейчас имеют многие компании. Их эмиссия будет происходить в момент обмена Фиата на данные токены. Но в отличие от бонусов предприниматель получит возможность свой товар или услугу продавать в кредит и путем рекламных акций делать плавающим курс своего токена по отношению к фиату, повышая его привлекательность и стимулируя тем самым спрос. Условно товар стоимостью в один доллар, он может продать за 95 центов в своих токенах. Такие токены могут какое-то время храниться в электронном кошельке покупателя без движения. Это позволит предпринимателю получать беспроцентный кредит от них за свой еще не проданный товар или услугу. Фактически это будет равнозначно совершению Предзаказа со стороны покупателя. Более того, алгоритмы позволяют реализовать идею свободных денег Silvio Gesell, когда их номинал с течением времени будет угасать, что должно повысить скорость обращения данных денег. В общем, у предпринимателя появятся новые инструменты для развития своего бизнеса и стимулирования спроса. Для создания таких stablecoin понадобятся криптовалюты 2 уровня, которые будут «запираться» в смарт-контрактах и являться условным обеспечением. Соответственно чем привлекательней созданная финансовым центром среда и инфраструктура для предпринимателей, тем больше будет спрос на его криптовалюту и тем выше ее курс на бирже. Между провайдерами будет конкуренция. При этом их количество не ограничено. Между предпринимателями тоже будет конкуренция и поэтому они свои токены тоже постараются сделать привлекательными для потребителей. Как показала предыдущая международная экономическая практика, такие местные валюты в замкнутых местных экономических контурах, типа производитель-магазин-работник и потребитель очень хорошо стимулируют все звенья данного контура и увеличивают скорость оборота таких денег, решая тем самым проблему с ликвидностью в экономике. Конкуренция между предпринимателями будет расти, и толкать к развитию экономику. Процент за кредит у всех предпринимателей будет плавающим, и он будет тоже являться инструментом для привлечения потребителей (покупателей). Условно один и тот же товар я могу купить в кредит у разных предпринимателей, но с разной процентной ставкой. В целом финансовый интернет и такая глобальная сеть запускает механизм создания частных денег и их конкуренции, о чем писал в своей книге ""The Denationalization of Money"" нобелевский лауреат Friedrich Hayek. Это позволит дать всей мировой экономике новые инструменты для роста и развития. Такую сеть известный экономист Thomas H. Greco, Jr. назвал VITA (жизнь). Она действительно должна дать жизнь экономике.

&gt;ISTANBUL, Dec 16 (Reuters) - The Turkish lira dropped to an all-time lowbeyond 15 against the dollar on Thursday ahead of another expected interest rate cutby the central bank, which has fallen in line with President Tayyip Erdogan's risky new economic programme.
&gt;
The lira touched 15.2 at 0606 GMT, a record low, and it has shed more than 50% of its value so far this year.  The central bank is expected to cut its policy rate by 100 basis points to 14% at its policy-setting meeting later in the day, a Reuters poll showed despite inflation soaring above 21%.  
***  
  
Believe it or not, the Lira was 8.3 per dollar on 1 September. If Turkey cut rates more on Thursday we are going to see FX fireworks and this risks contagion to other EM currencies and also Eurozone banks exposed to Turkey. (We are talking about the world's 20th largest economy here!)",finance

Yesterday the Fed announced 3 interest rate hikes to tackle inflation in 2022. This hawkish move pushed the stock market up after nearly a week of constant decline.

Why didn't this push the stock market down further? My understanding is that if there are planned interest rate hikes, this tends to decrease equity valuations so the market goes down. Can someone explain why it went up?

CryptoCurrency,Question about Custodial Ethereum Wallets,"I set up an account with Midas Investments due to their attractive interest rates and daily returns, and transferred a couple bags over — ETH, SUSHI, LINK, and FTM. They all have the same wallet address. The first three went through flawlessly, but FTM didn’t show up. I didn’t test a small amount first since the first three went through with no hiccups. I later realized I needed to convert it from ERC20 to Fantom Network before transferring. 

Midas’ customer service has been helpful, but here’s what I don’t understand. The FTM shows up with the other three when I look up the wallet address so it’s in the wallet as ERC20. Midas said they can recover the FTM and convert it, but it takes a bit of work and they’re charging a fee to do it (kind of expensive, but far less than the amount being recovered so my hands are pretty much tied). If they have custody of the ERC20 wallet, shouldn’t they either be able to just convert it to FTM like I should have, or send it back to me to do it?",cryptocurrency

I've tried Google but can't seem to find any info that matches up with my question(s).

I’m a U.S. citizen. If I make $50,000(for easy math) this year, I'm single, claim 2 dependents all year, never went exempt and I make a $10,000 401k withdrawal before the end of the year, how will that impact my tax refund next year?

If they go ahead and take taxes out of my 401k
withdrawal, does that mean the only difference is that the $10,000 withdrawal will make my $50,000 salary a $60,000 salary? Will my tax refund generally be much less? About the same? Or greater since I've paid more
taxes than I otherwise would have?

My returns are usually ~$1,000 federal and ~$600 state(SC).

TL;DR: How does a 401k withdrawal affect your tax return if your taxes are consistent year to year and it's the only change?",finance

personalfinance,First time going into student loan repayment,"Hi smart people. When student loans start back up this February, it will be my first time in repayment. I finished undergrad in 2018 and a graduate program in 2020 so they were deferred and then with covid they kept getting deferred until now. 
I have a decent income, a good savings, and I just bought a home. I heard a ton of different advice for how to deal with loans. All my loans are federal. My largest loan is also my highest interest rate at 6%.
I've heard it's better to get a personal loan and pay off all the student debt because I can get a better rate with a mortgage in my name. I've heard just paid the minimums. I've heard go on a income-based repayment plan. Etc....
My goal is to pay the least amount of interest absolutely possible. I have about a third of my total student loans amount saved up in a separate account save solely for the purpose of paying my loans (this is separate from my personal savings).

I was planning to pay that all as a lump sum as my first payment in January and then possibly refinance with a personal bank loan? Not sure what to do after that lump sum...

personalfinance,New W4 Help MFJ - a few questions,"Hi All, 

I’ve done a bit of research on how to fill out the new W4 but still have a few questions. Here is some background:

I’m starting a new job on 1/10 and will be making more than currently am. My salary will be $115K and my wife’s salary will be $48k. 

I’m confused on the MFJ two jobs section specifically putting a number in the 4c section from the multiple jobs or spouse works section in step 2. 

I tried the IRS calculator but it’s difficult to populate because this will be a new job with higher salary so I don’t have historical data they are asking for on things like federal taxes per pay period, per year. I tried filling it out and it said we would get a 9k refund which doesn’t sound right at all. 

I used the table included on the W4 but have a few questions on that. Here is a list of overall questions I’m looking for help with. 

- If I fill out my new W4 and add extra withholding in 4c, will we be withholding too much since my wife will still have taxes withheld on her paycheck?

- If I want to just use the table provided on the W4 since I don’t have all the info needed for IRS calculator, should I do my total income or taxable income? Ex: if I plan to max out 401k should I say my salary ins 20.5k less in the table?

- I assume my wife should also fill out a new W4…should she just copy what I do but not put anything in 4c?

Overall I find the W4 very confusing. We used to have a near zero return which is what we want but now I’m worried of a big bill or big refund. Thanks for all the help!!",finance

stocks,BOE Surprises With First Hike in Crisis to Curb Inflation,"From Bloomberg:

&gt;""The Bank of England unexpectedly raised interest rates for the first time since the pandemic struck, setting aside the threat to the U.K. economy posed by record coronavirus cases to become the most high-profile central bank to take on surging inflation.

&gt;Officials led by Governor Andrew Bailey voted 8-1 to lift borrowing costs by 15 basis points to 0.25%, delivering an increase that no other Group of Seven central bank has made since the start of the crisis. Silvana Tenreyro was the sole dissenter. Policy makers said more “modest” tightening is likely to be needed as inflation heads toward a peak likely to be around 6% in April.

&gt;The pound rallied as much as 0.8% while U.K. 10-year yields jumped 5 basis points after the decision. Traders now see the BOE’s key rate rising to 1% by September.

&gt;The U.S. Federal Reserve already set a hawkish tone on the eve of the BOE announcement by signaling three rate hikes next year and accelerating the wind down of its stimulus program, while Norway kept up its own tightening effort on Thursday with its second increase this year.  

&gt;The BOE’s precipitous shift into tightening mode will surprise the large majority of economists who anticipated no change, and investors who were pricing in around a 40% chance of a move. The outcome was the second in a row featuring a surprise after November’s decision to stay on hold wrong-footed financial markets. 

&gt;The BOE hike is a response to the danger posed by surging prices gains, with a report this week showing inflation jumped to 5.1% in November -- more than double the central bank’s target -- and a separate report Tuesday showing U.K. companies added to payrolls at a record pace.

&gt;Considering that backdrop, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief European Economist Jari Stehn told Bloomberg Television just hours earlier that an outcome of no change was “not a done deal,” even though it was his main expectation.""

Bitcoin,"Inflation is not a feature or a bug. Inflation is not even the ""problem"". It is a side-effect of the treatment to the problem. So how does Bitcoin solve the problem?","The real problem isn't with the currency at all... far as I can tell.

What is the real problem then?

To answer this I have to try to understand what currency is. And what it isn't.

Currency is a store of value, or energy. To increase the efficiency of trade. Currency doesn't run an economy, but currency is what an economy runs on.

Currency doesn't have to do anything in itself except exist. Ideally it is trackable, tradeable, and close to impossible to counterfeit. If I imagine the economy as an engine, currency isn't the gas, it's the oil. It doesn't generate energy, it transfers it, and keeps the economic machinery moving smoothly as possible. But none of the power (value) of the engine (economy) comes from the oil (currency), it comes from the gasoline (our hard work). Oil generates no power, only transfers it smoothly.

So what's the actual problem: 
The engine itself is leaking oil and threatening to overheat and explode. There's not enough currency value in circulation because it keeps getting funnelled to the same place / leaking. 

Dropping the engine analogy, nobody has any fucking money anymore because wages don't go up, among a million other things, because corporate greed/bribes. Meaning corporations making more money and CEOs hoarding more money, meaning less and less money in the economy. Before any damage is done the fed prints more money to cycle through the economy before it too is lost into the leak. Eventually the economy becomes such an efficient money funnel to the top 1% that the economy reaches the point where it is basically a 2 step process of the government handing citizens money to hand to corporations. So it's essentially the government handing corporations money, even though the only reason they have to print money in the first fucking place is because those same corporations already have too much of the money. There is no longer and ebb and flow. It's all flow, straight to the top. And no economy can last on this model, as hyper inflation is soon to follow.

The irony being that printing money is supposed to be a redistribution of wealth, taking the most value from the people who have disproportionately more, and redistributing it back into the economy and the pockets of the citizens, but almost all of the printed money is funnelled back into the same problematic oversized bank accounts within a few months, so the only people to experience the loss of wealth due to inflation are the lower class. Who don't get enough money, basically have to spend it as they get it, and any money they do manage to hang onto is devalued.



And finally, my real question: How does Bitcoin actually solve any of this?
Some people believe there will always be a hybrid of currencies, and that might be fine. But to those of you who believe bitcoin does solve these issues and should take over as the reserve currency one day; do you just expect the government to somehow design an economy that doesn't leak? Because there's nothing I can see inherent to bitcoin that can prevent the same economic corruption we face today. 
What happens if the 1% continue to store their currency and just keep accumulating more? Eventually there won't be enough currency in the rest of the economy to keep it operating. This is when the government would normally turn on the printer, but if they can't, the economy will just have to work itself out. 
What would actually happen? Are we just trusting that a new government builds a new economy around a new currency? And we are just going to hope that they understand how any corruption will result in runaway power consolidation? 
Even without corruption, power can and usually will consolidate, just from luck or natural success. Would an economy running solely on a currency like bitcoin have to accept undergoing something like a wealth redistribution every generation or something? Because when there's not enough oil in the engine, it grinds to a halt, and people die, civilizations collapse.



Inflation in itself isn't a problem. It is a side-effect, with benefits and downsides which reflect the health of the economy itself. You can't just get rid of inflation and think that solves the overall problem, when the only reason inflation is seen as a problem in the first place is because of how problematic the entire economic system has become.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Written off credit card debt. Pay full? Negotiate? Chase says no payment for deletion.,"So,  I've helped a few friends this year negotiate out of debt,  turns out I'm pretty good at getting less than 50% for deletion. 

Anyway,  chase is another story they say they will not delete,  nor will they show balance paid in full if we pay less.  The will put "" settled for less"" on the credit statement.   

The goal is refinancing the home,  my friend is in bad financial shape, her own demise.. and needs to refinance her 500k home with 220k balance,  at a 5% interest rate.  This refinance is effort to fit her life into 2600 of social security per month.  But first.. need to get this 520 credit score up to something creditors will accept.  Currently no open credit cards or any credit building tool. 

So.. chase says no deletion,  and if we settle for less then she gets a settle for less statement on the credit report.  This is the last part,  we have gotten deletions on all other 28 accounts on her credit report.  Do we pay chase full balance? Or settle for less and hope that's enough to bump the credit report.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Solana Leads Gains as Cryptos Recover on Fed Decision,"Solana led gains among larger tokens amid a broader jump in global markets. The crypto market has added almost $59 billion in value over the past day following the U.S. Federal Reserve decision to gradually reduce stimulus benefits and taper purchases of government bonds after inflation climbed to a 39-year high.

Tokens of Solana, the fifth-largest crypto by market capitalization, climbed 12% Thursday to $180. Ethereum rivals avalanche and elrond were also among top gainers in early European hours, adding 11% and 13% respectively, according to CoinGecko data. Dogecoin and shiba inu saw muted growth after a rise earlier this week based on reports of electric-car maker Tesla allowing dogecoin payments for its merchandise.

Since early 2020, the U.S. has provided stimulus packages to businesses and individuals and the Fed has purchased nearly $120 billion in bonds each month to boost the economy. That’s helped prop up financial markets worldwide, while becoming a cause for concern among traders worried about the incessant money printing.

Yesterday’s decision bore well for the crypto market, however. While bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is considered a risky asset by many investors and traders because of its volatility, some view it as a hedge against inflation.

“Increased speed of tapering by the FED has been a typical buy the rumor sell the news story. Markets are looking for a tighter monetary policy as a response to record inflation,” Andreja Cobeljic, co-founder of trading intelligence tool Superalgos, said in a Telegram message. ”The short-term correlation between equities and bitcoin is positive and Bitcoin also rose very sharply. It is worth noting that retail buying of Bitcoin has been extremely strong on the lows, recent onchain data shows.”",cryptocurrency

CryptoMarkets,"Fed Accelerates Tightening – Bitcoin and the Markets Go Green Again. Why? The Fed blew the whistle on the party, but more importantly ended the uncertainty. The markets like it.","Everyone was waiting for Jerome Powell yesterday to hear about the decisions made by the FOMC after its December 2021 meeting.

What the markets were expecting happened. The Fed decided to accelerate tightening.

With inflation at 6.8% in November 2021 in America, the Fed could no longer continue with its ultra-accommodating monetary policy. Asset purchases will be cut in half to $60 billion by January 2022.

In late winter 2022 or early spring 2022, rates will be raised for the first time. Two more increases will follow in 2022, three in 2023, and finally two in 2024 in order to eventually return to key rates above 2%.

Faced with the end of the party whistled by the Fed, you might have imagined that the markets would turn red. Well, the opposite happened. The S&amp;P 500 is back in the green near its ATH, and Bitcoin has seen its price return to green and is now above $49K.

And the rise is expected to resume in the days and weeks ahead.

Many are wondering why investors are returning to buying as the Fed has announced a more aggressive inflection of monetary policy.

stocks,(12/16) Thursday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Thursday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Thursday, December 16th, 2021-

*****

# [Dow futures up 200 points following Fed decision to aggressively wind down asset purchases](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/15/stock-futures-market-open-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures rose sharply in early Thursday trading after the Federal Reserve signaled it would be aggressive on tapering and sees three interest rate hikes in 2022.
*****
&gt; Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped about 222 points. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.7% each.
*****
&gt; Shares of companies that have done well in previous rate-hiking cycles led premarket gainers. Materials stocks FMC Corp. and Freeport-McMoRan both rose more than 3% ahead of the opening bell. Bank stocks also rose across the board, with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America all up about 0.6%.
*****
&gt; In transportation news, Delta Air Lines reported that it now expects to see a profit of $200 million in the fourth quarter, after previously projecting a loss. Shares rose 2.2% on the news.
*****
&gt; In other central banking news, the Bank of England announced it is hiking its key policy rate by 15 basis points to 0.25%. Markets were awaiting a separate policy decision from the European Central Bank. There also is more economic news on tap, with weekly jobless claims and housing starts out at 8:30 a.m. ET.
*****
&gt; Following the Fed news, traders accelerated their own expectations for interest rate increases. Fed funds futures trading now points to a 63% chance of the first quarter-percentage-point increase coming in May 2022, with chances also rising to about 44% that the central bank could make its first move as soon as March, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.
*****
&gt; Stocks traded in negative territory throughout the regular session Wednesday and turned higher ahead of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s press conference in the afternoon at the conclusion of the two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The Dow added 383 points, or 1.08%. The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.63% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.15%.
*****
&gt; “The fact that the FOMC acknowledged new COVID variants as a threat to the economic recovery that could alter policy going forward, as well as the generally optimistic tone from Powell in the presser, helped spark a relief rally as the Fed meeting was viewed as being not-as-hawkish-as-feared,” Tom Essaye of the Sevens Report said in a note on Thursday.
*****
&gt; The Fed will begin reducing the pace of its asset purchases in January and buy just $60 billion of bonds each month going forward, compared to $90 billion in the month of December. That decision follows recent inflation data showing a 6.8% surge in November, which is higher than expected and the fastest rate since 1982.
*****
&gt; “The notion that elevated inflation levels would be transitory has finally been thrown out the window by the Fed and the latest policy adjustments are reflective of a committee that doesn’t want to miss the next train leaving the station,” said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management.
*****
&gt; Health-care stocks UnitedHealth and Amgen gained ground Wednesday, rising 3.1% and 2.6%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Adobe and Accenture are scheduled to report quarterly earnings before the opening bell. FedEx and Rivian will report after the bell.

CryptoCurrency,Domino effect Volksbank Raiffeisenbank ventures Bitcoin advance - THE BOOMERS ARE COMING!,"After the savings bank, a regional association of the Volksbank is venturing out on its own in the direction of Bitcoin. Is the federal association now following suit?

After the German Savings Banks and Giro Association had publicly confirmed a pilot project for Bitcoin trading on Monday, December 13, the competition is now following suit. In a solo venture, the regional association of Volksbank Raiffeisenbank Bayern Mitte (total assets: 4.6 billion euros) also wants to venture into the crypto space. 

Specifically, this involves trading and custody of bitcoin. There are currently no plans to expand the service to other cryptocurrencies.

The almost 800 employees of the regional bank have already been intensively trained on the topics of bitcoin and blockchain to create a ""broad understanding"". According to the board of directors, trading with digital gold is to start in the coming year. Volksbank wants to support customers in obtaining their own cold wallet. In addition, the bank is also working in parallel on its own solution for the safekeeping of cryptocurrency.

Volksbank Bayern Mitte's go-it-alone approach is unlikely to have gone unnoticed within the association as a whole. In general, the offer of Bitcoin is a business policy decision of the bank.

When a decision will come from the federal association, however, remains open. The integration would give more than 30 million customers access to Bitcoin.

investing,"What was the basis of the narrative in May - September 2021 predicting a ""10-20% correction"" in the markets?","So yesterday, the FED has officially announced a tapering. It was even a more aggressive tapering than people were talking about in May - September 2021.

However, the markets rallied on the news of the taper from the FED.

From a valuations (economic benefits vs Risk) assessment, it makes sense that the markets would rally:

\- Interest rates remained the same.  
\- A day or two before the announcement the bond yield decreased therefore decreasing cost of debt.  
\- There was \*a little\* uncertainty surrounding MAYBE the Fed might touch interest rates a little bit. IF they HAD then cost of equity would have went up. But it was unlikely. Anyway the uncertainty surrounding this, made for an increased cost of equity in the days up until the meeting - so small sell offs/corrections occurred.  


BUT they never touched interest rates in the end!  
So Weighted average cost of capital would have decreased because the bond markets priced in the more aggressive tapers decreasing cost of debt and then cost of equity became less because the uncertainty around changing interest rates disappeared.

Any valuation method:  
\- PV of FCF - shows an increased MV  
\- Dividend discount models same thing.  
\- Multiples are going to get higher because decreased cost of capital.

So what was the basis of a ""10%- 20% correction in the markets"" this quarter for 2021??

Now we are looking at one of the other banks but since it's been more than a month would they have to run a new credit score? Since it's through banks we personally have accounts with, are they technically ""running credit scores"" at all? Would it hurt us/our credit scores to check into the mortgages offered by the other banks we have accounts with at this point?",finance

personalfinance,Exended Warranty with axiom,"Let me go ahead and say yes i'm an idiot, big woop we all make mistakes. Some of us just make bigger ones than others. I bought a vehicle from this dealership getting smooth talked by the finance lady that its only ""$30 extra a month for the warranty extra"". I pay most of my loans off under two years usually so all i care about is the interest rate. I realized after the fact the $30 a month is if it takes me 72 months to pay it off. Lo and behold taking a better look at the paperwork I signed up for $8000 worth of extended warranty through Axiom. That made my 10k down payment non existent at this point. I freaked out and went into the dealership and cancelled it the next day. I also have the three warranties in hand that say voided all over the paperwork of the warranties.

I just got off the phone with Axiom right now and they confirmed they will not be sending a check to the dealership because it was voided and never funded by the dealership to begin with (I saw in this subreddit this is usual protocol like 7-14 days the extended warranty company sends a check to the dealership). 

So this means that the dealership has that 8k sitting somewhere? This is the proof i have from the finance manager saying it will take 60-90 days for it to reflect on my loan. Everytime i went in person they said 30-60 and would keep changing the numbers.

This is bullshit right? Why would it take even 30 days for them to add my 8k to my loan. The car was 40k and after taxes my loan should be 32k (including 10k down, taxes about 2k and other fees) but my loan that just got funded yesterday by the bank DATCU is showing an open loan for 40k. 

It took 2 weeks for them to even fund the loan (bought the car around the 26th of november) I called and walked in to the dealership multiple times trying to hurry along the loan funding process since I bought itbecause DATCU was telling me they didnt send paperwork and they were telling me on the phone they did (dealership) when they didnt (not the first time they lied). 

Finally it got funded yesterday, so they could have simply had DATCU fund a 32k loan right? Because they finally submitted the paperwork when I went in person on Monday (2 weeks since I bought it) to push them along. I sat in the lobby and called DATCU and they said ""Yes we just received the paperwork finally"". Is there anything I can do at all? Am i wrong? Is this common ""60-90 days to reflect in the loan amount that the warranty is cancelled""  

&amp;#x200B;

idk how to attach a picture but the picture is email text that says : ""Yes it has been flat canceled, because it was canceled within the same week there is no paperwork needed to sign. You will see it reflect your account 60-90 days from today.""",finance

personalfinance,Financial/social assistance for grandfather,"Hello all, forgive me if this is not the right sub to post this or if I’m missing any required information from this post. My grandfather who lives in the United States (NYC area) is 91 years-old and requires medical/social care. He has no major health issues beyond being a diabetic however he lacks mobility and cannot drive due to his age. He does require someone to check in on him to make sure his medications are being replenished/taken correctly and that he has food available for him to eat (he can prepare basic meals). My uncle/his youngest son who was his primary caregiver for the past several years since my grandmother passed away has been very sick and in the hospital and as a result cannot give him care. My father has stepped up however we both live in Canada and my dad has not lived in the United States for 35 years and is unfamiliar with processes for social aids for the elderly.

I will try and formulate my questions as bullet points below:

1. What are our options/resources to get him assistance? We have been looking at nursing homes however the costs are astronomical, especially compared to Canadian nursing homes. Everything we have seen in the New York State area is close to $12,000 or more per month. Are there any subsidies or lower cost options?
2. Are there any resources or social services that check in on the elderly in the New York City area? With the new Omicron variant, my father will likely have to return to Canada soon and we won’t really have any reliable resources to check in on my grandfather while my father is back in Canada. We have set up meals on wheels for him however we are hoping to get some sort of caregiver to at least check up on him on a daily basis to make sure everything is OK and that his medications are replenished and being taken correctly.
3. Are there any other resources or subsidies that the federal or state governments provide that we can look into? I know it seems like we are looking for handouts however we have quite a few resources north of the border to help out with elderly who may be isolated. Trying to see if there are any similar services south of the border that we can take advantage of.
4. Forgot to add this. He’s a veteran as well, not sure if there are special programs for aging vets.

personalfinance,Tax Underpayment Penalty base amount,"I am trying to figure out how the tax penalty is calculated. Below is the scenario. Assuming, for 2021:

(1) I need to pay $60,000 for Federal tax ( **total tax owed)**

(2) In order to avoid the penalty, I need to withhold at least $54,000 (**minimum required payment,** 90% of $60,000) . Let's just use this 90% safe harbor rule, but not consider other rules.

(3) But I only withheld $50,000 from my employer. (**my withhold amount)**

(4) Assume the penalty interest rate is 3%

When IRS calculated the penalty, between (a) and (b) below, what is the base amount IRS uses to calculate the underpayment penalty?

(a) difference between the **total tax owed**(1) and the **minimum required payment**(2)? In this case it's $6,000 =$60,000-$54,000 . So total penalty would be $6,000 \*3% =$180

(b) difference between the **minimum required payment**(2) and **my withhold amount**(3)? In this case , it's $54,000-$50,000 = $4,000. So total penalty would be $4,000 \*3% =$120

Bitcoin,"I'm selling a house, gonna have large liquidity event. Want to put most into BTC. But the question is, how??","Would love the community's opinion on how best to get a large (for me) amount of $ into Bitcoin.  I'm a small landlord, and I'm selling a house.  My agent did a Comparable Market Analysis and said it should fetch about $135k.  We just listed it today for that, no offers yet.  I did check into listing it in Bitcoin, but the problem would be that so many buyers in this area get federal loans, and so by refusing to consider $ offers I would be excluding those potential buyers, so we listed it in $.  Well, let's say it goes for $135k and I walk with $125k (I don't owe anything on it, but seller pays commission and a title expense or two).  After setting aside say, $20k for things like upcoming expenses and property taxes (due this time of year), I plan to put the other $100k or so into Bitcoin, hoping to come away with a full 2 coins if the price stays low between then and now.  That's what I'd love here.  

But...I got to thinking about it....would it be better to instead, do a slow DCA into it?  That way, if it in fact does drop to something stupid like $30k (not impossible), I can load up and maybe even end up with 3 full coins!  Which would be pretty incredible.

stocks,Shorting Pre-Revenue Companies In 2022,"Due to the Fed's lax monetary policies, 2020 was the year when basically every stock went up. Stocks of pre-revenue companies shot to the moon in 2020, and then crashed back to earth in 2021, as evidenced in the miracle and then debacle of Cathie Wood's ARKK fund.

The Fed has announced yesterday at the FOMC meeting that they will accelerate tapering and consider three interest rate hikes in 2022, from a rate of 0.08% (right now) to about 1.00%.

Due to increasingly less liquidity in the market throughout 2022, would it be wise to start shorting garbage pre-revenue or negative-revenue companies?

Examples: FUBO, OPEN, SPCE, FCEL, UBER, NKLA, RIVN, LCID etc. I know some of these went down a lot already. I'm asking whether there is a high probability that they will decrease in valuations even more.

personalfinance,"Should I sell in taxable, and/or ignore my IRA, in order to purchase i-bonds?","With the currently high interest rate of i-bonds, they are an attractive investment, and it would be nice to own them. However, I don't necessarily have much *immediate* cash on hand to do so, although could get the money to do so, with some drawbacks. Here is my situation:

* Outside of my ~$15k-$20k 6-month emergency (and vacation) fund, I only have about $3k extra in my HYSA. I was saving this with the previous goal to immediately dump it in my 2022 IRA on Jan 1st, and hit the full $6k by the end of the year, ideally as soon as I can.
* Outside of that, my only other accessible money streams are income from my job, and about $25k sitting in a taxable brokerage ($15k VTSAX, $7K VTIAX, $3K VBTLX). I purchased these funds within the last year, so they would be taxed as short-term capital gains. And I know these two things will likely be said, so let me address it: [I disagree that bonds don't belong in taxable](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2020/02/05/asset-location-do-bonds-belong-in-retirement-accounts-swr-series-35/), and despite only being in my mid-20s, also [disagree that I don't need at least a small amount of bonds somewhere in my portfolio](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/7t2oma/discussion_on_the_place_bonds_have_in_a_2030_yr/dt9ltph/).

* Forget about the IRA for now and dump the ~$3k in i-bonds instead
* Sell in taxable in order to purchase i-bonds, and if so, which funds and how much?
* Direct future paychecks to i-bonds, essentially prioritizing i-bonds over my IRA?

personalfinance,There has to be a better way to get school loans after 24. I took out $17k in private loans for this year with an 8% interest rate...,"24 year old college student here from Pennsylvania. I dropped out after my first year at community college and just started going back last year. Today was the last day of my 4th semester so as of today I'm halfway done! I'm a math and statistics double major. 

My first year at community college was free on a full scholarship, and last year I went to a university and maxed out my federal loans but I was under 24 so I was able to have my mom fill out a parent plus loan to cover the rest (about 8k I think?)

This year I learned I was unable to participate in the parent plus loan because I turned 24 before the end of the year. I maxed out my federal loans and still had a balance of $17,500 so my financial aid office told me the only option I had was so find a private loan. I applied for like 8 or 9 different loans and only got approved for 2 because neither of my parents had good enough credit to co-sign for me. Plus I only made $18,000 from work last year so I don't blame them for not accepting my applications. Still, it was really mentally draining. My school did offer me $30,000 in grants but the tuition was over $50k so there was still a lot to cover.

One I got approved for was a 10.5% interest rate and the other (which I accepted) was a 8% interest rate from Discover. Again, a huge stressor especially because everyone talks about how predatory private loans are and that you should stay FAR FAR away from them. 

Anyways, my boyfriend  calmed me down about the interest rate. He told me once we're married we can refinance and ill get a much better rate because he makes over 6 figures. 

It still worries me though that my rate is so high, especially because I'm having to take out this much money with them. Is there really no other federal loan option after FAFSA and PHEAA? My dad is a retired disabled veteran from the Marines but for some reason he wasn't able to get me any assistance from them, I don't remember why. Maybe because he was in school at the time too?

I also tried to apply for a bunch of scholarships but I didn't get any of them and they all seemed really sketchy, almost like they were fake and just trying to get you on their website to look at ads.   Can anyone offer any advice?",finance

In Washington, President Biden signed a bill that would raise the debt limit to once again avert a default by the US government. 

the Fed announced it would double the pace of tapering and signaled a strong likelihood that there would be an interest hike, probably around August-September (according to the Fed’s dot-plot), the first since rates were slashed to near zero in March 2020. This was largely the expected outcome of this meeting. 

The new pacing would bring all asset purchases to a full stop by March 2022, faster than the course set forth in November that originally sought to end purchases by the middle of next year. The decision had unanimous agreement.

A quicker taper gives the Fed room to move earlier on interest rate hikes. All of the 18 members present at the meeting said they could see the case for at least one rate hike next year, a noticeable revision up from [September projections showing a 50-50 split on a 2022 rate hike](https://news.yahoo.com/fed-fomc-monetary-policy-decision-september-2021-141145429.html).

The Fed said, “Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to elevated levels of inflation.”

The median expectation of the committee sees core personal consumption expenditures, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, clocking in at 2.6% in 2022 (compared to 2.2% in the Fed’s September projections). Core PCE came in at 4.1% in October (data for November core PCE comes out December 23.

The next Fed meeting is scheduled to take place Jan. 25 and 26.

**Highlights**

* Activity in the U.S. services and manufacturing sectors decelerated in early December but still held in expansionary territory, with stubbornly elevated prices looming over economic growth. 
* IHS Markit's preliminary December U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) registered at 57.8, coming in below November's 58.3. Consensus economists had been looking for a slight increase in the index to 58.5, according to Bloomberg data. Readings above the neutral level of 50.0 indicate expansion in a sector. 
* Housing starts rose 11.8% on a month-over-month basis in November, [the Commerce Department said on Thursday. ](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf)This easily topped estimates for the 3.1% increase expected
* EV startup Rivian (RIVN) said it was building a new plant in Georgia as it looks to expand production. 
* Rivian stock gapped down another roughly 11% after hours after the company reported earnings that showed steep losses and said it expects to fall “a few hundred vehicles short of its 1,200 production target for this year.
* Steven Cliff, deputy administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and nominated for the top job, was asked about the agency's probes into Tesla auto-pilot and said ""we hope to have those investigations wrapped up soon."" He said he did not have a ""precise timeline.""
* Tax preparation company H&amp;R Block Inc on Thursday sued payment company Block Inc, previously called Square Inc, saying the new name infringed its trademarks.
* New car sales in the US are expected to rise next year, driven by pent up demand as automakers were forced to cut production in 2020 and 2021 amid the semiconductor shortage. Edmunds expects 15.2 million more cars will be sold in 2022, a 1.2% increase despite higher prices.

personalfinance,Mortgage down payment vs investing,"So I am getting ready to buy a house and have a couple of scenarios that I could use some advice on. I have been pre-approved for a $300,000 mortgage (hoping to buy around 250k), and my two different options are:

Option 1: 3% down (9k plus about another 9k in closing costs and other fees) with an interest rate of 3.25%.

Option 2: take 12k in first time home buyers down payment assistance, at an interest rate of 4.25%, and invest the cash I would have used on the down payment in the stock market instead.

The variables I have been considering are stock market growth rate, the 1% interest rate difference between the two mortgage rates, growth in the value of the home. 

Are there other things I should consider?

Some other information:
- I make 58k a year, and my girlfriend makes anywhere from 30-40k (please don't tell me not to buy a house with my girlfriend, we are going to get married soon). She is a seasonal firefighter, and her income hasn't been considered in our loan amount. We were told we could try if we needed more money, but this was the path of least resistance, and this is hopefully more than we need. 
-  250-300k is a small home in my area, so can't go much cheaper. We are not interested in moving elsewhere at this time either.
- I don't have the funds for 20% down, so I am paying PMI in either scenario.
- This is my first home, but I am not planning on moving for several years at the very least. If we do move eventually, we hope to keep this as a rental.  
- If we do put 3% down, we would have a 3-4 month emergency fund remaining (currently 6+ months) and would have to sell about 5k worth of stocks, ETFs, mutual funds etc.
- My middle credit score is 801
- I have 58k in federal student loan debt. I am getting back on the PSLF plan, with 1.5 years of payments already made, so I am not interested in trying to maximize these payments (assuming government in 8.5 years will have this program figured out)
- I have just under 40k in retirement accounts, and I would rather not touch these.
- I'm 30 years old, and have a decently paying job with a lot of growth opportunity (natural resources/ ecology), but I don't think I'll be clearing 100k anytime soon lol.",finance

personalfinance,Looking to Purchase our First Home,"Hi everyone! I browse this sub for a long time for advice and hoping you all can help me also. 

My partner and I (both in our early 30s) are looking to buy our first home together and feeling rather pessimistic. We live in NJ and the housing market has been insane to say the least. 

We have a combined salary of $120k and saved up $100k for a down-payment on a home. Our parents will be gifting us an additional $60k to help us out. I have a retirement account that has $75k and my partner has $10k in his. We have absolutely no debts. We pay in full on our credit cards every month. Cars and student loans are all paid off. All we pay for right now is the usual living expenses (currently renting at $1632/month). 

The bank did pre-approve us for a 30-year conventional loan of $480k at 3% interest after we put down 20%. For a decent home in our area, however, we would have to spend $550k and up. We saw a home around this price but with the way the market has been, offers can go over the asking price. We thought we would be fine with sticking to a $600k home as the max but after doing some calculations, the mortgage payment would be +/- $3,500/month. Our gross monthly income is $10k but net is about $6,500 after our retirement contributions. This is more than 50% of our net income. 

I have read that you shouldn't exceed 28% of your income to pay your mortgage but that seems impossible in NJ. Property taxes in desirable areas alone averages around $12k/year. 

In your opinion, what should be our maximum mortgage payment? Should we just postpone our housing search? I'm just worried that interest rates will increase in 2022 but housing market/price will be unchanged due to the low inventory of homes... Any advice and suggestions are greatly appreciated!",finance

CryptoCurrency,Omicron; good or bad for crypto?,"Even though I think Omicron is terrible because of the damage it does to people's health and lives, I don't think it should be bad for crypto adoption.

&amp;#x200B;

At the beginning of the corona pandemic, ourgovernments chose to print trillions of fiat into the system, so that large corporations and rich people with debts (mainly boomers) would be saved. Young people would have benefited far more if they would just had let the economy collapse in March 2020, because things would have become cheaper to buy for young people then. Housing would have been affordable, instead of these ridiculous prices. When old and inefficient and overleveraged companies would have gone bankrupt, young people would have had the opportunity to start new and better businesses. These opportunities are snatched away from us, to ""save the economy"" (in reality: to save rich boomers and irresponsible companies, and, to be fair, some honest hardworking small business owners).

&amp;#x200B;

Then came Omicron and stock markets are in a frenzy. But, why would we dump crypto and stocks because of Omicron? If countries follow their previous strategies, wouldn't Omicron be just as good a reason for central banks to pump more fiat into the system? So that people an institutions can buy more crypto. If central banks stop pumping they will only cause an economical crisis during the pandemic, which will be disastrous. They should wait until the pandemic is over before raising interest rates and stop pumping fiat so that an economic crisis will be more manageable than in a friggin' global health crisis.

&amp;#x200B;

Or do only large corporations and rich boomers count? These groups got their bailouts and handouts and as young people started to profit from those same things, those corporations and boomers got slightly inconvenienced. Because young people don't want to work for fastfood chains for poverty wages anymore and corporations have to pay them more, and boomers are not getting the service they are used to at those restaurants.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tl;dr: When they stop pumping money into the economies and stocks, crypto and everything else will go down, I think they will do that because young people don't count, only rich old people and corporations.**",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Why Using a Cryptocurrency as A Country’s Only Legal Tender Can Actually Work: An Economic Commentary,"## I just saw a highly upvoted and awarded post saying that non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies whose only purpose is payments will not make it.

## Here’s Why This is Not Entirely True

Because I’ve studied economics at university, it was easy for me to think that cryptocurrencies would never become the main legal tender of a country, given price volatility, and the sudden lack of monetary policy options a country would have for dealing with economic issues, despite not having a fixed exchange rate.

### To normal economists, this spells disaster. Let me tell you however, why I think this is not the case.

Take Bitcoin for example. Largest market cap but with price volatility and lots of speculation, and limited supply.
Under normal circumstances, let’s say a country suddenly loses its port and can’t import good anymore, or there’s another kind of supply shock, prices would go up, and with no monetary policy, inflation would set in under Bitcoin. 

##The Tools of the Government are However Still Available and Growing

There’s an economic theory called ‘The Long-Run Neutrality of Money’ which states that monetary policy is useless in the long run. When the money supply is increased, this for some time has a temporary effect on the state of the economy, but as prices adjust, this effect becomes neutralised. Only through Government Fiscal Policy can permanent changes in the economic level of output be made.

## In Other Words, The Government Still Has To Act In the Best Interest of The Economy if It Wants to Produce Results.

The solution is then to restrict the free price movements of the goods in the country. Companies are inclined to increase prices of let’s say bread during a supply shock due to the sudden scarcity and make bigger margins, but why should they be allowed to, when this stresses the economy? That’s right, for some cases, they will be restricted from raising prices. In other cases where income statement and balance sheets take a hit, 

## the government will have to subsidise. By selling Government bonds for Bitcoin instead of Fiat or by depleting Tax and Profit reserves.

## So What About Bitcoin Price Volatility?

This is the kicker, I don’t think we have to worry about this. The next generation, will immediately be exposed to the free markets of crypto and DeFi financing, and I believe will become self sufficient at trading, managing their wealth and their own financing to avoid sudden losses and lack of liquidity issues due to price movements. 

## I Also Believe In The Future Tech of Dynamic Pricing

This is where prices are often displayed on screens rather than paper and stickies, and are automatically adjusted down to the moment one pays for them, and kept within reasonable bounds relative to the cost of production and the Bitcoin price. 

## So is This The Future Economy? Is it More Sturdy than The Current System? Due to Growing Financial Literacy and Financial Autonomy, I’m Inclined to say, ‘Yes, it will be better’.

Maybe this topic could be my or someone else’s economic master thesis.

CryptoCurrency,Analysis: Tokenization of Carbon Credits,"Experts and those who have done more than a few hours of research like myself, please feel free to chime in. 

With all these s&amp;p companies setting dates to go carbon neutral, I think carbon credits could be the next commodity (if you can call it that, maybe derivative?) to pop off as demand shoots up. Apple, Amazon, FedEx, Ford, GM, IBM, Untied Airlines, Lyft, McDonald the list goes on. [101 companies pledge to go carbon neutral or reduce footprint](https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2019/08/26/101-companies-committed-to-reducing-their-carbon-footprint/?sh=1c3de4fd260b)

Tesla made $1.4B in 2020 selling carbon credits. I’m not sure where to find how many credits they sold to make that kind of money, but I also found that they “avoided 5,000,000 tons in co2 emissions in 2020” so I’m assuming they sold around 5,000,000 credits. If that’s the case, their carbon credits are sold for around $300 each. 

I also read the price varies drastically, anywhere from less than $1/ton to over $50/ton. [source](https://secondnature.org/climate-action-guidance/purchasing-carbon-offsets-faqs/)

 I’m trying to figure out what makes some more valuable than others. I think credits that offset co2 production from fossil fuels might be worth more than credits for reforestation, but I haven’t found a solid answer. If anyone knows, please shed some light for me on this, because that’s a very wide range, and [this site](https://secondnature.org/climate-action-guidance/purchasing-carbon-offsets-faqs/) says credits are $11-212. 


Now to the tokenization part:

Klima Dao: $400. Offsets 1 ton of carbon (peak $3600/token) Polygon MATIC token.

MCO2: $11. Offsets 1 ton of carbon. (Peak $19/token) Ethereum ERC-20 token.

Why is Klima DAO worth exponentially more tha. MCO2 when they essentially do the same thing. I’m going to research more before I Ape into MCO2, but from everything I’ve read, $10 should be the floor price for a carbon credit, with the upper limit being $300. I’m still in the process of researching what makes some credits worth more when they represent the same thing (offsetting 1ton of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere)

TLDR; Carbon credit demand set to go up, possibly a good investment. Tokenization of carbon credits creates liquidity to trade these “commodities” Klima dao still very expensive, MCO2 seems like a better deal. Market cap shouldn’t matter as they represent the same underlying. MCO2 market cap $30M, but says they will mint more tokens as demand comes, so unlimited supply.

CryptoCurrency,No crypto is safe from inflation,"TL;DR in the bottom.

I've been in crypto for just a little over a year. I've learned a lot, and what appealed to me in the first place was the certainty of Bitcoin, in regards to how there will ever be a maximum of 21 million Bitcoin. That gives Bitcoin the property of true scarcity, no extra Bitcoin can ever be created or faked. No inflation, for all of eternity (after the year 2140 when the last Bitcoin will be mined, that is).

Then Ethereum comes along. 18 million Ether can be minted every year. Sunds inflationary, but recently, the net sum of added Ether (minted-burned) turned negative, so some claim Ethereum is deflationary. Even better!

Then enters Cardano. Cardano aims to create something better than the Ethereum blockchain, a so called Gen 3 blockchain. So, the blockchain is created, and the maximum supply is set to 40 billion ADA. 

Along with Cardano comes Polkadot, which also believes it can do better. Polkadot doesn't have a maximum supply, but currently there are ~1 billion DOT.

Solana enters the scene. Also inflationary like Polkadot, but that doesn't matter for this post. 

None of these other blockchains change a single thing about Bitcoin's fundamentals. Or rather yet, no blockchain changes the fundamentals of another blockchain. However, Bitcoins dominance continue to fall, and while the crypto market cap increases, not all the money flows through Bitcoin.

Since crypto's conception in 2009, more than 15 000 cryptocurrencies (coins + tokens) has been created. Most of them are just memetokens, but many of them hope to create something valuable, something better than what is currently available. At one point, somebody might have a revolutionary idea, and create the first gen 4 blockchain.

The picture I'm trying to paint is that of an ever inflationary crypto market as a whole. There is no hard cap on amount of crypto projects or blockchains, nor do I believe there should be (and of course, there realistically never can be). 

I expect to recieve comments from Bitcoin and Ethereum maxis saying ""it doesn't matter, Bitcoin/Ethereum will beat them all in the end"". Maybe you are right, maybe not. My point is to share my thoughts on inflation in crypto. A type of inflation I haven't heard people talk about, because everyone thinks of their favourite blockchain separately when they say there is no inflation. 

Just so that some people will calm their tits before going to the comment section; I believe Bitcoin will be a safe store of value with increasing value quite possibly forever. And just to piss some people off; I believe Cardano will be a better Blockchain than Ethereum.

TL;DR: Even though many cryptos are not inflationary or even deflationary, the crypto market as a whole inflates like the Fed on steroids with the creation of more than 15 000 cryptocurrencies since 2009.",cryptocurrency

cardano,What does it exactly mean for Cardano to be a platform?,"Cardano has entered the Goguen era in 2021 with it becoming a smart contracts platform. This brings many benefits and the potential is tremendous, but it requires some caution from users. Let’s explain what the platform is and what it means for users.  

# TLDR:

* A platform is a kind of environment in which a program can be executed. You can use smart contracts on a Cardano platform.
* Smart contract apps are created by third-party developers and their intentions may not always be honest.
* Cardano may be the most secure platform in the world, but that doesn’t mean it will automatically apply to third-party applications.
* The IOG team takes no responsibility for third-party applications. IOG is only responsible for the Cardano platform. Everyone in the world is free to decide how to use it.
* Cardano will have an appStore and certification program. Users will have more confidence that they are using quality and secure apps.
* It doesn’t matter if we know the authors of applications or not, because more important is open and freely accessible source code that anyone can look at and verify its correctness.
* Do we need platforms? Let’s ask a better question. What we want or can improve in our society through decentralization. Then we can ask how to achieve that.
* It does not make sense to own the value via a blockchain network and then, the moment you need to use it in the real world, lose this absolutely crucial advantage and entrust the coins to a third party that enables fast payments or other financial services.
* A rich ecosystem has many advantages. First and foremost is the large network effect. The more options a platform has, the more it will be used.

# What is a platform

We guess you already know well what is a platform but maybe you are not aware of it. Let us explain. To put it simply, a platform is a kind of environment in which a program can be executed. If you read this text you have a computer with your favorite operating system. It does not matter whether it is a Samsung cellphone with Android OS or a laptop with Windows OS. You can download an arbitrary application from the Internet and run it. It can be said that you can extend the possibilities of your computer and thus you have access to more functionalities. For example, you can download a movie and use a player to watch it. You can also chat with your friends, or use internet banking. You basically decide about functionalities you want to have on your computer.

Every program, or if you want an application, has to be written by someone. Programmers produce applications for a specific platform. So programmers must have some kind of development environment that allows them to write the application. For example, it is possible to write an application in the Java programming language. The programmers download the Java development environment and write the application. They then test this and, if it works as expected, offer it in some form for users to download. The application will only work for users who can run it on their computers. Fortunately, Java is supported almost everywhere.

Broadly speaking, the platform is your hardware and operating system with support to run Java applications. However, a platform can also be a web browser that allows you to run extensions. Programmers need to know how to write such an extension and what development environment to download.

 

# What is a Cardano smart contract platform?

Cardano allows developers to write a smart contract (script) in the programing language Plutus. Plutus smart contracts consist of two parts: the on-chain part that is executed on the blockchain, and the off-chain part that is executed on the user’s machine or client’s side.

For simplicity’s purpose, let’s say that a smart contract is an application. The application is written by third-party developers. Users can decide to use the application. If they decide to do so they interact with the off-chain part of the application. They provide inputs or instructions that result in the execution of the on-chain part. For example, a swap transaction can be constructed that is executed in the blockchain. To be more precise, there is a special piece of software, let’s call it a Virtual Machine, that is dedicated to executing applications. Virtual Machine understands the Plutus smart contract instructions (the code written by developers) and executes them.

Smart contracts are executed in a decentralized way so they do not rely on third parties or centralized entities. They are stored in the blockchain and the whole network can verify the execution. The process is transparent and irreversible. It means that once a given smart contract is deployed and given conditions are fulfilled based on an interaction of users, given pre-programmed actions will be taken.

For example, if a swap condition is met (funds of Alice and Bob are in the escrow, or value fed by an Oracle is as expected), given transactions are created to swap tokens between Alice and Bob. The result of the smart contract execution will be stored in the blockchain forever. It means, that both Alice and Bob will be exclusive owners of swapped tokens until they decide to send them to somebody else.

You can see the platform as a layer or extension above the basic Cardano layer, which provides absolutely basic operations such as network consensus, network transaction transfer, ledger maintenance, staking, etc. The platform offers options to extend this basic functionality by issuing tokens, programmability, integration with other networks or services, etc. The basic Cardano layer, for example, will not allow the creation of stable coins, as it needs to work with inputs from the real world, specifically with the real market value of assets. If digital coins, such as the ADA, are to be used as a reserve asset, there must be some automated logic that will take care of issuing stable coins and reserve tokens. For a stable coin to gain the trust of users, it must be decentralized. This means that smart contracts must be used to automate the logic of all needed processes.

Let’s give another example. The transaction network will allow Alice to send coins unconditionally to Bob. The platform will allow developers to build a service that can temporarily lock coins in safekeeping and send them to Bob only if a specific condition that Alice and Bob agree on in the physical world is met. Bob will only receive coins from Alice if he sends her a certain number of other coins. Alice and Bob can thus reliably exchange ADAs for wrapped BTC or NFT, for example.

# The trust model of platform users

Now you have a good idea of ​​what a platform is in the world of blockchain networks. Let’s describe the trust model from the perspective of the platform users. You can think of it as layers, where the bottom one represents the Cardano platform and the top one represents the users. There are many layers in between.

 

* Cardano is a decentralized blockchain network that is maintained by nodes. The first layer contains the blockchain, transaction network, and stacking capabilities. Cardano is a platform, so in this layer, there are also Virtual Machines that execute smart contracts and many other pieces of infrastructure.
* The IOG team is responsible for the development of the Cardano network, including all the tools and infrastructure that make it a platform. In the context of the trust model, the team is also responsible for developing the Plutus development environment, which is used by third-party developers to write smart contracts. The team strives to provide the most secure infrastructure and tools for running third-party applications.
* Users are not forced to use third-party applications and can only use Cardano. This means using the functionality that the IOG team is responsible for. Specifically, to send transactions, issue custom tokens, or delegate coins within staking. Using these basic features of the Cardano network does not require trust with third parties.
* Third-party developers who write applications are also users in a way, as they need to use Plutus development environments, test-nets, Virtual Machines, etc. Third parties trust the IOG team and the Cardano platform. Once they deploy their smart contract applications on the Cardano main-net, users can voluntarily use them.
* Users who choose to use the smart contract application trust not only Cardano platforms but mainly third-party developers and their ability to ensure the security of their application. Things like security, privacy, source code quality, usage fees, availability, etc., all of this is in the control of the teams that create smart contract applications.

There is no direct link between the IOG team and third-party app developers. The IOG team is only responsible for the quality of the platform. This means that they are in control of the network decentralization, scalability, Virtual Machine, Plutus development environment, developer documentation, etc. The IOG team is not responsible for the behavior or the applications delivered by third-party teams. It is important to be aware of this distinction.

Third-party teams may not be competent and may not produce a quality application. If there is a bug in the app, users may lose their wealth. The teams may even be scammers. For example, they may ask users to subsidize a project by delegating coins to a staking pool they run. After collecting ADA coins, they may never deliver the project and the tokens they gave out to delegators will be worthless.

Anyone in the world can issue their own tokens on Cardano. The real value is usually decided by the issuer. Tokens can be a promise for the future, just a reward, or they can represent things in the physical world. It is up to the users to verify the value of the tokens. If, for example, Apple decided to issue APPL tokens on Cardano and said that a long-term holder of the tokens would get a 10% discount on new merchandise from the company, the tokens would gain value. If a scammer names the tokens that way and claims the same thing, the tokens would have no value and would be a scam.

The IOG team is responsible for the platform and its capabilities. The platform can be used by anyone in the world to realize their goal. However, the goals may not always be sincere. Thus, the platform can be misused to enrich fraudsters. If you put powerful new technology in people’s hands, some will use it to build beneficial things for others, others will abuse it. The building is always harder than cheating. Each person, and by extension, the decentralized service, must earn their trust. This may take time.

It is necessary to distinguish between what a decentralized platform is and what an application is. Decentralization will not protect you from fraud. If you fall for a scammer who promises to send back double the coins you send him, it’s your fault. You signed the transaction. In this scenario, the transaction network and the fact that everything is done in an anonymous environment were used to commit fraud. The app is a sort of extension over the capabilities of the transaction network. It is a kind of extension that allows developers to add new functionalities, such as decentralized exchanges. This advantage is balanced by the fact that the authors of the applications must be trusted.

It works exactly the same in the traditional world. Anyone in the world can create a fake Java application and try to get you to download it to your computer. If you do that, the application will somehow harm you. You can’t blame the manufacturer of the computer or the operating system. They didn’t do anything wrong. You chose to download and install the application from an untrusted source, or from an untrusted vendor.

Experienced users only install trusted apps on their computers or phone. For example, the Office application from Microsoft, which also produces the Windows operating system. In the case of the Cardano network, users can only use the transactional network and staking. In this case, they only trust the source code, which is largely contributed by the IOG team.

We don’t want to give the impression that using smart contract apps is dangerous. If the app is well written, the source code is public and anyone can check it, and the app is used by a large number of users over a long period of time, the risk of losing wealth decreases significantly. If a decentralized exchange works for more than a year without problems, you can use it with confidence too. The dAppStore and certification program will help increase trust.

Cardano may be the most secure platform in the world, but that doesn’t mean it will automatically apply to third-party applications. Never forget this.

# Application store and certification

Can the IOG team do anything to help people protect their wealth? Obviously, in a free decentralized world, the IOG team cannot vet all third parties and determine which projects are legitimate and which are not. The Cardano platform is open to anyone who wants to use it and build their services on it. To protect users, it is possible to build something similar to what already exists in the traditional world. You are probably familiar with App Store what is a kind of marketplace for applications that you can download to your smartphone. Cardano will have something similar. A dAppStore and a certification process will be available to ensure that users will use verified and secure applications.

Developers will be able to upload their dApps to the dAppStore. Thus, they will become available to other users. It must be said that there will be no censorship on the dAppStore and everybody will be able to upload dApp.

Naturally, it will be possible not to use dAppStore and promote dApp in your own way.

Developers can freely decide whether they let their dApp be certified. A certified dApp gives users assurance about the behavior of smart contracts. There will be a kind of automated logic checks, manual auditing of smart contracts, and even the possibility of formal verification. People will naturally trust more certified dApps since there will be a certainty that they behave as expected. A process and/or someone competent has verified that.

Users will see all available applications on the site, including certification status. Other metrics such as the number of downloads, user satisfaction, lifetime, etc. may be available. The role of the certification program is the prevention of code-level security vulnerabilities. Every team can introduce a bug unintentionally that can lead to the loss of users’ wealth. The purpose of the certification is to discover bugs before the applications will be used. This type of protection might not be 100% bullet-proof. However, the level of certainty will be much higher than we can see in the current DeFi environment.

# Decentralization, anonymity, and trust

Some people are not clear about the possibilities of decentralization and what role people play in it. Every program had to be written by someone. This applies to the first layers of the Cardano network, but also to Bitcoin. It doesn’t matter if we know the authors or not, because more important is open and freely accessible source code that anyone can look at and verify its correctness. Confidence in the project is thus built primarily on the source code and the time for which the code works reliably.

The source code authors do not own the network and have no way to influence it. For example, if they do not have the resources needed to create new blocks, they cannot do so, as well as prevent anyone else from doing so. Decentralization ensures that the network runs completely independent of the team that wrote the source code. Of course, each network has a team that maintains the source code. Source code writing cannot be fully decentralized.

In the case of smart contract applications, the principle is exactly the same. Someone writes the source code of the smart contract and offers it for use. If a team reveals its identity, it can be more trustworthy, as it goes to market with its own skin. If a team wants to remain anonymous, it can make someone feel like they want to do something wrong. Of course, this may not be the case and the reasons may be different. For example, a team may want to avoid prosecution. From the point of view of trust in the source code, anonymity is not necessarily required, as other people may declare that the code is well written and will most likely work well.

Decentralization can provide features such as the immutability of history, resistance to transaction censorship, free access, and more. Most importantly, however, no individual can change network properties and no one can stop the network. No one can do this internally, such as a team, or externally, such as the authorities. In the context of applications, this means that their execution has the same properties as the network itself.

If Alice signs a transaction that sends 1000 ADAs to Bob, no one is able to prevent that transaction. Some random node in the network places the transaction in a new block, and the rest of the network accepts the block with the transaction from Alice. It works very similarly with applications. The execution of a once deployed application will be unstoppable and the execution will be distributed so that no centralized entity will have control over it. If any team deploys a decentralized exchange, for example, it will have no control over token swaps.

# Do we need a smart contract platform?

If you look at today’s world and the financial processes that take place in it, you will find that they are more complicated than just direct payments from sender to recipient. The financial world works on trust between the individual participants and at the same time on their trust in the authorities and the legal system. If the payment participants don’t know each other, they don’t naturally trust each other very much. In this case, it can be difficult for them to interact financially. With declining confidence, the risk of losing funds increases. Concluding an agreement in an untrustworthy environment is more difficult and usually requires some form of contract. Both parties need to rely more on the legal system.

Financial operations can be long-term in nature. It is not always possible to pay immediately for a specific good or service. Sometimes it is necessary to pay in advance or, conversely, to defer payment. It is quite common for payment to be conditional. Loans are a typical example of a long-term financial operation. One party will lend the other a larger amount of money and expects the other party to repay the loan on a regular basis in smaller amounts. Although the loan can theoretically be implemented through a number of transactions between participants, these transactions have a certain context. There may be some interest rate and regularity in the game. The higher complexity of financial operations requires higher complexity in terms of network or platform capabilities.

People are not equal at the level of their status. We live in a hierarchical arrangement and some people can have delegated power. Our company will always have elected representatives and authorities. These people will be given the opportunity to dispose of resources that are not theirs but are entrusted to them. Businesses or larger financial institutions are in a stronger position because they serve more people and have something that others want to use. People are forced to trust these institutions, but their trust is often abused.

We could transfer the question of whether we need a platform to another question. What we want or can improve in our society through decentralization. We can see the problem of breaches of trust in many places in our society, and it is clear that a mere transactional system cannot improve them. An ordinary transaction system cannot handle as many basic financial operations as a trustworthy escrow.

If two parties who do not trust each other were to exchange two digital assets with each other only through transactions, they would have to find a third party that they both trust. A third party, such as a notary, would have to receive transactions from both participants and then make an exchange. If the parties did not use the services of a notary, one of the participants could easily commit fraud. He would wait for the other party to send him assets and then keep his assets, as well as the other party’s assets.

It makes sense to add functionality over a decentralized transaction and monetary system and thus increases the capabilities of the alternative financial system we want to build. That is exactly what we need the Cardano platform for. Today, no one knows exactly what we can decentralize and what intermediaries we can replace. It is not just a question of the possibilities of technology, but also of the choice of people and the acceptance of change by the people who are in power today.

Imagine that everything will remain as it is today, including the strong position of banks, big IT giants, governments, and the only thing that will change will be the replacement of fiat currencies for cryptocurrencies. Do you think that is possible? From our point of view, it is not. As decentralized networks become more and more popular in society, fundamental changes will take place at the social level. Banks cannot function in exactly the same way if cryptocurrencies prevail at the expense of fiat currencies. However, let’s not expect fiat currencies to be replaced by cryptocurrencies. Fiat currencies will undergo their own transformation and will be digital.

The platforms will be useful by allowing people to own the financial infrastructure they will use. This means that everything, including fees, changes, enhancements, etc., will be under their control. All the qualities we admire for decentralization can be preserved and no centralized authority will be able to influence it.

Further development of platforms will make it possible to increasingly replace common centralized services and processes. The future will be decided by the majority, not a few people with a strong position. This does not mean that humanity will get rid of the hierarchical order. Rather, we can expect some reorganization of society and a redefinition of the social contract. But that is the distant future. We have to start with small things like decentralized escrow services and the ability to exchange assets without centralized intermediaries. Additional services and functionalities will be added to this.

We need to constantly push the boundaries of decentralization. This is a natural human trait and it will happen whether we like it or not. The emergence of Cardano can be seen as a logical continuation of the evolution of decentralization. Cardano will allow us to build a rich ecosystem with a place for everyone. If Cardano succeeds, the boundaries of freedom will be shifted.

# Let’s build a rich decentralized ecosystem

The Cardano platform will enable a rich decentralized ecosystem. The first generation of cryptocurrencies only has a transaction system, so the possibilities for use are very limited. As a user, you can basically only send and receive one kind of volatile value. The problem is that the transaction system of the first layers cannot be used for regular payments as the transactions are slow and expensive. If the biggest advantage of blockchain technology is the ability to exclusively own assets without third parties, it makes no sense to use other than decentralized networks to transfer value. The moment users are forced to give up possession of their own private keys, we return to a centralized world. It does not make sense to own the value via a blockchain network and then, the moment you need to use it in the real world, lose this absolutely crucial advantage and entrust the coins to a third party that enables fast payments or other financial services.

Each individual user decides how much decentralization they want. However, we do not believe that entrusting cryptocurrencies to third parties for normal financial operations such as escrow, loans, insurance, buying and selling other financial assets, etc., will have a sufficiently disruptive effect on society. If these services are offered by the Cardano platform, we believe there will be people who will take advantage of them. This will weaken the position of current inefficient intermediaries, such as banks, and in turn, promote a decentralized network.

The ability to issue tokens is a way to greatly expand the capabilities of the Cardano platform. Once an existing business decides to use tokens within their business, the tokens can have real value and represent physical things. If the legislation allows it, and it seems that we will see the necessary regulations soon, it will become realistic to tokenize, for example, shares. So you can have not only your favorite cryptocurrencies in your cryptocurrency wallet but also share, with all the benefits that decentralization offers. Shares, which are more stable than cryptocurrencies, can be used as collateral for a loan, for example. Smart contract apps allow you to build decentralized exchanges so you can sell shares or buy new ones at any time.

Every business needs revenue to cover its expenses. This principle must also be maintained for projects in a decentralized world. So far, this has only been achieved at the level of the first layers. Cardano’s network is one that people are happy and willing to maintain because they are rewarded by the network for doing so. The network retains a high degree of decentralization due to the fact that it is maintained by a large number of stake pool operators along with delegators, and this business is available to everyone. Decentralized projects, such as DEXes, need to create a similar model where the service fees are split between the team and the token owners. These tokens will behave similarly to shares and it will be quite natural to keep them in your wallet alongside cryptocurrencies.

On the Cardano platform, it will be easy to create algorithmic stable coins, work with decentralized identity, connect to the physical world via Oracles, use second layers like Hydra, etc. This ecosystem will be significantly richer in capabilities compared to the first generation of cryptocurrencies. First-generation cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, can essentially serve as a store of value or a means of exchange if you don’t mind high volatility. This limits the use to essentially payments only. Things like buying stocks will be done centrally. The buyer will send BTC to someone and the shares will be bought and held in a centralized manner. Today it works well, it’s secure and people are comfortable with it. But blockchain and platforms offer so much more. Buying shares can be done instantly, you own the shares immediately through your wallet, and the fees can be lower. If platforms offer this, it won’t make sense to use the current centralized systems.

From a network perspective, a rich ecosystem has many advantages. First and foremost is the large network effect. The more options a platform has, the more it will be used. It is realistic for the Cardano platform to process thousands of transactions per second through the second layer. These transactions will not just be related to paying for goods, as with the first generation of cryptocurrencies, but will be connected to real business, banking services, social networks, the arts and media industry, the gaming industry, the stock market, etc. Every app on your phone may someday use decentralized networks in the background in some way.

Your Netflix subscription will be a token that you pay for with stable-coin. You buy a concert ticket through another app and you can have an NFT in your wallet that will remind you of the event forever. If you decide to get a new phone, you sell a piece of Tesla stock in the store and pay. Or you pay for the phone directly with stock and somewhere in the background, everything is converted to cash. This weekend, you’ll use the token and your decentralized identity to vote in a local referendum on building a new road. The possibilities are endless and limited basically only by technology. What may seem like science fiction today will be standard boring technology in 20 years.

The high network effect will have a very positive effect on the economic model of the Cardano platform. It can be of immense value as it will provide wealth not only through ADA coins but also through tokens. For example, imagine if the top 5 companies in the world out of the top 100 tokenized shares on Cardano. The network would provide immense wealth for a large number of users. At the same time, it would collect a large amount in fees. The first layers of blockchain networks will one day face a budget problem to cover the costs associated with running the network. The only way is to create a functioning economy around it and collect a lot in fees. This will be much easier for platforms than it was for the first generation of cryptocurrencies. With exaggeration, one could say that blockchain networks must take over the financial system within a few decades or they will disappear.

There is hope that the new financial world will not be in the hands of governments, banks, and financial institutions. This world can be partially owned by all the people of the world if they want to, through native coin blockchain projects. So our future will not be decided by politicians and CEOs of big IT corporations. If you have ADA coins, you will have decision-making power in the Cardano network. If you use Cardano for all financial and social operations, you will have freedom and control over your future.

Governments are slowly losing control and the trust of the people. This power can be taken over by large corporations. The IT giants will try to create a Metaverse and there is a good chance they will succeed. The concept of decentralization can put power back in the hands of the people. Decentralization is by no means guaranteed to succeed and the current rulers are in a very powerful position. It is up to each of us to decide whether we want to use the old centralized systems or enter a decentralized world.

# Conclusion

You can look at decentralization as a set of rules and operations that are unchangeable and unstoppable because they are maintained and overseen by many people and no one person is dominant. The platform extends this concept and gives people the ability to create their own set of rules and operations for other people. This is essentially an app. So the application inherits all the good features of a decentralized network. Decentralization is a concept and has no artificial boundaries in the sense that a transactional network is the last thing we can create. To send value unconditionally is a basic operation. The platform adds the ability to also create the value, send it conditionally, or create some logic over the value. For example, an algorithmic stable coin is a set of certain operations that can maintain stability in a decentralized way. The platform offers a wide range of applications and innovators can realize their visions.",cryptocurrency
cardano,Essay: The power of Cardano and Blockchain,"What does decentralization mean to us?

Yesterday we had an experience of life. Yesterday we built a feature on Cardano Mainnet, launched it, used it, and most importantly, we did so with the safety and stability of Cardano. 

First, let me tell you about the freedom blockchain, and Cardano gives us. It's not about the freedom of speech or freedom from financial institutions that blockchain is so proud of. It's a freedom of interactions, exchange, and ownership. Take a moment to realize that blockchain enables ANYONE to 'give' something to a person on the other side of the globe. You could hear it from many people who talk about crypto. However, only recently, it clicked what power it is. 

Think of giving a pencil to your colleague who sits in the same office as you. You hand the pencil; a colleague receives it, just like that. No middle man. You trust your hand can bear the pencil, as colleagues can receive it too. Just a simple transaction of the pencil between two people. I'll ask you to stop for the second and think about this essential event, a transfer of ownership. How easy, reliable, and definitive it is in the real world.

Now let's digitalize the pencil and call it a pencilToken. For some reason, your colleague needs it, and you have a spare pencilToken. A couple of years earlier, you could only deliver it to your colleague using applications built on top of Internet Protocols... It's like using FedEx to send the very same real pencil to your colleague who might or might not be in the same office as you are. You had to trust that FedEx would do what they promised too. Your colleague would have to trust that you have 'sent' it. And you would need to trust your colleague when they say that they did not receive it.

Think about the blockchain as the air between you and your colleague. As an ultimate observer, a fact holder, a ledger of any transaction and event. An all mighty who remembers and registers everything that happened. Or simply - the actual virtual reality.

Let's get back to the pencilToken. When you (as a wallet) want to give something to your colleague (as the wallet). You transfer the pencilToken using the blockchain. When doing so on the blockchain you can trust that:

a) You don't have the asset anymore, and someone else has it (double entry). 

b) At the time of transfer, you are sure that it will reach the receiver. 

c) Everyone publically knows about this transaction.

That's the power of blockchain and Cardano. It brings essential action of the transaction into the digital age. It allows one to transact an item to someone who sits on the other side of the world like they would be sitting next to each other.",cryptocurrency
stocks,JPMorgan agrees to $125 million fine for letting employees use WhatsApp to evade regulators reach,"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/17/jpmorgan-agrees-to-125-million-fine-for-letting-employees-use-whatsapp-to-evade-regulators.html

JPMorgan Chase is paying a $125 million fine to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges that its Wall Street division allowed employees to use WhatsApp and other platforms to circumvent federal record-keeping laws. The SEC said Friday in a statement that JPMorgan Securities admitted to “widespread” record-keeping failures in recent years. The bank’s employees used personal smartphones and email accounts, as well as messaging services including Meta-owned WhatsApp, to conduct securities business matters from at least January 2018 through November 2020, the regulator said. SEC officials who spoke to reporters Thursday evening said JPMorgan’s failure to preserve those off-line conversations violated federal securities law and left the regulator blind to exchanges between the bank and its clients.

Federal law requires financial firms keep and retain meticulous records of electronic messages between brokers and clients so that regulators can make sure those firms aren’t skirting anti-fraud or antitrust laws. Regulators in New York and London have ratcheted up enforcement of record-keeping rules in recent years as traders migrated to encrypted messaging platforms including WhatsApp, Signal or Telegram. While phone conversations and messages on official company devices and software platforms are preserved, it’s much harder for bank compliance departments to surveil communications on third-party apps. The method picked up in popularity after two of the industry’s biggest trading scandals of the past decade (involving manipulation of Libor and foreign exchange markets) hinged on incriminating messages preserved in chatrooms, resulting in multi-billion dollar fines for banks.

Traders at JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and other firms have been dismissed or placed on leave for infractions tied to the practice. But the SEC order reveals how pervasive it was. At JPMorgan, the practice of going offline to communicate was firm-wide, and even the managers and senior personnel responsible for compliance used their personal devices to communicate sensitive business matters, the SEC said. The investigation at JPMorgan is ongoing and the SEC has launched similar probes at firms across the financial universe. JPMorgan ordered its traders, bankers and financial advisors to preserve work-related messages on personal devices earlier this year, Bloomberg reported in June.

Officials declined to offer details on the current status of the JPMorgan examination or those at other banks. “As technology changes, it’s even more important that registrants ensure that their communications are appropriately recorded and are not conducted outside of official channels in order to avoid market oversight,” SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in a press release. In stressing the importance of diligent recordkeeping, Gensler recalled the foreign exchange scandal of 2013, when traders at several of the globe’s largest banks used a private chat room to conspire to fix currency rates to maximize profits. Five of the globe’s largest banks, including JPMorgan, ultimately agreed to pay more than $5 billion in combined penalties and plead guilty to resolve the investigation. “Books-and-records obligations help the SEC conduct its important examinations and enforcement work,” Gensler added. “They build trust in our system.” While SEC officials said the $125 million penalty is its largest recordkeeping fine to date, the bigger threat to JPMorgan may be reputational. By going after JPMorgan, the world’s biggest Wall Street firm by total revenue, the SEC has put the industry on notice.",finance
economy,FedEx Drives Out Labor Shortage With Strong Earnings,"Shares of FedEx (NYSE: FDX) jumped 4.94% in after-hours trading after the transportation company posted positive earnings.

Financials: FedEx reported earnings per share of $4.83 and revenue of $23.5 billion in the quarter; both were better than expected.

Bigger Picture: Labor shortages, higher transportation costs, and higher wages hammered FedEx, which resulted in $470 million in costs. But the company was able to grow its operating income thanks to strong demand and by managing the labor situation.

Quote: “Strategic investments that we have made to our networks and systems have enabled us to provide critical delivery capacity and supply chain expertise to support the needs of our customers, while also making it possible for us to capitalize on the growing e-commerce parcel market.” - Raj Subramaniam, FedEx Corp. president and chief operating officer.

Final Thoughts: It was a great quarter for FedEx, which was able to hold back the labor shortage and supply chain challenges. But, is the worst of the labor shortage over? It’s hard to tell at this point.

In fact, I pride myself on never having paid interest, or I did until last month. I forgot to pay my main card and was charged a late fee of $29 plus about $30 in interest.  I did not argue with Citi because it was my fault that I did not make the payment as I usually do so it makes no sense for me to try to get the charges removed.

What I worry about is the impact on my credit score and/or interest rate.

personalfinance,High student loans - Looking to invest - Looking for a little advice,"Hi everyone, I know this topic has been posted before but I want to be a little more specific about my situation. I graduated with my Masters in the spring of 2019 and during that time I accumulated $165,000 in debt. While I realize this could have been somewhat avoided, I don't regret my decisions made while in school. Right now I am looking for a little advice on how I can be smart about my future rather than trying to pay down every penny before investing/saving.

Initially I consolidated my loans into one private loan with a fairly low interest rate (my loans where a mess and I was ill advised at the time) that I could more easily handle and began making monthly payments of $1700 distributed bi-weekly (to save in interest). I did this for a little over a year without investing aside from a small emergency fund in a high yield savings account. Since then, I have refinanced for a lower interest rate and lowered my monthly payments to $1250 so that I would have a little extra cash to invest with. While this has helped me feel a little better about my finances, I would love to be able to invest more than the $200 a month that I can currently afford.

So the advice I am looking for here and what I have been debating for the better part of a month is, would it be worthwhile (potentially smarter) to refinance and lower my monthly loan payments further so that I can allocate more of my income to investing and growing my wealth? The way I see student loan debt is as an investment in myself and I'm okay with the debt. I just want to be able to build something for myself in the future that could one day outweigh the additionally interest I would be taking on if I where to lower my payments now and extend my payment period. Thanks in advance!

TLDR; Is it smarter to lower/extend student loan payments over a longer period of time (increasing total accrued interest) so that I can allocate more of my income toward investing and growing my worth rather than throwing it all at student loans and investing a minimum?

Update 1: I apologize for not providing an interest rate or salary. Felt this was more of a general question about the value of investing over paying off student loans quickly. Regardless, my current interest rate is 4.85% (I know this isn't stellar but it's been the best that I can get), and my gross salary is $56,000. Additionally, I do have an excellent credit rating.

Update 2: Slipped my mind while typing this, I have built up 3 months of an emergency fund and have been contributing to a 401k plan since graduating consistently per paycheck.",finance

Historically, this market has been good in terms of real estate, but I'm concerned about the risks of it.

Now, we would likely use a third party to administer AirBNB or rent it out for a few years, but we have considered retiring here. If we had a mortgage it would not significantly change our life if we weren't able to rent it out, but it would eat into the portion of our savings that went into other investments.

I'm not that interested in being a landlord, but I'm having trouble explaining why other than being otherwise busy. However, we are also considering retiring in this country down the road.

(Our other investments are 401k and our brokerage account, which is allocated in index funds. This would mean wiping out our non-401k investments if we didn't use a mortgage.)

Now I am in this predicament where I am stressed because I have both options! 

Option A: Credit union. Job offer accepted. Starting upcoming Monday. $68k salary doing financial reporting, budget variances, etc. Pension, 401k, hybrid (1 day a week in office starting January). Health insurance starts 3rd month (my wife is currently unemployed).

personalfinance,Timing funding of 529 plan,"We just had a baby, and I'm working on setting up a 529 plan to fund her education. I'm having trouble deciding how to approach funding the plan -- in particular, I've been reading a lot of recommendations to ""superfund"" a 529 if you can afford it, i.e. essentially make only one lump sum contribution when opening the plan, based on an assumed average interest rate over 18 years and the target value that you want to hit. The idea here, as I understand it, is that since (unlike e.g. retirement planning) you only have 18 years for the money to grow, you're better off funding as much as possible as early as possible. 

This makes sense to me, and we can afford to do this. But with this bull market we've been in for so long, I can't help but feel a little nervous that this is a risky proposition (i.e. I superfund the plan this year and then we enter a 5-year bear market). I realize you can't predict/time the market, but this superfunding strategy seems to be sort of inverse to a dollar cost averaging type of strategy, which mitigates the kind of risk I'm worried about.

Is anyone else going through this, or has any suggestions or ways of thinking about this? I was considering maybe taking a semi-staged approach, where instead of literally funding the entire amount in the first year, I would split it up over 3-5 years or something like that. If this bull market continues on interrupted for the next 18 years then I'll have missed out on a little bit of potential growth, but if there's a market downturn in the next couple years I'll be able to buy into it a bit rather than the entire investment going down for the duration.",finance

&gt;Drive with Uber and you can afford first class like me! – Rose DeWitt Bukater, Titanic Survivor

# KEY POINTS

* Similar setup to Dec ‘19-Jan ‘20 rebound (1mo return \~+45%)
* Analyst EBITDA estimates too low; avg PT of $70! (+85%)
* Explosive ’22 EBITDA growth on increased op leverage
* Consistent 2022 Top Pick on Street; screens great for fund managers
* CEO bought 200k shares, major vote of confidence
* Wandered desert for '21, Entering promised land '22
* Calls price for good upside!

# Company Description

Uber is best known for its B2C ridesharing platform, but the variety of logistic-based businesses under its umbrella drive the company's full value. This includes B2B businesses like Uber Freight, which in ‘21 acquired Transplace- a global leader in logistics and supply chain management software- during the early innings of a historic transformation in both industries. Additionally, in markets where Uber could not compete immediately (i.e. China) they invested in leading regional startups (i.e. Didi), allowing them to still profit from the global transportation &amp; logistics transformation while gaining optionality through simple strategic sales. Uber has also developed subscription and loyalty programs, locking in their customer base while taking market share. A consistently smart, strategic approach has made Uber one of the great companies to come out of the 2010s tech boom.

# Thesis

UBER has been getting hammered nearly all of 2021 for various reasons, none of which are due to fundamental shifts in the business. It's a far stronger company than pre-covid, as the pandemic era forced Uber to increase efficiency &amp; financial leverage, making them **more profitable on lower bookings**. **Return to full volume = Profits like Splash Waterfalls** (see: Ludacris). Did I mention the CEO just said they had their **best bookings week ever**? Additionally, they should benefit from travel news over the next month as it continues to see strong recovery momentum despite Omicron.

Two important calendar events happen annually: Entering the new year and the second half. Funds are always for stocks to drive outperformance in that next period, and in the case of Dec, this leads to supply overhangs from tax-loss harvesting (TLH) suddenly being met with swift buying once the “coast is clear”. Like the overhang in ‘19, Uber could rebound out of this period toward the mid-to-high 40s where the CEO purchased 200k shares last month. Market mechanics converging with positive fundamental news should support a near-term multiple rerating.

Recap: This play is taking advantage of a rebound as the coast clears from overwhelming Dec supply (TLH &amp; omicron fears), buying demand re-enters (week of 12/17) helping it break its downward channel, and a sentiment &amp; technical reversal is signaled, leading to further upside momentum.

# Current Valuation &amp; Financials

* Revenue Growth: +49% ’22, +31% ‘23
   * Fwd P/S '22: 2.9x ... valuation and growth speak for themselves. Name one other company growing at \~40% 2yr CAGR trading at only 2.9x Fwd P/S.
* EBITDA Growth: +243% ‘22, +188% ‘23
   * Explosive growth a direct result of prior investments across their platforms
   * Does not yet account for CEO’s comments on 12/14 reaffirming 4Q21 EBITDA toward the higher end of the guide (orig: $25m-$75m), which likely flows through to slight estimate raises across the next calendar year as well.
   * Uber continues to approach full profitability, currently estimated for Q2 ’23. I suspect Uber may pull this expectation forward at their Feb ER.
* Free Cash Flow Growth: ’22 +190%, ’23 +268%
   * UBER’s efficiency initiatives have it on the brink of becoming a colossal FCF generation machine, with ’22 expected to be the year they flip FCF positive for the first time in history. Guess what factor should do well in the next phase of this market? My money is increasing FCF will be top of that list.
* Equity Investments
   * The primary culprit of their Q3 miss, equity investment revaluation (i.e. Didi stake of 144mil shares) drove the bulk of their -$2.4B net income loss, not losses from actual business operations.
   * CEO looking to strategically raise cash from these investments as they rebound in the future; with Didi relisting on Chinese markets, it will eventually flow through as a colossal earnings tailwind in the future.
* Analyst Price Target: $69.50, +86% Upside
   * The buffer makes it a fantastic candidate to rebound and still have plenty of upside following their February ER.
   * **UBER named a Top 2022 Pick by Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and UBS so far.** What do all these have in common? They comprise the bulk of investable assets and represent a significant portion of sell-side flow. Good PMs drive outperformance by buying early in a price turnaround and that’s roughly where we are.

# Technicals

Technicals are horrific due to the relentless nature of the TLH in Q4 as managers offset insanely strong gains elsewhere. However, 2020’s resistance level of $37 has become the new support during the December selling and it is very clearly basing; once the TLH subsides this week, we should have a quick zip upward, officially breaking the upper channel of the downtrend, in turn triggering positive momentum signals which leads to fast money re-entering the stock. See Chart 1 in Appendix

# How to Play

Note: All positions assume a rebound to mid-to-high $40s by expiration. Prior resistance highs were $64.

*Gen X/Boomers*: Buy stock! No brainer.

*Risk-Averse*: April ’22 C42.5 currently presents 1-3x upside, expands to 5.5x on sustained momentum to $55 following Feb ER.

*Quasi-Risk Averse*: March ’22 C42.5 currently presents 3.9x upside, expands to 5.5x on sustained momentum to $55 following Feb ER.

*Pump It Up! Junior*: Feb '22 C45 currently presents 4.7x upside on a post-ER rebound to $50, expands to 9.5x on a rebound to $55, 85% of prior highs.

*Pump It Up!*: Jan ’22 C40 currently presents 5.5-9x upside on a rebound toward mid-to-high $40s

*WSB Delight*: Jan ’22 C42 currently presents 6.5-11x upside on a rebound toward mid-to-high $40s

&amp;#x200B;

 My positions: I’m accumulating all of the above, finishing my purchasing over the days ahead as we take advantage of volatility from options expiration and the market holding its breath through the Fed announcement. Instead of posting this write up on Dec expiration (12/17) as planned, I decided to crank it out earlier due to the attention boost UBER got 12/14 so people could start legging in positions. Keep in mind the current positioning of the options market should create a gravitational pull toward $40 into 12/17 expiration at the same time TLH starts to subside.

I've been reading all the great tutorials and FAQs here, but also hoping I can list some of my stats here and get some help understanding things a little more. In general, I'm never been great with investing money because I've never really had any extra to invest. I've been a freelancer for most of my life in the non-profit sector, barely eeking by. I've been lucky to pay the necessities and have maybe a $1000 in the bank at any given time.

All of that has changed within the last two years with a full-time job in the for-profit sector, and I now have money to invest in my future. I know 40 is late to the game, but I'm hoping to start making some steps to improve my long term financial health.

My relevant stats:  
Age: 40  
Partnered 10 years, unmarried with 2 year old.  
My yearly Income: \~$50k year  
No Current Employer Investment/Retirement Plans or Matches  
Home: Own a duplex with partner. Purchased 2019, refi in 2020. 30 year mortgage at 3% with $330k remaining on $337k. $2000/mo mortgage. Rental income of $1750/mo. Current home value approx $425k.  
Duplex CapEx Account balance: $25k. We pay $1200 total into this account each month  
Personal Savings Account Balance: $40k  
Student Loans: $20k at 2% interest ($100/mo payments)  
CC (or other high interest) Debt: None  
Roth IRA Balance: $2000  
Simple IRA Balance (from a previous job 10+ years ago): $5900

Her relevant stats:  
Age: 36  
Her yearly income: \~$50K year  
Employer retirement 401k match maxed out  
Personal Savings Balance: $65k  
Student Loans: None  
CC (or other high interest) Debt: None  
As I write this, I don't know her current retirement balances. Will update later if needed.

The two of us also have a joint personal checking account with a balance of around $2000. We also opened a 529 Plan last year for our child with a current balance of \~$800.

Our monthly living expenses are very modest (we're both good a living with little) and we thankfully have no daycare costs because of retired grandparents. No car loans, or credit card debt. With food, groceries, and entertainment, we're looking at maybe $2000-$2500/mo combined in living expenses.

We are currently looking at purchasing and homesteading a new duplex in the next year, which will most likely require 5% down and closing costs (probably $10-15k) like our current place did. That will bring our current duplex's rental revenue to around $3200/mo, which means it will start generating profit for us. Even with home prices and interest rates rising, we imagine the rent to mortgage ratio will be similar on the next duplex, and we'll probably continue adding a similar monthly amount of our personal income to our CapEx account each month. After a few years in that duplex, we plan to purchase a single family home. We're also toying with the idea of purchasing a small plot of land up north near Lake Superior, and building a Tiny Home on it which we'll use as a VRBO type rental and family vaction spot.

Current retirement plan is selling those duplexes and the single family home in 20-25 years, and retiring up north to the Tiny Home. Plus using existing investment plan incomes/payouts, social-security, and whatever plans I start setting up now that I have money to invest.

So in the next few years, I'll need some liquid assets for down payments but also want to be playing catch-up with retirement plans the best I can.

Long story short, what do I (we) do with all that cash sitting in our savings accounts? (And what info did I forget to include above to help understand our financial situation?)

stocks,J.P.Morgan Securities to pay $200 million to settle U.S. regulatory charges on record-keeping lapses,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. regulators fined J.P. Morgan Securities $200 million for ""widespread"" failures to preserve staff communications on personal mobile devices, messaging apps and emails, and are probing similar lapses at other financial institutions, they said on Friday.

JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's broker-dealer subsidiary admitted to the charges and to violating securities laws. It also agreed to implement robust improvements to compliance policies, in addition to a fine, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said in its $125 million order.

The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday it had fined the firm $75 million for the same issues.

""The firm's actions meaningfully impacted the SEC's ability to investigate potential violations of the federal securities laws,"" the SEC said.

JPMorgan declined to comment.

The penalty is one of the first major enforcement actions brought under SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden and who has pledged to crack down on misconduct by Wall Street companies.

The SEC said it discovered that J.P. Morgan Securities had been violating rules that require firms to preserve written business communications when the broker was unable to produce records during the course of other investigations.

As a result of the JPMorgan probe, the SEC has opened investigations into other firms' records-keeping practices, it said, confirming an October Reuters report https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-sec-wallstreet-communication-idCNL1N2R70P2.

""This is an issue that we're seeing at other firms,"" said an SEC official, adding that ""individuals and entities that self-report"" will fare better in penalty negotiations.

From at least January 2018 through November 2020, J.P. Morgan Securities' employees often communicated about securities business matters on their personal devices, using text messages, WhatsApp, and personal email accounts, the SEC said.

None of these records were preserved. The lapses were institution-wide and known to senior management, who also used personal devices to discuss business matters, the SEC said.

It added that J.P. Morgan Securities agreed to retain a compliance consultant and to conduct a comprehensive review of its policies and procedures relating to the retention of electronic communications found on personal devices, among other remedies.

Long Story....

I have a one-person S-Corporation for which the tax return is due a month before personal taxes (March 15th normally).  Normally I file for a 6 month extension and just file the corporate tax form (it's one or two pages) at the same time as my regular taxes.

This year I forgot to file the extension on time and sent it in two weeks late (early April).  In late July, after I had already filed (mid May due to the filing extension for personal taxes this year), I got a letter from the IRS denying my corporate tax extension request.  No big deal.  Since the corporation is a ""pass through"" it never owes federal income tax - everything passes through to my personal return - there should be no penalties.

Wrong.

A week or so ago, I check the mail and find a letter from the Department of the Treasury.  Not good.  I don't get much snail mail, so I only check the box once a week or less.  This time it was about 2.5 weeks since I last checked.   I walk back to the garage and am about to open it when the mail truck pulls up.  The driver hands me a certified letter from the Department of the Treasury.  Now I am starting to sweat.

The first letter said I owed a $420.00 penalty for filing my corporate taxes late.  WTF.  I did not owe anything with that return, why am I getting a penalty?  The 2nd letter said I now owed $421.13 due to interest and they would go after my bank account if I did not pay up.  At least it was only $1.13 in interest :-)

After some research I found out that there is a $200/month late fee for S-Corp taxes.  Since I filed in mid May, I was over two months late.  I've had this S-Corp for many years and never new this.  Live and learn.

A little more research led me to the one time abatement policy, which I could NOT find a way to do online.  It took four attempts to get a live person on the phone and 45 minutes in the queue.   I gave the person my info and asked for the ""First Time Abatement"", she ran a computer check, found me to be in good standing (never filed late before, paid all taxes on time - I almost always owe) and said I would get a letter in 7-10 business days waiving the late fee.

Today the letter came!

My Calendar now has a repeating event every year to remind me to file the extension.",finance

However, I wasn't aware of the fact that you need 1 DOT in your polkadot.js wallet or else the wallet will disappear forever and the remaining DOT burned. Because of this I contributed all the DOT in the wallet and hence it was gone *\*poof\*.*

&amp;#x200B;

My question is now this: 

Have I done goofed? When the lease period of 96 weeks is up, will I not be able to receive my DOT back since the  wallet it was transferred out of is now gone?",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,European Central Banks and Fed are taking a Hawkish stance. Perhaps it's time to reevaluate your portfolio and investment strategy going into the New Year.,"It looks as though things are going to be getting tight in the economy, investors are moving into low risk stocks. November's producer price index show's that it is up 9.6% from last year. The conclusion of the Fed's latest meeting and the recent moves by Central Banks are looking hawkish. 

When you are focused solely on Crypto you can forget to look at the wider economy, and it's apparent in alot of the posts on this sub. While I, and many others believe that Crypto is going to become a force that will shake the current centralized financial industry, it hasn't become that force just yet. Therefore the current movements of that same financial industry effects us too. 

According to [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com) there are about 11795 known and listed tokens, or ""coins"" across 536 different exchanges. While we have nicknamed a vast significant amount of these tokens under various names, such as ""Shitcoin"", ""Altcoin""/""Alts"", ""Memecoin"" etc they are still a part of the ""global"" Crypto market, for better or for worse. The recent hawkish moves in the economy outside of our little closed economy mean that it's looking as though Crypto will not be seeing any significant amount of ""new money"" coming in. The reason being that major investors/financial institutions have moved their focus away from the *riskier* ""growth stocks""  towards low risk options instead.

# What does this mean for Crypto? 

We may be continuing to see a decreasing global market cap as more investors and ""Paper Hands"" begin to move out of Crypto as more hawkish news begins to circulate. This is to be expected of course, as with and ""FUD"" comes people selling out. But typically after each global ""dip"" of all assets, we tend to have a global ""pump"" that follows. This pump typically also includes a large number of Alts. But not all Alts survive even a minor dip, some are left forgotten about and simply ""die"".

I have personally moved out of any Crypto that I believe hasn't got a significant project/use-case providing a value. I made this move because I expect that as things look more and more hawkish, many people will be moving their money out of alts and instead into ""safer"" assets, for example Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. Much like how currently growth stocks are being sold off for lower risk options. The similar fear that you might have invested in something that's going to be one of the assets that ""die"" during a dip will set in. The fear will mean that the fresh supply of the next ""moon shot"" token you just bought is going to be the first thing you will sell out of. Followed by tokens you bought that one time because somebody mentioned it, but you never did any research on it.

Call me a ""FUDster"" if you want, feel free to post your own opinions in the comments. I've put the speculation flair on this post because I'm going to be honest with those of you who read down this far, I can't tell the future! 

Wall Street, the Fed and European Central Banks could all be full of shit and the economy will be booming next year, who knows. **Just ask yourself one thing**, if the economy does take a turn for the worst, do you really think people will still be buying dog coins?",cryptocurrency
cybersecurity,"Log4Shell, the new exploit used for a NotPetya2?","Hey everyone,

With the first wave of emergencies dealt with as far as I'm concerned, I had some time to look back at the global situation and what this vulnerability could mean.

- 1. Log4Shell

Log4shell hit the security world like a nuke [last Friday](https://thenewstack.io/log4shell-we-are-in-so-much-trouble/). We are dealing with something that some consider a new class of vulnerability, with impacts comparable to Heartbleed and Shellshock. It's easy to exploit, extremely widespread considering how common Log4j is, AND really tough to identify within a complex IT infrastructure. Meaning that the detection and patching effort is going to be long and painful for most IT and cybersecurity professionals around the world.

We've seen (as expected) an explosion of exploit attempts, and the majority of them were initially coming from [Russia](https://thehackernews.com/2021/12/hackers-exploit-log4j-vulnerability-to.html). It could simply be cybercriminals trying to cash-in the exploit right away, but it could be something else.

- 2. A look back at NotPetya

Now, looking back at NotPetya, and the history around it. We’ve had important known exploits released by the shadow broker around [April 2017]( https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/04/nsa-leaking-shadow-brokers-just-dumped-its-most-damaging-release-yet/) which also shaken our small world. Who’s behind the Shadow Broker remains a mystery, but what they released was legit.

[2 Month later]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_cyberattacks_on_Ukraine), we saw the most devastating cyber attack against a nation in history. Using exploits released by the Shadow Broker, and a well prepared plan that got out of control. This also had devastating side effect beyond Ukraine with companies like [Maersk]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maersk#NotPetya_malware_attack) or [Saint Gobain ]( https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-attack-idUSKBN19I1TD) affected.

I’m not saying that Russian intelligence needed the public release of the exploit to use it. They may or may not be aware of it beforehand but it’s irrelevant, the timing is too important to ignore. I believe they wanted to exploit it before it got massively patched making the exploit useless to them.

We have a previously unknown and severe vulnerability being publicly released, a geopolitical tense context, and a global attack with serious consequences worldwide a few weeks later.

 

- 3. The Ukraine situation

This is where I would be the least savvy about. I’m only watching the situation from a distance, fed by mainstream media and analysis.

As far as I can see, we had in the recent weeks, an increase of [Russian troops]( https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/russia-ukraine-invasion/2021/12/03/98a3760e-546b-11ec-8769-2f4ecdf7a2ad_story.html) at the border. They may or may not be preparing an invasion, but the world is generally watching closely the situation as we’ve seen in the past how [quickly Russia can react]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Georgian_War) to “protect their interests”.

Some analysts are predicting a break in the escalation thanks to the [Christian Orthodox Christmas]( https://www.heritage.org/europe/commentary/what-russia-might-do-ukraine-5-scenarios). This combined with the international focus on the Olympics in China (similar to the South Ossetia start during the Beijing olympics) create a context were an invasion is possible.

Combining a cyber-attack with armed force invasion could be a key point of the Russian strategy in the upcoming month. 

- 4.  conclusion

So here we are, we have a weapon, a pressing but favorable context, and a motive.

I have a very weird feeling about all of this. Those situations might be different but considering how this vulnerability could be weaponized quickly by Russian forces, it makes me worried for the upcoming weeks.

I may be reading too much into the situation, it might be an oversimplification of the context and what could happen, but it is something that has been crossing my mind a lot lately. One thing is sure, the cybersecurity professionals around the world will have to keep a close eye on this in January. It’s only our first week into this.

* Update to married filing jointly but uncheck the ""spouse works"" box until April

CryptoCurrency,"Crypto being backed by nothing is a flawed argument. Anyone that claims ""Crypto is backed by nothing"" probably has no idea about mining or how it works.","Bankers and Federal agencies love claiming that Cryptocurrencies will go to zero because they are backed by nothing and are worthless. However, that is possibly the most stupidest argument against Crypto.

Mining and selling Crypto can be basically compared to producing and selling a product just like any other industry. Mining almost any Cryptocurrency requires A TON of effort. Especially in 2021, if you are going to mine Cryptocurrencies, you need to get decent mining hardware as well as electricity in order to sell those Cryptocurrencies for a profit. And of course, electricity also doesn't come out of thin air

TLDR:  Cryptocurrencies need to be mined which requires a lot of resources. Cryptocurrencies do not come out of thin air and never have been.",cryptocurrency
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, December 17, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, December 17, 2021**

Stocks extended Thursday’s losses, with the market ending a volatile week in the red as market participants continued to digest ongoing risk surrounding the Omicron variant and the Fed’s new monetary policy, which signaled a faster rate of taper and interest rate hikes next year. 

**Notable Numbers Today**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -1.02%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -0.50%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -1.42%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +0.92% 
* Volatility Index: +3.19%
* JP Morgan (JPM): -2.28%
* Oracle (ORCL): -6.39%
* AMC: +19.22%
* FedEx (FDX): 4.95%
* Rivian (RIVN): -10.26%

The main focus of market participants remains on the Federal Reserve’s latest monetary policy decision, with the Central Bank doubling the pace of tapering and suggestions that the interest rate may be raised three times in 2022.

The potential for higher rates continues to weigh heavily on technology and growth stocks whose valuations rely heavily on future earnings potential. In the last month, the Nasdaq has fallen by -3.43% and the Russell 2000, which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 8.32% in the last month.

On the other hand, cyclical stocks in the energy and financials sectors outperformed on Thursday, with the prospects of higher interest rates and stronger growth seen as benefiting these sectors. The Dow Jones (DIA) has only lost -1.23% in the month and has been trending upwards in December. As always, it’s important to balance a portfolio with both growth and value stocks.

Troy Gayeski, Chief Market Strategist at F5 Investments, said “The thing investors have to understand is, we're going through a major transition in monetary policy. The Fed has been running emergency policies arguably far longer than they should have been, and as that money supply growth slows down as they ease off the balance sheet expansion and ultimately hike next year, one would at least expect more volatility in markets. And that's really what we've been seeing the last month."" 

**Highlights** 

* The Biden administration on Friday recommended the Federal Communications Commission grant Alphabet's Google and Facebook-parent Meta licenses for an undersea cable.
* The companies entered into national security agreements to protect data on the Pacific Light Cable Network system, an undersea fiber optic cable system that will connect the United States, Taiwan and the Philippines.
* Tesla Inc was hit by a lawsuit over CEO Elon Musk's social media posts including his Twitter poll on stock sales that pulled down its stock prices. Investor David Wagner called for access to internal documents to investigate whether Tesla and Musk failed to adhere to fiduciary duties
* Rivian stock gapped down another roughly 11%  after the company reported earnings that showed steep losses and said it expects to fall “a few hundred vehicles short of its 1,200 production target for this year.
* Alibaba Deputy CFO Toby Xu, making his first major public remarks since being named this month to take over as CFO, said that international e-commerce ""will become one of the key growth drivers"", adding that 57% of revenue for Cainiao, Alibaba's logistics unit, comes from overseas.
* Reddit announced it was filing for an IPO with an estimated $15 billion valuation. I love the platform but I think they’ll have a hard time monetizing users.
* Rivian also announced it was planning to build a new factory in Georgia in order to boost production
* Kellogg’s has reached a new tentative agreement with its 1,400 striking cereal plant workers that could bring an end to the strike that began Oct. 5.",finance

I said sure and they had told me that they cant get a crypto wallet setup and dont know why it won't let them set one up. So they asked if they could do a few transactions on mine. I gave them a throwaway account at binance.us but now I'm worried they might have been trying to con me. It was supposed to be a few transactions and i figured eh itll be fine i can just pay the applicable taxes no big deal.... then they deposited 15k in the wallet. I think they are attempting to get around paying taxes or try to move around stolen money maybe? They stopped talking to me so I've locked the account. There is approximately 15k worth of bitcoin in the wallet. What should I do? The account is under my name and the account was verified by my SSN and ID. It's bitcoin not fiat currency. So is this money considered mine? What should I do with it? Ive contacted binance.us to lock the account. I'm fairly new to crypto and I'm at a loss as what to do...

Or should I dial back my contributions and do something else with it?

I paid off all debt last year. Only thing I have is a mortgage which is @ 3.25. I'm at ~70% LTPP and ~ 55% LTV. Hard to justify throwing more there.

But there are almost always some potential opportunities if this was the case for you.

1. Roth conversions.  If you are single (married filing joint), and had no income in 2021, you can convert $12,250 ($25,100) from Traditional to Roth and pay no federal income taxes whatsoever.  This is the standard deduction and the effective 0% tax bracket.  If you don't mind paying 10%+, consider converting even more.

2. Tax gain harvesting.  If you have unrealized gains on securities in a taxable account, and you are single (married filing joint), you can bring your taxable income up to $40,400 ($80,800) with long-term capital gains and be taxed at the 0% rate.  Even if you want to hold these investments, you can realize the gain and reacquire them to reset your cost basis, reducing future tax obligations.

3. Less helpful for fewer people, but if you're expecting 2022 to be a better year, hold off on making your January mortgage payment until January, in order to capture taxes and insurance for a potentially itemizable deduction in 2022.

4. Also rare, but if you have an old 401k with company stock in it, you may be eligible for Net Unrealized Appreciation: the ability to take your company stock out of your 401k, and move it into a taxable account.  If your stock has a lot of unrealized gains on it, then the opportunity is back to the second point: tax gain harvesting.  Beware that this comes with tax penalties if you are under 59.5, but if the conditions are right, a crappy year financially could be a great year to exercise NUA.

**TLDR**:

In conclusion, risk analysis of DeFi protocols is a very complex process as the areas of risk exposure are very different and often interfere with each other. For example, a protocol that allows more freedom in governance will attract investors who want to make the most out of being able to cast their votes on a wide variety of factors, but it will also be subject to more volatility in changes and be undesirable to another group of investors who want to hold the tokens for stability in asset value. Thus, we have to be clear of our purpose first, and then make the relevant analysis and comparison across protocols.

# General Conclusion

Risk is one of the most prominent issues in traditional financial markets. In particular, risk helps investors to quantify a specific number representing an asset value, in order to assess whether that level of risk is acceptable.

In DeFi, however, risk is often undervalued as the majority of participants do not fully appreciate it. Several lending/borrowing protocols are at the forefront of this field when it comes to assessing the risk of an asset. In other protocols we rarely see full consideration of risk.

In this article, we will introduce the concept of systematic risk (generalised) from traditional markets to DeFi.

# What Is Systematic Risk?

Assuming you invest in a single asset, what is the source of risk for this ""portfolio""?

We can say that there are two common sources of uncertainty:

1. Risks arise from overall economic conditions, such as business cycles, inflation, interest rates and exchange rates. These economic factors are difficult to predict with certainty and all affect the return on assets.
2. Risk comes from the asset itself (specificity). For example, is the government controlling the asset or is their direct demand for it, etc. These factors affect one asset but do not affect other assets.

Now we look at the ""portfolio"" of even more assets (a diversification strategy), asking the same question, what about portfolio risk?

Diversifying multiple asset classes spreads the risk of the entire portfolio. The ability to decrease the value of one asset provides the ability to increase the value of another asset. These effects will offset and stabilise the return on the entire portfolio and portfolio volatility will continue to decrease.

However, even if we hold a certain amount of assets (e.g. &gt;1000 assets), we still cannot avoid risk completely, because almost all assets are affected by factors such as general macro factors. For example, if all assets held are affected by the business cycle, then we cannot avoid business cycle risk no matter how many assets we hold.

&gt;This risk that persists even after diversification is called market risk, which is associated with sources of market-wide risk. Such risk is also known as systematic risk, or non-diversifiable risk.",cryptocurrency

RECAP
-Well the quad witching day and ex-dividend day was mostly uneventful and unexciting. I feel like Thursday was way more volatile than today. Nonetheless lets jump right into it. 
-Looking back at yesterday we had established a clear downward channel that we then saw the after/ pre market ""break"" except... it didnt really break it. It was just establishing a wider downward channel that we for the most part traded within. 
-we opened the morning just below that 465 mark. And for the most part traded sideways from 464 to 461. We saw our first bit of volatility around 1030 with a drop to 458. The rest of the day we stayed between that 464 and 460 mark. The end of the day we solidified a pretty solid downward channel. Finishing the day down 1.06% or -$4.94. 
For those of you who saw my quad witching post yesterday youll see that she performed as suspected. 

AFTERMARKET
-We had continued the downward channel and was appearing to establish it (which i feel we rarely do in Aftermarket). But we managed to pop the candle above the resistance line. Finishing the week out at 461.56. We did see a hard rejection at the 1 hour 20 day EMA which could signal we are still leaning towards a bearish side. 
https://i.imgur.com/jXaoeZT.jpeg 

DAILY/ WEEKLY NEWS
- Build Back Better plan still not passable at the moment it appears. From what i understand congress is now outta session for Christmas break too. 
-Covid cases on the rise
-Feds now saying 2022 rate hikes will depend on the economy. 
-istanbul's stock market was halted twice due to financial crises in turkey 

DAILY POSITIONS RECAP
-Overall today i again had to work night shift and really planned to sleep till power hour and make a few trades. Ended up getting up about 2pm market was about where i expected. I made 4 intraday trades today misplayed one put for -5% (got caught slipping and misread the wic that broke resistance), 2 puts for a nice 20% gain (i bailed early cause of my earlier misplay for -5% and didnt have a great feel of the chart yet), tried to scalp a pop at the end of the day on a call and didnt get it in time so closed that down 2%. 
-Overall an okay day. I also picked up Jan 21 464C, 465C, 468C and 470C and a Dec 27 464C. Tried to snag a Jan 21 461C too but couldn't get it to fill at closing. Overall im planning to play the bullish recovery next week. I went with Jan 21 incase we see some further dip or it takes a bit to get there. 
-Also picked up some Ford Jan 21 21C and Dec 27 20C. 
-Not gonna lie i dont like seeing stuff red like that but its within my threshold and im still bullish (for the calls to pay off at least). 

NEXT DAY/ WEEK ANTICIPATION 

1 HOUR RSI
-Overall we are near 43 which is leaning towards over sold. (Bullish)
https://i.imgur.com/IvBHuD4.jpeg 

1 HOUR MACD
-today the MACD ran mostly flat while remain a sell. Aftermarkets push saw us get a buy signal (bullish).
https://i.imgur.com/IvBHuD4.jpeg 

1 HOUR BOLLINGER
-we followed just below the mid bollinger all day today and in the morning used the lower as support. After hours push was rejected by the mid bollinger. High- 466.82, mid- 462.72, low- 458.82. 
-overall the mid rejection is bearish. If we cant close a candle above 463 we will most likely find support near 459.
https://i.imgur.com/03tZOOv.jpeg 

1 HOUR EMA
-Mid day saw a 20 day EMA rejection. The EMAs continue to curl negatively and the 20 day has significantly fallen below. I would look for the 20 to curl positively and get back above the rest before i see anything bullish holding.
-After hours showed a nice 20 day EMA rejection too (bearish).
-https://i.imgur.com/lPOoPr4.jpeg 

DAILY MACD
-We were running a buy/ flat neutral MACD for a while. However today we saw a confirmed sell signal.
https://i.imgur.com/FvzAeFb.jpeg 

DAILY RSI
-we are neutral at 47, however, i see a downward trend line
https://i.imgur.com/FvzAeFb.jpeg 

DAILY BOLLINGER
-We failed to close the candle above (however the wic did break it) mid bollinger of 463.75. Low- 451.77 and high of 475.73. 
https://i.imgur.com/amGSXoj.jpeg 

DAILY EMA
-Much like the bollinger we failed to close the candle above the 20 day EMA (however the wic did break it). 20 day EMA sit at 464.03. The 50 day EMA did hold as support at 459.83 however we saw the wic too break that. If we continue downward 100 day EMA (next logical support) is at 450.61. 
https://i.imgur.com/HBsxsh8.jpeg 

DAILY CHANNEL
-Overall we had been running in the kid section of the channel. However now we are appearing to drop below the middle of the channel. Lower support line (red dotted line) sits right around 448. 
https://i.imgur.com/k2xO2lJ.jpeg 

NEXT WEEK OUTLOOK/ POSITIONS
-Overall we are on the hourly looking a little more bullish, however, we are sitting pretty bearish on the daily. 
-We have a key resistance area of 463- 464. IF we can close a candle completely above 464 monday we could see a complete reversal and start working back towards 470. 
-There is a very real scenario where we trade completely sideways monday too. There is some uncertainty surrounding covid right now which may change some of direction.
Key support area (based off my support lines) 460 (50 day EMA) --&gt; 458.6 --&gt; 457.6 --&gt; 454 (heavy support here from 10/4, 10/6, 12/3). Doomsday 448 (lower red dotted line for major channel). 
-As i mentioned i grabbed some 464C, 465C, 468C and 470C. My goal today was to play the dip by loading up in some discounted calls which most were 15-20% down today. 
-My feeling is by end of next week we should be back up above 470.",finance

CryptoCurrency,"How I think Web 3.0 private blockchains will work (like for the gov), and how running a type of crypto on it could eliminate the need of traditional taxes","So going along with my prior post on Web 3.0 on here. Yes I think private blockchains will heavily be used simply for the improvements of a blockchain vs a normal cloud storage system. Like a blockchain requires many points of failures while a normal cloud system only requires a single point of failure. 

I can easily foresee in this new age of Web 3.0 we will see things like the USA gov have it's own blockchain. What could happen is the federal gov will make a layer 1 blockchain. 

For those of you who don't know Layer 1 blockchain is simply the first level. Layer 2 is what is built on layer 1. Layer 3 is built on layer 2. And so on. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I can see it where the federal will have layer 1, and each federal department and each state is layer 2. Then layer 3 will be built on the state level for state programs, counties, and most likely cities. (It is possible some states or all might pick to make city level layer 4 and 5). 

# The benefit 

The smaller the blockchain the easier it is to attack. So having layer 1 gov blockchain be controlled by federal gov USA or something like the UN which branches off. It makes it more secure from changing files. And then top that with privacy stuff which helps hide where things are being transferred or what is being transfer. 

# How crypto on top of this could get away from normal taxes?

So IMO if a gov power was to do something like this, at this time it would be smart to look at switching their currency to heavily backed by crypto and a solid push for getting away from physical money. What I could see is the gov could use the same features on the newer coins in which everyone gets reflections as the crypto is being used.

Reflections are basically a transfer tax from the crypto itself. Say it's 10% for example, and you bought something for $100. That's $10 being taxed. Now lets say there is just 1M coins. That $10 gets split between them all and each gets $0.00001 of that $10. Now lets say if the gov holds 500k coins. This means the gov gets $5 from that tax while everyone else gets everything else.

What this means is since the gov will end up holding a huge back. For every transfer, buy, sell, or whatever. They should in theory get enough from that which would make normal taxes pointless. Plus it would encourage the gov to push for a better economy and for the gov to spend less so it can have a bigger bag to make more.

&amp;#x200B;

BTW sorry for any typo or ramble. It's just my 3AM thoughts on how this tech could work to solve both problems and how I think it could work.",cryptocurrency

stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning December 20th, 2021","Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new holiday-shortened trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 20th, 2021.

# **Market turbulence may be a theme in the holiday week as investors fret over omicron, the Fed - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/17/market-turbulence-may-be-a-theme-in-the-holiday-week-as-investors-fret-over-omicron-the-fed.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks could be volatile in the coming week, with thin volume exaggerating moves in both directions ahead of the Christmas holiday.
*****
&gt; The market was whipsawed in the past week, with the Nasdaq down about 2.9% since Monday and lagging the other major averages on a weekly basis. Technology stocks were at the center of major market swings, as investors reacted to the spreading omicron Covid variant and the Federal Reserve’s hawkish shift.
*****
&gt; “As we head into the last two weeks of the year, we know volume is light and volatility can also pick up,” said Jeff Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab. “There’s the possibility of a Santa rally, but there’s also the possibility that the lack of volume can lead to dramatic swings to the downside as well.”
*****
&gt; While December is typically positive for stocks, the traditional Santa Claus rally is the historically positive market performance that often comes in the last five trading days of the year and first two of January, according to Stock Trader’s Almanac. As the saying goes, if Santa doesn’t call, bears may come to Broad and Wall — the street address of the New York Stock Exchange.
*****
&gt; # A thinner market near the end of the year
&gt; So far, the S&amp;P 500 is still up 1.2% for December, but it’s down nearly 1.9% for the week. The broad-market index has a roughly 23% gain for the year. The index ended Friday at 4,620.
*****
&gt; “The Santa Claus rally this year is a little tough to call because the market has done so well up to this point. Building on that momentum is a bold call,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. “Volumes are going to decrease, and that’s likely to lead to greater volatility into year end. It wouldn’t surprise me if markets close the year strongly, but with the omicron variant and the Fed tightening, it just seems anxiety is at high levels.”
*****
&gt; Strategists haven’t given up on the idea of a late December to early January rally. However, with the selling pressure, it could be more difficult for the seasonal year-end buyers to boost the market. The thinness of the market may also make it tricky to gauge how stocks will trade into January.
*****
&gt; “I think it’s going to be hard to get a real tell on the market — the light volume and the fact there’s going to be relatively little economic news or corporate news. It’s going to be just incremental news on omicron,” said Kleintop.
*****
&gt; He said earnings in the past year have been a catalyst for stocks, with companies beating estimates and raising guidance. That could turn the tide in the next earnings season in mid-January, if stocks continue to move lower.
*****
&gt; “This time we might get a lot of dividend increases. There’s a lot of cash out there,” he said. Kleintop said expectations are for just an 8% gain in corporate profits in 2022, and that could move higher since companies appear to be managing margins better than expected.
*****
&gt; In the week ahead, there are several economic releases to watch. The markets will be most fixated on personal consumption expenditures next Thursday, as the so-called PCE deflator is the inflation data most watched by the Federal Reserve. The report follows November’s hot consumer price index, which was up 6.8% on a year-over-year basis.
*****
&gt; Arone said the market will also monitor the consumer confidence index release next Wednesday for inflation expectations. The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index is out Thursday.
*****
&gt; Key real estate indicators are also out next week, with existing home sales on Wednesday and new home sales Thursday. Durable goods are also out Thursday.
*****
&gt; The market is closed for the Christmas holiday on Friday.
*****
&gt; # Bond market confusion
&gt; As stocks gyrated, bond yields went down in the past week, especially after the Fed announced Dec. 15 that it would speed up the end of its bond-buying. The central bank also provided a new interest rate forecast which showed members expect as many as three hikes next year, when previously they did not forecast any.
*****
&gt; The Fed also removed the description of inflation as “transitory” from its statement.
*****
&gt; Bond yields move opposite price, so the move lower in rates was surprising to market professionals. It would be logical to have expected a jump in yields at the shorter end of the market, which is most influenced by Fed policy. For instance, the 2-year Treasury yield was at 0.63% Friday afternoon, below the 0.67% level it was at ahead of the Fed news.
*****
&gt; The benchmark 10-year yield was at 1.44% before the Fed’s announcement. It had fallen to 1.37% by Friday morning and was at around 1.40% in afternoon trading.
*****
&gt; Yields initially inched higher Friday afternoon after Fed Governor Christopher Waller said the central bank could raise interest rates as early as March. Goldman Sachs economists had been expecting a March hike, but most expected the Fed to wait until May or June because it will end its bond program in March.
*****
&gt; “I do think the omicron scare has got people spooked. On the long end, it’s weighing on it,” said Wells Fargo’s Michael Schumacher. “The front end doesn’t make a lot of sense. We just heard from the Fed... The front end should really be taking its marching orders from Powell.”
*****
&gt; # China easing?
&gt; While the Fed and the Bank of England have recently moved to tighten policy, another economic superpower may be doing the opposite.
*****
&gt; Schumacher and Kleintop said a positive surprise for markets could come from China ahead of Monday’s trading.
*****
&gt; “On Monday, we’ll all be watching China with what they do with their loan prime rate. There’s a chance they could cut it,” Kleintop said.
*****
&gt; “If China is going to re-inflate their economy, that would be a real boost to global growth,” he said.
*****
&gt; # What to do
&gt; Kleintop said investors should stay fully invested. He noted that because of the big rotations in market leadership this year, investors should be more diversified.
*****
&gt; “Every time we started to see a breakout with value, it was crushed with another virus outbreak. We should be seeing growth stocks outperform here, as cases rise, but they haven’t made a new high relative to value since the news of omicron,” said Kleintop.
*****
&gt; Kleintop noted that the tech sector is highly valued, with its price-earnings ratios 10 points above the 20-year average. The forward price-earnings for global tech was 28.5 Friday. He said that compares to the global energy sector, trading on a 12-month forward price-earnings ratio of 9.5, about nine points below its average.
*****
&gt; “This is the widest gap we’ve seen between the growthiest of the growth and the value sectors,” Kleintop said. “We haven’t seen tech make a new high relative to energy since before omicron. Certainly, there’s the Fed weighing on valuations as well as there’s the idea there’s going to be less liquidity pouring into these favorite stocks.”
*****
&gt; Kleintop said he does not see a big gain for the market in 2022, like this year, and investors should look abroad for some better gains.
*****
&gt; “We see a positive year for equities but nothing like this year,” he said. “There’s a potential outperformance by Europe and international next year, after they underperformed.”

&gt; # Outperformance from Low Volatility

&gt; Over the last two weeks, low volatility names have outperformed the broader market. The PowerShares S&amp;P 500 Low Volatility ETF (SPLV) has ticked 6.83% higher over the last 10 trading days as of yesterday's close. During the same time period, the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) moved 4.36% higher. Investors have poured into safer names so far in December, but SPLV has still underperformed SPY on a YTD basis. Over the last three months, the performance of these two ETF's has been essentially identical with SPLV breaking out to all-time highs, while SPY struggles to break out. Although investors are not necessarily selling off equities broadly, they are gaining exposure to lower volatility names, which could be interpreted as taking a more conservative posture.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/SPLV-perf-121621.png))**
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/SPY-perf-121621.png))**

&gt; The two-week performance spread between SPLV and SPY is currently at an elevated level, and as of earlier this week (12/14) was at its widest level since 1/31/20, which is less than a month before the COVID correction began. Investors should watch the performance of low volatility names moving forward, as continued outperformance would signal that investors are becoming increasingly risk averse.

&gt; # Five Important Charts To See Right Now

&gt; As we head into the end of 2021, here are five charts that caught our attention.

&gt; First up, last week was one of the best weeks of the year for stocks, and that could be a good sign. “It turns out that big weeks like last week usually have the bulls smiling,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “23 out of the past 25 times the S&amp;P 500 Index gained at least 3.8% in a week, it was higher three months later.”

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&amp;P 500 closed up more than 3.8% in a week on 25 occasions since March 2009, with last week being number 26. As you can see, the future returns 1-, 2-, and 3-months out are extremely strong.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-12.15.21-1-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Second, we are nearing the second half of December, which historically is when stocks tend to do well during this usually bullish month. In fact, returns actually get better if the S&amp;P 500 is negative in November (check) and up more than 20% heading into the final month of the year (check).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-12.15.21-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Third, the second year of the Presidential Cycle tends to be the worst of the four-year cycle and it is up the least often as well. Although we expect stocks to still do well in 2022, this is a reminder it likely won’t be another run-away bull market like we saw in 2021.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-12.15.21-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Breaking this down by new Presidents versus re-elected Presidents and it is quite clear that year 2 under a new President historically has been quite weak. Then again, this said year 1 shouldn’t be very good and that sure hasn’t been the case this year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-12.15.21-4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Lastly, breaking things down by quarters, it becomes very clear the next three quarters are some of the worst of the four-year cycle, before a very strong fourth quarter.

&gt; # Mid-December Low Buy Point

&gt; December typically starts out weak. And it has. But despite the recent worrisome headlines about the Fed, inflation and Omicron stocks typically begin the yearend rally right here around mid-month. As you can see here in the chart while this year has clearly exhibited more volatility, stocks have tracked the usual December seasonal pattern of weakness in early December. So with market seasonality reasserting itself these past few months the prospects look good for the rally to resume.

*****

&gt; # Pockets of Strength in Emerging Markets

&gt; So far this year, the US has outperformed every other country on the planet. Broadly speaking, developed economies have outperformed emerging economies. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) has declined 6.8% in 2021, but this does not necessarily mean that performance across every emerging economy has been negative. Although China, Brazil, and South Korea have been particularly weak (three of the top six countries of exposure for EEM), countries like Taiwan, India, Russia, Mexico, and South Africa have experienced positive returns this year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/Trend-analyzer-121521-EEM-3.png))**

&gt; Just like individual sectors in the US cannot be expected to perform equally, emerging economies don't always perform in unison with each other. Differences include natural resources, political &amp; legal structure, trading partners, and much more. Although EEM has declined on a YTD basis, the average performance of the nine countries that we tracked was a modest loss of 0.1%, and the spread between the best performer (Taiwan) and the worst (Brazil) is currently 41.3 percentage points. Moving forward, investors may want to consider selecting individual countries to gain emerging market exposure, as the broader ETFs tend to have a large concentration in just a few countries. Emerging markets are inherently higher-risk investments in comparison to developed nations due to uncertainty in future prospects, but in the long run, there are excellent opportunities within pockets of emerging markets, although not all countries will see the same performance.

&gt; Technology (XLK), Energy (XLE), and Consumer Staples (XLP) tend to trade quite differently from each other for a variety of reasons. The Consumer Staples sector tends to be more defensive in nature as spending on the 'essentials' tends to hold up better in times of uncertainty than spending on more cyclical goods. XLE is largely levered to the price of energy commodities but also acts as an inflation hedge. Technology, meanwhile, tends to do best in a bullish tape as investors gravitate towards sectors with the brightest growth prospects. Because these sectors have different exposures, it is uncommon to see weeks like last week where these three sectors top the leaderboard for a given week. In fact, this has only occurred 9 times since the start of 2000, and two of those occurrences were in back-to-back weeks at the end of 2007.

&gt; In the table below, we show each of the prior weeks that Technology (XLK), Energy (XLE), and Consumer Staples (XLP) were the three top-performing sectors (without a prior occurrence in the last three months) along with the S&amp;P 500's performance over the last following week, month, three months, six months, and one year. In more than half of the prior eight occurrences, the equity market was lower during weeks when this occurred, and in the two prior weeks where the S&amp;P 500 was higher, it was up less than 1%. In other words, there has never been a week like the last one where the S&amp;P 500 was up close to 3% and these three sectors topped the leaderboard. After the eight prior occurrences, the S&amp;P 500 was consistently higher one week and one month later with positive returns six out of seven times. Moving further out, though, the consistency of positive returns was less. In fact, three months later, the S&amp;P 500 was only higher four out of seven times, while six and twelve months later it was higher five out of seven times.

&gt; Somewhat ominously, the worst forward returns came after the occurrence almost exactly fourteen years ago in December 2007 when the S&amp;P 500 went on to decline 40% in the following year. One difference between that period and last week, though, was that instead of those three sectors leading the market in a week where the S&amp;P 500 was up over 2%, in that week the S&amp;P 500 was down over 2%.

personalfinance,Time to refi fed student loans?,"I have about $110k in fed student loans remaining, with an average of ~6% interest. I’m on a 25-yr repayment schedule, which prior to the moratorium, was $890/month. During moratorium, I was slightly more aggressive, paying $1k/month, focusing on the higher interest Grad PLUS loans. Now that the moratorium is about to end, I’m thinking that I should refi for a better interest rate with a private lender. The only reason I didn’t previously is because of the potential for any student loan legislation, which seems pretty unlikely for the foreseeable future, and the perks of fed protections like the aforesaid moratorium, and alternative paths in case there is an adverse career event or I decided to go into a public interest position. However, at this point, my career is stable, we have a household income that will approach $400k/yr come pay raises in early 2022, and as mentioned, I highly doubt there will be meaningful federal action on student debt. The only major financial horizon in my life is that we’re looking to buy a house in the next 2 years, and we’re very high COL. I can’t think of a reason why I shouldn’t refi at this point, while interest rates are low, but I wanted to get additional thoughts from wiser minds than mine.",finance

CryptoCurrency,How to find a shitcoin and survive,"I posted a comment a week back that received a lot of buzz and have updated that post with better information. So, here is a more detailed post that covers how to find a shitcoin, what to look for in a shitcoin, and fundamentals to understand.

**Terms and mechanics to understand**

First off, 99% of the time Shitcoins are Shit*tokens*.

**Coins VS Tokens:** A coin is the blockchain’s native currency. A token is like a fork of a coin. You can build your token on a Blockchain and enjoy all the security and features of the coin’s blockchain, while focusing on features you want in your own coin. A Binance Smart Chain token would be BEP20 while an Ethereum token would be ERC20. You cannot have a BEP20 token on an Ethereum network, but a bridge can be made that allows moving a BEP20 token to an ERC20 token. Think of each blockchain, BSC and Ethereum, as individual islands separated by vast seas. Their natives can’t move from island to island and if you try to move an ERC20 native to a BEP20 island, you’ll lose that native. But a bridge can be built that allows safe passage from one island to the next. We call this “interoperability”.

**Altcoin**: Any coin not Bitcoin.

**Shitcoin**: Subjective. For me, it’s a token with a low market cap and high risk.

**Price:**  Price is determined by market cap / circulating supply. If I have a Market Cap of $400,000 and a circulating supply of 200,000 then my price is $2. Easy right?

**Market Cap:** Market Cap is determined by circulating supply x price. If I have 200,000 circulating supply and $2 price, then my Market Cap is $400,000. Nice!

**Diluted Market Cap:** How much would the market cap be if the TOTAL coin/token supply was circulating right now.

**Circulating supply**: This is how many coins/tokens are in available right now.

**Total Supply**: This is how many coins/tokens exist right now, even those not circulating.

**Max Supply**: This is a best guess of how many tokens may ever exist. Usually for inflationary Tokenomics.

**Inflationary:** Coins/tokens will continue to be added to the total supply. Price go down.

**Deflationary:** Coins/tokens will be removed from the total supply. Price go up.

**Burn:** Removes coins/tokens from supply. Price go up.

**Taxes:** Taxes are built-in fees you pay for buying and selling a shitcoin. Exchanges don’t allow for taxes in most situations, but decentralized exchanges do and that’s where all tokens are born. Taxes are how a token makes money to grow. Example: Say you want to buy ShitcoinX. If you buy $100 of ShitcoinX you will be taxed 10%. That 10% is broken down into 5% reflected rewards, 3% liquidity and 2% marketing. 5% goes to the devs and 5% goes back to holders. So, you end up with $90 of ShitcoinX. Now, if you decide to sell, you’ll also be taxed 10%. Now you’re the proud owner of $81.

**Why shitcoins don’t care about price or supply**

The misconception with shitcoins is that you **need** the shitcoin to go to a dollar or that the price even matters at all. None of that matters with shitcoins. The only thing that matters is market cap. It doesn't matter if a coin has 1 quadrillion or 100 circulating supply.

Market cap gives you the best general idea of what kind of return you might expect.

A large-Cap coin has less room for growth than a small-cap. The tradeoff is the risk. A large-cap is less volatile than a small-cap. Even with all the research in the world, investing in a shitcoin is a HUGE risk.

If a 100 circulating supply coin has a market cap of 100 billion, how difficult do you think it is to get to 200 billion? Pretty damn difficult just to double your money.

Now, if a 1 quadrillion supply token has a market cap of 50k, doubling your money is a reasonable expectation. A cough could push it over. A million-market cap can happen just from organic growth over time.

If you only have $100 to throw away, you could put it in Bitcoin and possibly get a 20-40% return within a few months. You probably won’t double your $100 anytime soon because that means Bitcoin would have to go from 900 billion to 1.8 trillion. That’s a lot of money to discover. It’s also a safe bet that Bitcoin will keep going up over time. Your $100 might be $1,000 in ten years.

That same $100 invested in ShitcoinX at a 50k market cap can easily double or 10x just from a few ads and an influencer. 50K is nothing in the crypto world. You’ll see 50k being thrown at a tiny Shitcoin from a single whale which will rock the charts. You can also lose you $100 in the same day if you're not careful.

Price and supply don’t matter because you’re factoring in volatility and odds. You’re gambling. You’re willing to bet that a solid shitcoin with a low market cap and a competent team can easily 10x your investment faster than a large cap can. To do this with any degree of success you need to do some basic research.

**The two shitcoin strategies: Holding and Trading**

**Trading:** If you want quick gains, you must enter and exit early. This is essentially a pump and dump, or as I like to think of it, day trading. You need to start by finding an Initial DEX Offering, or IDO, and get in early:

· [https://bscpad.com/](https://bscpad.com/) BSCPad

· [https://gamefi.org/](https://gamefi.org/) GameFi

· [https://launchpad.seedify.fund/](https://launchpad.seedify.fund/) Seedify

· [https://trustpad.io/](https://trustpad.io/) TrustPad

And if you’re feeling adventurous there’s PinkSale [https://www.pinksale.finance/#/?chain=BSC](https://www.pinksale.finance/#/?chain=BSC)

Most of the IDOs are limited access. You must go through steps to get whitelisted and often it’s random. You may apply to a dozen and only get accepted by one.

The pinksale option is usually public but there’s a chance you might get phished. This is when a scammer sees a project getting ready for an IDO and mirrors their IDO on pinksale to look like that token’s IDO. They’ll link to the official website and everything. The only difference is that the token you're buying is a scam and not the one you thought you were buying. It’s important to check with the official telegram group and confirm the presale is official and not a scam!

**Holding:**  If you have your heart set on a project and you didn’t get whitelisted or in on the presale, **DO NOT BUY AT LAUNCH!** Wait at minimum 72 hours after launch before you buy in. The traders who bought in at the IDO will be doing a lot of dumping. You may start with a buy in price of $2 and a few days after launch it’s now valued at $.40. The price will go down the week after launching. Once you buy in, there’s very little chance that your token is going parabolic that day. It may take days or weeks for price discovery. If you’re a holder, you trust the project and you’re willing to wait. Buy and hold. **Don’t doubt your research**.

This is a chart from Project Quantum. I was able to buy in on the presale. I dumped it shortly after the launch and made a nice 10x. But when you zoom out, that 10x doesn’t look so hot. I had lambo money in my hands and I pissed it away to buy more Cardano at $1.35.

[Project Quantum](https://preview.redd.it/47ga779hgb681.png?width=1516&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=03c4f9325eb5aced5f4cb5e372545308e04e2ee7)

If you find a solid shitcoin, take out your initial investment and hold! Shit is great fertilizer and sometimes nice things come from it.

[TryHards](https://preview.redd.it/jyzfigdjgb681.png?width=1190&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54adc57bf0a5adabf944f5dc8417836e49397a99)

Here is a chart from a more recent GameFi project, TryHards. This is a solid project with investors, a working proof of concept, and a lot of features that impress me. The chart is doing everything I expect it to do; climb quickly, trend downward, then move to the right as price discovery happens. At some point I expect it to take off just as Project Quantum did. These trending periods are consolidation moments. As it’s trending to the right you want to be buying. **NOT** when you see a huge green candle!

**What to look for in a Shitcoin:**

Most shitcoins that tick these boxes will make you money if you remember to take profits.

* **Verified devs:** They don't have to be doxxed but they need to be visible along with their socials. Gauge the team and test their knowledge and confidence at AMAs and when you see them in Telegram.
* **Whitepaper:** Proves they put some effort in the shitcoin. Measure the quality and content of the whitepaper. Is it a copy paste with very little content? Did they build it in notepad just before someone asked them “Where whitepaper?”.
* **Website and all the socials:** Proves they put some effort in the shitcoin. Is the website a Sitebuilder template or a genuine built from scratch website? If the devs can’t build their own website do you trust them to manage a crypto project? Are the devs active? How engaged is the community? Are people hyped or just waiting for something to happen?
* **Audits:** Audits cost money which is an indicator the devs aren't there to honeypot or rug-it. These usually come within a few weeks of launch.
* **Market Cap:** This varies. A shitcoin with not much to offer except community and rewards, aim for under 500k if you’re a holder. If you’re a trader, don’t bother if you didn’t get in on the presale. If it’s a project with a solid team, an interesting utility, that has a working product or at least a proof of concept, under 50 million is a fine entry point for a holder. This is because they’ll usually have investors and financial backing. You’re treading on the edge of a real Altcoin when you’re looking at these projects.
* **New listing**: This varies on your strategy. If you’re a trader, get in on presale. If you’re a holder, get in a week after launch.

The biggest pump will come within 48 hours and then, usually, you'll see a few months of downward or horizontal movement before the project starts to climb again. This is because the first few days sees the most hype and excitement. Everyone is looking for the newest thing. As it pumps the movers &amp; shakers take profit and move on leaving a group of bagholders who believe in the project.

The next big pump comes when things start happening for the project such as:

* Exchange listings (Hotbit, WhiteBIT, BitUp, Bitmart, ETC)
* Utilities revealed (Usually something to do with NFTs or swaps)
* Marketing budgets are pretty fat from taxes
* Not a rug or honeypot
* Devs are a little seasoned by now

If your shitcoin only offers reflections and hasn’t achieved anything other than listings and audits after six months, chances are the devs have sold their holdings and moved on to another project.

Almost every shitcoin I bought between April-June are now 3 million to 400 million Market Cap. All of them I bought around Presale-500k Market Cap. But! If you hold, and holding is fine, you will see a loss of 50-90% for months between the pumps. If you're not financially secure you will not survive this. You'll invest $500, it'll drop to $250, you'll move it to this new coin that's been out for 3 weeks that everyone is talking about, lose 20-40% just in taxes from selling and buying, then that coin will drop 50-90%. This is **just** the token’s own tax and not your federal taxes. **You will lose every single time you change lanes. Pick a lane and stay in it.**

In conclusion, if you want fast money get in at the IDO and sell when you hit your target return(5x,10x). Don’t buy in after launch. If you hold, **always** take your initial investment **but no more**. Why? Because you're in this for life-changing-money not bill-money. You're trying to build a nest egg of hundreds of ""what ifs?"". Any one of these could 100x. If you keep taking your initial investment out when it 10x you'll be fine.

So I checked with navy federal credit union and they quoted me for 2.99 interest rate for five years. The rate I will be paying on my student loans (the full 24kwill be about 4% so I am just conflicted if I should be splitting these loans up. So 12k at 2.99 and the rest will have 3.67% (avg of the remaining loans left) .

I currently have between 40k - 50k in a 401k. I was thinking about pulling money from the plan to pay off the card. I know if I pull money early from it I will have an extra penalty on top of the normal tax rate, but I feel like that would be much less then the interest I would end up accruing over the year trying to pay off the card. 

I just wanted to get some other opinions on this or other ideas on trying to pay off the card faster.

Edit: I haven't responded to individuals, but I have been reading everything. Thank you for your comments. The 401k is not the solution. A comment had mentioned some 401ks offer borrowing against the investment. I don't know if mine offers that, but I do have a life insurance policy that does.

stocks,"The ""It's already priced in""-myth","The ""It's already priced in""-myth

Who doesn't love mythology? Greek, Egyptian, Norse, there are plenty. Recently this sub has seen a new rise of modern mythology. Apparently, everything is already priced in and the market is some all-knowing, all-seeing entity. Is this true? Maybe. Let's dive in.

The origin of the mythos.

Sorry, I'm too lazy to try and figure this out. My guess is that it started with some brilliant guru who spouted this during one of his Youtube Ad videos. It seems awfully convenient, doesn't it. ""The market knows all. You think you can beat the big banks? Of course not. They have a million analysts and you don't stand a chance. However, follow me and the trades I'll email you every day, and you too can become a millionaire in a year or two."" Let's face it, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

The fallacy of the mythos.

""Everything is already priced in."" Let's explore the consequences. Two companies go public with news of their merger. Price of both stocks stay the same. Barely a wrinkle. Why? There were already some rumors so it was priced in. 

You deep dive a company and discover that their growth is accelerating. If this keeps up, the share price is somewhat undervalued at this moment. You compare this with the prices of said companies competitors and discover they are all overvalued. Do you invest? No. The market knows all, so I must be missing something right?

The FED announcing to hike interest rates. All growth stocks drop drastically as everyone migrates risky parts of their portfolio to big, solid companies with decent dividend. Rumors grow that Evergrande might default, every price is speculative and that this is the new way of the market. Then you read it, ""Bullish! This is all already priced in."" Of course. You're such an simpleton. How could you miss this?! All the potential disasters are priced in. 

If you truly believe this, then all price mutations are random. People are randomly selling and buying stuff and you just need luck. Ask yourself, do you really believe that?

Sweet reality

Meanwhile in the normal world, some things are priced in, but not everything is. News of the omicron variant caused prices to drop. Evergrande caused prices to drop. Earnings reports cause a drop or rise. That's just how it is.

The market still responds to every tidbit of news. So if your deep dive uncovers something, it's most likely true. There are thousands of companies who release their earnings report and hundred of small news articles that give information about very niche topics. There is no group of people who read all of that and have the means to immediately capitalize on it before everyone else.

People are emotional when it comes to money and also to stocks. For most people here, a ""crash"" is a 2,5% drop. Investing has only recently been made available to everyone. Apps where you can easily buy any stock you like, weren't available in 2008. When the real crash comes (no one knows when and how) then it will be worse than 2008. A lot more individual investors will panic, since they've never seen their portfolio tank 50% and see headlines that this might be bankruptcy for whatevery company they have invested in.

When you do a deep dive and uncover a good buy, just buy it and then post it if you want to share. Since you did the deep dive, you know more than 99,9% of all redditors on the company. You might even be the most knowledgable if the company is in a niche.

So do your deep dives into markets you know. Feel free to share your findings with us and try to think critically of all comments, no matter the amount of upvotes.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Cryptocurrency badly needs to work with the Cannabis Industry in legalized states.,"I am pretty well informed about the Californian cannabis industry as I have many family members worker in the C-suite at some well known companies and they are constantly telling me the same thing. Finance, taxes, and banking are almost impossible to use with money that has touched cannabis sales. As marijuana is federally illegal, thc or without thc (hemp) it becomes impossible to bank the money earned in banks. Most stores are cash based to cut out CC fees. This leads to companies and dispensaries hoarding large sums of cash with no where to put it. That also makes them hot for robberies. For example just this month 15 dispensaries being targeted and robbed all together in the Bay Area. [See the News Article](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10274993/amp/Spate-robberies-San-Francisco-Bay-Area-threatens-survival-cannabis-shops.html)

It really makes me think that the simplest solution which no one is taking is to transfer the money into cryptocurrency and hold it in a cold storage wallet. Wallets are practically bank accounts, more secure even depending on your strategies. I wish more companies would consider at least party purchasing stable coins and storing them or collecting interest on them with insured exchanges like Gemini or Coinbase. You would think  that these companies in Silicon valley would have already considered higher tech options insured of hoarding cash. Does anyone know of any companies or industries already doing this?",cryptocurrency

Now I'm 29 and almost finished, problem is that I have no clue on how to go about financial independence, I've mainly spent last 3 years recovering and increasing my earning potential with software engineering skills, currently learning how to negotiate like you're 30 and slowly feeling the stigma of my situation fade away.

How should I go about financial independence ? 'cause I got the first steps: gain more than you spend, increase earning potential but with the skills that I'm getting I have a few more options like separating my time from my gains through code.

Got no investments besides what I put on learning and staying in good health.

nuclear,"Upcoming Australian elections, voting advice requested regarding Clive Palmer","Hello everyone,

I am an Australian who has long lamented their national ban on civilian nuclear which has been upheld by both the major Labor and Liberal parties.

This ban is upheld under federal legislation, Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Commonwealth) in section 140A(1). As such, the two major parties along with smaller parties which support these parties (the Greens and the Nationals respectively) and most independents are against nuclear.

Strangely enough, Australia’s nuclear submarines are exempt from this ban on nuclear power with [military applications being listed as an exemption](https://www.awe.gov.au/environment/epbc/exemptions).

A notable exception to this is Clive Palmer’s United Australia Party which has consistently [outlined support for nuclear power](https://www.unitedaustraliaparty.org.au/united-australia-party-backs-nuclear-energy-for-affordable-and-reliable-power/). As such, is it advisable for Australians to vote for Clive Palmer despite more controversial views being supported by his party such as views on COVID? If not, are there any better choices, especially ones with anywhere nearly the clout that the United Australia Party has.

Alternative approaches to nuclear advocacy or to get a nuclear career in general are also welcomed. I did look into the possibility of moving overseas but export controls are a significant hurdle. I looked into the possibility of the UK or Europe.",energy

ethereum,Goldcoin?,"With attempts by governments to ""regulate"" fiat-backed stablecoins, it's probably the right time for a clone of DAI that is backed by gold instead of fiat.

Gold is a tangible and physical asset (unlike the dollars in Circle's bank accounts that could be seized/deleted at any time), which makes it easier to build a decentralized stablecoin system backed by it.

The ethereal nature of the dollar - it's just numbers in a database run by a centralized authority - is the most underrated obstacle to building a stablecoin that stays true to crypto principles. To hold dollars in any meaningful amount it is necessary to partner with old-school backs, who have been ""regulated"" so much they're basically quasi-nationalized.

Since gold is relatively permissionless (worse than BTC or ETH, better than fiat), even small-scale gold holders can issue stablecoins with market caps in the low millions. Moreover, this can be done in absolutely any national jurisdiction, unlike dollar-backed stablecoins that require US or US-friendly financial jurisdictions.

Just like MakerDAO, JewelerDAO/&lt;insert name&gt; will evaluate the reliability of different stablecoin issuers and create an index of the best ones, along with all the other monetary policy functions.

(In theory, this can be done with any commodity, but since gold has the highest economic value per unit volume it is the easiest to do on a small-scale by far, which is good for decentralization. Also, there are so many firms around the world that are competent at being custodians of gold, which can't be said for most other commodities)",cryptocurrency

# 1) Not An Illusion

Stable coin is not an illusion. Stable coin is a type of monetary policy a project chooses. For instance, to **peg** the cryptocurrency to something (e.g. USD).

When we talk about cryptocurrencies, we have to talk about the different types of monetary policy. One of them is fixing exchange rates. Other options are inflation targeting, price level targeting, mixed policies, etc.

## Case in point:

(compare it to the fiat-world) You have countries like Panama, Ecuador, El Salvador using a 1:1 exchange rate with USD. For other countries, they peg their currency to USD like Belize, Barbados, Hong Kong, UAE. ([Source](https://www.oanda.com/currency/iso-currency-codes/USD))

# 2) Types of Monetary Policy

When we talk about international monetary policy, we have to mention the **impossible trilemma**. Basically, central banks/currencies have to choose 2 out of 3 options to create their currency. They are

* fixed exchange rate
* free capital flow
* sovereign monetary policy

Many of the stable coins (e.g. USDC, Tether) collect 1 USD to create 1 USD equivalent of their token, hence the “stable-ness” relative to USD. This means they give up control of their own monetary policy.

This seems fine right now, but as the economy grows, monetary policy becomes very important because we are talking about inflation rates and interest rates (if any). If the stable coin is only controlled by the US-FED (external control), it is a risk for the internal environment to operate.

## Case in point:

Greece crisis in 2012. Greece, being part of EU, had to give up their monetary policy control, and follow the ECB. Greece needed an expansionary monetary policy. But since it uses Euros and linked to the other Euro-nations like Germany, the expansionary policy suitable for Greece is NOT suitable for Germany at that time. Hence, Greece wanted to get out to resolve their economy.

Cryptoeconomics is all about the long-term sustainability of the project with minimal speculation.

If this were to happen in the stable coin universe in the foreseeable future as the internal economy grows, the dependent monetary policy will pose as a risk to the stable coin’s economy.

# 3) Stable doesn't mean it does not change.

Stable means it is **stable relative to something**. E.g. gold, USD, GBP.

The point of stable coin is to reduce velocity of the currency, hence reduce the risk associated with it. A new technology (DLT, blockchain) is risky enough if we can mitigate the risk with stable coins, that is a huge bonus.

In our instant-gratification society, we want to see results now and fast. The fastest way to reduce velocity is to create a pegged 1:1 coin - my point #2.

There are other ways to create a more stable type of currency that works in the long-term. The downside: it takes time to perfect the monetary policy (mechanism design) &amp; other tokenomics pillars.

# 4) “Stable coins don’t exist because fiat currencies are not stable.”

O*kay... ... but what do you mean by “stable”?*

But there are other ways to create a stable currency using other monetary policy and nominal anchors.

\*Quick crash course: nominal anchors in the fiat-world is what the government provides to increase stability to the economy at the expense of the government’s autonomy. They are the single variable to pun down the expectations of private agents (e.g. USD holders, token holders) about nominal price levels (not price levels less inflation).

## Case in point:

USD does not have an exchange rate target. We learnt that from the failed Bretton Wood System. USD is also the global currency, so it doesn’t make sense for them to fix their exchange rate to something else. Instead, they use other methods, e.g. inflation rate targeting. US Fed does that. (Source) Bank of England does that too.

# Conclusion

* Stable coins are useful. It is real. It is not an illusion.
* The idea of using a 1:1 peg is good in the short-term. For long-term success, I have my worries.
* There are other ways to manage the monetary policy apart from exchange rate targeting.",cryptocurrency

I pay 0% federal up to ~$81k and then 15% on let's say another $30k per year?  So if I retire and just leave my fund alone and draw $110,000 from it as my retirement, I'll pay $4500 in federal taxes?  I know I am subject to state taxes and possibly Medicare/SS also, but if I'm understanding this correctly, this nest egg in stocks/funds can really be stretched out if I'm not getting pulverized by taxes each year when I pull some out.

personalfinance,Interesting personal loan situation,"***EDIT: Please do not give me the standard recommendation of ""work more hours"" or ""pick up another job"" that's extremely impractical in my situation because I work 40 hours a week already and still have to make time for friends/family before I go. It's not as simple as that. I have a high monthly output of bills and none can be cut back my vehicle is my only piece of debt (apart from from 30 dollars on a credit card I pay off and spend) it's impossible for me to make 2,000 extra within 30 days***

&amp;#x200B;

So here's my problem: I'm going to prison in a very short time period (\~month). I owe 12k on a car and it recently tanked in value due to mileage. So now I'm stuck in negative equity on it, no savings, and no one to barrow 2,000 dollars from.

I know I cannot barrow 2k because I'll be in prison and cannot pay that back however I had an idea that if I could get a 10k loan I could sell the car pay the difference off, use auto-payments from the loan to make the monthly payments from my bank account until I got out (I'm only going for 15 monthish so it's not unrealistic) use the remaining money to purchase a vehicle in cash as I'll have money sent in from family so I won't have to worry about spending the money at all from the loan.

I make 20/hr now and I have an amazing job but the car has to go because it's the reason I don't have a savings, plus my credit would tank with a repossession and all of the delinquent payments. Getting out of prison with an awful credit score isn't something I want to do even if that means costing myself a lot of interest on a personal loan.

I have a 740 credit score, 2 years of history, and make give or take 32,500 a year on paper. I have pay stubs and everything you need to dig yourself in a hole with a loan but I don't know where to dig. Who should I goto for the loan for the best interest rate with my income? I know it's very foolish but I either tank my credit now with no fighting chance or take the risk so I can still be able own a home in the next 7 years.",finance
CryptoCurrency,To Those Wanting To Quit Their Jobs &amp; Live Off Crypto,"So I've long been interested in ""The FIRE Movement"" the whole Financial Independence Retiring Early thing. I noticed recently there's a crypto fire community called r/CryptoCurrencyFire which I think is pretty neat. 

I saw a post yesterday from a guy who was making $30 a day off in game rentals and was considering quitting his job, so I just wanted to share some insights from someone who's into the whole FIRE thing and why that might be a bad idea. I should add this guy wasn't from a 3rd World Country where $30 might be a months income, this was someone from California, one of the most expensive states in the world to live in. 

FIRE stands for financial independence retiring early. The whole idea of FIRE is to try to up your income as much as possible, cut your expenses as much as possible while still maintaining a decent quality of life, live off 50% or less of your income, and save and invest the rest.

In typical FIRE discussions 750k is about the bare minimum anyone considers retiring on and that's among the r/leanfire community or those who are willing to live a bit more simply and sacrafice a bit of spending for the freedom of time. There is a community called r/povertyfire where people plan to live on 12k a year or less, typically by moving to a lower cost of living area. 

I guess my point is this, when your 20 yeas old and living with your parents making $30 a day may be a way to quit your job and have some beer money, but its not a real income and without being subsidized by your parents you really can't live off that. Beyond that Defi platforms get rug pulled or hacked all the time, interest rates are good for a few weeks or months and then drop, it's not super sustainable right now to live off APR.

Now it's one thing if you got 1.2 million in crypto, maybe you buy a rental property that brings in some money each month, throw a bit into a high dividend ETF and throw a couple hundred thousand into staking some crypto, but if you have less than a half mill, and that's being generous, and you plan on living off crypto that seems pretty risky. 

I imagine many of you have already read it but I'd encourage you if you haven't to read Tim Ferris's The 4 Hour Workweek, it gives you an interesting and different way to look at life ie taking mini sabaticals or retirements for 6 months or a year every couple years throughout your working life so you can ""enjoy retirement"" while your still young, healthy and active. He also talks a lot about creating passive income streams and your own businesses. Its basically just an eye opener if you've grown up with the idea of getting a 9-5 working hard until 65 and then retiring, it's a different lifestyle and a different way of looking at things. 

I guess my point is this, to the guy making $30 a day or $60 a day you could either quit your job enjoy hanging out taking it easy and live off that money, or you could keep your job, use that money to continue to DCA, to continue to stack, especially now when things are down, and by having the patience to do that in a couple years you may be in a position to actually and sustainably quit your job and not go back to one.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,How to spend 40k $? Please advice.,"Hey, everyone,I am looking for advice, but first, let me give you some info. I usually make around 5k a month, and I spend half of it - mortgage, house payments, kindergarten, food, clothes and everything else you can imagine to have a very comfortable living.

I am collecting the rest of the money, and now at the end of the year, I have around 40k that I want to do something with them. Keeping that money in the bank makes no sense to me. I have an emergency fund that can sustain me for about a year, and I don't need to put more money there.

I will probably not need that money in the next few years.   
Also, I am located in Eastern Europe, the tax rate is 10%.

I have several options in front of me :

1. Put that money in my mortgage. Currently, I pay around 750 a month, so it's not a big deal. The interest rate is 2.5% per year. If I put those 30k there, I will have to pay around 600 a month.
2. Invest that money. I am thinking about putting that money in some ETFs or mutual funds.I don't have the time to be a trader, nor do I have the skills.I am very busy with my job, and I usually work weekends pretty often.

My questions are: Should I go with option two and what to invest in?I had investments in gold and silver, but the return rate is crappy. Crypto is somewhat volatile for me.

Should I put my 40k in stocks like Berkshire and Apple or go and buy some ETF?

I also have few thousand $ in Mintos, but I don't want to put more money there.

retirement,FOMO Shadowing Retirement Insecurity,"Planning, we do it for almost everything whether we realize it or not. Even my most flighty of family and friends tend to put together some sort of mental outline before they take something on. As for me, a person with a pronounced case of anxiety, I can overly plan to the point of it adding to my stress about anything. There is one area specifically that I once had in order until life got in the way; retirement. Business school taught me with a high amount of financial discipline that I could save my way into anything. For those who don't know me, I felt that business school had many concepts that were great until put into practice. In a world of spectrums, I was in for the surprise of my life when I met with my polar opposite; a super retirement saver. As lovely of a human as he may have been (his opinion not mine), our financial planning perspectives blended well as a chocolate mousse in a sauerkraut sandwich- not gonna mesh well without literal magic. From it all I tried to soak up some sort of lesson from our differing ways of life, this is my summation of retirement for the average working-class earner.   
For those of us in the under $70,000.00 tax bracket, saving can be hard in a market where a serious medical bill or personal disaster can wipe you out. With that in mind, I would also like to point out that the inflation rate blazes ahead of the interest rate for savings accounts, including for the long-term accounts in many cases. The only exception is if you have a massive amount of money to combat this unpleasant fact i.e., over a million dollars in the bank.  In my personal case, I plan to never retire completely, as all of my relatives who did so in the early 2000s were financially decimated by the 2008 recession. Their downfall was due in part to the changes in technology that affected monthly household budgets (analog TV to online entertainment, etc.). When these early to retire relatives of mine made their post-retirement budgets they could not have expected their phone bills to go from the average of $40.00 a month in exchange for a landline to $120.00 for a cell phone unless they had a crystal ball directly from Steve Jobs himself.   
It wasn't just the unexpected expense influxes that doomed my quick to their twilight years family. It was also the withdrawal from society that retirement packed that took them down a notch. My once high-functioning elders went from responsible adults to being unable to mix with civilization within a decade. Seeing them on visits would sadden me because it was unavoidable to notice how reclusive and shut down they had become from being out of work. All the savings in the world could not prevent them from being left out of the loop when it came to modern culture, something that gives me some pause to mention when I converse with them but is quite apparent nonetheless.   
Then came my buddy the supersaver. He's the type of spender that has as much discipline as a drill sergeant on inspection day. Every expense he has is planned long in advance. I would say that we got along well until the topic of my retirement plan was mentioned, but the truth was that we didn't enjoy any of our time together. My supersaver wouldn't go anywhere or do anything. It was as if he were frozen in the year 2000. I often had to suppress myself from commenting to him that to me it was as if life had totally passed him by. No matter the effort I tried to put into adding a little bit of fun into our interactions, the supersaver was unmoved and I found myself miserable in his company. After a few months of communication resembling two ships passing in the night, I gave up on whatever form of friendship we were trying to nurture. Not out of animosity, but out of exhaustion. Being with the supersaver was isolating. He would not go anywhere because it could waste gas. He would not meet new people because it might take the night in a different direction than he had budgeted. For a person who could afford anything he wanted, I found myself burning bridges socially to keep up a tiresome miser who wouldn't allow me to foot the bill in a social situation either.   
The difference between myself and the supersaver was that after my bills are paid I may buy a few comfort items that have some amount of joy for my own use. Nothing too outrageous, an example of my spending style might be that I may go on a weekend trip once a year or eat out a couple of times a month. To my supersaver though, the shock could have knocked him off of his feet knowing that I did those things. As for the supersaver, his entire monthly budget was focused on retirement, retirement, retirement, and little else. The fastidious nature of his spending or lack thereof was designed for that matter alone. The thing is though, who is right? Probably neither of us. We are both two extremes of a saving spectrum. The supersaver had become a museum item amongst his own life, while I was ignoring hard truths about my future.   
Generally speaking with consideration to retirement, the given ages were initially planned when retirement was a few short years before the average age of death. By that I mean according to Google, the retirement age was set in this country in 1935, when the average life expectancy was between 58 and 62 years. Whereas now the average life expectancy is nearly into a person's eighties barring any chronic illness. Does that mean we should rethink retirement in America? In a world where ""you can't take it with you,"" is a popular phrase, how wrong am I? Is my supersaver diagnosable as spending intolerant? Or am I a frivolous nelly? After all, we don't know how long we will even live anyway, right?  
My side of the retirement debate or the biggest argument against my way of life is that in a pinch I'm screwed without a tucked away money nugget to dive into. There are those who find my spending style abhorrent, which is buying the things I need over the things I want, but not necessarily saving for that rainy day fund when it comes to quality of life purchases. Here's how I get around this issue; payment plans and spending down in an emergency. My thoughts on the supersavers are that the concept was popularized during times when banks were tight-fisted and only a select few could get a decent loan. Fast forward to today where crowdfunding, Affirm, Afterpay, and clandestine payment plans all can help just about anyone with a pulse sidestep traditional methods that keep the supersavers of the world in fear. Not that I would ever suggest that people max out their credit cards or anything, and it's always a good idea to be on the lookout for a competitive deal. For me though, it's the best way to have an enriched quality of life, which can be dicy in the world of revolving debt. A person must tiptoe a fine line of living within their means and still have meaning in their living, but it can be done.   
As much as I find my supersaver to be practical, his lifestyle of planning for the future has cost him something that I consider too dear; the enjoyment of the present. He will never be as young as he is today again. He will never have today back and the expectation of a tomorrow can never be assumed. My supersaver has stayed in on otherwise beautiful summer nights and held back when they could have jumped in on one too many things. Although his tomorrow is financially safe, his ""now"" is a loathsome existence of waiting for some lofty glory day of ""when."" As for me, I want to swim in the warm waters of Australia again before I am too much more wrinkled by the years or to make a few bad decisions for love not because of the financial impact, but for the moment, which may never happen again. Don't waste your money, but don't be a miser either, there's too much to lose from either extreme. Am I wrong?",finance
CryptoCurrency,"The government is trying to bite off more than they can chew. The government should properly regulate the banks first before trying to regulate Crypto.

The SEC and the FED should stop obsessing about Crypto and start regulating banks properly. Trying to regulate Crypto while banks are out of control is a stupid idea. It is honestly way overdue for banks to face the consequences.

As per UN reports, up to **5%** of the global GDP, equal to approximately **$4 Trillion** is laundered each year. Banks play a HUGE role in money laundering and dirty money schemes, making false reports and committing corruption. The vast majority of money laundering schemes are directly or indirectly connected to banks.

CryptoCurrency,Eliminating Irrational Token Allocation and Creating True Unit of Account with SORA,"Let me start off by saying, the SORA ecosystem can’t be explained in a single post. So, I’m going to try my best to simply introduce you to the *algorithmic decentralised central bank*. Let the rabbit hole begin.

Reduction of purchasing power, supply shock, and inflation are terms that are frequently being used by economists to describe the current global monetary conditions. These terms being used are derived from the backbone of the existing monetary system, where central banks issue fiat money into the economy based on predicted [**credit creation**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1057521912000877).

As we can currently see, there are two major issues in this practice. First of all, the present fiat currencies are not backed by any commodity and derive their value solely from the trust that the people place on it and the regulatory government.

This brings us to the second issue, centralization. Having central monetary authorities regulating the issuing of purchasing power increases the risk of human error, greed, and increases the miscalculated risk of a supply shock, thus leading to an incalculable monetary economy.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where the creation of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies comes into play. Exchange rate &amp; value stability (Storage of Value property of money) are important factors to determine Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency’s value.

We are all aware that bitcoin has been described as a hedge against inflation and as a unit of value. This is due to Bitcoins monetary policy having a fixed supply and a predictable injection and allocation via the network's computational mining system. But does this solve the issues our current financial system has?

Volatility in the price of many cryptocurrencies is often a major obstacle to their widespread adoption. The purchasing price of most cryptocurrencies is determined by secondary markets. While this is a desirable feature for a non-sovereign currency to have, crypto markets are prone to psychological influence, such as excessive fear and greed (FUD, FOMO, etc.), making most of them too volatile to be accepted by stores.

&amp;#x200B;

The XOR Token Bonding Curve solves the issue of value instability. The XOR token has all the attributes of money. It is embedded with the value of other assets; including but not limited to DAI (USD), ETH, [**VAL**](https://medium.com/sora-xor/sora-validator-rewards-419320e22df8) and [**PSWAP**](https://wiki.sora.org/polkaswap/pswap-tokenomics#the-pswap-token) tokens, making XOR a true store of value. (More assets can be added or removed via [**multi-body sortition**](https://medium.com/sora-xor/the-sora-parliament-af8184dae384)). This significantly increases the trust in the monetary value as the token’s value is influenced by the backed assets.

The token bonding curve (TBC) manages the supply of tokens via the use of smart contracts in a rational way, without the involvement of humans or a central government, to create a system that avoids the boom-bust problems of traditional economies and the deflationary economics of many cryptocurrencies.

In simple words, the TBC is essentially an infinitely liquid, decentralised central bank. At any time, you can buy newly minted XOR from the token bonding curve using some specific reserve assets or sell your XOR tokens (which are instantly burned) for one of those assets.

The TBC uses a simple model where there are two linear functions: a Buy-Price Function and a Sell-Price Function.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know what you are all thinking. *“Why would we want to mint tokens? Isn’t this one of the main issues of our current financial system?”*.

An economic system has not only money (unit of account/store of value/medium of exchange), but also a means to allocate money and control quantities of money allocated. To design a successful blockchain ecosystem for the real-world economy, the allocation of purchasing power is key to laying a strong foundation for the economy.

[The Quantity Theory of Disaggregated Credit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfdlctvHH4&amp;t=489s) (Prof. Werner, 1992, 1997) discusses that money may be injected into the economy in proportion to the productive purposes. The result is a sustainable growth without inflation and with a more equal income and wealth distribution: Money is allocated for productive, sustainable work, producing income streams and not speculation.

To summarise, SORA’s decentralised economic system seeks to improve society through responsible money creation and allocation, however, unlike existing centralised and privatised systems currently in existence, SORA does so with the community first and foremost.

Forex,Is Erdogan a wizard-rebel economist or just purely lost? Neo-Fisherists may agree with him. And what it means for USD/TRY,"Neo-Fisherists are looking to validate their beliefs as Turkish president and central bank are the first to apply this economic model, which many call “Neo-fisherism”, in real world. 

Erdogan’s goal is simple though not simple to accept and understand: “We are going to achieve low inflation with low interest rates.” 

It implies that low interest rates cause inflation to go down.

That’s exactly what Neo-Fisherists say. (note that the opposite is true as well: high interest rates = high inflation)

Hmm. 

The roots of this idea come from the Fisher equation that many are familiar with, which states that the nominal interest rate is equal to the sum of the real interest rate and inflation.

r (nonimnal) = R (real) + inflation \*

One of the most basic beliefs of economists is that if the central bank lowers nominal interest rate, inflation will increase and the real interest rate will decrease. But what if real rate of return is pretty much fixed in the long run meaning that no matter what the inflation rate is and what the central banks around world do, the real rate of return on safe short-term investments averages about 1-2% over the long run. The neutrality of money in the long run is widely known assumption in the economy world.

That’s where Neo-Fisherism comes in play. The central bank may influence the real interest rate in the short run, but over time it will revert back to its equilibrium level. Then, in order for the equation to hold, inflation has to go down if nominal interest rates are kept at a low level. For example, let’s say that the fed funds rate (key rate of American FED) is 0.25%. if real rate of return on safe investments is 1%, the only way to get 0.25% nominal rate is to add a negative number, in this case inflation, -0.75%. Arithmetics. 

I find this theory interesting though experimenting with it as we can see may be “too risky”. On the other hand, Japan has struggled to lift inflation rates despite 20+years of money stimulus. We may add European countries like Sweden and Switzerland that had negative interest rates for many years despite QE policies.

So, is it possible that the whole world has been following a “not so good” formula and Neo-Fisherists (including Turkish government) have their say or they are just purely lost? 

Also, what is your take on USD/TRY in the short term? Looks like macro factors are not looking good for TRY. 

\*

(To those who do not really understand what this equation means. Imagine that your friend wants to borrow $100 from you and gives you a piece of paper saying that he will pay you back $100 + 10% interest 1 year later. 10% interest is nominal rate in this case. Imagine that inflation rate is 2% per year. Basically your real rate of return would be 8% as inflation eats that 2% (10% - 2%). if you sum 8% (real rate) with inflation (2%) you get nominal rate of 10%, which is exactly as I wrote formula above)",finance

personalfinance,Just bought a condo and feeling stressed about money and the future…,"Hey guys. I’m a 27yo single female, and I live near and work for a large southern city. I just purchased a 800sqft 2br/1b condo this past September and have been renting a room to my little brother. I feel like I’m barely keeping my head above water at times — but maybe it’s just because of my anxiety. The change from living with my parents to living mostly independently has been really hard, and I just cannot objectively tell how I’m doing. I would really appreciate some advice.

I make $41k annually (govt job) and am expecting a raise to $50k in January 

No student, medical, or CC debt whatsoever 

I currently have $6300 in a 401a and I also contribute to a city pension (I’m unsure about addtl specifics because I don’t really understand my pension!) 

I pay ~$180 a month for health insurance through my employer and contribute $300 a year to an FSA.

I owe $14k on my car note and the interest rate is high at 6% (2018 Honda Accord) 

I have a 30y conventional mortgage at $128k. I believe the interest is around 3.2%. It was an absolute nightmare getting a mortgage for a condo so the interest rate isn’t where I wanted but… I guess what’s done is done at least for now.

I have $4200 in emergency savings — down from $6k because my cat AND I just recently had dental surgeries this month smh…

As far as budgeting: I take home $1125 each bi-weekly paycheck. Each month my mortgage/HOA is $1015, car is $315, gasoline is $100, electricity/internet $170. I haven’t really gotten a hang of what my food/household expenses are like yet but have been averaging about $800 for myself and my cat. (I really want to do better with food but when even a single damn apple costs $2 where I live, it’s harder than I anticipated). My brother pays me $700 a month for room/utilities as well. 

I know I’d be very hard pressed to do this without my brother contributing and my dad continuing to pay for my car insurance and cell phone. I think knowing I’m not 100% self-sufficient adds to the anxiety, and having had to dip into my emergency savings this month has got me rattled too. Plus there’s the fact that I’ve been sleeping on a mattress on the floor because I can’t afford a bed frame yet… that certainly does not help my confidence! 

So objectively how am I doing? Am I right to be as stressed as I am? And if so, how do I improve my situation? My immediate goal right now is to restore my emergency fund and then get it closer to $10-12k in the next 6 months.",finance

CryptoCurrency,CPI Inflation numbers being manipulated,"If you've been carefully watching the CPI numbers in order to evaluate whether or not to invest in crypto, there's a video from the CoinBureau that is an absolute must watch. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJTUVPaNJ04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJTUVPaNJ04)

The inflation numbers have been manipulated in favor of representing lower inflation.  The fact that Powell has retracted the word ""transitory"" likely means it will get worse, but if it's not being reported correctly, who knows how bad worse is going to be.

Obviously there is a strong motive to lowball CPI as it would allow governments to justify maintaining extremely low interest rates which means they can avoid interest on their national debts.  It also attempts to tone down any panic surrounding the diminishing dollar which is, well, in trouble despite what that US Currency index might tell you.

defi,How much time do you think the banks can resist DeFi?,"We all know that banks plays an important role for any economy since they have the power to create new money through loans according to FED monetary policies.

But the banks are being hitted hard by two main fronts: fintechs and DeFi. 

If you take a look at some huge banks like Wells Fargo (WFC) and Bank of America (BAC) then you will see stagnant revenues and lower loan activity. It is also expected a slow economic recovery and a significant decline in consume. WFC has already approved a capital plan to raise dividends through share buybacks. This is a desperate measure to me. They actually have no idea how to compete against unregulated fintechs with open platforms like PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ). These fintechs are experiencing over 20% of revenue CAGR. 

The problem is even more serious when it comes to DeFi. How can they compete with an “invisible” competitor? 

How can banks offer us APYs like those we get on staking?

If you are familiar with the APYs provided by some platforms like Swiss Borg, Nexo, Binance and Yield App then you will realize that there is no way a bank can fight this. How can a bank fight a 12% APY on CAKE through Binance and 18% on USDC through Yield App? It gets even tougher because these platforms evolve real fast like a living organism. For example, V2 platform for Yield App is already being tested with new features like stake and lock, redesigned interface, better tier rewards and enhanced security. How can a bank fight this?

How banks can offer us services like credit/debit cards as good as those we already can have from Coinbase, Crypterium, Crypto, SoFi and Eidoo? 

How they can offer us a complete ecosystem like DeFi does if they struggle to maintain a shitty online banking platform?

I am not saying they will be vanished, but that it will be a good fight. IMHO, DeFi will win.

cardano,"Summary of Charles Hoskinson ""I'm Back"" 2021-12-18","Charles Hoskinson is back from a meditation retreat in the Read Feather mountains of Colorado, about which he blogged.  He spoke about a number of personal issues, and about dealing with criticism. Full video is here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5vN3IRyIeU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5vN3IRyIeU)

Cardano-related content included the following:

Regarding peer to peer (P2P): Progressing, but network changes require care; must be co-designed with the consensus layer.  Harder to do in proof of stake (POS) than in proof of work (POW).  But making good progress.  Offered a shout out to stake pool operators (SPOs) who are helping out.

Regarding stake-pool operator (SPO) landscape evolution: Partial delegation coming, and probably proxy keys, enabling delegation portfolios. Also, layer-two (Hydra), sidechains, and additional service offerings will create additional revenue potential. Optimal number of stake pools will be increased (""k""); other parameters will be reevaluated. Thinking a lot about contingent staking, which allows SPOs to sign/approve stake assignments to their pool after possibly performing KYC. Other work will separate out payment addresses, enabling staking rewards to go somewhere other than the staking account.  ""Conclave"" will allow SPOs to federate, to form logical groupings (allowing, e.g., small SPs to gain rewards not as accessible to each pool individually). Will be a great year.

In response to an audience comment that Cardano is dead, Hoskinson asserted that Cardano is stronger than ever, by any metric (feature progress, adoption, etc.). He returned (at many points) to the subject of poor and badly motivated information that is making the rounds, offering examples, refuting them, and encouraging people to check their information sources and look at what is actually happening.  Hoskinson finds criticism based on false information to be the hardest for him to take. Legitimate disagreements are not the issue.

Hoskinson backtracked on his earlier goal of writing a governance book, not (yet) having researched and learned enough to do that topic justice. The topic is important, though. (Mentioned a couple of books he likes, offset 20:15/1:27:36.)

Regarding offline payments via secured chips: Work (U of Wyoming) has slowed because of COVID, etc., but continuing.

Regarding difficulty of programming Cardano smart contracts: Functional programming paradigm is not as hard as sometimes claimed. Programming Cardano smart contracts is a ""six out of ten."" Hoskinson asked, rhetorically, what CS program the naysayers graduated from. Responded to the assertion that Cardano has a PR problem by saying PR wasn't his focus. Cardano needs to grow at the right rate, and PR should happen organically and in decentralized ways. Added that seven PR people are being hired, though.

Regarding attention given to Meld and SundaeSwap by IOG: Conversations are happening with three-four dozen providers (e.g., via IOG dApp developer programs), and work with Meld and SundaeSwap shouldn't be understood as a special endorsement. But IOG does want to help ensure that first-wave, high-profile defi/dApp product rollouts go well and where possible encourage things like open sourcing. IOG is the best positioned entity in the world to do this.

Regarding publicizing new projects: Advised starting with Catalyst, making proposals, gaining social capital.  That's what Catalyst is for.

Regarding accessibility: Without giving a definitive answer, Hoskinson went through a variety of accessibility issues - visual, cognitive, aural, etc. - and possible responses, standards, etc. He spoke about the natural human tendency to design for oneself and one's neighbor, about the need for empathy and awareness, and about possible connections with the Cardano certification process that is being instituted.

Hoskinson talked briefly about input endorsers, which follow pipelining; TPS rates. Referred to the original Ouroboros paper.  He also talked at length about biotech/medical challenges and issues, (mostly) unrelated to Cardano (blockchain comes in generally in areas like records, DNA registries, etc.).

He talked about a variety of personal issues and interests, also not closely related to Cardano, most of which I have not summarized here (this being a Cardano subreddit, r/cardano).",cryptocurrency

Specifically, housing costs vs savings vs interest rates vs inflation. I realize no one knows the future but I am trying to make the best decisions with the information we have available to determine when I should consider pulling the trigger.

My wife(33) and I(38) currently rent but have made the decision that we want to own. Our lease is up next November. I plan on going through the mortgage approval process with only my name to ensure we can afford everything with only my income. Her 30k annual income would be used for helping with bills, investing and play money. She has approximately 4k in student loans and 3k left on her car loan. Her credit score is 801.

My salary: 120k base + up to 20% annual bonus (bonus paid in March)
Debt: zero
Savings: 12k
Crypto: 5k
Monthly Savings goal: 1500-2000
Roth 401k: 110k - contribution of 15% with additional 3% employer match 
Roth IRA: 13500
Brokerage: 13000
Current rent: 1430
My Credit Score: 814

Single family homes which we like in the area range between 400-550k. We also like some townhomes which range between 330-380k. These are all generally newer construction. We don’t want a fixer upper. 

This salary is relatively new (this past August). Prior was 92500. Additionally, monthly expenses are an area which I am focusing to reduce to save more.

Questions:
- Should I consider reducing my 401k contribution for now until I have a good amount for a down payment? I would reduce to 6% to get the 3% company match.
- Does it make sense to pull the trigger with current savings and pulling money out of a mix of the other accounts? Suggestions on amount and from which accounts to leverage?
- Everything I’m seeing says the first interest rate hike will occur in April. Is that pretty much the worst time to buy?
- Any other advice on how to best tackle this situation?

I appreciate your knowledge and suggestions.

Hi! So my wife has over $300k in student loans, spread throughout way too many micro loans and some larger loans. They all have different interest rates, ranging between 3-8%, so the monthly payment is just ridiculous. 

Now that we are about to buy a house, it’s an absolute necessity to lower her payments. The only thing is the couple places she tried to consolidate through keep saying her debt to income ratio is too high. I took a look at the numbers and her DTI would be way lower, so she would actually be able to refinance, if she didn’t include our rent payments. 

We have joint accounts and my income alone can cover our rent, along with other expenses. So my ultimate question is, would it be possible to exclude our rent payment from her applications so she would be eligible to refinance?",finance

defi,"Guys, I am confused — what is the deal with Auto-farms, Auto-staking and damn Reinvest button? | Canary Academy Article","*First of all, we’d like to apologise for not covering these specific options at Canary platform in a comprehensive manner as yet since the volume of questions has been sustainably high and the need was quite obvious. We are fixing the omission by this short article explaining how simple staking and farming is different from auto-staking and auto-farming and how the hell to use this Reinvest button.* 

[https://miro.medium.com/max/525/1\*piflNw4PiyVyg-xr8xopvQ.png](https://miro.medium.com/max/525/1*piflNw4PiyVyg-xr8xopvQ.png)

If you are new to DeFi we strongly recommend first to onboard yourself on the fundamentals via few [easy reads by Canary Academy](https://blog.canary.exchange/canary-academy-521a52500e0d). Those will help you build the right basis so then any new knowledge (like this article) will be processed much easier as you will know where to fit it in the growing DeFi expertise in your head. Should we rather use ‘connect the dots’? Anyway.

We assume that you are familiar with simple staking and farming. Staking is locking your tokens in the platform to earn more tokens (very similar to depositing cash in the bank to earn an interest… that interest… ok, let’s not go into that). That helps the platform:

* *influence demand-supply thing as higher rewards lead to more people wishing to lock their tokens in the staking contracts thus a certain volume of tokens is removed from the market leading to a higher demand and vice versa*
* *enable governance and loyalty programs where people who lock their tokens in the staking contract receive rights with the corresponding weights to influence rules and parameters that platform operates according to (yes, enter DAO — we’ll talk about that in the next release) and receive privileged access to certain benefits*

Ah, well done, quick-witted! Yes those two bullet points are connected… I suppose we cannot get away from ‘connecting the dots’ thing today. By the way, some platforms use staking to provide assets lending and borrowing services but usually this comes along with additional staking conditions, e.g. bonding periods.

Farming is staking LP tokens that you get for [providing liquidity](https://blog.canary.exchange/can-you-make-a-living-with-defi-e67d6fa17dd4). Staking LP tokens usually yields much higher rewards. This helps the platform to attract liquidity into swap pools or vaults so then others can use this platform as a [decentralised exchange](https://blog.canary.exchange/how-decentralised-exchange-dex-works-part-i-533804fa1f2a).

At Canary staking and farming rewards are accumulated every few seconds so you can see them growing in your pool just staring at the screen for a few minutes (‘Your unclaimed CNR’).

[https://miro.medium.com/max/525/1\*DoNoU5oUNrxSly4nn5VaLA.png](https://miro.medium.com/max/525/1*DoNoU5oUNrxSly4nn5VaLA.png)

Rewards are measured in Annual Percentage Rate (APR) or Annual Percentage Yield (APY).

[https://miro.medium.com/max/525/1\*tRvbDoXZY8gZBGbKmOhwJg.png](https://miro.medium.com/max/525/1*tRvbDoXZY8gZBGbKmOhwJg.png)

APR is a simple interest rate (your reward is accumulated separately). APY is a compound interest rate (when your earned reward is added to the initially staked amount so then your next reward is calculated based on the slightly increased staked base). You can read more about the magic of the compound interest or APY [here](https://blog.canary.exchange/can-you-make-a-living-with-defi-e67d6fa17dd4).

So when you see a simple staking pool or farming pool with APY rate shown then do not think this is the rate you are going to receive by default. You can achieve this rate of return only if you withdraw your accumulated rewards and add them to the initially deposited amount manually at least once per every 24 hours. In case of farming you have to follow few additional steps to convert your rewards to the liquidity pair tokens and then add them to the liquidity pool to mint LP tokens which only then you can add to the initial farm deposit. Thus simple staking and farming pools rather should show you APR rates.

Ok, it seems like you have already got it that auto-staking and auto-farming pools are those where the rewards are added to the initially staked deposit automatically so you avoid the manual hustle.

&gt;*Ah, do not forget that each manual step, i.e. rewards withdrawal and adding them back to the deposit is considered as a separate transaction thus you will be asked to pay transaction fee for each step. Thank whatever saint person or spirit you believe in that we are on Avalanche!*

Therefore auto-mode also saves you transaction fees. Alright, seems like we are all clear now about the difference. Note that in case of auto-staking or auto-farming you will not be able to claim the accumulated rewards separately. You will need to withdraw everything and then leave whatever you need in the wallet and deposit the rest back to the pool. Thus if you need to claim rewards everyday to pay your bills probably auto-mode is not quite handy for this.

Now let’s sort out this reinvest button puzzle. First thing you need to know is that you can ignore that button altogether and you will be totally fine with your auto-staking or auto-farming. This button is really just to add a pinch of fun into the process.

[https://miro.medium.com/max/525/1\*60P7ulJH4II\_9\_xbCVraEw.png](https://miro.medium.com/max/525/1*60P7ulJH4II_9_xbCVraEw.png)

As mentioned above, the smart contract will add your rewards back to the initial deposit, i.e. reinvest automatically once per 24 hours. You can see the accumulated rewards up to the given moment in the ‘Next Reinvest’ section. Note that this is the amount of reward for the whole pool, i.e. not only for you. When reinvestment happens the accumulated amount is distributed among all stakers based on the amount they deposited (i.e. their share in the pool).

Reinvestment can happen more frequently — once someone who deposited the assets into the same pool decides to click that reinvest button. The accumulated amount is then distributed to all stakers and gets reset to zero. Then the cycle starts again until someone clicks the button. If no one clicks it during 24 hours the smart contract will do it.

That someone who clicks it initiates the off-cycle transaction thus that someone will need to pay the transaction fee. For all other stakers that distribution will not cost anything, i.e. only that someone will pay the fee and others will benefit from that (because the intensity of compounding rewards will increase with no additional cost for them).

Then why someone would click it at all? Because of the bonus.

[https://miro.medium.com/max/525/1\*oh0YVhjzdCogsbGDO9XTmw.png](https://miro.medium.com/max/525/1*oh0YVhjzdCogsbGDO9XTmw.png)

 You can hover the pointer over the ‘Reinvest’ button to see how much additional reward you and only you will get on top of staking rewards for pressing that button. Other stakers will not get that additional 66.54 CNR. Then you can compare that with the transaction fee and see if it is profitable. For that you just click ‘Reinvest’ and you will be prompted to confirm the transaction. 

[https://miro.medium.com/max/525/1\*sSd6oTqQzpgOP9HgIl1pzQ.png](https://miro.medium.com/max/525/1*sSd6oTqQzpgOP9HgIl1pzQ.png)

So if 66.54 CNR is worth more than 0.0086 AVAX fee than you earn something and help others. If not, you just click ‘Reject’.

Hope we managed to explain this in sufficient details and now you are comfortable with the auto-thing. Please do not hesitate to share this article in any forums you see someone asking the similar questions to earn some karma and gratitude, this is royalty-free.

1. Here is the coming onslaught of Cardano dApps summed up in just six lines. [https://twitter.com/DCdoso/status/1461340919731523586](https://twitter.com/DCdoso/status/1461340919731523586)
2. Pavia says they will drop the extended land map next week and that it will include some new land types. [https://twitter.com/Pavia\_io/status/1461331532069711876](https://twitter.com/Pavia_io/status/1461331532069711876)
3. The smaller “fix-it” bill that would attempt to remedy the bad crypto language in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill has now been introduced in the House of Representatives. [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1461317078175072263](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1461317078175072263)

8. Charles dropped a new AMA where he mentioned very briefly that they are actually going to look into read-only UTxOs. If it’s possible to have these types of UTxOs while preserving determinism, it would be a big change since transactions must currently consume inputs. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJcVEJ1a6eg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJcVEJ1a6eg) Some background reading on read-only UTxOs: [https://github.com/Emurgo/Emurgo-Research/blob/master/smart-contracts/Unlocking%20The%20Potential%20Of%20The%20UTXO%20Model.md](https://github.com/Emurgo/Emurgo-Research/blob/master/smart-contracts/Unlocking%20The%20Potential%20Of%20The%20UTXO%20Model.md)

18. Charles drops a video on the eToro user limitations. It sounds like IOHK knew nothing about this. Interacting with exchanges falls in the Cardano Foundation’s wheelhouse. It’s unclear whether the CF knew anything. He also pointed out it’s very interesting that an old line exchange like Bitstamp has decided to LIST Cardano during this same period. Charles also mentioned that they haven’t seen any regulatory activity on IOHK’s end. eToro is a relatively small source of liquidity for Cardano and there shouldn’t be much of an impact. [https://youtu.be/WYQTkf8ndpY](https://youtu.be/WYQTkf8ndpY)
19. The Pavia map is expanding on Wednesday, Nov. 24th at 1500 UTC with a second land sale. [https://twitter.com/Pavia\_io/status/1463153632484941834](https://twitter.com/Pavia_io/status/1463153632484941834)

24. The minutes from the Fed’s November FOMC meeting have been published and indicate they are ready to taper asset purchases and raise rates to combat inflation.

32. The Cardano Community takes a moment to enjoy contemplating the circumstance that there will never need to be a “magical Cardano 2” in order for our blockchain to survive. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1465089315340488704](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1465089315340488704)

58. The heads of Circle, FTX, Bitfury, Paxos, Stellar Development Foundation, and Coinbase appeared before the House Financial Services Committee. As expected, the questions from some of the House Committee members belied a misplaced focus on things like terrorist financing while others understood the need to regulate crypto appropriately so that crypto innovation is not forced offshore. There was significant focus on stablecoins due to the President’s Working Group placing so much focus there. One representative also chose to focus heavily on the energy consumption of Bitcoin mentioning coal power plants coming back on line to fuel Bitcoin mining. The witnesses from the crypto industry seemed to focus on dispelling misconceptions and also pushing for a single crypto focused regulatory body as opposed to the fragmented regulation that is typical in Washington. [https://youtu.be/ohp-Trq4HU4](https://youtu.be/ohp-Trq4HU4)

CryptoCurrency,"An even juicer dip, what we buying fam 😛😛😛","Bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices have fallen sharply this week, with the combined value of the crypto market losing almost $1 trillion since its peak in November.

The bitcoin price has fallen to lows of just over $45,000 per bitcoin, a more than 30% decline from an all-time high of almost $70,000 last month. Meanwhile, other major cryptocurrencies, including ethereum, Binance’s BNB, solana, cardano and Ripple’s XRP have also struggled—all dropping double-digit percentages from their highs.

Now, as bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrencies fall in the face of global central bank policy tightening along with global stock markets and other assets, the chief executive of the U.S.-based Kraken crypto exchange has warned he thinks the bitcoin price could fall dramatically in 2022.

A lot of people see anything under $40,000 as a buying opportunity,” Kraken CEO Jesse Powell said in an interview with Bloomberg this week, adding the bitcoin price could drop to below $40,000 this winter.

“I was personally buying when we dipped back close to $30,000, a few months ago. A lot of people have some dry powder on the sidelines just waiting to come back in at rock bottom prices.”

Earlier this year, Powell made headlines when he predicted the bitcoin price could hit $100,000 before the end of 2021.

“It’s hard to know where [the bitcoin price] goes,” Powell said, but couching that he’s still bullish on bitcoin in the long term. “When you look at a long-term trendline of bitcoin and it’s just up consistently. I always tell people, ‘If you think about buying bitcoin, think about it as a five-year plus investment

Earlier this month, other bitcoin and crypto market watchers began calling out some of the more ambitious bitcoin price predictions. “$100,000 by the end of the year is a difficult prediction to make. I think $100,000 could be in target in 2022 but this year, I’m not so sure,” Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan said in an interview.

Others are taking a watch-and-see approach to the bitcoin price as the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world move to taper their Covid-19 pandemic stimulus measures.

“The downward trajectory pertaining to bitcoin currently remains intact as market participants continue to price in fundamentals,” Tammy Da Costa, analyst at DailyFX, wrote in emailed comments.

“For much of this year, rising inflation has supported bitcoin prices allowing it to climb to yet another all-time high just last month. However, with global policymakers now expressing a more hawkish tone, bitcoin prices have stabilized above $45,000 which continues to provide support for the imminent move.”

This week, the Federal Reserve said it’s expecting to raise interest rates three times in 2022 and will accelerate the winding down of its huge bond-buying policy in the face of soaring inflation that’s hit a 40-year high.

Much like gold and other safe-haven assets, investors have used bitcoin against rising inflation,” added Da Costa.

“With higher interest rates and a faster pace of tapering now expected to proceed, further rate hikes may pose as an additional catalyst for price action over the longer term. From a technical aspect, the fact that prices have retraced by over 20% since the November high confirms that bitcoin has entered into a bear market. Although price action is currently trading within a well-defined range, bulls may struggle to regain control over the systemic, prominent trend, at least for now.”",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Is this refinance worth it?,"First time posting. We purchased a home in June in California and got a 3.125% interest rate.

Joe Manchin said he wouldn’t support the plan. Contracts linked to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 544 points, or 1.54%, S&amp;P 500 futures declined 1.62% and Nasdaq futures were down 1.63%.

***The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was at 1.371% after falling Friday to 1.401%, the lowest yield in two weeks.*** 

Asian shares posted steep losses and European stocks were tumbling as many countries warned they could institute fresh restrictions as the highly contagious Omicron variant of Covid-19 was quickly spreading. The Netherlands returned to full lockdown. Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden’s chief medical advisor to Biden, said he expects coronavirus cases in the U.S. to reach record highs this winter, driven by the Omicron variant. He said he expects “significant stress” on hospital systems in some regions of the country.

Economists at Goldman Sachs cut their forecast for U.S. growth for 2022, citing Manchin’s rejection of the Biden spending bill.The Build Back Better bill’s “enactment had already looked likea close call and in light of Manchin’s comments we are adjustingour forecast to remove the assumption that BBB will become law,”Goldman’s economists wrote in a report Sunday. “A failure to pass BBB has negative growth implications.”

***Oil prices fell sharply on worries that fresh Covid restrictions would reduce demand. Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell 4.1% to $70.50 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude dropped 4.6% to $67.47 a barrel.***

Stocks fell last week on worries over a resurgence of Covid-19 and the Federal Reserve’s announcement that it would accelerate the end of its bond-buying program and its projection of three interest-rate increases next year, moves that will be made to rein in the highest inflation rates since 1982.

CryptoCurrency,Millennial millionaires love Bitcoin,"As the crypto market continues its rollercoaster ride, a CNBC poll paints a clear picture. Millennial millionaires love Bitcoin.

The crypto market is a constant up and down - and today is no exception. Bitcoin's chart performance from the last seven days resembles a roller coaster ride.

Bitcoin's price decline has also had an impact on large parts of the altcoin sector. The ten most valuable cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are all in the red.

However, the volatility is hardly hurting the popularity of Bitcoin and Co. - quite the opposite. If you look at a new survey by the US TV channel CNBC, the picture is clear - especially among Millennial millionaires.

Moreover, 53 percent of Millennial millionaires stated that more than half of their assets consisted of crypto assets.

Nearly 45 percent of Millennial millionaires cited concerns about rising inflation as a reason for the high investment share. However, the phenomenon of demonetization will be a constant companion, according to a majority of the respondents. 

However, the young wealthy weighed the negative consequences differently than their less well-heeled fellow citizens. While the majority of the population is primarily afraid of price increases as a result of inflation, Millennial millionaires are worried about rising interest rates, as these would have a direct impact on their crypto investments.

CryptoCurrency,Personnel carousel - Binance.US recruits new legal expert from Intel,"There's a new hire at Binance.US: a bona fide antitrust expert from Intel named Sidney Majalya.

Binance's U.S. subsidiary announced Thursday that it has hired Intel's top compliance executive as the crypto exchange's chief risk officer. Sidney Majalya is a former federal antitrust prosecutor. He previously headed the compliance offices of Oracle and Uber, among others. He takes up his new post at Binance.US in January, according to his tweet.

""In light of our focus to make Binance.US the most compliant and consumer-centric digital asset platform in the U.S., I know the organization will benefit greatly from Sidney's vast experience, talent and judgment"" - , writes Brian Shroder, CEO of Binance.US

Binance.US gets serious about regulation

As the former Legal and Chief Compliance Officer at Intel, Majalya should be well-versed in antitrust, anti-bribery and other legal compliance regulations. Moreover, earlier in his career, he served as a trial attorney in the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice from 2004 to 2014. 

Majalya's hiring at Binance.US is seen as a clear indication that the exchange is serious about compliance. This could be crucial as U.S. lawmakers continue to put pressure on the nascent crypto industry, which market watchers say is under-regulated. But there are definitely differing views within the U.S. government on this.

CryptoCurrency,"To the 101million who are posting about Devs not doing enough to ""pump"" up the value of their invested coin/token","TLDR: Please do not blame or disrespect the Developers of your chosen coin/token if the value is not increasing to your desired expectations. As it not solely the fault of the Devs as there are many factors in play when it comes to pricing!

I think it is easy to forget fundamentally:

&gt;""The value of anything is determined by supply and demand. **If demand increases faster than supply, the price goes up** ""

Therefore, please do not assume the negative correlation between the price and your investment is solely down to the Devs not implementing price-increasing initiatives/technologies to help ""boost"" the value of said token/coin.

Additionally, other factors that impact price include:

* Node count
   * This is said to be a good indicator of the value of a cryptocurrency, as this is a measurement of how many active wallets exist on the network. The more active wallets, the more demand/trade is likely.
* Institutional and retail Demand
   * over the past 2 years (since lockdown), there has been a lot of media spotlight on crypto which has prompted a lot of retail buys, and in turn causing a potent artificial demand for crypto in the short term - some/majority of these retail buyers will sell when then market is down, further adding to the ""dip"".
   * More institutions are looking to capitalise on the crypto ""boom"", however, these are also the same people who buy big and sell big when they need to offset losses/have fear etc.,.
* Mass Adoption
   * prices increase if a coin/token gains momentum and the projects are widely adopted
* Inflation of fiat currencies
   * if value of the fiat currency drops, then in theory the value of BTC would go up in respect to that currency. Thereforem you are able to get more of that currency with your BTC thanks to the artificially low interest rates.
* Cost of production
   * there is a correlation between direct and opportunity costs and the overall value of the cryptocurrency.
* Marketing / Communication 
   * Having a strong marketing campaign can help get the word out about the project and in return create demand. 
   * Poor or non-existent marketing would mean the value may move sideways drop as people lose interest as they assume a project is dead.
* Regulation
   * if the governments get their way and cryptocurrency is regulated, prices will be impacted by this and we will most likely see an initial drop in price.

Thank you for allowing me to rant.

The widening financial instability fueled concerns about adverse spillovers to other parts of the economy, from a further boost to inflation, which is already above 20% and eroding households’ purchasing power and savings, to industrialists sounding the alarm about damage to production and investments.

The longer the currency disorder persists in Turkey, the more a reversal in the central bank’s interest rate policy goes from being both necessary and sufficient to just necessary.

stocks,$UAN - 2022 $60 Yield Distributions Multibagger,"Disclaimer: I own options and shares of $UAN and have been in $UAN since March of 2021.

This is not financial or stock advice, but my analysis of the company.

I’m going to be explaining why CVR Partners ($UAN) is an interesting company in today’s market.

Their Website: https://investors.cvrpartners.com/


**Glossary for Clarity:**

$UAN - Referring to the security/stock

UAN - Referring to the product Urea-Ammonium Nitrate

CVR / CVR Partners - Referring to the company

Sidenote: UAN is sold as UAN28 and UAN32, referring to the nitrogen content of 28% or 32%.


**What does CVR Partners do?**

CVR Partners is a fertilizer commodity company that produces two products for sale. These two products are Urea-Ammonium Nitrate and Anhydrous Ammonia. These two products are used as nitrogen fertilizers in the agriculture industry, their largest market. They have two plants that produce these products. One is located in Coffeyville, Kansas. The other is located in East Dubuque, Illinois. The plant in Coffeyville uses petroleum coke as their input to produce Ammonia and UAN. The plant in East Dubuque uses natural gas as an input product, and can produce a variable amount of UAN and Ammonia, therefore they can sell whatever is more profitable at the time.


**Brief History of UAN and Ammonia pricing and supply:**

Prices of UAN and Ammonia were at quite profitable levels for CVR in 2012, which is reflected by $UAN price at the time. After 2012, the prices of these chemicals entered a downturn. Lots of production came online around the world driving prices of fertilizers down. UAN went from a high price of around $300/ton in 2012 to the lowest point of around $120/ton in 2019. Ammonia also went from its highs of $800/ton in 2012 to around $280/ton in 2019. However, covid has caused rippling supply chain issues around the world, and fertilizer is no exception to that.


Because of these global supply chain issues, costs of commodities worldwide have surged. UAN currently sits at around $600/ton and Ammonia sits at around $1350/ton, dwarfing 2012 prices, and there is no end in sight to price increases as there is a global shortage of nitrogen fertilizer products. The cost of natural gas worldwide, especially in Europe, has skyrocketed. Almost all nitrogen fertilizer plants, other than CVR’s Coffeyville plant, use natural gas as the feedstock. This has resulted in nitrogen fertilizer plants worldwide shutting down, including almost all European plants, as the cost of natural gas in Europe has seen an exponential increase due to supply constraints, making production of any fertilizers via natural gas feedstock untenable. Gas prices in the USA will not surge nearly as high, as the US is the largest producer of gas, whereas Europe has to rely on Russian gas lines for their supplies, and they cannot get along with Putin’s regime. These supply chain issues may now be further exacerbated with the Omicron variant of COVID spreading like crazy, resulting in more supply chain issues, extending the high European gas prices.


**Chart of European Gas Prices:**

**You can read more about the surging prices of fertilizer as well as see price history here:**

https://www.dtnpf.com/agriculture/web/ag/crops/article/2021/12/15/nitrogen-fertilizer-prices-continue


Due to CVR’s Coffeyville production plant using petroleum coke as a feedstock, it has a natural price advantage to traditional nitrogen fertilizer plants that use natural gas as a feedstock, as petroleum coke is a significantly less expensive feedstock on a per ton of fertilizer produced basis. Coffeyville produces about 1300 tons of Ammonia per day and 3000 tons of UAN per day. East Dubuque produces about 1075 tons of Ammonia per day and 1100 tons of UAN per day. It is clear from the above numbers that CVR’s larger producer of UAN, Coffeyville, has a huge cost advantage compared to other producers of UAN worldwide.


Furthermore, UAN has anti dumping import tariffs pending in the USA, which were petitioned by CF Industries, a much larger nitrogen producer in the US. Potash anti dumping tariffs were also successfully petitioned by another company in the US, one that escapes my memory. Potash is another fertilizer that is not nitrogen based, but has and also still is rising in price.

**CVR Partners Company Structure:**

CVR Partners is a Limited Partnership in a Master Limited Partnership (MLP) structure. The General Partner is CVR Energy (Ticker $CVI). CVR Energy is controlled by Carl Icahn’s Icahn Enterprises, and CVR Energy owns approximately 33% of CVR Partners ($UAN). In this way, Carl Icahn has control over CVR Energy, and also has an interest in increasing share price, and increasing distributions from CVR Partners.


This is a beneficial partnership because CVR Energy produces petroleum coke, and CVR Partners gets their petroleum coke from CVR Energy. Because they are in this partnership, transactions are smooth, consistent, and efficient. There is reduced cost for both since CVR’s Coffeyville facility is located in the same exact place as CVR Energy’s oil refinery.


CVR Partners has a policy of distributing all available cash generated each quarter as distributions to unit holders. As such, available cash as determined by management at the end of each quarter will be distributed evenly between all unit holders. There are about 10.68 million shares/units outstanding (CVR Energy owns 33% of this number). Because this is an MLP, there are multiple tax implications that must be taken into consideration that will not be gone over here, as it is too complex for this analysis. However, do not purchase these units in a retirement account.


**CVR Partners Acquisition of Rentech and Debt:**

In late 2015-2016, CVR partners acquired Rentech Nitrogen in a 533 million dollar deal. Rentech Nitrogen became CVR’s current East Dubuque facility. This increased their debt by around 500 million, and they have had this debt ever since, due to the downturn in fertilizer pricing hitting their ability to pay back the debt hard. Because of this they have around 645 million dollars worth of debt today. Originally, this debt was due in 2023, with an interest rate of 9.25%, and recently 550 million of this debt was refinanced to 2028, with an interest rate of 6.125%. The remaining $95 million due in 2023 was kept, with a plan to pay it off over the next two years at a rate of $15 million each quarter. So far, two partial redemptions have been made at 15 million dollars each, and so there is only $65 million of this 2023 debt left. At the current rate, the 2023 debt will be gone around the end of 2022, beginning of 2023. Though the remaining 2028 debt is still not ideal, it is definitely positive that it was refinanced at a much lower rate and five years out. Lastly, CVR Partners plans to redeem new carbon tax credits in January of 2022. Currently, these credits are estimated to be around $50 million at least, but could potentially be more based on how they are calculated. This will also be applied to debt, and may pay off the 2023 debt faster, or be applied to 2028 debt.


**Calculating Profits and Distributions &amp; Determining a Fair Value for Future 2022 TTM:**

Before going into the future profits, I want to briefly review 2021 distributions:


Distributions for 2021:

Q1: $0

Q2: $1.72

Q3: $2.93

Q4: Estimated at least $4 (Conservative)


CVR is finally getting the higher market prices for their products, as CVR typically presells their products 3-6 months in advance for Q3 and Q4, whereas for Q1 and Q2, they mostly get spot prices. We can see clear proof from the above that their pricing is improving. Now we must estimate for their next year's distributions. To do this I will make some assumptions as listed below:


Production of Ammonia per day = 2375 tons * 365 days

= 866,875 * 95% utilization rate

= 823,000 tons of Ammonia


Production of UAN per day = 4100 tons * 365 days

= 1,496,500 * 95% utilization rate

= 1,421,000 tons of UAN


Because there is a scheduled turnaround for Quarter 3 of 2022, we can expect to lose 8.33% of overall yearly production, as we will lose a third of Q3 production.


Therefore: 1-.0833 = 0.9167


823,000 tons/Ammonia * 0.9167 = 754,000 tons / Ammonia

1,421,000 tons/UAN * 0.9167 = 1,302,000 tons / UAN


Ammonia conversion to UAN rate was between 65%-70% for 2019-2020. Because of higher Ammonia prices, we will assume a lower conversion rate of 65%. We are then left with:


754,000 tons * .35 = 264,000 tons / Ammonia


Lastly, we assume the price for UAN is $550/ton and Ammonia is $1200/ton.


264,000 tons / Ammonia * $1,200 / ton = $316,800,000

1,302,000 tons / UAN * $550 / ton = $716,100,000


Total: $1,032,900,000 from sales of Ammonia and UAN not including any costs


Lastly, we need to figure out the cost of feedstock and production and operations.

Conservatively, we can estimate:

Cost of Revenues: $300 Million

Selling General &amp; Admin Expenses: $25 Million

Depreciation &amp; Amortization: $75 Million


Therefore Operating Income is: $632 Million

There are 10.68 million units: We get about $60 in distributions per share.

This averages $15 per quarter.

At a 10% yield, a historical yield for this company, we get around $600 per share for 2022 TTM.

At a 20% yield, we get around $300 per share for 2022 TTM.

While I did not calculate EBITDA, at a historical 7x-10x EV/EBITDA, this company would be valued somewhere around $300+ easily.


**Why Consider $UAN:**

As inflation continues at its current rate, and commodity prices increase, this company is a great hedge against inflation. It’s highly dependent on the price of UAN and Ammonia, and with the prices skyrocketing with no end in sight, combined with the global shortage, global supply chain issues, and increasing interest rates, this is one of the safest companies to invest in currently. If you buy shares right now, and prices stay the same, nothing goes wrong, you will get around 75% of your money back from distributions alone in a year’s time. This doesn’t account for share price appreciation, which will certainly happen if/when they throw off all this cash in distributions. Prices of UAN and Ammonia also certainly have more room to rise, as gas prices in Europe continue higher and global supply chains continue to be constrained.",finance

personalfinance,Pay off all debt now (except new mortgage) or use all house sale money to invest?,"I have about $12k of car loans and $23k in student loans right now. I just bought a new house as well. I am expecting about $120k in profit after selling my house. I could invest all the proceeds and continue to make payments on both debts or just pay off everything and use the remainder to invest, but I’ll have 35k less to invest. Is it worth it to use all the proceeds to invest or pay off those debts and invest the remainder? My car loan interest rate is a little less than 3% at a credit union, and I’ll have to start making payments on student loans again at an interest rate of 6%. I’m in my early 30s with an income slightly above $100k. Any help will be appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,Should I pay off my student loans in one lump sum or refinance and pay minimums?,"Background: I have &lt;15k in federal student loans at 6.8%. I graduated in 2020 and currently have a stable medium-high income job and an emergency fund. I max my 401k, IRA contributions. Other debts: 10k car loan, 20k of wife's student loans (not part of the question).

 With forbearance ending soon, I originally planned to do a one time lump payment and be done with it all. The psychological benefit of paying off the loans immediately doesn't mean much to me - I'm confident in getting these paid off one way or another. I am mostly interested in making a sound financial decision. 

I'm now thinking of another option: Refinance and pay the minimum, invest the rest of the cash I originally set aside for the lump sum. Between 1) expected higher than average inflation and 2) expected increases in interest rates (and presumably nominal returns) is this a better option financially? If so, would it be better to refinance at 2% for 5 year or 3% for 20 year?",finance
personalfinance,Pay off personal loan or large portion of auto loan?,"Come early next year, February or so, I will have about $10k coming to me and I would like to use it to better my finances. I currently have two loans, one is an auto loan and one is a personal loan I took out for refinancing some credit card debt. Long story short on the auto loan is that I rolled some negative equity into the loan from  my last vehicle (yes I know..) and owe ~$40k on a truck that’s worth about $32k. This is a 72 month term at 4.59%. The personal loan has about $3500 left to be replayed over another 20 months at 9.00%.

I am considering two options. The first option would be to take the whole $10k and pay it against the truck, at which point I would have a little bit of equity in it. I would then look to refinance the vehicle at a lower interest rate and probably with a 60 month term. I have ran the numbers on this and my monthly payments would go from $630 to $530 even with the shorter term, assuming a 3.00% interest rate. I’m not sure if this is a realistic rate or not, my credit score is about 760.

The second option would be for me to pay off the $3500 personal loan which currently has a $190 monthly payment, and bank the rest of the money. I am leaning toward this option, the way I see it is that the newly “freed up” $190 per month could then be put toward the truck. I also do not currently have much of an emergency fund, so if I go with this option, I’d have about $6500 leftover to put in the bank. 

I’m just curious to see what your opinions are. Am I thinking about this correctly? Are there any better alternatives that I haven’t thought of? Thanks.",finance

CryptoCurrency,"Deflation, Crypto &amp; Economics","Every week or so I see a post talking about the evils of deflation, and how no currency which did not provide for infinite inflation, would never be adopted as a currency. I'm tired of these takes, so here is the opposite view, that deflation, like inflation, can be good/bad, depending on how it happens. 

What is deflation: Deflation is the general lowering of the price level. In other words, the money you have is accruing more purchasing power over time. 

What can cause deflation: Deflation can be caused by a contracting of the money supply, this is generally a painful experience, that is unexpected, and is typically bad for the economy in the short term. However, in an economy where the amount of money is fixed, deflation can also be caused by increases in productivity, this type of deflation is very different. 

When we talk about deflation in terms of crypto, the latter is what we are speaking of, the price level lowering, as a result of increases in productivity. That's it. 

Now why are some people afraid of this? Well, they take the mistaken view, that inflation is necessary to encourage people to spend their money, in other words ""without the artificial debasement of currency, the economy would not function"" This is patently absurd. I will next take on some of the more frequent claims about deflation below.

""If the currency is deflating, everyone would just hoard their money!"" 

This is both untrue, and stupid. If a currency is deflating, lets say at an avg. 2% annually, *Then any economic transaction which takes place, must be worth more than a 2% increase in value of the money spent in a years time*. For most people, in most situations, this will not be a pressing issue. And we see this today in choices between investing, and spending. Why would you buy the new PS5, when you could invest that money, and get 5% return on it in a year? Well, because the value that the PS5 generates for me now, is worth more than the price of the PS5 + 5% in a year. This is no different than how cost/benefit evaluations would work in a deflationary setting, is the value of what I am spending on worth more to me than that money I spend + X% deflation in a year, the answer is often yes. 

To further kick this dead horse, lets use an example of a real product, in an economic setting of 2% deflation annually. 

An Xbox - \~ $1,000 spent today and you get an Xbox to enjoy for the next X amount of years, or, $1,020 in a year? **You are giving up 20$ in a year, for an Xbox to enjoy for next few years**. This level of opportunity cost is by no means going to break the economy. Now obviously for larger purchases, the cost is going to increase, but then again, so will the benefits derived from those purchases. 

&amp;#x200B;

""If the currency is deflating no one will invest!""

Once again, wrong and stupid. If the currency is deflating, it does not mean that no one will invest, it simply means that those investments will need to be able to provide a return greater than the deflation rate. This only means that those available loan-able funds will be directed to those projects which are most economically beneficial, which provide the greatest returns. 

An extension of this is in interest rates on loans, Let's look loans with USD today for example. If you take out a loan from a bank, and the base interest rate of that loan is say 5%, then the bank will charge you a total interest rate of around 7%. %5 for the base loan, and 2% to adjust for inflation. 

This same process would take place in a deflationary environment. 5% for the base loan, minus 2% for deflation, for a total rate of around 3%. 

Now, in all of this, I have assumed a predictable rate of deflation, this is intentional, as whether you are talking about inflation, or deflation, too much of it, and at unexpected intervals is a very bad thing for the economy. However, to say that ""deflation is bad prima facie"" is simply stupid. 

I will also add that more measured claims of ""deflation would reduce spending and investment"" are likely true, however this is not the same as saying they are bad. There are opportunity costs to everything, including spending and investing. **To say that the natural rate would be lower, is not to say that the lower rate is undesirable**. In a free market of money, devoid of manipulation and debasement, the market would set those rates, not bureaucrats.",cryptocurrency
btc,So many posts &amp; videos about offline onboarding of BCH merchants and users -- so where are the results?,"BCH adoption is healthy. I am not 'bearish' about it, and there is nothing going wrong with it. But it has essentially been flatlined since early this year, and yet I keep seeing post after post, literally every day in here, about how this or that meatspace merchant or user is being 'onboarded' into Bitcoin Cash.

If all these 'onboardings' are genuinely creating more users, then where is their usage? Where is the steadily increasing traffic? It has been over a year now that 'physically onboarding the developing world' has been such a focus here, and I am not seeing the rubber hit the road on this.

Now look at online. There was a huge spike in transaction counts in relation to the site noisecash (which by the way also involved the developing world), and then when they started batching, the traffic went back down to 'nornal'. This effect alone massively dwarfed any detectable onchain effects of physical onboarding in the developing world.

I think the conclusion is clear: Meatspace onboarding, at least in the developing world, is a big fat red herring. **Cryptocurrencies are an online technology** and their main advantage and value proposition is for online commerce, not as much for in-person trade. Even the anti-censorship advantages of cryptocurrencies are neutralised in-person because you could just wear a mask and sunglasses, which is perfectly acceptable these days, and use fiat cash, which can't be traced back to you. In-person censorship resistance is not a problem that is crying out to be solved.

I am not saying don't try to onboard people in meatspace. I am saying that strategy is clearly not having much effect, and the idea of some that it should be focused on exclusively or heavily prioritised was clearly not right. No biggie. Just adapt to the realities and focus more resources elsewhere, right?",cryptocurrency
stocks,"Wells Fargo says correction is likely, recommend these 10 safe picks (RH? UAA?)","[Here's the list](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/20/wells-fargo-says-the-probability-of-a-correction-is-rising-so-hide-out-in-these-quality-stocks-.html):

* Apple
* CMS Energy
* Conocophillips
* Meta
* JPM
* MSFT
* RH
* UAA

&gt;The bank is recommending cyclical quality stocks from its high-quality large-cap portfolio, which should help investors capture some upside and outperform to the downside. Each stock has an overweight rating by Wells Fargo analysts, a market cap of more than $3 billion, and “favorable” quality, which is based on debt to EBITDA (or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), profit margins and return on equity.

&gt; “We believe it is time to move up in quality and down in risk,” Harvey said. “The Fed has turned hawkish; we are seeing pricing fatigue; growth is decelerating; market froth is abundant; and risk-averse options are relatively cheap but limited... so expect pressure on multiples.”


....

&gt;Harvey noted that much of consumers’ pent-up demand has been satisfied and retailers might have a harder time hiking prices going forward.

&gt; “We are not worried about the overall health of the U.S. consumer,” Harvey said. “Our focus is more the marginal change as it relates to future spending, since we are beginning to suspect the consumer is no longer the price-taker it was six to 12 months ago.”

So most of this list is pretty standard. Although I'm not very familiar with the cases for RH and UAA. Why doesn't Wells see dampening consumer demand for these products? Any surprises on this list for you?",finance
CryptoCurrency,A Simple Explanation for the Bear Market,"You can take a look below at an explanation for the crypto bear market.

I'll explain:

One of the reasons for the invention of bitcoin is the ""printing press"" of the United States Federal Reserve and other Central Banks across the world.  The Federal Reserve prints money, buys government bonds.  This has a variety of effects:

1. Inflation: more money is chasing the same number of goods.  Companies are still selling the same number of bananas and chainsaws but now there is more money to pay for these things so it all becomes more expensive.
2. Financial asset price increases.  This one is more extreme than inflation.  Financial assets include land, bonds, stocks, and of course cryptocurrency.  First the Federal Reserve prints the money so more money is chasing the same number of assets.  Then the Federal Reserve exchanges that money for bonds.  Thus the first to get that money are investors in government bonds.  They reallocate their gains in their bonds to other financial assets making financial asset inflation more dramatic than inflation.
3. Weakening of the currency.

So the Fed has declared that maybe printing like crazy is a bad idea and they want to print less and less.  This makes the United States dollar (USD) a better store of value.  Better does not mean good.  It just means that if you thought that the USD was a 3/10 now it is a 3.5/10.  More people will be willing to hold USD for a longer time than BTC.

I do not think that the Federal Reserve has the moral authority to tell Congress that it caused a recession that caused people to pay their debts just to improve the quality of the USD even though it does have the legal authority to do so.  They'll eventually go back to the printing press.

personalfinance,Thoughts on leveraging home equity,"I'm opening a HELOC and wanted to bounce my thoughts off this community. There's two main goals:

1. Safety net to supplement my rainy day fund, e.g. in case of loss of income. (I understand the lender may close the credit line in case of loss of employment, but that's why it doesn't replace the rainy day fund.)

2. (Re)finance past and upcoming home improvement projects that I could pay off out of pocket, but would prefer not to. For this I'd do a fixed rate lock over 6 or 12 years, at around 2.6% or 3% respectively.

To elaborate on 2, I like the safety net of liquidity, and I'm expecting my cashflow to improve in a few years (cutting out preschool for two kids, and phasing in a multi-year raise from work). I also expect interest rates to rise or at least not fall, and inflation to possibly ramp up, so taking on more fixed debt now seems reasonable.

I'm thinking of managing the debt by opening up a separate brokerage account for the disbursed funds. I'd invest in something conservative like short-term treasuries or investment-grade corp bonds, the idea being to lower my cost of borrowing by a percent or so. I'd pay back the loan in equal installments, not interest-only. When I take on new projects they'd be funded from that account.  Alternatively, I could fund it by selling stocks and thereby keep the loan principal invested safely, though that somewhat defeats the point of using home equity.

STORIES

The Snacks Six: stories that defined 2021

The stimulus effect… Since the third stimmy landed in March (another $1.9T), the US economy has rebounded hard. Spending boomed thanks to extra $$$ for consumers, stocks rallied to new highs, and unemployment has fallen to near pre-pandemic levels. But as the economy revved up, supply issues abounded (#EverythingShortage) and prices soared. 2021 was all about stimulating spending; 2022 could be about cooling. The Fed plans to hike interest rates three times in the new year to tamp down inflation, which hit a 39-year high last month. Meanwhile, JP Morgan Chase believes ’22 will bring a full global recovery.

Meme mania… Investing gained unprecedented cultural relevance this year as Americans sat at home with extra cash and more ways than ever to participate in markets. In January, social-driven buying campaigns helped lead to rising prices of “meme stocks” like GameStop, AMC, and Nokia — and later meme-related cryptos like Dogecoin, Shiba, and short-lived Squid coin, which turned out to be a scam. But meme mania is just one chapter in the rise of the retail investor: Retail investors accounted for an estimated 23% of all US equity trading this year, up double from 2019.

Vaccination nation… December 2020: The US Covid vaccine rollout begins, starting with essential workers and high-risk groups. Since then, vax access has majorly expanded (even to kids). The first half of the rollout was all about “carrots” — think: free Krispy Kreme incentives. The second was “sticks”: Corporations like CVS, McDonald’s, and Walmart mandated shots for some employees, while others required unvaccinated employees to pay more for health insurance. In November, President Biden announced vax mandates for all employers with 100 or more workers. Now 60% of Americans are fully vaxxed, and nearly a third have gotten a booster. But global Covid deaths this year surpassed 2020's total toll by June, and now Omicron is spreading fast.

Race to the metaverse… “That’s so meta” took on new meaning. In October, Facebook became “Meta” to double down on its vision for an internet you can be inside of — from VR gaming worlds to virtual offices and meta-malls. Tech titans like Microsoft, Roblox, and Nvidia are also racing to claim their stake in the ’Verse, which could be the future of work, entertainment, and commerce. Mark Zuckerberg hopes that by 2030 his metaverse will reach 1B people. But it faces many hurdles to becoming (meta) reality.

Trillion-dollar milestones… Tech giants got even giant-er as pandemic scrolly-tappy habits stuck. Apple is close to becoming earth’s first $3T company, only 16 months after hitting $2T. Microsoft passed $2T in June as the cloud boom continued, and in November Google briefly surpassed the double-trillion mark (thanks, YouTube bingeing). Even Tesla momentarily joined the four-comma club. The uberwealthy also had a banner year: Billionaires grew $1.6T richer. In 2022, interest-rate hikes plus Biden-led tax increases could cut into gains for tech powerhouses and the deep-pocketed.

Labor gains leverage... from strikes to $15 minimum wages. Power shifted to workers as companies scrambled to hire during the labor shortage. Covid fears, childcare needs, and extra unemployment benefits kept many home, while the pandemic changed priorities. Job openings soared as workers looked for better options. Corporate behemoths like Target and Walmart engaged in a battle of benefits, hiking wages and dangling perks such as free college tuition. As workers demanded better conditions, union popularity hit a 56-year high (even Starbs has one now). With a record 11M job openings on one side and a low 4.2% unemployment rate on the other, emboldened workers have negotiated 4.8% higher wages this year, on average.

NUMBERS

Six big numbers of 2021…

51 = # of commercial space launches this year, including Virgin Galactic, SpaceX, and Blue Origin space-tourism missions (feat. “Star Trek” icon William Shatner and former footballer Michael Strahan).

3,091 = # of times the word “journey” was mentioned on earnings calls, as corporate execs grappled with a mixed bag of financial recovery + major global issues.

$69M = the record-smashing price that an NFT sold for at a Christie’s auction, as the value of digital assets soars. You could buy many metaverse yachts with that money.

+58% = rise in US gas prices from last year. The pump anxiety is real, and could make it way pricier to heat and electrify homes this winter.

313M+ = total “Squid Game” views, including 142M+ views of the actual Netflix series and 171M views of Mr. Beast’s YouTube re-creation.

$2.8B = Alibaba’s historic antitrust fine. As Chinese regulators crack down on tech titans, the value of US-listed Chinese companies has plunged.

personalfinance,How much do i actually need for a house?,"30.5M Single. Live in a medium to high COL area in the west coast (Not Seattle or Bay Area). Even the most basic homes and townhomes on average go for about 500k + right now. I don't have an intention of buying a house until I'm 33. So in another 2 to 3 years. I am able to save / invest about 3k to 3.5k a month right now (accounting for salary increase). 

I have 0 debts, about 100k saved in retirement accounts (roth, 401k etc.), and 50k in investments. I'm continuing to put money into retirement and investments.

But at some point I have to start saving cash for a downpayment. My understanding is that, home prices are not going to drop, but interest rates are likely to rise in 2 to 3 years. So to get a good interest rate, I need to put 20% down right? 

Does that mean that I should start saving cash asap? I can only save 36k to 40k a year, so I would need to start saving cash immediately? Or some percentage of it etc. 

I am suggested that, I could do half cash half investments, and if needed take a loan out of my investments (reallocating them to bonds for stability or at least a part of it) when i eventually need to and if the market didn't tank. And I could take money out of my roth without penalty in my state too.",finance
CryptoCurrency,"Banks can cry all they want. The truth is, Crypto does not and will not need banks to keep growing, while banks will inevitably have to adopt Crypto in order to grow.","Crypto already has its own debit cards and credit cards with amazing cashback and deposit features that put any bank in the world to shame. Not only that, proof of stake coins allow you to earn double digit interest rates while banks rarely go above 0.25%. 

Cryptocurrencies are exploding in terms of popularity with the amount of blockchain wallets getting &gt;100% in terms of year-on-year growth this year alone while banks are reporting a 6.5% decline in bank branches this decade.

The Crypto market is increasing by trillions every time there is a pump, adding as much as $2.5 Trillion in just two years while the entire global market cap of banks is [stuck around $8 Trillion for years](https://www.statista.com/statistics/265135/market-capitalization-of-the-banking-sector-worldwide/). Banks have literally been close to being bankrupt multiple times, yet the only thing keeping them afloat are huge government bailouts. **Ethereum alone is bigger than the largest bank in America.**

What am I trying to say?

No matter what the CEO of a bank says, they aren't oblivious to Crypto's explosive growth. Banks are profit based businesses and they will inevitably have to fully adopt Crypto in order to keep growing. We are already seeing this as most banks are starting to offer some kind of Crypto services and starting to offer their own digital currencies. They know traditional fiat cannot compete with Crypto.

TLDR: Frankly, Crypto can continue to grow without banks while banks will inevitably have to adopt Crypto in the future in order to grow, in fact, it's already happening. Banks need Crypto to grow, not the other way around.",cryptocurrency
MachineLearning,[D] Question about collaboration with data scientists and engineers?,"Hello! (newby to the group here), I was wondering if you would mind elaborating on potential demand for ML operations collaboration with data analytics departments and data scientists?  When I first started in data science the last thing I  wanted to do was integrate with APIs and perform ETL, clean and format data into feature sets, and manage models.  I had the most fun calculating interesting statistical reports and building and running simulations.  I'm wondering if with today's data science landscape and tools available folks are still feeling that problem?  If the problem exists how are folks handling it, particularly when building production capabilities from the research and models?

A  little background if you are interested... I started developing over 20 years ago because of an interest in data science (particularly in finance and economics), multi agent systems, and machine learning (in Lisp at the time), but my career (application and hosting platform engineering and architecture) took me away from that objective, and I gradually became unhappy with what I was building and managing.  I made a choice to get back to that passion and I started working on a platform to do the underlying plumbing of managing cloud infrastructure and data integration and processing, so I  personally could create multi agent simulators and self optimizing recommendation engines.  But admittedly I am behind on my knowledge about what is really going on in the data science market.  I created this open source project after my brother died and I would have built it even if nobody else in the world wanted it because it connected my experience with my passion, and I really needed something fun to do.

The reason I am thinking the demand might be there is I have a friend who has a small AI consulting shop and I have been able to work with his team on a US federal government project, which allowed me to work with others on model strategy and implementation.  They did the strategy and initial model implementation in notebooks and rough libraries, I translated that into more pluggable and scalable application code, and my open source software is handling the production ops and recommendation engines.  We all got to do what we loved and it seems to be working out well for the client.   This project took me back to a place I loved in software engineering, and I am wondering if this would be a good market to serve, because starting in the new year I HAVE to start generating some more revenue and I would prefer to do that in a area I am passionate about.",technology
personalfinance,Looking for Advice on Student Loan Consolidation,"Hi All,

I'm helping someone with 9 Student loans (details below in the table) . Would it make sense to consolidate to move from variable rate to fixed? Here is what I'm thinking:

* Student Loan forgiveness is on the table (Before midterms). Consolidating may make this debt ineligible
* Rate is estimated to change from 0% to between 0.25% and 0.75%
* A rate change of 1% will add an estimated $10 to my monthly payment
* I need to look if there are any prepayment penalties or repayment of any benefits
* The current budget is very tight and can't really handle anything too drastic (living paycheck to paycheck).

insurance + taxes $6000/year

personalfinance,Need help understanding IRS and CO State Income Tax Amending,"I have worked, full time, for a company operating in Colorado for nearly 5 years. Halfway through 2018, I moved to Texas. Since the move, I have been paying Colorado state income tax. I brought this up to my employer at the time of the move and they said ""blah blah we aren't setup to remove income tax for you blah blah"". At the time, I was like okay that's fine it's a small amount and I wasn't finding any information online suggesting I was exempt from these taxes. I was also the first non-resident employee so there wasn't much pressure for them to ""set this up"".

Fast forward to July 2021 where we have several non-resident employees and my employer informed me they adjusted their payroll taxes to exempt non-residents from withholding state income taxes, so moving forward income tax would not be withheld for me and I would no longer be required/obligated to pay the state. Woo hoo! I am then told they can produce W-2C (corrected W-2) forms to adjust boxes 16 and 17 to show $0 for state taxable income and state income tax withheld for the year. They said you can contact the Colorado Department of Revenue to inquire about refunding income taxes paid per the three W-2Cs they filed and provided me with (2018, 2019, and 2020 - 2021 will be handled next year).

Currently, I am trying to figure out my next steps because I am super confused. I have talked with the Colorado Department of Revenue a handful of times and have received a few different answers as to what I need to do. Their last statement was that I need to amend my return. No additional detail and at the time I didn't think to ask if they meant federal and state, just state, etc. They did not give me much direction. I have looked online and am seeing to do the federal you need to file a 1040-X and for the Colorado return you must file a 104X. I tried amending in both TurboTax and the Colorado Department of Revenue's portal and both systems are producing really weird data/numbers on the amended forms. Colorado in particular was re-calculating that I owe them the refund I was given as if the system was saying since I was supposed to pay $0 in taxes and I was given a refund, $0 - refund = you owe the refund. Instead, the math should be state income tax paid - refund = new refund. Now that I don't feel I can rely on these systems producing these forms for me, I am back to where I started, unsure of what forms I need to fill out, where I need to send them, and in what order. Can somebody please help me understand what my next steps might be? I know this is a rather specific situation, so any help is much appreciated! Thank you Reddit nerds :)

Edit 1: Right now, all I have is the W-2Cs for 2018, 2019, and 2020. I have not done anything with these forms or the adjusted data on them.",finance
Bitcoin,Why governments love fiat system,"I’m not sure if btc will be the worlds reserve asset. Mostly because governments around the world love fiat based monetary system. A gold or btc standard limits their power. Also does a poor job at stabilizing capitalisms inefficiencies. And social stability. 

When we look into Karl Marx’s socio-economic theory specifically (crisis theory) we see that capitalism is doomed to fail. 


(Or have recessions or financial crisis.)

The reason is simple. The ratio of profit vs the amount of money invested decreases over time.

This becomes an issue because now I have to go into debt to sustain my business expenses. I would have to constantly innovate and keep profits high to stay in business. 

This is unsustainable. Why? Because you can’t grow forever. Eventually the whole system collapses. Modern economist call this the boom and bust cycle

This is also observable in the physical universe. Under the term entropy (the law of thermodynamics) it seems not even the universe can evade this problem

“Loss over time is inevitable”

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/USData47_13.png/1280px-USData47_13.png

As we take a look at this graph we see that more capital over time is needed to sustain growth.  - Source federal reserve 

The fed money printer saves us from doomsday. 

The government has no choice but to print money to sustain growth. Debt has to grow larger and larger to keep up with innovation and new technologies in order to stay competitive globally. 

The CBDC or a crypto dollar. Will solve the governments problem. They are already in the works of making this a reality. Whatever you opinions on this form of currency is irrelevant as the government wants this. Bitcoin may or may not become a reserve asset it all depends

personalfinance,Used Car Loan - Bad Credit,"Hi everyone.  I'm so lost right now, and could really use some help.  I was going through some rough times, had some major money issues, and ended up getting my leased car repossessed, a month ago.  I have since been able to work out my financial situation a little better, so I can start working back to catch up on everything.  In the meantime, I've been renting a car to get me through my day to day, but I can't keep paying $30 a day, so, I need a car, badly.  I do not drive all that much, so looking for an old used beater, probably under $8,000, depending on the monthly payment.

The issue I'm having is getting a loan.  My credit score dropped to 550, and of course I have the Repo on there.  I understand I'm totally considered Sub-Prime, but I know there has to be a way to get a loan somewhere.  I don't have a lot of extra cash at this moment, so looking to minimize my down-payment (preferably $500 or less), which I also know isn't going to help my situation.  I know I'm going to be paying in the low 20%, but I'm okay with that right now, assuming there is no prepayment penalty on the loan.  I expect to be in a place where I can pay extra towards the loan each month, and should have the loan paid off in less than a year, so I just have to take the crazy interest rate hit for now.  

Unfortunately, I don't have anyone close to me that I can ask to co-sign for me.  Is there anywhere I can go to get help? Any lenders that would work with me?  Any way to easily find dealers that work with sub-prime candidates?  I live in Los Angeles, if that makes a difference.

Original Post:

I sold my car to CarMax today and the process went smoothly.  It took a couple hours, but overall I was impressed.  It's a car I bought new in 2018 and due to covid has low miles.  They appraised it on-site for an hour and have me the price they quoted through their website.  I was chuffed.

Leaving the dealership I get this text message from an unknown number:

&gt; CarMax maintains the right to determine which customers it will conduct business with and, based on information in our systems, CarMax has elected to not do business with you. I don't know the exact reason, but it could be related to a prior interaction with CarMax or information you have provided. This decision is final and is applicable at all CarMax locations.

I thought it was spam so I didn't respond, but I called carmax to tell them about this, thinking someone was using their info to scam people. The customer relations person was confused and said it was weird and gave me the corporate number and asked that I report it to them so they're aware.

I gave up after sitting on hold, thinking I'd call back tomorrow.

That's when the store called me directly and the manager asked that I bring back the bank draft immediately and they would give me the car.  They said that corporate demanded it and they had zero information as to why.  I was extremely skeptical and asked for common reasons why this could happen and he gave me nothing.  He seemed nervous and asked me to call back tonight with a time I could come back or he would follow up tomorrow.

I read the *signed* contract and the breach clause states they can demand to cancel a transaction if I misrepresented something at some point, which I haven't.

I have nearly perfect credit, the loan is current, the car is in excellent condition (and they appraised it themselves) and we have a signed contract.  My wife is on the loan and she signed everything right next to me.  We didn't lie whatsoever.

I called CarMax corporate and the nice customer service lady couldn't reach anyone at corporate (it's 6pm) so she's going to call the location GM and call me back by 7. 

I called the loan holder and they saw the loan payoff request from CarMax at 1:49pm today and confirmed the payoff amount the CarMax told me.

I've also called my aunt, a lawyer, and told her the situation and I'll see what she says.

But right now, I'm not doing squat.  Unless they tell me how I was in breach of contract, I'm considering it valid.  My only worry is that they won't pay off the loan (I already deposited the bank draft).

All I can assume is that they didn't like the deal after the fact.  They have an identical car (all options, color and mileage) listed on their lot for only $998 more than they paid to us, implying they're oy making $998 on the car they just bought from me.

Either that or it's a case of mistaken identity?

But seriously, has anyone ever heard of this before?  What options do I have???

Thanks, PF.  Let me know of there's a better sub for this question, but you guys are so helpful I thought of here first.  :)

Edit: corporate customer service just called back and told me that the information provide (i. e., none) was accurate and they want to unwind the deal, citing that they have the right to choose who they do business with.

I told them that until they can show me how I breached the contract, I'm going to consider it valid and not do anything.  She said she'll let legal know.

No idea wtf their problem is.  It's not like a car company has never lost money before.  I can't imagine there's any other reason for this B. S.

Back in 2010 I graduate from college and start payments on a Federal Perkins loan for Colorado School of Mines. Summer of 2020, I end up paying it off. And just today, I get a statement in the mail indicating it's fully paid off. Notification is dated 3 days ago (when it was sent. Very timely notification. Good to know they're on the ball there. /s). 

The notification also include a number of other documents about the loan (promissory notes, rates, ect). My full 9 digit SSN is on pretty much all of them. Frequently it's hand-written under an account number. Also, this envelope is not sealed. Didn't seem like it could seal correctly with all the documents stuffed in it. It would be possible for someone to access the documents and put them back in the envelope without tearing anything. But on the other hand, my mailbox only has a key access. So if someone else did tamper with it, it would be someone at USPS.

We have been playing around with the numbers and if we could refinance around 3% for 30 years and cash out 100k or less, our payment would be about the same per month.   The cash out money would be used to pay off the car loans and student loans, and we'd put the rest toward home improvements and possibly into retirement.

CryptoCurrency,How crypto is like getting off the gold standard,"Reading this subreddit, sometimes it sounds like people here are angry USA (etc) went off the gold standard, because money can be printed without any limits. And I totally hear you (though I disagree).

But I wanted to suggest that the language used by critics of crypto in government sound a lot like the people who were curious about leaving the gold standard.

NPR wrote:  He told FDR that the country had to leave the gold standard – and Roosevelt took his advice.
When FDR told his advisers about the decision, ""they all exploded,"" Ahamed said. Dean Acheson, assistant secretary of the Treasury, resigned. Another adviser said it would be the end of Western Civilization.
But it wasn't. The experts of the day were wrong about the gold standard.

""Most economists now agree 90% of the reason why the U.S. got out of the Great Depression was the break with gold..."" 

If we look at the way the US government talks about crypto itswa lot like the experts talked about getting off with a gold standard. Elizabeth Warren you can say that reptile is the end of the world or the bane of all sound monetary policy oh, but she just sounds like she's echoing gold standard or bust rhetoric of than 1930s. The thing markets and individuals need is flexibility!",cryptocurrency
cardano,"Cardano Rumor Rundown December 21, 2021","Hey Everyone!

Let's go...

Newly covered today:

1. There’s a new community built tool for analyzing the Ada Realms metaverse. [https://jurgel.github.io/adarealm-market-map/](https://jurgel.github.io/adarealm-market-map/)
2. Cardano’s biggest metaverse is already more…uh…decentralized than Decentraland. [https://twitter.com/PavianoGroup/status/1472879929230602247](https://twitter.com/PavianoGroup/status/1472879929230602247)
3. We got another PAB Pre-Release (Dec. 20)! [https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-apps/releases/tag/v2021-12-20](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-apps/releases/tag/v2021-12-20)
4. There are now automated seller ratings on cnft.io. This means you can tell which sellers habitually fail to send the asset after a sale. [https://twitter.com/StaleDev/status/1472995940478996483](https://twitter.com/StaleDev/status/1472995940478996483)

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Here is the coming onslaught of Cardano dApps summed up in just six lines. [https://twitter.com/DCdoso/status/1461340919731523586](https://twitter.com/DCdoso/status/1461340919731523586)
2. Pavia says they will drop the extended land map next week and that it will include some new land types. [https://twitter.com/Pavia\_io/status/1461331532069711876](https://twitter.com/Pavia_io/status/1461331532069711876)
3. The smaller “fix-it” bill that would attempt to remedy the bad crypto language in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill has now been introduced in the House of Representatives. [https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1461317078175072263](https://twitter.com/jerrybrito/status/1461317078175072263)

8. Charles dropped a new AMA where he mentioned very briefly that they are actually going to look into read-only UTxOs. If it’s possible to have these types of UTxOs while preserving determinism, it would be a big change since transactions must currently consume inputs. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJcVEJ1a6eg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJcVEJ1a6eg) Some background reading on read-only UTxOs: [https://github.com/Emurgo/Emurgo-Research/blob/master/smart-contracts/Unlocking%20The%20Potential%20Of%20The%20UTXO%20Model.md](https://github.com/Emurgo/Emurgo-Research/blob/master/smart-contracts/Unlocking%20The%20Potential%20Of%20The%20UTXO%20Model.md)

11. Pavia has dropped some very cool images of their avatars (or at least “background characters”). [https://twitter.com/Pavia\_io/status/1461713781122232327](https://twitter.com/Pavia_io/status/1461713781122232327)

14. We got another Plutus Application Backend (PAB) release today (11.22)! [https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-apps/releases/tag/v2021-11-22](https://github.com/input-output-hk/plutus-apps/releases/tag/v2021-11-22)

16. It looks like we’re getting a block size increase and a plutus script memory increase on December 1, 2021. [https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/11/22/slow-and-steady-wins-the-race-network-evolution-for-network-growth/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/11/22/slow-and-steady-wins-the-race-network-evolution-for-network-growth/) [https://twitter.com/cardano\_whale/status/1463097104331468803](https://twitter.com/cardano_whale/status/1463097104331468803)

18. Charles drops a video on the eToro user limitations. It sounds like IOHK knew nothing about this. Interacting with exchanges falls in the Cardano Foundation’s wheelhouse. It’s unclear whether the CF knew anything. He also pointed out it’s very interesting that an old line exchange like Bitstamp has decided to LIST Cardano during this same period. Charles also mentioned that they haven’t seen any regulatory activity on IOHK’s end. eToro is a relatively small source of liquidity for Cardano and there shouldn’t be much of an impact. [https://youtu.be/WYQTkf8ndpY](https://youtu.be/WYQTkf8ndpY)
19. The Pavia map is expanding on Wednesday, Nov. 24th at 1500 UTC with a second land sale. [https://twitter.com/Pavia\_io/status/1463153632484941834](https://twitter.com/Pavia_io/status/1463153632484941834)
20. Charles drops a video about the Caravan moving on despite any FUD (like eToro) that temporarily emerges. [https://youtu.be/IjXkP\_DGRgY](https://youtu.be/IjXkP_DGRgY)
21. The Pavia second land sale saw demand vastly outstrip supply to become (reportedly) the biggest Cardano NFT drop ever. [https://twitter.com/Pavia\_io/status/1463560375442591753](https://twitter.com/Pavia_io/status/1463560375442591753) [https://twitter.com/Pavia\_io/status/1463547885539278849](https://twitter.com/Pavia_io/status/1463547885539278849)

24. The minutes from the Fed’s November FOMC meeting have been published and indicate they are ready to taper asset purchases and raise rates to combat inflation.

26. Here’s a good concise tweetstorm inspired by the Raul Pal/ Breedlove conversation about how the last 100 or so years led us here to this macro environment and crypto. [https://twitter.com/JamesRothmann/status/1464305493099393028](https://twitter.com/JamesRothmann/status/1464305493099393028)
27. Interesting discussion of the SundaeSwap ISO, the Scooper Model, and decentralization. [https://youtu.be/94N8KXNs\_as](https://youtu.be/94N8KXNs_as)
28. John O’Connor drops an IOHK article on “RealFi” including thoughts on the ramifications of validated identity for uncollateralized loans in markets like Kenya and the projects in Ethiopia and Zanzibar.

32. The Cardano Community takes a moment to enjoy contemplating the circumstance that there will never need to be a “magical Cardano 2” in order for our blockchain to survive. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1465089315340488704](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1465089315340488704)

58. The heads of Circle, FTX, Bitfury, Paxos, Stellar Development Foundation, and Coinbase appeared before the House Financial Services Committee. As expected, the questions from some of the House Committee members belied a misplaced focus on things like terrorist financing while others understood the need to regulate crypto appropriately so that crypto innovation is not forced offshore. There was significant focus on stablecoins due to the President’s Working Group placing so much focus there. One representative also chose to focus heavily on the energy consumption of Bitcoin mentioning coal power plants coming back on line to fuel Bitcoin mining. The witnesses from the crypto industry seemed to focus on dispelling misconceptions and also pushing for a single crypto focused regulatory body as opposed to the fragmented regulation that is typical in Washington.

I’m looking to invest 10% of my paycheck in to crypto utilising a DCA strategy but I can’t quite decide on my split for my coins. 

I’d be looking to buy monthly, with a spend of around £230 total/$300. 

I think I’d want a high % split of ETH and BTC with a smaller % split of alt coins. I’d also like to drop some money each month in to a stable coin like USDC on a cefi platform like Celsius for a bit of exposure to decent interest rates. 

What are your thoughts on below? 

40% BTC
40% ETH 
10% USDC on Celsius 
10% Altcoins (ADA, Dot, ALGO, etc or generally as a rule of thumb whichever is the top traded alt coin the previous month, excluding shitcoins) 

Is it worth investing this little in USDC on Celsius?

\- Vitalik has such an amazing mind and he can write and speak which is so hard for so many 'developer' types. I do hope he is getting outside and getting some Vitamin D.

\- They did this event inside a museum in Germany. You have to watch the end where they let the director speak (I guess it was the 'ad'.) The two running it must not know they are still on camera as the guy rambles on and on in his Star Trek shirt and does the weird Klingon gesture at the end? Perfect guy to run a museum and of course Vitalik was nothing but kind to that **'question?'** (I was dying  watching the guys laughing trying to hold their shit together.)

algorand,Dedication to all the negative Nancys',"TLDR: Please do not blame or disrespect the Developers of your chosen coin/token if the value is not increasing to your desired expectations. As it not solely the fault of the Devs as there are many factors in play when it comes to pricing!

I think it is easy to forget fundamentally:

&gt;""The value of anything is determined by supply and demand. **If demand increases faster than supply, the price goes up** ""

Therefore, please do not assume the negative correlation between the price and your investment is solely down to the Devs not implementing price-increasing initiatives/technologies to help ""boost"" the value of said token/coin.

Additionally, other factors that impact price include:

* Node count
   * This is said to be a good indicator of the value of a cryptocurrency, as this is a measurement of how many active wallets exist on the network. The more active wallets, the more demand/trade is likely.
* Institutional and retail Demand
   * over the past 2 years (since lockdown), there has been a lot of media spotlight on crypto which has prompted a lot of retail buys, and in turn causing a potent artificial demand for crypto in the short term - some/majority of these retail buyers will sell when then market is down, further adding to the ""dip"".
   * More institutions are looking to capitalise on the crypto ""boom"", however, these are also the same people who buy big and sell big when they need to offset losses/have fear etc.,.
* Mass Adoption
   * prices increase if a coin/token gains momentum and the projects are widely adopted
* Inflation of fiat currencies
   * if value of the fiat currency drops, then in theory the value of BTC would go up in respect to that currency. Thereforem you are able to get more of that currency with your BTC thanks to the artificially low interest rates.
* Cost of production
   * there is a correlation between direct and opportunity costs and the overall value of the cryptocurrency.
* Marketing / Communication 
   * Having a strong marketing campaign can help get the word out about the project and in return create demand. 
   * Poor or non-existent marketing would mean the value may move sideways drop as people lose interest as they assume a project is dead.
* Regulation
   * if the governments get their way and cryptocurrency is regulated, prices will be impacted by this and we will most likely see an initial drop in price.

stocks,What the hell am I missing with RKT?,"Please don't torch me if I'm being stupid, but I've been looking at RKT for the past 6 months and I really can't figure out why the market hates this stock so much.

Currently they are on track to increase their annual revenue from last year: 10.9B to around 13B, with about ~40% of that being profit on average.  If we look at Q3 alone compared to a company like NVDA who had a massive jump in share price, RKT had income of  3.1B and NVDA 3.4B!  Granted NVDA did increase more YoY revenue wise, RKT is pocketing a ton of cash, and their PE ratio reflects that.

Obviously it's apples to oranges to compare the two in a lot of ways, but as far as pure earnings, I can't see why this stock gets so much hate!

RKTs business model could be solely taking advantage of low interest rates as home buying and refinancing is at a massive demand.  If this pulls back, it will eat their bottom line.  However I believe RKT has the tech to take over the large majority of this market to compensate any relative pullback.  In addition, being a pure software company allows them to have great margins, and expand into other areas quickly.

Besides just being a ""mortgage company"", what are the main driving factors for this stock being stuck in the mud?",finance

1) Life Insurance thru work he was a federal employee for 25+ years we think this is bare minimum 10k but may be a years salary plus 10k
2) His 401k, we are not quite sure because he borrowed some money from it before but we would guess over 50k
3) a car worth 15-20k with what we think he took out a 5k loan against. (Car is dirty and trashed but will probably clean up well with a full detail) Ae have the car is our possession now. 
4) He was facing an eviction in January but had moved out early and passed away at the new location he was staying. 

My brother was divorced and had no kids. No will. So we assume it will fall back to his/my mom. We have already planned a cremation and paid for it.

Wife and I own a home with a very small 30 yr mortgage payment on a condo purchased for $270K that is valued at $425K. We owe $165K with a 3.1% interest rate. No other debt.

$230K liquidity sitting in the bank doing nothing.

Our retirement savings are piss poor:

* $60K in my employer-sponsored 401a, $3k in my employer sponsored 403b
* $4K in her 403b. It is a TIAA-CREF plan. Options are a fixed annuity @ 3% or a variable rate indexed annuity. Her employer offers a 7% match of her salary. Net fees on the annuities are around 0.4%.

**Is there any reason to be putting money into my wife's 403b instead of just setting up Roth IRAs or buying indexes?**

Today, I received an email from WF letting me know that I'm eligible for an interest rate and monthly principal and interest payment reduction.  It states there are no costs involved, all my other loan terms remain the same, and all I would need to do is sign and return the letter they are FedEx-ing to me.  I called WF, and they said this is not a refinance or a mortgage modification; instead, it is an interest rate reduction program they are rolling out to certain borrowers, with the idea that it would disincentivize me to refinance elsewhere. 

A few questions:

(1) Is this legit?  Has anyone done this?  Any advice?

(2) Will this have any impact on my credit?  The representative assured me it would not, but I couldn't get a commitment on this point in writing.  I don't know if the letter says it or not since I haven't gotten it yet, but knowing WF I suspect it says nothing on this point.

(3) My wife and I just made an offer on a second home.  She is taking out a physician mortgage for that property.  The mortgage on the current property (the one associated with WF) is in my name only.  If I accept the WF interest rate reduction, would that have any effect on our pursuit of the new home?

personalfinance,"Potential student loan forgiveness (Teacher), and I need help making the right choice","I currently have \~$23,000 in student loans from my Master's degree I have to start paying off Feb 1st like everyone else. I had made another post before about a best strategy to pay those off, as I do have the ability to just pay it off right now between my savings and a little from my checking account, while still retaining \~5 months safety net.

However, I was emailed some information about a federal teacher loan forgiveness application by my administration. From what I see, it requires that I:

1. No outstanding balance on direct loans (I have direct unsub stafford loans)
2. Teach for 5 consecutive years as a highly qualified teacher (I'm in my 1st year, have bachelors/masters, full state certification)
3. Be employed at a qualifying school (I do)
4. The loan(s) for which you are seeking forgiveness must have been made before the end of your five academic years of qualifying teaching service.

I meet all of these requirement except for the 5 year minimum.

Is there a way for me to defer my student loans until I qualify? Or is there a best repayment strategy so I do not dump all of my savings into loan repayment when I will eventually qualify for $17,500 in loan forgiveness?",finance
personalfinance,Need guidance on my federal student loans before repayment starts again,"So I wanted to post this and get some advice on specifically what to do with my student loan debt. I am generally financially savvy however after doing more reading about the payment plans, and with the 0% interest almost up, I’m really unsure about which plan I should be on. I figure I’d see what someone more knowledgeable than me would say?

–

I am self employed - I do not have a regular paycheck at all. It’s hard to know what my actual income is year after year or what I will owe in taxes. I do not make a whole lot of money, but I do make more each year. I was able to save a lot of my PUA funds to pay off a significant amount of debt to the tune of $11k this year which has felt great. I have a comfortable amount of money in my accounts, which is how I like to keep it to maintain my fluctuating business expenses and bills, even knowing that I could be investing more of it.

Now that I’m working toward paying everything down, I’m not sure if I’m on the right federal repayment plan for my student loans.

My bills &amp; debt are as follows:

* About $1600 for rent, groceries, utilities, bills
* $368 for car loan (low low rate)
* I currently pay minimum payments on private student loans, one is for $115/mo $10,495 at 3.18% and the other $88/mo for $9,226.43 at 3.18%
* My Federal loans are currently on the PAYE schedule; one Subsidized at $18,830.10 and one Unsubsidized at $7,989.44. I have $1500 in interest on these loans and currently make $0 payments.

I have spent the last couple of years focused on paying down credit card debt and a personal loan, which are now at $0. For my next step, I was thinking I’d focus on paying down my private loans, keep paying $0 for federal as long as I can, and then pay those down (or let it be forgiven after 20 years) but now re-reading the payment plans I’m not sure that is at all smart.

I can’t tell if REPAYE or PAYE is a better option in terms of interest? I don’t plan on making gobs of money and I do plan on getting married in the next 10 years. The interest rate is also 0% for not much longer so I’m not sure if I should put money into it now?

If it means anything, I have been putting $ into a Roth IRA and I try to max it out each year. It’s been great returns. I have probably just enough to be able to do that for 2021, pay taxes, and keep a small emergency savings.

Please poke holes in it and give me timelines for when some of these factors might come to an end.

Literally every factor that influences inflation is going absolutely bonkers right now, and I don't see it dying down any time soon.

We have:
1. Low interest rates
2. Massively increased money supply that has yet to find an equilibrium
3. Massive personal savings for many middle class Americans compared to recent years 
4. Higher wages 
5. More disposable income due to working from home
6. High oil prices
7. Low unemployment 
8. Huge increases in public spending 
9. Tax reductions and huge tax credits and subsidies
10. Shortages in necessary goods (cars, lumber, steel, food, microchips, etc.)
11. More tariffs and industrial disputes
12. More environmental regulations
13. Deficit financing
14. Natural disasters (imagine how many cars and homes that are being wiped out from tornados and fires that are occurring more often)
15. Pauses on debt repayment

In 2009, the government had to subsidize people to buy cars and homes. Now you can't even buy a decent selection of 2 year old cars for MSRP. It took 2 months for my friend's order for home fencing material to come in. Graphics cards are going for 3x's their MSRP.

There is so much pent up demand that there will be shortages and inflation for at least another year. I don't expect many of the prices to even come back down when the market finds the equilibrium.

The only ways I see inflation going down are an increase in supply of these extremely in demand goods, repayment of debts like student loans, increases in interest rates, increasing unemployment, and other things that the government will not do because it will cause hardship or harm financial markets.

Some things that have yet to happen that will increase inflation are:
1. An increase in the currently record low velocity of money
2. Increased oil prices
3. More natural disasters
4. Increased government spending (such as the build back better plan",finance

&gt; 
&gt; This could be a long read. Kindly bear with me.
&gt; 
&gt; I write this primarily in response to the [TechSpot article](https://www.techspot.com/news/91937-bitcoin-largely-controlled-small-group-investors-miners-study.html) from yesterday (r/technology mods told me they only allow “*mainstream news articles with* *editorial oversight and fact-checking*” so I'm sharing this here).
&gt; 
&gt; But I’d also like to take this opportunity to write about Bitcoin more broadly as someone who has been following it for more than a decade and I’ll try to do so without complicating the conversation for anyone unfamiliar with Bitcoin.
&gt; 
&gt; The TechSpot article cites a non-peer-reviewed National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) [working paper](https://www.nber.org/papers/w29396) from Igor Makarov and Antoinette Schoar.
&gt; 
&gt; NBER claims to be non-partisan but it is a private NPO funded by the likes of [Bill Gates foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/committed-grants/2019/11/inv003527).
&gt; 
&gt; The chairman of NBER, Karen Horn, is a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and Head of International Private Banking for Bankers Trust.
&gt; 
&gt; The authors of this working paper, Igor Makarov and Antoinette Schoar are no experts in Bitcoin.
&gt; 
&gt; Makarov is employed by Financial Markets Group (FMG), which focuses on policy research into financial markets and works alongside [banks and regulators in Europe](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/html/index.en.html).
&gt; 
&gt; Schoar is a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management and co-chair of NBER Corporate Finance group, who has [previously made it clear ](https://bcf.princeton.edu/events/antoinette-schoar/)that she is no fan of Bitcoin with some pretty misguided takes on it.
&gt; 
&gt; It’s critical to note that the data regarding miners cited in this study is from when mining was largely concentrated in China. This is [no longer the case](https://cbeci.org/mining_map).
&gt; 
&gt; The paper claims the authors have “the ability to trace miners on the blockchain.” The tracking method shown in the paper is based on subjective, unverified “algorithm to track the distribution of mining rewards from the largest 20 mining pools to the miners that work for them.”
&gt; 
&gt; The validity of this conjectural method of tracking was also subjectively verified before all mining operations migrated out of China to many different parts of the world.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; # Bitcoin distribution is not highly concentrated
&gt; 
&gt; The first thing we need to acknowledge with Bitcoin is that it is still very much a nascent monetary system. It has come a long way in a short space of time but it’s only been around 13 years and only 3% of the world’s population currently use Bitcoin.
&gt; 
&gt; It took the Internet 25 years to get to that point. So while adoption is certainly happening a lot quicker, we still have 97% of the world’s population to bring on board. Unlike the banking system, which has ostracized nearly half of the world’s adult population, Bitcoin can actually work for every person in the world, no matter who they are or where they come from.
&gt; 
&gt; The top wallet addresses [here](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html) do not belong to individuals. Almost all active addresses holding greater than 10 basis points of the total supply (greater than 0.1%) are addresses belonging to exchanges and custodial services holding custody of Bitcoin that belong to millions of individual users. Not all exchange addresses have been tagged by bitinfocharts. For instance, the third largest address, looking at activity and transaction patterns, [very likely belongs to Coinbase](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/block/707013/1P5ZEDWTKTFGxQjZphgWPQUpe554WKDfHQ).
&gt; 
&gt; Now **you’re not supposed to be holding your Bitcoin in exchanges** as that defeats the whole point of Bitcoin, besides enabling rehypothecation, which can artificially inflate the supply, and other security risks, but a lot of people do since they’re new to Bitcoin, unfamiliar with the concept of self-custody, and inadequately appreciate the purpose and potential of Bitcoin. There are ongoing educational efforts to encourage people to take ownership of their Bitcoin.
&gt; 
&gt; **Not your keys. Not your sats.**
&gt; 
&gt; The wealth distribution is admittedly far from where it needs to be, but it’s heading in the right direction. As more and more users adopt Bitcoin, the Gini index improves markedly. The game theory embedded into the protocol ensures that it does over time. The article from TechSpot claims that 10,000 individuals control a third of the supply. This, even if we assume to be accurate at face value, is a vastly improved figure from only 2 years ago, when [less than 5000 wallets](https://imgur.com/aNP9Ew6) were estimated to own half the supply.
&gt; 
&gt; On-chain analytics firm, Glassnode, [published](https://insights.glassnode.com/bitcoin-supply-distribution/) a finding earlier this year that ownership of Bitcoin is not highly concentrated and it naturally disperses over time. I’ll explain a little later in this article why that is the case.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; # Beyond the cryptocurrency
&gt; 
&gt; Let’s try to first understand Bitcoin beyond the cryptocurrency, as a software protocol and what it represents for humanity. Sure, price speculation is fun but for me, it’s the least interesting aspect of Bitcoin.
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin is open-source software collectively hosted by a pure P2P permissionless network of ∼ 60,000 nodes distributed across the world — by far the largest pure P2P network ever. Anyone in the world can propose changes to this software no matter who you are. There’s no central server or hierarchical structure to this network. You don’t need anyone’s permission to access the network. We don’t need to know who Satoshi was to trust the system because the code is open for every single human being in the world to read and scrutinize. Satoshi was simply the first, founding contributor to this open software.
&gt; 
&gt; This is such a revolutionary egalitarian concept so far removed from all the corruption and iniquities that inhere within our extant hierarchical technology and monetary systems that a lot of people understandably find it difficult to grasp but this could fundamentally fix the world and make money and technology at large work for everyone without privileges.
&gt; 
&gt; There’s a common misunderstanding that Bitcoin has great value because it was the first digital currency. This is untrue. There were several prior attempts — B-money, Bit gold and Hashcash the most prominent among them. Satoshi’s proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm solved a critical flaw in the use of blockchain as a public ledger known as [the Byzantine Generals Problem](https://river.com/learn/what-is-the-byzantine-generals-problem/) (BGP).
&gt; 
&gt; Solving for BGP meant that we could have an open ledger network without a central server or middlemen where nobody had to trust anybody else for the system to work. Every node within the Bitcoin network is a server with a live copy of the ledger and each node is able to verify the authenticity of its copy of the ledger without having to trust any of the other nodes.
&gt; 
&gt; The concept of blockchain predates Bitcoin by almost two decades. So the value was never in blockchain but the way Bitcoin was able to utilize blockchain as a trustless, permissionless, decentralized public ledger to democratically create, distribute and exchange value.
&gt; 
&gt; On the face of it, it’s easy to mischaracterize Bitcoin as some kind of an investment scheme. It is absolutely not that ([The Newcoiner Dilemma](https://preview.redd.it/kngn40wr20d71.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3b134c484734a2b004220711e06767ce4d9aebe)). Who is to benefit from an investment scheme where nobody is in charge?
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin is a complete revamp of our monetary system to make it work for everyone and more broadly, as a software protocol, Bitcoin has the potential to fix the Internet’s original sin — centralization at the hands of few privileged gatekeepers — and restore it to its originally intended form as a [decentralized P2P network protocol](https://preview.redd.it/5rc5zsks00d71.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=758cbf3af64ea5a1a1d4edcfe7235a9db9231c5c).
&gt; 
&gt; A network protocol is only decentralized if any participant within the network is able to access and verify the truth (the state of the ledger) on their own in a very economical manner without requiring permission or trust. We’ve seen many predatory knock-offs since Bitcoin, which are little more than snake-oil marketing gimmicks with fundamentally flawed protocol designs and centralized node architectures. Cynical rent-seeking and exploitation just comes with the territory for any revolutionary technology.
&gt; 
&gt; Permissioned, quasi-permissioned, DINO (decentralized in name only) blockchains are a waste of time. Blockchains are comparatively inefficient databases unless truly decentralized. What makes them special is the ability to individually host, validate and audit the ledger.
&gt; 
&gt; Throughout Bitcoin’s history, Bitcoiners have staunchly defended the right of users of the network not to be priced out of running their own node, [most famously 4 years ago](https://www.amazon.com/Blocksize-War-controls-Bitcoins-protocol/dp/B08YQMC2WM) when **Bitcoin users stood firm in the face of pressure from miners and corporate interests to prove that it was the users who truly controlled Bitcoin, not miners and not wealthy investors**.
&gt; 
&gt; Anyone can host their own [Bitcoin full node on a Raspberry Pi](https://preview.redd.it/1ohgb7ol00d71.png?width=829&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be47cad6110b6147c8d55410b23bca8205cff9ec). This allows them to be an equal rights citizen within the network without delegating trust to a third party. If you cannot self-host a node on your own, you’re going from trusting bankers to trusting a random person on the internet. That doesn’t seem so revolutionary, does it?
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; # How does such a network scale?
&gt; 
&gt; Let’s take the Internet as an example. The IP suite is a software protocol like Bitcoin. It originally had a monolithic design until we figured out that it could not scale without [layered architecture](https://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/~ptw/teaching/IWT/transport-layer/tcp-ip-layers.jpg). Bitcoin has undertaken a similar multi-layered approach to scaling in recent years.
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin’s base layer is the network layer protocol and the monetary settlement layer. Priorities for this layer are maximizing security and trust-minimization. Built on top of this is a payments layer called Lightning Network.
&gt; 
&gt; Lightning Network is a decentralized layer-2 network protocol that uses a native smart contract scripting language to enable instant, almost feeless, global [Bitcoin payments](https://imgur.com/2zUCL2b).
&gt; 
&gt; In Lightning Network, parties to a transaction are required only to have a sufficiently funded open channel active in the network. This is done through a single on-chain transaction.
&gt; 
&gt; If there is a direct channel open between the parties, the transaction is routed directly and incurs [no fee](https://preview.redd.it/esqddcdq10d71.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95c4cb49f6d3405594ee84a16c693b558daa0b18). Without a direct channel, the transaction is routed through routing nodes, incurring a small fee, typically no more than a few sats (fraction of a cent), paid to routing nodes hosted by users of the network.
&gt; 
&gt; You can find a live node map for Lightning Network [here](https://explorer.acinq.co/). It’s pretty remarkable how far Lightning Network has come in only 3 years.
&gt; 
&gt; With Lightning Network’s maturation as an infinitely scalable decentralized global payments network, Bitcoin is shifting focus to its next big milestone, Taproot, which is due to go live in mid-November at block height 709632.
&gt; 
&gt; Taproot brings [a set of protocols](https://bitcoinops.org/en/preparing-for-taproot/) that enhance Bitcoin’s privacy, scalability and unlocks the path for seamless integration of application protocols on top of Bitcoin while also ensuring that users are still able to economically run their own Bitcoin full node.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; # Game Theory of Bitcoin
&gt; 
&gt; Cypherpunks were pursuing the concept of Bitcoin, a decentralized P2P monetary system, for two decades. Satoshi completed the final, most important, piece of the jigsaw — solving the Byzantine Generals Problem to prevent double-spend.
&gt; 
&gt; In doing so, Satoshi sought to address two fundamental flaws with fiat money,
&gt; 
&gt; 1- Centralized, focused issuance and control of money supply and monetary policy
&gt; 
&gt; 2- Trivial cost of issuance
&gt; 
&gt; While issuance entails no cost, the money remains at the mercy of the basest of human qualities, self-seeking greed. All corruptive tendencies of fiat money are a direct consequence of the trivial cost to issue infinite money.
&gt; 
&gt; Satoshi’s proof-of-work algorithm solved for these two flaws by implementing [an ingenious cost of issuance algorithm](https://imgur.com/eFwM54J) that keeps every actor honest and forever scales in proportion to Bitcoin’s value as a monetary network —the higher Bitcoin's value, the higher the cost of issuance.
&gt; 
&gt; Proof-of-work requires those who acquire the new supply of coins (miners) to continually input real-world work for their rewards and cover recurring operational costs. The work ensures that those who receive the new supply of money cannot keep hoarding it for themselves. Miners are forced by the game theory embedded into the protocol to redistribute Bitcoin into the market.
&gt; 
&gt; Any monetary system [where the creation of money entails no work and cost](https://www.amazon.com/Ethics-Money-Production-Guido-H%C3%BClsmann/dp/1933550090) would be [fiat 2.0](https://imgur.com/g2MVTAy) all over again, a system where wealth equals power, where [the rich forever get richer and the poor get poorer](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/world-s-richest-become-wealthier-during-covid-pandemic-inequality-grows-n1255506).
&gt; 
&gt; In proof-of-work, wealth != power
&gt; 
&gt; Miners input work and recurring costs to find blocks and receive compensation for their work but the blocks are validated by full node users, not miners. Full nodes enforce the rules — accept or reject blocks found by miners — and hold the power to keep miners honest. Every full node user has one vote. Proof-of-work admits of no corruption or privileges.
&gt; 
&gt; A very large portion of the world’s population is affected by either hyperinflation and/or lack of banking services (c. 4 billion people). Bitcoin allows them to connect to an open, permissionless network to generate, store and exchange value where nobody can stop them. The combination of proof-of-work and economical self-hosted nodes distributed all across the world is what ensures Bitcoin's antifragility, securing the network from [state attacks](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/10/23221016/edward-snowden-china-banning-bitcoin-just-made-it-stronger).
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; # Bitcoin, a global leader in clean energy innovation
&gt; 
&gt; 20 years ago, [the Internet was boiling the oceans](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1999/0531/6311070a.html?sh=54f838642580). Today, it’s Bitcoin. In 20 years, the next emerging technology. Energy, in manifold forms, has always been fundamental to human interaction and its impact, an ineluctable consequence of human evolution.
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin is at once the most fundamentally important technological and monetary evolution for humanity. For the first time in human history, every human on earth can become financially sovereign, set free from the whims of other humans.
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin is a huge net positive for humanity and [a global leader in renewable energy innovation](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-large-scale-bitcoin-mining-is-driving-clean-energy-innovation-2021-01-06). The renewable energy share of the Bitcoin network is over 4 times that of the average grid. In 2020, renewable energy sources accounted for only about 12% of total U.S. energy consumption. [58% of global Bitcoin mining operations](https://imgur.com/98f7mSM) are powered by renewables.
&gt; 
&gt; According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), 66% of the primary energy used to create electricity is wasted by the time the electricity arrives at the customer meter. Bitcoin is able to [harness stranded/wasted energy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-07-01/bitcoin-mining-with-stranded-energy-video), while also mitigating the climate effects of other industries [by capturing flared gas](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/bitcoin-mining-flare-gas-btc-energy-crusoe-energy-coinbase-winklevoss-2021-6) that would otherwise be vented into the atmosphere contributing to climate change. Other industries find the cost of transporting energy prohibitive. With regards to coal, almost all of the coal-powered mining was happening in China. They’ve all [since been shut down](https://cbeci.org/mining_map).
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; # The quest for perfect money
&gt; 
&gt; What's money? Anything that’s accepted as representing value by the parties to any transaction. It’s really that simple. Three thousand years ago, cowrie shells were used to represent value. We’ve had [various forms of money](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/history-money/) since but the quest remains the same. Humans have always sought money that can hold value over time until it was required to purchase other things that hold value to them — goods and services.
&gt; 
&gt; If we look at money from this perspective, we could argue that money is technology but until now, we never had the technology to come up with a money that was able to fulfill all three functions of money — store of value (SoV), medium of exchange (MoE) and unit of account (UoA).
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin is at once a good SoV (scarce and incorruptible), a good MoE (the payments layer — Lightning Network), and a good UoA (infinite divisibility and instant portability across the world).
&gt; 
&gt; I view Bitcoin to be the culmination of humanity’s 7000-year technological quest to perfect the representation of value by truly democratizing its creation, distribution and exchange. Never before have we had a money with all the necessary properties of sound money. All previous forms of money had compromises.
&gt; 
&gt; Scarce money has always been sound money but previous iterations of scarce money lacked the [other properties](https://preview.redd.it/t1azmamjn0u71.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eeb96dbc2eb0e78bfaaca45fb2da5b10305848f1) required to be viable as MoE and UoA — fungible, readily portable, infinitely divisible, incorruptible, indestructible, provably finite and objectively verifiable.
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin ticks all the boxes. It further adds a new dimension to money hitherto unimaginable, obviating the need for trust, eliminating counterparty risk without the burden, cost and attendant inefficiencies of involving trusted middlemen.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; # Fiat money is a pyramid scheme
&gt; 
&gt; It would be remiss not to highlight at this time just how [inequitable](https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/nation-world/un-world-hunger-billionaires-elon-musk/67-329635e8-6602-4bd1-b607-781cfd9ba7e0) our current monetary system is and, something we don’t often speak of, the [jarring impact](https://i.imgur.com/kLSpP6B.jpeg) of inflation-driven compulsive consumerism on climate change.
&gt; 
&gt; The current system of credit constantly incentivizes you through a myriad of machinations to keep spending money from tomorrow’s labor, but the new injection of money from your tomorrow’s labor ends up being concentrated at the top, with the ultimate consequence of inequitably diminishing your purchasing power and continually enriching those at the top of the pyramid.
&gt; 
&gt; In short, money borrowed against your future labor ends up destroying your own purchasing power while the lender profits off your future labor, both in the form of interest and by being closer to the new money. It’s a double whammy. Fiat money post hoc undercuts the value of our work and time, except for the top 0.01%, some of whom [have seen their wealth grow almost 10-fold](https://inequality.org/great-divide/updates-billionaire-pandemic/) during a once-in-a-hundred-year global pandemic.
&gt; 
&gt; In 1971, President Nixon canceled the convertibility of the US dollar to gold. The subsequent collapse of the Bretton Woods system gave central banks absolute monetary authority as the dollar was no longer required to be backed by gold reserves.
&gt; 
&gt; Central banks’ newfound ability to continually manipulate supply, interest rates, and velocity of money has led to deleterious consequences. Perpetual expansion to spur illusory “economic growth” has sent deficits spiraling out of control and resulted in, inter alia, a vicious cycle of high inflation, recession as a consequence of efforts to mitigate the effects thereof and ever-increasing, now extreme, economic inequality.
&gt; 
&gt; I’ll just leave it [here](https://imgur.com/a/4LlWaKy) as to the enduring effects of the Nixon shock.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; # Triffin paradox
&gt; 
&gt; The Triffin paradox explains why any sovereign currency serving as a global reserve currency is unworkable — the state issuing the reserve currency is required to continually run up a deficit to meet the world’s demand for its currency. This creates a conflict of interest between domestic and international monetary policies, which becomes untenable in the long run, leading to the collapse of the system. The [average lifespan for reserve currencies](https://preview.redd.it/raj2vtkxn0u71.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bf93b12c22fda167d3108814d0a6b2b3fef5740) is 95 years.
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin is the only monetary system in history that has the properties to last forever, for, unlike all previous monetary systems, it doesn’t derive value from the authority or wealth of the issuer, which is fleeting, but a timeless universal constant — hard-coded mathematics.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; # Closing thoughts
&gt; 
&gt; I’d like to earnestly urge everyone to read mainstream articles about Bitcoin through a lens of scrutiny as to the interests of those who own these organizations. There’s an ongoing campaign to poison the well with blatant disinformation while simultaneously accumulating Bitcoin for themselves.
&gt; 
&gt; When you really burrow down the Bitcoin rabbit hole, you come to realize that Bitcoin is quite the culture shock, a monetary paradigm shift irreconcilable with the status quo sustained by immoderate expansion normalized through generational indoctrination of the rationally vulnerable to acquiesce to furtive post hoc theft of the value of their work and time, especially in the last 50 years post-Nixon shock.
&gt; 
&gt; Mainstream media organizations are owned by the banking establishment and beneficiaries of the fiat pyramid scheme [who stand to lose a lot of power](https://preview.redd.it/r5jquqfi31u71.png?width=1065&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68019bec64e17df45ef3f72c5e7c1d8e3b167e2e) if 8 billion people were to understand [the peaceful revolution](https://imgur.com/Y2rhS0w) that is Bitcoin.
&gt; 
&gt; There are no C-suites, marketing/PR teams in Bitcoin to manipulate public opinion or issue any official statements in rebuttal to intellectually dishonest journalism. Bitcoin keeps plowing along honestly, paying no mind to assorted naysayers motivated by self-interest seeking to further various agendas.
&gt; 
&gt; Tick.. tock.. next block..

&gt; 
&gt; I hope the irony of an organization chaired by a former Federal Reserve president decrying the concentration of wealth in Bitcoin while we do not have the ability to peer into an open ledger to scrutinize the concentration of wealth and the transactions of bankers in the fiat monetary system is not lost on anyone.

personalfinance,The question of life... how much house should I really buy?,"Been a long time Reddit user (lurker?), but never found a good reason to post.  Ironically personal finance is an area where I’d happily pay for guidance, but I’ve been led astray with underlying motivations (greed / commission) previously.  Figured Reddit would be a good place to ask for genuine holistic advice.

This post is huge… my apologies in advance.

**Background…**

My wife and I moved from Denver to a suburb of Indianapolis mid-2018.  Both of our families (parents and extended) live in Indiana, and I grew-up in the town adjacent to where we live now.  Our motivation behind moving was two-fold: 1) we were ready to consider having children and wanted them to have a relationship with their grandparents 2) the housing prices in Denver were climbing at exorbitant rates and home-ownership seemed impractical within the near future.  Moving “back home” was easy and comfortable - we knew exactly what we were getting into.

Our biggest complaint over the past three and a half years is exactly what we anticipated.  Our town-home in Denver was across the street from several local restaurants and walkable distance to a grocery store, the gym, parks and was roaring with culture.  There was never a lack of things to try or explore, and it felt like such things were so prevalent they were easy to come by (versus having to research and find them).  Our current location in Indiana can be chalked-up to a typical “wannabe-upscale” Midwestern town.  Sleepy, mostly Caucasian, fast food restaurants are popular among locals, folks seem to enjoy driving fancy cars &amp; having big houses as a status symbol while spending weekends in-front of their TV… I could go on and on.

A lot has transpired since moving.  I now have a beautiful and amazing 14 month-old daughter.  I’ve advanced in my career and am making more money, with another raise likely in the future (Q2 2022).  My wife has found a love for her new job, and is finally making pay equivalent to her salary in Denver.  COVID hit, and we jumped on the bandwagon of minor upgrades to our home.  Throughout this process, we began to realize that we’re a bit cramped-on space and would prefer to size-up just a bit when the time is right.  Once COVID restrictions lifted, our itch to get out and explore left us disappointed.  After a new Wendy’s began construction at the entrance of our neighborhood, the wife and I decided it wouldn’t hurt to start looking for a home in an area that aligns better with our wants.  We’ve been casually browsing for a few months, but nothing serious.  The housing market is extremely buyer adverse, and we want to make sure the move we make is somewhat permanent (10 years+).  We’ve even tossed around the idea of moving to Chicago, as the culture and overall vibe would better align with what we had in Denver (we particularly like the Roscoe Village area).

**Recent Events…**

My wife was bored and browsing home listings this weekend when she stumbled upon an open house in an area close to downtown Indianapolis that we both enjoy.  In the past year we’ve spent considerable time searching neighborhoods, driving around, and exploring different areas, giving us a good sense of what location within the Indy area would be an ideal fit.  I was reluctant to go… the price point was high, making it seem like a long-shot.  But with nothing better to do, we jumped in the car on Saturday and made our way over to the listing.

A gentlemen greeted me as I walked-in and introduced himself as the realtor and the general contractor of the renovation, which took me by surprise.  It was busy, and I didn’t want to waste his time on what I felt was a shot-in-the-dark opportunity, so I asked to look around and excused myself.  That’s when my perspective changed.  This place was f\*\*king GORGEOUS.  Every room I walked into outdid the pictures posted online, which never happens.  It was obvious there was care and detail put into the renovation… from the built-in reading nook in the bedroom to the cofferred ceilings in the kitchen to the outdoor landscaping.

Realizing this place was different from other open houses we’ve visited, I found myself curious and sparked up a conversation with the realtor.  The house was built in the 1930s and had a single owner.  A woman, who’s grandfather built the house, recently passed and her family decided to sell it to someone in the neighborhood.  Enter the realtor standing before me, who lives two streets over.  As a side-gig and hobby, he decided to purchase the house and take on a renovation project in partnership with his brother in-law, who is a carpenter by trade.  He showed me pictures of the house during construction as well as a list of local vendors he hand-selected to do the work, which was cataloged by trade.  The house was stripped down to the outer brick and sub-floor.  Walls were rebuilt, plumbing &amp; electrical was new, etc.  Other than the solid wood doors that were stripped-down and refinished, the realtor said the furnace and roof were the only items in the house that were not replaced.

I walked away in-awe.  This place ticked all the boxes we were looking for.  Charm of an older home, without the potential for hidden issues stemming from years of neglect.  Dedicated space for my office (I work from home, and my desk is currently pushed against the wall at the top of a stairway).  Not large, but enough room to grow into, while maintaining a sense of “coziness”.  A big enough back yard to host a cookout, but not so big where annual landscaping and upkeep becomes a burden.  And the biggest plus… location.  Blocks away from walking trails, local restaurants, coffee shops, theaters.  K-8 school is fantastic.  We spent some time walking around the neighborhood afterwards, and there were more dog walkers than I would expect on a cold rainy day.  Everyone greeted us with a “hi” and a smile, a few commenting on my daughter’s insistence on walking alongside us over being carried.  I find myself leaning toward pessimism for most home opportunities we happen-by, as the risk always seems greater than the reward.  I left feeling like this could be a home where my wife and I grow old together.

**The Conundrum…**

After venturing back home, we crunched some numbers and hit the stark reality that this probably wasn’t the right choice.  While we felt we could swing it financially, we didn’t want to be in a situation where we didn’t have the means to enjoy a moderately comfortable lifestyle while living in our new home.  After some internal debate and sleeping on it, we emailed the realtor back with a synopsis of our conclusion and thanked him for his time.  We figured that’s where the story would end.

Less than 24 hours later we received an response from the realtor that seemed very heartfelt and genuine.  He explained that the price was negotiable, and he wondered if we would be open to a conversation.  He cautioned that this would not be a hard sell, and we could cut ties at any time.  He continued by offering to sell our current house without charging commission, and mentioned that he felt there may be other opportunities for him to help once he understood our position.  The email ended with the realtor commenting on our conversation at the open house, mentioned a connection he felt with our family, and that would really enjoy having us as neighbors.

We figured there was no material downside to a chat, and agreed to talk with the agent - which is scheduled for tonight.  This got me thinking - he’s probably going to ask the obvious question of a price point that we would be comfortable entertaining.  I don’t want to go into the conversation ignorant, especially if the resulting difference in price is a non-starter and further conversations would just waste everyone’s time.

**The Facts…**

* I’ve always taken a conservative approach to personal finance, and honestly no longer have a good sense of “living within means” and “living on the edge”.  Here’s our situation.
* Combined gross annual income (base pay only): \~$240K
* Combined additional variable bonus (usually receive in full):  \~$20K
* Debt includes one car payment ($630/mo) and student loan payments ($450/mo).  No credit card debt, or anything like that.
* We have $75K in “savings”, which are currently held as mutual funds.
* My wife and I both max out our 401K contributions to the IRS limit.  However, we do not further invest in IRAs, etc. other than a College Choice 529 for our daughter.
* We’ve got about $40K in our checking account, which is divvied up into buckets (think Dave Ramsey’s envelope method) for specific categories (e.g. auto maintenance costs, annual insurance payments, etc).
* Remaining balance on current mortgage is \~$300K, and our house is likely valued at $400K minimum.  Comps have a high of $450K and a median of $420K. 
* Current mortgage payment is \~$2400/mo on a 15 year mortgage.
* New house is listed for $895K.

*Net Result*

* Would need to take-out a 30 year mortgage instead of a 15 year
* Would want to put 20% down payment to avoid PMI, which would include the equity on our house and most of our savings 
* The mortgage payment consumes extra “roll over” money that we’ve always had after doing our monthly budget.  Our budget is based on a comfortable lifestyle, and we rarely dip into this “roll over” cash unless we decide to go on a shopping spree or something.  Additionally, some of our debt is near payoff and I’ve also factored in complete payment of my wife’s grad school tuition, which should only last 18 months.  I anticipate we’ll be back into a surplus of our budget monthly again when she completes her degree.

*Potential Scenario*

* Sale of current home for $400K, with $100K in equity
* Purchase of new home for $850K
* Down payment of 20% amounts to $170K - $100K from equity + $70K from mutual funds
* New mortgage principal of $680K with interest rate of 2.75% = $3650/mo (including taxes &amp; escrow) on a 30 year mortgage.
* Closing costs (estimate $20K) may need to dip into checking if current equity isn’t larger than $100K

**Questions…**

1. If I’m not completely misunderstanding how things work, there is a conflict of interest in the realtor also being the homeowner.  This could actually work out in our favor - maybe there’s larger room for negotiation given his profit share?  I’m skeptical that this conflict of interest circumvents a natural checks-and-balances on things like market price… should I be worried?
2. I’m concerned about throwing all of our savings at a new house.  The peace of mind in knowing that nest egg was there if something catastrophic happened was very comforting.  I also think it’ll take a long time to build up that savings again - maybe a decade or more.
3. Is this a bad investment?  I’m worried the housing market is going to “crash”, and our new home will be valued at much less than we pay after we’ve signed the paperwork.  I’d be less concerned about investing our savings into the house if I knew it could pay off with appreciation of some sort in the long run.
4. Overall thoughts? Is entertaining something like a $850K realistic for the seller?  Is this an overall bad idea, on our part?

defi,"DeFi is a threat to the centralized banking sector, not only because of the financial outcomes, but also for the fact that investors are considered more than “just another client”.","First of all, the banking system, worldwide, has been existing for hundreds of years, which literally gives it the power it has today. Individuals had no chance before as banks were the only place where one could invest their money in order to make profits. But honestly, is 0.5% a real profit? I mean now, banks literally trigger me with those “high” interest rates lmfao. 

But I don’t want to talk about the fact that DeFi’s returns are much higher than what banks offer. DeFi projects actually operate differently. Banks never thought of doing what’s best for clients. I mean who the hell would want a bank to control their capital, make billions and give them what’s not even a fraction of that profit?

Decentralized finance projects are giving investors the chance to be a part of the decision-making about their investments. I mean governance tokens, like BIT, allow investors to actually vote on what project they want BitDAO to undertake. For example, recently BitDAO’s community voted and decided to finance EduDAO, which will support universities. Does any bank offer anything similar to that? Surely not.

I believe banks, corporations, centralized financial institutions, and everything between them will try to steal what DeFi is about and try to attract more investors, but what we’re betting on is the fact that the next generations are actually educated, and they know that those bankers are only getting greedier. 

Not to forget that in 2021, more than 31% of the world’s population is unbanked. Does this mean we’re witnessing a new era?",cryptocurrency

***Apologies for no recap yesterday, I was traveling all day back home to spend Christmas with my parents***

The market staged a comeback on Tuesday, with all three major indexes rising more than 1% as market participants digested news of federal involvement to help mitigate the spread of Omicron and the imminent authorization of an at-home COVID treatment.

The Biden administration announced it was buying 500 million at-home rapid coronavirus tests that Amercians will be able to order online for free starting in January. This comes following a report that Omicron has now become the dominant variant in the US, accounting for roughly 73% of all cases reported last week.

New COVID-19 cases rose 9% in the United States in the past week but are up 57% since the start of December, according to a Reuters tally. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-20/omicron-surges-to-nearly-three-quarters-of-u-s-virus-cases](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-20/omicron-surges-to-nearly-three-quarters-of-u-s-virus-cases)

Moreover, the White House will deploy 1,000 military personnel to assist at hospitals as capacity starts filling up.   The number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients has increased 26% this month, with hospitals in some areas already strained by the Delta variant that emerged earlier this year, according to that same Reuters tally.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is in charge of approving and regulating new medications, is expected to authorize the Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK) coronavirus treatment pills this week.

Last week, Pfizer reported that its COVID pill showed near 90% efficacy in preventing hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients, and recent lab data suggests the drug retains its effectiveness against the fast spreading Omicron variant of the coronavirus.

[https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-set-authorize-pfizer-merck-covid-19-pills-this-week-bloomberg-news-2021-12-21/](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-set-authorize-pfizer-merck-covid-19-pills-this-week-bloomberg-news-2021-12-21/)

Meera Pandit, global market strategist at JP Morgan, said “On the virus side, ultimately what we’ve seen with prior surges and prior variants is that market sell-offs tend to be somewhat contained to a period of time, so we do expect that as we get better and better at dealing with some of these challenges from the economic and market perspective, things will likely settle down despite some of the public health challenges we have ahead.”

In other news, market participants are also processing an unexpected blow to Biden's economic agenda after Senator Joe Manchin (D., W. Va.) quashed the administration’s long-deliberated Build Back Better Act, citing concerns about inflation, the national debt and ongoing pandemic.

Looking ahead, there is tons of important economic coming out:

* Wednesday - The Conference Board is set to release its latest consumer confidence index, expected to show an only modest uptick for the month of December.
* Thursday - Bureau of Economic Analysis will publish Personal Consumption Expenditures, the Fed’s preferred measurement for inflation. Consensus data compiled by Bloomberg showed PCE is projected to climb at a 0.6% month-over-month rate in November.

**Highlights**

* President Joe Biden in remarks Tuesday afternoon said he was considering a reversal of recent travel restrictions in light of Omicron
* AT&amp;T Inc said on Tuesday it was selling its advertising unit, Xandr, to Microsoft. Xandr was created in 2018 through the acquisition of an ad exchange and a TV ad tech company to use data collected from phone, internet and TV services to target consumers.
* Following the blocking infrastructure bill, Goldmans Sachs (GS) and Mark Zandi, chief economists at Moody’s, cut US GDP forecasts for 2022.
* Moody’s, one of the main credit ratings agencies in the US, once again gave Apple the highest ‘AAA’ credit
* The EU approved Microsoft’s (MSFT) $16 billion acquisition of Nuance, an AI-powered text to speech company
* Workers at a Starbucks (SBUX) store in Seattle, the coffee giant’s hometown, say they aim to unionize, adding momentum to the organizing efforts at the chain.
* Global merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activity shattered all-time records in 2021,  $5 trillion for the first time ever, with volumes rising 63% to $5.63 trillion by Dec. 16, according to Dealogic data, easily surpassing the pre-financial-crisis record of $4.42 trillion in 2007.
* Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd has received approval from Taiwan's investment commission to set up a chip manufacturing plant in Japan.
* Alphabet Inc's YouTube began restoring access to Walt Disney Co channels on its platform on Sunday, after the companies reached a distribution agreement to end a two-day blackout.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Why are people given the impression of Crypto being complicated when it is far more simpler than the confusing mess that is the banking system?,"Crypto as a currency is super simple. You download an online wallet, or buy a physical wallet, and bam! you have an account where you can receive, send and stake just like every other user on the network. Everyone is equal and the network is simple. 

Compare this to making a bank account. You have to give banks A LOT of your personal information, put in a deposit in order to have an account and then you have lots of types of bank accounts each being different and the overall system being like a hierarchy and confusing. Oh, and you also have to deal with banks interfering with your day-to-day transactions and meddling with your finances. You also get a measly 0.25% interest on your deposit if you are lucky while the interest rate is 7%.

TLDR: Crypto might be a little hard to figure out at first for non techy people, however it is way simpler, equal and more methodical compared to the mess you have to face when creating and maintaining a bank account.",cryptocurrency

algorand,STBL is a coupon that launders money?,"STBL is AlgoFi's stablecoin. But it isn't exactly stable, is it? Right now it is trading at 0.95 USDC. So why is that?

The idea with USDC is that Circle actually holds the dollars. You could in theory go to Circle and give them a USDC in exchange for a dollar.

But what about STBL? Can you go to AlgoFi and ask them for a dollar in exchange for their STBL? It wouldn't be the first time I am wrong today, but I don't think so! STBL is minted because AlgoFi is holding collateral from other lenders.

STBL is an IOU note from AlgoFi. It is a promise to pay a dollar back to AlgoFi. It is a coupon on which AlgoFi wrote ""this is a dollar. Trust me bro."" If you buy STBL, you are not buying a dollar. You are buying a coupon that someone could use to pay their debt to AlgoFi... yes, a bit of a mindstorm there! Meanwhile they are enjoying using leverage from their loan, while you the STBL holder are left holding coupons.

You see, the only purpose of STBL is to pay a debt or trading it away for a different asset that has utility. That creates a massive downward pressure on the price of STBL relative to USDC and Algo.

And as USDC interest rates increase, people start to prefer borrowing STBL instead. They would rather have 2% interest than 25%, right? And what do they do with that STBL? They swap it to USDC, creating more downward pressure on STBL.

And here is where things get crazy. After swapping STBL for USDC, you can lend the USDC in AlgoFi. Then you can use that as collateral to borrow more STBL, swap for USDC and lend that. This creates a feedback cycle that generates income for AlgoFi, lenders, and devalues STBL. This allows someone to lend way more USDC than they should be able to and all at a fixed interest rate of 2%. It is not quite an infinite money laundering machine, but it is a feedback loop.

Bitcoin,The year is 2031,"The year is 2031. The world economy was able to ride the highs of the 2021 pandemic, allowing the debt and economy to keep building up. Alas, a recession occurs as it always does once every decade or so, and the damage has taken its toll back in 2029, a bit earlier than expected. G20 countries don’t know what went wrong; they all thought that printing more money to expand the economy was the right thing to do, but somehow they thought this time it’s different. Except, this time was no different.

Citizens of all countries are ready for change. They realize that this fiat game was all a facade, and by 2030 everybody realized that the jig is up. Institutional investors, the wealthy, and family offices have already converted a majority of their net worth into Bitcoin, and governments are trying desperately to pull believers back into the fiat world, but to no avail.

Bitcoin is at $2.5 million as of December 21st, 2031 (just at around a $50 trillion market cap). Bitcoin has officially been the worlds most pristine collateral asset. While the interest rates for a mortgage on a home in the United States is at 0.5%, Bitcoin interest rates are substantially lower at 0.01% simply due to its demand and its collateral value. Housing as an investment and means of accruing wealth seemed like a thing of the past, as the worlds wealthy has already sold their real estate portfolio and put it into Bitcoin a few years ago.

The largest Bitcoin wallet aside from Satoshi Nakamoto belongs to Michael Saylor, who has amassed 500,000 bitcoins. All other altcoins are at the whim of Bitcoin, with the second coin Ethereum barely reaching a $2T market cap in 2029 before dropping down to $1 billion from Michael Saylor buying a bunch of ether to pump up the price only to dump it all on the market and convert it to BTC to accrue more BTC.

In this final stage of the fiat regime, there is no choice but for governments to use Bitcoin as a parallel universe to the fiat system to unload debt and transition to a sound money protocol that gives a glimpse of hope into the future for generations to come.",cryptocurrency

# Raoul Pal AMA Overview

&amp;#x200B;

On Dec 16th, Raoul Pal did an AMA to promote Real Vision’s new Crypto Pro platform. In the hour-long video, he spoke of several topics, including crypto regulations, macroeconomic trends, and risk to the sector. Below is an quick overview.

 

**The FED and Rates**

Pal predicts inflation will curb economic growth in 2022, and the central bank **will forgo raising rates** when economic data does not coincide with their predictions. He points out that bond yields, often utilized to predict GDP and interest rate changes, remain unconvinced with the central bank’s upcoming rate forecast. Lower rates are generally considered positive for crypto. I covered the latest FOMC announcement in this report a few days ago.

**Regulations**

Pal seems unconcerned with the hard stance that regulators such as Gary Gensler are exhibiting and explains it’s a negotiating tactic. He foresees crypto entities and regulators meeting somewhere in the middle when proceedings are hammered out. Pal mentions the most significant risk to stablecoins is an unforeseen one: the un-banking of Circle, the issuer of USDC.

**Institutional Investments**

Pal addresses a question on intuitional investment that leads to his 2022 predictions. Institutional grade investors are not widely concerned with crypto disrupting their sector but instead see it as an opportunity vehicle. Banks, the middleman of transactions, are the most likely to fight adoption in self-preservation.

Asset allocators are in the process of closing their books for the year and rebalancing positions before the holiday. These investors will likely reopen balance sheets starting in early 2022. In addition, many institutions have assembled crypto mandates which will also take effect in Q1. Pal predicts that the beginning of the year will be very bullish for these reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;“Crypto is the largest Marco lay-up in all of history.” — Raoul Pal.

Pal is a huge proponent of crypto, and his experience and views are well-respected in finance and crypto alike, including myself. He lays out predictions with a grain of salt and advises preparation for various scenarios, but his conviction of major long-term adoption is adamant.

Pal is not the only crypto figure to predict a possible strong Q1 next year. Others include TA specialist Ben Cowen and Messari CEO Ryan Selkis via his 2022 thesis report. I say “possible” because true experts don’t take hard stances on market predictions. Instead, they follow data and prepare for the event they are correct. We should do the same.

&amp;#x200B;

 

# Crypto Market Update

&amp;#x200B;

**Bitcoin** shows promising signs by breaking out of the downward trendline beginning Dec 7th. However, don’t become too optimistic yet. Bitcoin will likely test the support a few times before a possible rebound. **Bitcoin is up 3.87% to 48.6k**.

**Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D)** is up **+.50% to 40.66%**. BTC.D refuses to drop below 40% as another trend up could be in store indicative of a strong preference of BTC vs. alts in the short-term.

**Ethereum Dominance (ETH.D)** is **down -1.50% to 21.05%.** The 20% level will be an interesting level to monitor. It took Ethereum 200 days to break this well-tested level.

**Terra (LUNA)** is up a strong +**6.34%**. Don’t be hesitant in taking some profits in LUNA at these levels. I remain bullish on the long-term potential of LUNA, but there may be some corrections in the short term. **LUNA** has been up 65% in the past seven days.

**Render Network (RNDR)** is **up +31%** today on news of a successful funding round to include some important Venture Capital firms. Render is my preferred method to play the Metaverse trend — more info on the funding round in the news section below.

Notable performers (7d)

* **YEARN +77%**
* **SPELL +67%**
* **HLM +40%**
* **MATIC +26%**
* **AVAX +49%**
* **HBAR +36%**
* **AR +47%**
* **ONE +41%**

It’s a healthy sign to see the market pushing up quality projects.

# NEWBIES’ Lesson of the day.

**Metamask crash course. Get your free airdrop!**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ye7c8e6q20781.png?width=474&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a35066f37ae9d3c629b8b687d618593b3699222

*Take all actions at your own risk. Start small, DYOR, and store your keys in a safe location.*

I will write about Metamask in my NEWBIES section today for two reasons. First, there are rumors Metamask will have an airdrop very soon. An airdrop is a distribution of tokens to users. You get free tokens for being an early user. Airdrops are common in crypto, and there have been a few that have rewarded users substantially. For example, Uniswap airdropped early users 400 UNI tokens which equated to $6k in today’s value. In November, Ethereum Name Service, the .eth domain DAO, airdropped users up to 1000 ENS tokens, which equated up to $80k. I know it sounds crazy, but that’s crypto. And this is your chance to collect your first airdrop.

Metamask is one of the most widely utilized crypto wallets on the market, with 21 million worldwide users, and can be used on various networks, including Ethereum, Binance, Avalanche, Fantom, Harmony, and many more. In addition, it’s easy to use and was my preferred method of testing out protocols in my early crypto days. Oh, and it’s completely free to download.

I’d recommend watching this video before you download Metamask.

* [Coin Bureau’s Metamask Step-by-Step guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfkqgXNPiHg&amp;t=25s)

You can then download METAMASK here:

* [https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/)

Make a few transactions using METAMASK to be eligible for the airdrop. I’d recommend using Harmony one network (ONE), Binance Smart Chain (BNB), or Polygon (MATIC). These networks are easy to use and cost pennies to make transactions.

Make a few small transactions (less than $5) on SUSHISWAP. Here is a tutorial:

* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSnhi68uMcc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSnhi68uMcc)

Number one rule: STORE YOUR KEYS IN A SAFE PLACE!

Now stick back and wait for your airdrop. We’ll keep our fingers crossed it’s a considerable amount, no guarantees!

&amp;#x200B;

 

Thanks for reading today. I hope you enjoyed the content. I’m always open to suggestions, so feel free to message me.

College B - is in FL

Student (AES/PHEAA) - I attended a total of two schools for college. College A and College B. I did the majority of my studies in College A and that is where a big chunk of my loans accumulated from (Private and Federal). I started attending College B in order to finish my degree. After doing the required credits, I was in a position to transfer my credits back to College A in order to graduate. **HOLD**. Apparently, the advisor I spoke with at College B thought I was a full-time student (was VERY clear that I was not and that I was transferring out) and due to this error, I apparently received too much money from College B, and had to pay them back. Ok, so I pay them back the $5K they claimed I owed.  **HOLD**, a loan that was under College A went into default and because of that loan status, College B will not release my transcripts to me. I am in the process now of going into loan rehabilitation with the private loan, but that takes up to 9 months. This whole issue has made me lose a really good job opportunity, my degree has absolutely nothing to do with the job I applied for, all experience was gained with my previous employer, but because I have no proof of a degree, I lost out. Right now with the fee's the loan is at $15K (they say once I get through the 9month period it will return to $12K) .

&amp;#x200B;

Credit Card (DISCOVER) - In short 2019 was hectic for me. I had a very difficult move and crazy life things occurred...like everything that could've gone wrong did,  and now I am sitting on $5K of credit card debt.  I have been trying to bring this amount down for at LEAST a year and a half but due to my job and how I was getting paid I was never able to put a true dent in it, without getting charged a fee that just threw any progress I had out the window. I have to spend my money very carefully because at the time I was just making it with rent, phone, internet, water, car note, insurance (health and car), and pet expenses. I was only able to pay the minimum every month. Had the job mentioned above worked out, a lot of my woes could've been taken care of to an extent. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am at a loss as to what I should do. I would really love if I had the ability to take out a loan for like maybe $18K so I can just make some sort of progress, but as you can imagine my credit isn't that great. At the time I quit my other job because I had signed the papers for this other better paying job and then this is when this whole school thing came up. I honestly didn't know it was as bad as it was until they ran a background check and I couldn't access anything---at the time I was under the impression that transcripts were sent over to College A. I'm currently working a contract job and looking for a little part-time job to just help me make some sort of financial headway in all of this. 

My question is: should I go HARD with trying to bring down/pay off my credit card? SO I can maybe get a loan to take care of the Private Student Loan?

These two things are  really impacting my credit score and overall life progress in a major way and I'd really like to fix it. I have had some financial relief since moving back in with my parents and thankfully they don't require me to pay rent...but I do have all of my other bills to take care of...I get paid decently but it's not enough to make as much of an impact as id like. Because life tends to hit me hard at times, I have no savings, and lol my contract job is up in February unless they extend my time. I'm currently looking for another job but I can only find so/so work with my lack of degree at the moment. 

Any advice on what the hell I should do or just well wishes would be appreciated!",finance
personalfinance,Should I get a debt consdolidation loan?,"Really stressing out about my past financial decision. I'm $12,500 deep in credit card debt and I don't make enough money to pay it off to be able to use it again. (For example, one of my credit cards has a limit of $5700, it's at $5900, I only have $50 to put into it, which is an absolute waste and I need that money for gas, groceries, etc). I have a full time job and got paid today but I don't have enough excess money after bills to put a dent into this debt. I was thinking I could get a loan and use it to put all my credit cards to $0 and then I only have to worry about the loan. I'm afraid of my accounts closing, or going to collectors, etc. Is there a better way to go about this or should I just go with the loan?

Additional Info:

I've been doing research and trying to pre-qualify for loans but my credit is so bad (less than 600) no one will accept me. I have an apple card (among 3 others) so my interest rate is pretty high (around 16% for Apple). Just need some advice...I'm not sure what to do and I know almost nothing about finance. I have a budget but it really only helps me set aside money for bills rather than having enough to pay off all this debt. Thanks for any advice",finance

Metapoly is the first decentralized metaverse land tycoon that helps you drive investment in the Metaverse. With the recent successes of NFTs, it’s clear as day that the things the world terms as valuable are changing. With Metapoly, you get to be at the vanguard of that change.

**How does it work:**

1. Let’s imagine this as a land-bank name “Globabank”. Globabank is just like any other bank that “owns” the title/ownership of the “assets” in the bank’s balance sheet.
2. Globabank offers the customers a very attractive interest rate % for them to sell their land deed to Globabank treasury.
3. In return, Globabank offers you a certificate of ownership; via D33D token, as a right to govern the Globabank itself.
4. And anyone can own this token as a governance right to this Globabank.

personalfinance,HVAC replacement financing,"Alright so, my furnace died, and its below freezing outside.

**The Important Details:**  
I probably need to finance (depending on what I decide to do) $4k-$13k to replace my furnace and maybe a/c too (depending what I decide to do, a few details below). I have ""excellent"" credit (760 TU, 789 FICO). My only loan currently is the mortgage.  


I realize I have quite a few different options to me but, I have some specific questions.

**The Questions:**  
1) I know that a Home Equity loan has traditionally been a pretty low interest rate but, I know that when applying for credit, I always get asked a bazillion times if I have one of those. Can someone explain to me exactly how that affects my credit and my future credit applications? And, similar question for a HELOC (since its a similar thing).  
2) I'm kinda torn on what to do with the interest rate vs loan term problem... Are any of my potential options likely to have penalties for paying stuff off early even if I do a 7 (random number) year payback or whatever? (there are other options but, the ones off the top of my head are, equity loan, heloc, and personal loan. Technically mortgage refinance is probably an option but, I refinanced like 8 months ago so, rates aren't significantly lower currently so, my gut tells me that would not necessarily be ideal). But basically I'd like a low monthly payment, but I'd like to be able to pay it off faster once things settle a bit more than they are right now for me.  
3) Anything big I've not really mentioned? I know there are like government home improvement loans but, not sure how much of a hassle that would be to even attempt. 

**Somewhat irrelevant details, but people will probably ask so**:  
The expected repairs on my 18 year old furnace, will be *at least $*1500 (before they can even test more to find other things wrong with it), and its in the range for the end of its lifespan anyway, so I'm seriously considering instead, replacing the furnace entirely and putting that money to that use. Furthermore my a/c unit is also the same age and pretty ineffective (when its 100 outside, if I'm running the a/c full time -- which is not cheap-- and the lowest it can possibly manage is 92 degrees inside).  
Furthermore, because based on what I've read in other similar posts, people are going to ask; no I don't already have the savings for a replacement. Bought the home 2.5 years ago, and got a divorce a year ago and decided I wanted to keep the house despite the fact that I would be house poor for a while. Fortunately, the appraisal value of the home has gone up 60% since purchasing it (and +25% since refinancing in the divorce), so, for me, appears to be worth it so far. So, I don't want to hear about how I should have saved ahead of time or should wait till I can pay for it outright or whatever, I just want my question answered please and thank you.",finance
personalfinance,"Wife started 1099, I’m W2, file jointly and have questions (TX)","I’m seeing through my research that we need to make quarterly tax payments (first one would be in Jan since she just started getting income in Oct/nov right?)

1. How much do I need to set aside to cover her federal and Medicare/Social security? Our marginal tax rate will be 22% this year and most likely next year. 

2. If we never get to itemize deductions as the standard is always more than enough, do I still track her expenses from the 1099 work to reduce her taxable income?

I’ve been setting aside 30% so far.",finance
personalfinance,Save up enough money to avoid PMI or get a mortgage now before interest rates go up next year?,"I’d really like to buy a house in the next year or two so I can get out of the rental game, I have enough money saved up right now to probably afford a 10% down payment on an FHA loan (my credit isn’t great but I don’t have any current collections at least). I can probably save enough for 20%+ in my market over the next 6-12 months so I can get out of PMI however it seems like interest rates are going to start climbing in the near term. My question is would it be better in the long term to get a loan while interest rates are still really low or would avoiding PMI be more beneficial?",finance

18. Charles drops a video on the eToro user limitations. It sounds like IOHK knew nothing about this. Interacting with exchanges falls in the Cardano Foundation’s wheelhouse. It’s unclear whether the CF knew anything. He also pointed out it’s very interesting that an old line exchange like Bitstamp has decided to LIST Cardano during this same period. Charles also mentioned that they haven’t seen any regulatory activity on IOHK’s end. eToro is a relatively small source of liquidity for Cardano and there shouldn’t be much of an impact.

As expected, the questions from some of the House Committee members belied a misplaced focus on things like terrorist financing while others understood the need to regulate crypto appropriately so that crypto innovation is not forced offshore. There was significant focus on stablecoins due to the President’s Working Group placing so much focus there. One representative also chose to focus heavily on the energy consumption of Bitcoin mentioning coal power plants coming back on line to fuel Bitcoin mining. The witnesses from the crypto industry seemed to focus on dispelling misconceptions and also pushing for a single crypto focused regulatory body as opposed to the fragmented regulation that is typical in Washington.

personalfinance,Received a hospital bill 2 weeks before undergoing a spinal fusion surgery. I could do nothing about it and the bill was sent to a collection agency. No income and no idea what to do,"During the tail end of 2020, I learned I had a desiccated disc and was told surgery might end up being inevitable - and it ultimately did. Since I didn't have insurance, I had to go through a ton of hoops to try and get approval for a spinal fusion surgery. Up until July, I received nothing but bad news, but during June, I applied for Medicaid and was approved and the coverage became active in July.

Although I was still able to walk around, if I sat upright even for just thirty minutes, it would disrupt my bodily functions for days. I was terrified of facing permanent nerve damage and I tried to do everything I could to push the issue and receive help. When my Medicaid coverage became active, my PCP told me I would finally be able to get the surgery approved. Meanwhile, I was going days without urinating. I ultimate gave in to my fear and wound up going to a hospital.

During the first visit, absolutely nothing happened and the doctor practically scoffed at my insistence that I needed help. On the second visit, the doctor put in an order for a CT scan and said he would send it to a neurologist to overlook it. I made an attempt to tell him I happened to bring a CD-R with a previous CT scan that he could use, but he ignored me. After waiting a few hours, the doctor returned and told me my condition wasn't bad enough to be rushed to surgery.

Two months later. I receive a bill in the mail for both visits. Nearly $2,000 in total. I asked numerous people what I should do about it, and I was repeatedly told that it would be tossed back and forth between my insurer and the hospital. As I was waiting for things to play out, I received another letter notifying me that my bill had been sent off to a collection agency.

From here, I called the agency and informed them of the situation. Apparently, the hospital I went to sent incorrect information, and this lead to some sort of issue. I gave them my Medicaid info and figured things would work out. Weeks later, the agency called me about the bill again, and after asking about the insurance, I was told that I wasn't eligible for coverage at the time of the visits, so I had to pay the full amount.

...and I'm panicking. I have no income, and because of the spinal fusion I had, I am nowhere near healthy enough to go out and seek employment. [I read on this thread that if you make under a certain amount of money, the hospital legally has to pay your medical bills.](https://old.reddit.com/r/BeAmazed/comments/kzl2wc/if_you_make_under_a_certain_amount_of_money_the/) But I didn't find this info until after the bill had been sent to the collection agency. so I just don't know. I'm so confused. I ONLY went to the hospital because my Medicaid coverage became active. and somehow, I wasn't eligible for a hospital visit. I don't get it.",finance

personalfinance,"Grandmother recently passed and left my mother her home, my mother is worried if she'll be able to keep it.","My grandmother just recently passed, and left a TOD that gave my mother everything, including her home which she also lives in.

My grandmother had a damn near perfect credit score, and was able to get a fantastic interest rate on the mortgage. My mother is just recently retired and her income is ~half of what it was when she was working. She's also had a bankruptcy about 4 years ago, and has since got her credit back into the mid 700's. 


My mother is worried that the bank, a FCU, may force her to refinance with an interest rate that's way too high to keep the house. To my knowledge, my grandmother put my mother on the deed before she passed, but I am not sure which kind of deed they had made up. 


We are in contact with an elder law attorney, but because of the holidays he's not returning calls; other attorney's are either on holiday or not accepting appointments until after the 1st. We have not received the death certificate yet, but the mortgage is due, as well as her credit card. She's afraid if she goes to the bank to try to deal with bills; that they would try to take advantage of her and get her to sign something she shouldn't. She has access to my grandmother's bank accounts, but afraid to draw from them to pay the mortgage, since the bank has not been notified of my grandmother's passing yet ( no death certificate atm either). 


My questions are basically: Can the bank force my mother to refinance to match the current market or my mother's current income, or can she just keep paying the mortgage as usual. And can she still use my grandmother's account to pay my grandmother's bills? Would the bank just kick my mother out of the house if she's lives there as well?

personalfinance,"What should I do with an extra $40,000?","I currently have my money at a credit union account my parents opened for me like 20 years ago. I'm 30, if this is important.

  I have an emergency fund of $15,000, a checking account of $8,000, a $5000 CD (which was a mistake but somehow, no one there knows how to withdraw the money from it), and another savings account of $40,000 there that had a higher introductory interest rate that ends this month.   I have my Roth IRA separate from all this so my question doesn't really pertain to retirement unless you think I should move the money to retirement.

Anyway, I'm not making as much in interest off the $40,000 in savings as I feel like I could make.  I've read that Ally bank has high interest rates but I've never switched banks.  I'm afraid that I'll screw it up and lose money or not get paid or something else that I don't even know will go wrong.  

I make about $15 in interest every month on the $40,000 and maybe $8 a month on the emergency fund.  The CD is an absolute joke and has only made about $60 in three years but I've tried calling and emailing multiple times about it and no one can figure out how to close it.  

I guess I'm just looking for advice on where to put this money or if I should just leave it alone.

CryptoCurrency,"Taking a loan for crypto, and why you should do it if you can","I'm a little pissed off by peoples saying ""DON'T TAKE A LOAN"" or so.

A loan is good, and the interest rate is currently attractive worldwide. It's just about manage the risks.

Let say you take a $10k loan for 10y. With a 0% interest rate it's around $83 per month.

The main questions are:

\- Do you have a stable income ?

\- How much are you ready to eventually lose per month in case the plan is going wrong ? Is a $10k debt on 10y not a big deal ?

\- Are the gains higher than the risk ?

\- What crypto are you targeting ? BTC or ETH seems the best long term options for safety.

\- Will you use a collateral for your loan ?

\- Will you just hodl (safer) or use DeFis (more risks) ?

Obliviously you should only listen at yourself and deal with what you have.

Let say even if 10y from now BTC goes half it value (we know it won't happen), you only have $7.5k to refund at the end.

So please stop saying to not doing it, that a lack of knowledge.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin price is not moved by whales.,"This just hit me.

We all know here that Fiat has its value because we all believe in that value. I also started to understand more about human nature recently with some books i've read and some conclusion i reached was: We all love stories. 

That's literally what holds us together from mass murdering everyone and also what feds the economy. Bitcoin is not anymore a matter of ""will it happen?"" but really a matter of when.

Most of us here believe in Bitcoin not because of its price or its capacity to go to the moon, but because we believe in what bitcoin stands for. The collective market then will give bitcoin it's deserved price. So in a way, if we have so much volatility, it's because we still have paperhands that don't believe fully in crypto or bitcoin. It's still a matter of when since Bitcoin kept crushing all expectation of him dying. Slowly but surely people will start to realize that we get an asset free of government control, that will go up and can't really get crushed. 

The problem is the masses that still believe crypto are scam, but give it 10 years or so, and we will attain what we want. :D",cryptocurrency

cybersecurity,Thought from a Hiring Manager: Experience &amp; Interest Trumps - Certifications &amp; Multiple Degrees,"I've been in tech a long time both in defense and financial sector and there seems to be some serious misconceptions amongst many posters here regarding certifications, cyber security as a major and graduate degrees

some quick rules

* Don't be a certification chaser and anything from EC Council is hot garbage
* Experience Trumps certifications
* Do not major in cyber security as an undergraduate
* A Masters Degree in cyber security is not for entry level professionals

Now here is the reasoning why

**Certifications**

Certifications are meant to complement your experience as you progress through your career, they are not a replacement for experience and there are very few entry level certifications.

If you have less than 5 years experience working or are a recent college graduate and have a dozen certs, I don't want you on my team, because you are likely a cert chaser. I have seen far too many of these over the years. This type of candidate has a bunch of certs, they will think entry level work is beneath them and are dead set on being CISO before they even have any experience in an org. They will always chase the next thing and will never stick to a role for any significant period of time and thus, will never gain any real deep experience

Having a bunch of unrelated certifications DOES NOT make you a more marketable candidate

Please for the love of god stop giving EC Council any money, nobody takes them seriously and they are a complete joke amongst INFOSEC professionals. If you only have CEH, I am not letting you anywhere near a pentest

NO you should not get your CISSP in college. That's designed for career professionals interested in management it is not entry level at all and is not going to help you get a technical role

Some financial advice, do not pay for SANs courses out of pocket. They are decent, but expensive, let your employer pay for those 

good certs while in school or starting out are : CompTIA - Security+ and Network+

**Undergraduate Major**

Stay away from ""Cyber"" as a major, much like ""Intelligence Studies"" these were a response by US schools to jump on the post 9/11/01 bandwagon of trying to go after money from the federal government to place people in the DoD/Intel community. Many of the schools offering these majors are garbage

some examples

American Military University

Capella University

Colorado Christain University

Basically any school that is online only, for profit or evangelical religious based you should avoid all together.

Any college that never had a computer science/computer engineering program and suddenly has a cyber security program, is going to be suspect on the quality of the curriculum and faculty

Now some of you may say but what about the NSA Centers of Excellence, well while there are some decent schools on that list there are plenty of turds as well. NSA is funded by Department of Defense and the DoD has a history of promoting junk colleges 

 APUS/AMU is on that list and they are online only garbage school that was started by a former military officer and they prey on military/veteran students

The decent schools on the list are ones that already had strong computer science/computer engineering majors not IT/Cyber Security

You are far better off going through computer science, computer engineering if you are interested in technical roles

If you are leaning more towards compliance, risk, etc then there are other options

**Masters Degree in ""Cyber""**

There are only a handful of decent schools to consider for this

Georgia Tech, Virginia Tech, University of Illinois, Penn State, George Washington, California State Polytechnic, RIT,  and if you're in the Air Force - AFIT

going to some random school to get a masters in cyber security is not going to help you get your first job 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to make it seem like you have to be a Computer Science/Computer Engineering major to work in INFSOC, because that isn't true, but if you had to pick a major those are far better than any ""Cyber Security"" programs

I have people from all kinds of academic backgrounds on my team, but one thing they all have in common is they realize, they are never going to be an expert in everything, there is always something new to learn and regardless of what you have walking in the door, you can benefit from taking more training",technology
altcoin,TRAVA.FINANCE - unique Lending/Borrowing Protocol with 3M MarketCap!,"While existing approaches provide only one or a few lending pools with their own parameters such as borrowing/lending interest rate, liquidity rate, collateral ratio, or a limited list of exchangeable cryptocurrencies, TRAVA offers a flexible mechanism in which users can create and manage their own lending pools to start a lending business.

There are six salient features of TRAVA, including:

**1. Crypto lending marketplace:** TRAVA creates a marketplace in which anyone confident in their abundant capital and profound knowledge of finance is free to create and manage their own lending pools. This multiple-pool model allows pool owners and their pool members to flexibly adapt their investment strategies to the volatility of the crypto market and earn more profits.

**2. Data analysis:** To reduce lending risks, TRAVA performs statistical data analysis based on the cross-chain knowledge graph and other data sources. TRAVA recommends the optimal parameters for pool owners to create and maintain their own pools (e.g., borrowing-lending interest rate, collateral ratio, liquidation threshold, a minimum credit score of borrowers). TRAVA also assists them in detecting and alerting unusual transactions in their pools.

**3. Credit score evaluation:** Though being an effective tool in lending, credit score has never been used in existing decentralized lending platforms. As a pioneer, TRAVA uses the cross-chain knowledge graph to evaluate credit scores for users and their digital assets. The pool owners thus can

* Reduce the lending risks by defining a credit-score threshold for borrowers participating in the lending pool;
* Stimulate borrowing by defining a high collateral ratio for borrowers with high credit scores.

**4. NFT, stock tokens, and other digital assets as collaterals:** To increase the liquidity of such special assets as NFT, stock tokens, or smart contracts, TRAVA allows users to use all of these asset types as collaterals. Before that, the special digital assets must be priced through auctions. The auction winners are involved in the lending contract. They can either possess the digital asset at a low price or earn a considerable profit from the contract.

**5. Cross-chain identification and cross-chain lending:** TRAVA uses the cross-chain identification protocol to identify all wallet addresses of the same users on different networks. After that, users can use up all of their cryptos as collateral for a huge loan in a single transaction. This facilitates their borrowing operations and saves them transaction fees. Cross-chain identification also helps them to increase their credit scores.

**6. Semantic knowledge graph:** TRAVA is built upon the semantic cross-chain knowledge graph. The graph is a distributed ledger that holds the data collected from multiple blockchain networks in the form of entities and their interconnections. The graph allows TRAVA to efficiently search for useful information:

* The amount and value of assets exchanged between two wallet addresses;
* The provenance of an NFT;
* Aggregated assets of the same user on multiple networks, etc.

**Token Utility**

1. Reward
2. Collateral and lending
3. Payment for lending fees
4. Payment for pool management
5. Payment for auction deposits
6. Payment for auction organization
7. Staking for a validator
8. Staking to participate in the governance process

CryptoCurrency,Crypto is Changing the Lives of the World's Poorest and the Best Is Yet to Come,"Crypto scams, hacks, and multi-million dollar NFT sales make the headlines, but beneath all the glitz and glamor there's a financial revolution going on fueled by crypto that is changing lives for the better.

When magazines like Foreign Policy start reporting on crypto's benefits you know the trend is is moving mainstream.

In a recent article, ""Cryptocurrency Isn’t All Bad"" [**Mark Leon Goldberg**](https://foreignpolicy.com/author/mark-leon-goldberg/), editor of *UN Dispatch* notes the low price of crypto for **funds transfers**.

&gt;Using DeFi applications that have come online in the last year, costs for transferring funds internationally are less than 1 percent—often far lower—and transactions can be completed in seconds as opposed to days.

&amp;#x200B;

Then there's the value of **access to capital** for small to medium-sized business who often have to pay abnormally high interest rates.

&gt;Lowing the transaction costs of remittances is just the tip of the iceberg. DeFi applications can make access to capital simpler and cheaper in places where getting a loan is anything but. Despite the major role of small and midsize businesses in African economies, the World Bank [estimates](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/smefinance) that in sub-Saharan Africa there is **$245 billion** in unmet financing needs for small and medium-sized enterprises. 

&amp;#x200B;

and **banking the unbanked**, yet another perfect use case for crypto.

&gt;DeFi offers a scalable solution that circumvents banks. Instead, internet access and a phone can connect people to a suite of extremely low-cost financial services, including savings and spending accounts.

&amp;#x200B;

The full article is worth a read ([https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/06/22/blockchain-bitcoin-energy-decentralized-finance-development-poverty/](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/06/22/blockchain-bitcoin-energy-decentralized-finance-development-poverty/))

Im wondering though on how to even start tackling my student loans- it feels like they will be impossible to ever pay off.

I have a super over thought plan to save money so let me know what you think any feedback is welcome!

I was reading about the payment service Plastiq that charges the 2.85% per total amount charged so if I did a year of payments for $6960.00 on my discover card “the card currently has an offer for 24 months 0% interest” it was a retention offer they gave me. From my math I’d save about $900 in interest doing this an taking a $198.36 charge from Plastiq  plus from what I understand Discover offers 1.5% cash back on all my charges.

personalfinance,Student Loans Repayment got pushed to May 1st. I was ready to dump my savings into loans. What's the best use of this money over 6 months?,"I'm 25. I have $12k in Federal Student Loans. Over the past 12 months, I've been setting aside $1k/mo. in the off-chance Biden follows through on his campaign promise to pay off $10k. Figured I had nothing to lose since it's not gaining interest. If he did it, I'd have a bunch of extra cash. If not, I could just dump the full amount when repayment begins and be debt free. With next week's paycheck, I'll have finally set aside the full $12k.

So now I have another 6 months of 0% interest, and a continued ""what if?"" on forgiveness. Letting it depreciate over 6 months seems wasteful but I'd want any investments to be liquid enough to withdraw from if I want to pay the debt. Any suggestions would be really appreciated!

Context on my finances:

*  Take home pay = $2500/mo. After bills/student loans/groceries, I've got about $200 to spend on anything else.
* $2k emergency fund.
* No kids
* I'm expecting a significant raise at the end of January but I'm still waiting on the exact offer.
* GF and I want to buy a house. Plan was to take the $1k/mo I'd been putting towards loans, and save up for a down payment over 2 years. Everything I'd get from my raise would then go to starting a Roth IRA, maybe an HSA, and squeeze in a little extra cash per month for myself if possible.
* I drive a 2007 Honda Civic, that appears to be dying a slow death. I intend on driving it till it croaks and then buying another used car, but I expect it'll happen within the next 5 years.

Thank you!",finance

personalfinance,Refinance student loans now or later?,"I have approximately $31k in federal student loans that are currently deferred with 0% interest until May 1st given today's announcement.

When the previous 0% deferment was ending January 31st, I was planning on refinancing with SoFi in a couple of weeks at a 2.99% rate (5 year payment plan).

If I defer the refinance until April, that gives me 3 months to save up more money to pay down the balance prior to refinancing. However, if my rate jumps from 2.99%, then the interest I'm ""saving"" by paying down at 0% may be cancelled out by paying more over the next 5 years.

I know no one can predict what student loan refi rates will be 4 months from now, but I'm hoping someone can help talk through this dilemma with me.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 1) Ignore Biden's interest deference extension and refinance $31k after the new year at 2.99%

Option 2) Defer on refinancing until April (with a $28k balance) and hope rates are still 2.99% 

&amp;#x200B;

If my math is right, the difference between paying off $31k and $28k @ 2.99% is only $59.8. So unless the rate I can get in April is less than 2.99%, I'm only saving $60 and rolling the dice on a lot of variables.",finance

personalfinance,Investing for Financial Independence/Early Retirement?,"Hello all,

Quick rundown of my current situation: 22, single, no children (no plans for future children either), recent college graduate in a medium-low cost of living area.

I've been working the past ~6 months since graduation building up a savings/emergency fund and now want to pivot to more aggressive retirement savings. Here's my current breakdown:

Yearly gross income: $84,000 + ~10% yearly bonus

Take-home pay each month (after 401k contribution and health/dental/vision insurance): ~$4700

Total Savings: ~$25,000

401k: Currently contributing 8% + 8% employer match, have about $7k balance at the moment (all traditional 401k, although Roth is an option as well)

Monthly budget: ~$1700 in spending (I don't always spend all of this, often the excess portion goes into a ""long term savings"" for big ""fun"" purchases)

Credit score in the mid-700s, never missed a payment on a credit card etc.

Currently saving $3000 a month after taxes, just going into a checking account. This is 2/3 of my post-tax monthly income that can go into better investments!

HSA: Not contributing anything, but employer contributes $1500/year. Current balance is $1500

I owe about $17k in student loans, all federal subsidized and payments will restart in May. There's a few different loans but the interest ranges from 5.05%-2.75%.

Now that I've built up a good amount of savings in the event of an emergency, I want to make my retirement savings more aggressive. At the moment I have no plans in the near future to buy a house or make any large purchases to save for (A vehicle is a small possibility, but hoping to ride out the current insane car prices with my current vehicle, I think my current emergency fund would handle that should it become a *necessity*).

My first thought is to max out my 401k at 24.4% (if my math is right) (employer match is 4% non contributory + up to 4% match, so total would be 32.4%, ~1/3, of my income saved for retirement. I could also open an IRA and contribute another $6k there, and max out my HSA. (I've actually heard to max this out first, after reaching employer contributions?).

My main concern with this plan is that (as far as I'm aware) *none* of this money would be available to me without a withdrawal penalty+taxes until I'm 59.5 or 55. I highly value financial independence and not going to work solely because I *have* to. Not to say I absolutely hate what I do or 100% plan on retiring and not working early, but I'd like to be financially independent and have the safety of knowing I don't *need* to work to survive. I think I've got time and income on my side to make this happen.

Let's say, for example, I wanted to retire at 45. According to an online calculator (assuming 7% rate of return and 0 salary increase ever (unlikely)), I'd have $1,375,250 in my 401k by 45. Assuming a 4% withdrawal rate, I could withdraw from that $55k/year pre-tax. This looks pretty good, considering after 401k contribution I'd be surviving off $63.5k/year pre-tax (and definitely planning on investing more of that, $55k/year is possibly *more* than I actually spend right now). But I can't withdraw that without a 10% penalty. (Doing some math, this would only take an extra $1k/month after-tax out of my paycheck to max out my 401k, leaving me with another $2k to invest still)


I've done some research and found discussion of a 72(t) exemption (SEPP is another acronym I see used to describe it), but I'm not seeing any examples with hard numbers. My understanding here is that the IRS will take my average life expectancy and split up the 401k into equal payments according to the balance and expected lifespan. Beyond that though, I'd really like to see hard numbers on how this would work out. Does anyone have any examples or resources for this? Everything I'm finding online is practically ""Yes, you can do this thing"" and 0 more information than that. How would I calculate the expected payment amounts? Would taking this route potentially be an issue later on in retirement? (i.e., overdrawing early on such that the account is depleted too early).



Aside from the 72(t), what other investment opportunities should I pursue? Should I just throw my extra $2k (or whatever's left after IRA+HSA maxing) into a mutual fund? Obviously there will be taxes on the gains and the money is post-tax, but if maybe it'd be better as a ""bridge"" for income before reaching 59? That's what I'm currently leaning towards.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I'm trying to wrap my head around all of this but it seems most resources point you to ""throw money into 401k, retire at 59.5""",finance
CryptoCurrency,US Regulator Tells Credit Unions They Can Team Up with Crypto Firms,"America’s credit regulator, the **National Credit Union Administration** (NCUA) has told domestic credit unions that they can partner with third-party cryptoasset service providers to give their members access to crypto markets.

The NCUA outlined its stance on crypto in an open letter to unions, explaining that they could “buy, sell and hold various uninsured digital assets with \[a\] third-party provider outside of the federally insured credit unions.”

The body said that its move was intended to “provide clarity” to unions, and rather than actively encouraging such partnerships, it noted that it “does not prohibit \[credit unions\] from establishing these relationships.”

And it warned that unions “should establish effective risk measurement, monitoring and control practices for such third-party arrangements.”

&gt;*“The NCUA anticipates that further guidance may be necessary with the continued growth of digital assets and the technologies that make them available. \[…\] This new guidance was a necessary step for providing clarity on the existing authority credit unions have.”*

But it also suggested that the new guidance “provides new opportunities for revenue in the digital asset marketplace,” for credit unions, remarking that demand has “only continued to expand as ordinary consumers are presented with easy access to cryptocurrencies and other digital assets.”

The news will have come as a welcome boost for the likes of the payments firm **NCR** and crypto management specialist **NYDIG**, who in summer this year struck a deal to allow around 24 million customers at 650 US banks to buy and sell bitcoin (BTC) through NCR mobile apps – and making use of NYDIG’s custody services.

The NCUA’s insistence on “sound judgment,” “due diligence” and “risk assessment” protocols will likely mean that only major (and highly compliant, well-insured) players in the crypto custody space will fit the regulator’s bill.

personalfinance,Order of Operations: loan payoff &amp; vehicle lease,"Hi all - looking to get some feedback, regarding credit scores, interest rates, and the best order to do things. 

Let me preface this with: I am respectfully not looking for feedback regarding leasing a vehicle and have done a lot of information gathering on financing vs. leasing. 

I am looking to lease a new vehicle soon, as my husband and I have been sharing a vehicle for the last year and I’ve had to leave him without a vehicle a few times while I am traveling. We made the decision to enter a lease, but only after my student loans were paid off (delayed gratification and working towards one goal while knocking out a financial obligation, yada yada).

Luckily I am in a position that is salaried, but I am compensated for any hour that I work over our standard 40-hour work week here in the US. Knowing this, I worked my ass off this year with the intent to knock out my student loans once and for all. I just received my 2021 bonus for $20,000USD which is enough to knock out my loans. Woohoo! Originally, I wanted to (1) pay off loans and then (2) enter the lease but after thinking of how the loan payoff will affect my credit score I think I should enter the lease first. What are your thoughts?

My (27M) financial profile:

+$20,000USD received in one-time bonus

-$16,000USD student loans 

-$260,000USD mortgage

No auto loans, but we have 1 vehicle we own outright

4 credit cards, all with a $0 balance

Won’t dive into investments and retirement accounts on this post

Currently credit score of 803, assuming that paying off my loans will negatively affect it and bring it to the 700s.

What would you all do? Do you think it will really matter one way or another? Thanks in advance.",finance

personalfinance,You should have uncomfortable financial conversations with the elderly in your life so they don't get scammed,"So my in-laws just got taken for tens of thousands of dollars. Here's how the scam worked.

Computer got infected with a virus - I don't know the details of how this happened.  At some point, in order to ""fix"" it, they gave control of their computer to someone else.  RED FLAG

Shortly afterward they received a phone call on their land line from ""Craig"" saying he was from their bank and the bank believed their bank account had been hacked. No money had been taken yet, but the nice man from they bank asked my in-laws if they would help them catch the hacker.  My in-laws are nice folks and agreed to help. RED FLAG

Over a period of a couple weeks, Craig called back a few times. Occasionally my father-in-law would question what was going on and Craig would be very rude. RED FLAG

Craig told them the hack was likely an inside job so they shouldn't tell their kids or use their regular bank branch.  RED FLAG.   RED FLAG.   RED FLAG.

Over these couple weeks Craig had them visit four separate bank branches [RED FLAG] and complete wires to a foreign account all in an effort to catch the hacker.  RED FLAG.

On the fourth attempt, the teller finally noticed something fishy and denied my father-in-law the ability to wire the money.

All this time my wife could sense something was going on but was rebuffed when she pried. We assumed it was a health related issue they didn't want to share, but my wife could tell they were keeping secrets.  My wife finally got them to tell her what was going on after the bank denied the 4th wire attempt. At that point my in-laws still believed everything was on the up-and-up.  She immediately called a sibling to come over (who, ironically, works in the fraud department of a bank).  Once my wife &amp; SIL repeated back to their parents their very own story it dawned on them they had been scammed.

Bank claims there's a chance they get the money back, but I highly doubt that will happen.


So, now that the immediate fire is extinguished, over the next couple of weeks we get to have some very uncomfortable conversations about finances with my in-laws.

One main thing is that my FIL had WAY TOO MUCH money in cash because he ""doesn't trust the stock market"".  🤦‍♂️. We'll have to try to convince him to hand his money over to a financial advisor to put in some extremely safe vehicles while leaving only a small amount in his checking account.  If we had done this one thing beforehand, the damage would have been limited.

At the end of the day, my in-laws are going to have to give up some of their independence.  And that conversation is hard whether you're talking about money, or driving, or living on their own.

So, if your parents or grandparents are of that age, it's time you have your own uncomfortable conversation.  It could make Christmas dinner a little awkward, but you're potentially saving your loved ones from some serious heartache.

I used Privacy.com linked to my bank account to mask the transaction from my bank successfully. I don't believe you can currently fund a privacy.com account with a gift card, but it may be possible. it looks like they are adding future payment options, that might be one of them.

I do not fully understand the benefits of this, but ill be doing it.

I currently have a ledger Hardwallet, and you could possibly DOX yourself by going directly going from bank to your ledger address. I don't know how ramps KYC works, but it may link that address to your verification. there's unforeseen implications. The stealthier method would be: fiat onramp to free counterfactual wallet/loopring wallet, send to hardwallet on L2. the low fees should make that step negligible. i also plan on my counterfactual wallet being my ""dummy"" wallet in case of wrench attacks.

Ramp itself has a KYC, but it seems fairly low level. I'm not sure the tax implications, or how they operate with federals. if anyone could help me out let me know. but as far as i can tell, they would only have access to the data of the USD-ETH transfer at the moment of transfer. not any trades or gains made from trades. i haven't figured out an off-ramp yet, but lets say you transfer and sell on Coinbase, and theres no record of gains, how will it be taxed? real question.

as far as turning cash into crypto... it looks like you can buy a visa gift card, and register it online with you mailing address. that mailing address becomes the billing address. you have to undergo the RAMP KYC, but you can use national documents, drivers license, and passports. and you should be good to go.

one step further into stealth: UPS rents mailboxes that count as legal home addresses. \[redacted for illegal activities regarding fake IDs and mailboxes\]

in the case of illegal immigrants turning USD into ETH and ""becoming their own bank (since they cant register for a bank account), those immigrants could be able to use their home KYC data, USD gift cards from the states, and mailing address/ups box.

Edit: I didn't try a gift card, but the fact that [privacy.com](https://privacy.com) cards work mean that it doesn't have to be a bank issued card.

and for those implying i'm promoting illegal activities: this is merely a discussion for security and potential use cases of a new technology, and how it may disrupt current culture.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Credit score/so frustrated,"Last summer, I had a 725 credit score.

In September, I refinanced my house with the same lender to drop the interest rate from 5.75% to 3.2%. Credit score dropped to 680 -- I assume because the mortgage company closed the old mortgage account when it opened the new one. The old mortgage was only 3 years old, and the new mortgage is less than the original one was. ($125K vs $121K). I didn't take any equity out, although the value of my house is now nearly $100K over what I paid for it.

Last week, I paid off my car (a 48-month loan). This week, I paid off my Discover card, the only credit card I keep any balance on. I pay it off in full every month. Other than the low revolving balance (usually less than $1K a month) on the Discover card and the mortgage, I am debt-free.

Today, Credit Karma reports my Transunion score at 663. Equifax, as usual, lags behind Transunion but I expect to see a comparable drop in that score when Equifax reports next.

I feel as though I am doing the right things -- keeping debt low, consistent on-time payments, not opening credit lines that I don't need, etc. -- but am being punished by the credit agencies for doing so.

Am I ever going to see that 725 credit score again?",finance
Bitcoin,How orange became my favorite color,"I was standing in a garage with my best friend Justin. We were neglecting our tedious duties we had grown to hate. Burnt out, and no payday in sight until completion of our job, we were no where close to finishing. I remember being mad at life and mad at myself. Christmas was a week away and I had not been able to come up with the gifts I had wanted. Nor had my friend and he was in no better financial situation than I. Being 28 with three kids and a beautiful wife I felt like a failure. 

""Never again!"" I shouted to Justin """"Never will I have another Christmas where I can't get my kids the gifts they deserve""

""Dude, same!"" he replied 

""If I don't do something different Im going to be right here in the same spot again next year. I need to start investing and get my money right."" I said.

He said ""We should ask your grandpa about Bitcoin""

""We should! He Knows a lot about that kind of stuff""

After we forced ourselves back to work, not even 15 minutes later my grandpa walked through the door. We turned off our sanders and approached him excitedly.

""Hey grandpa! What do you know about Bitcoin?""

His face filled with delight at my question. 

""Well, It runs on the blockchain""

""Blockchain?"" we asked

He went on to do his best to explain Bitcoin and what he called ""shit coins"". He said he bought all of his Bitcoin on Coinbase and that in his opinion everyone should have a little Bitcoin.

That night I downloaded Coinbase and after a few days of waiting for my account to verify, I purchased some Bitcoin.

It didn't take long until I was obsessed. I checked my account every 5 minutes and spent every second listening to and watching youtube videos about crypto. It engulfed my life completely. 

Fast forward 12 months here I sit today. Christmas is upon my family and I again, only this year they have more gifts under the tree than ever before. I also have more money in my account than ever before. For the first time in my life I feel like I have my money right. Bills are paid and I notice that the more money I have the easier it comes to me. Total opposite of where I was last year. It feels fucking great.

I didn't get my money right because the price of Bitcoin went up(though it helped) but it flipped a switch in my head. I started my investing journey that day in the garage and it changed my life. After a few months I even convinced grandpa to invest in a few of my favorite alt coins and now he isn't such a maximalist. I've also grown closer to my grandpa than ever before because we now speak almost daily about crypto and the Bitcoin price. At this point we've almost orange pilled our whole family.

The more I learn, the more I love it. Im going to continue my journey with an attitude of gratitude and never stop learning.

Today I could not imagine my life without crypto, its become an asset to my life. Thank God for Bitcoin!!!!!!!",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,PSFL and Investing to Lower Income-Driven Repayments?,"Hello,

Long time lurker, first time poster. 2 separate and distinct questions if anybody should be able to tackle this particular area of interest (PSFL, investments). 

Keeping this short and sweet. I'm a psychologist with $440k owed to Uncle Sam in one single, consolidated, federal student loan. Been with the state for 4 years and about to start the PSFL program (10 years/120 payments). This question is for those who are indeed familiar with the PSFL ins and outs. 

So then as we all know -- working for any govt entity means we repay for 10 years of qualifying income-driven repayments, and the rest is forgiven. Not even a large final tax burden at the end, like with the standard 20 year IBR. 

QUESTION #1

So then, what investments might I want to contribute into so as to lower my mAGI and therefore lower my monthly loan payments? 

My thoughts have been, but are open to correction, as follows: 

1. 401k (currently maxing)
2. 457b (currently maxing)
3. tIRA (currently maxing)
4. 529 plan (twins due in April)

All of my investments are being taken out of my state salary except the 529 which doesn't exist yet, because the twins technically aren't American citizens yet :). 

Question #2

Personal info now. State salary = $130k. I also have a side practice and work on my days off, brings me another $80-100k. The question as it pertains to PSFL then, is...does my side 1099 contract work also get considered as my overall income for PSFL repayments? Or, is it only my income from the qualifying govt/state job? 

\*\*ADDITIONAL INFO\*\*

Wife also a psychologist makes about $150k a year. We file separately, my decision, because if we're joint then her income would theoretically make my loan repayments higher. This is the correct decision, no?",finance
personalfinance,Pay off car or keep cash?,"Hey redditors!  First, here’s a bit of information about me.  I’m 32, in a relationship, rent a nice house from a family friend for a VERY reasonable monthly rate and I have a steady income as does my girlfriend.  I currently have right around $28,000 saved up in cash, zero credit card debt, $7,000 in our combined checking and I have around $40,000 or so tied up in investments (mostly crypto).  My car is a 2012 Toyota Camry SE with decently low miles.  I owe $5,468 on it with a 4.39% interest rate.  It’s very practical and I don’t plan on getting rid of it ANY time soon.  The thing I fight with, is should I pay the car off to then pay myself back the $199 payment a month or just keep paying on it!?  I can easily pay it off and have over a year’s worth of emergency funds leftover in cash.  I like having the liquid cash in case I run across a deal on something or if the need arises for it.

personalfinance,What to do with student loan money until May 1st?,"Hi friends, by the end of this month, I will have enough saved up to pay off all my federal student loans in one lump sum (\~24k).

Now that student loan payments are on pause until May, I am unsure of what I should do with my savings. I don't really want to leave it sit in my bank account making only .03% interest. Should I invest this money in a 0.5% HYS account, or throw it all in VTWAX until May, or just pay it all off now?

I am actually now in a much better place financially to begin rehabilitating them but it is really hard to tell what information is reliable or where to start. I contacted the company servicing the loans and they said to send them a signed copy of my previous years taxes to begin the process of starting a repayment plan.

personalfinance,"28 and need advice. 60k in student loans, 57k salary, hoping to buy a home in the next few years","I'm feeling pretty stressed and lost.

I'm 28 and have been terrible with my finances my whole life. I have over 60k in student loan debt which plagues me every day. I used to make 70-80k a year right out of college, but did not really save any money. Left my previous career because I hated it, found a job that I love, but it only pays 57k a year.

I have less than $10k in savings (which is mostly in an index fund) but plan to be way more frugal this year. Hoping to put $1,000-1,500 into my index fund per month in 2022. The average return on the index fund is well above my student loan interest rates so I will likely pay the minimum on those.

Hoping to transition into a role that pays 80-100k+ in the next couple years but I'd like to plan my finances with the assumption of a 57k salary.

On top of my student loans, I'm hoping to buy a house with my partner in the next year or two. He'll hopefully be working in a tenure-track professor role within the next couple years, so on the low end I'd estimate 80k salary a year (currently he makes 60k a year as a visiting professor). He has probably 20k in student loan debt. We just want a modest house to call our own.

I know this was a lot of information, but I'm really struggling to figure out what I should or shouldn't be doing. Is buying a house financially reasonable? Should I be putting my money elsewhere? What else can I do? What would you do in my situation?

investing,Generate 15-17% yearly using IB 1.5% margin and closed end funds,"Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I had the idea to borrow money from Interactive Brokers at 1.5% interest and invest in closed end funds like PDI which is yielding 10%.  I would pocket the difference.  After taxes I estimate I would clear between 5-7% free profit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Risks would be if PDI cut the dividend which I deem fairly unlikely or my prinicpal going down in value.  This I estimate would be the biggest risk as it could force me to sell my PDI at an inopportune time if I got a margin call.  I would have to manage the position.  Another risk would be IB raising the interest rates on using their margin which I deem fairly likely in a rising interest rate environment.  Are there any other risks I'm missing?

I'm thinking of doing this with 10% of my portfolio and if it works out, increasing over time.  Please tell me if this is too risky or a dumb idea.  Thanks!",finance

CryptoCurrency,The 10 Worst Crypto News Stories of 2021!,"From scam tokens collapsing to crypto fortunes going unclaimed, there have been some pretty gloomy stories this year. Here's a recap!

## 10. ConstitutionDAO Fail to Win Auction

Quite recently, a group of crypto enthusiasts embarked on an audacious bid to buy a rare copy of the U.S. Constitution. The imaginatively named collective — [ConstitutionDAO](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/constitutiondao) — raised more than **$40 million** so they could participate in the Sotheby's auction.All of this meant they were feeling pretty confident as bidding began, not least because the historic artifact was expected to sell for between **$15 million** and **$20 million**.Unfortunately, the transparency of the blockchain meant it was fairly easy for rivals to calculate what it would take to outbid them. And in a devastating setback, hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin swooped in at the last minute — paying a grand total of **$43.2 million**.

The decentralized autonomous organization slowly began to unravel after this. Although donors were able to receive refunds, the final amount returned to their wallets was decimated by high fees on the Ethereum blockchain.

## 9. Akon City — Still a Pipe Dream?

Back in the summer of 2020, the R&amp;B star Akon had a bold vision: to build a modern, Wakanda-inspired metropolis in the West African country of Senegal. [Akon City would be powered by cryptocurrencies,](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/akon-city-little-progress-made-on-crypto-powered-metropolis-since-first-stone-laid-last-year) create jobs, and become a vibrant part of the economy. The singer hit the headlines after laying a ceremonial stone to declare that the project was underway.Fast forward one year, and the **$6 billion** project was unstarted. Locals were in the dark about what was going on — and hopes were beginning to fade that the promised stadium, casino, schools and luxury apartments would materialize.At the time, the AFP's West Africa correspondent Emmet Livingstone [told the CoinMarketRecap podcast](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/coinmarketcap-crypto-podcast-bitcoin-crash-el-salvador-kim-kardashian-akon-city-burning-eth):

**""You can go to the field where the first stone was laid and it’s still just an empty field. However, if you talk to the building company, they will say they have been in contact with contractors and suppliers and they give the impression of machinations happening behind the scenes — but on the ground, zero.""**

Livingstone went on to point out that **$6 billion** is a ""huge, huge amount of money"" for a country like Senegal — but that it isn't entirely clear who is funding the project.

## 8. Forgotten Passwords to Crypto Fortunes

As Bitcoin continued its dizzying surge right at the start of 2021 — accelerating from **$29,000** to **$69,000** in the blink of an eye — we started to hear some unfortunate stories about early investors who were unable to get their hands on life-changing sums of money.[*The New York Times* spoke to Stefan Thomas,](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/if-this-man-gets-his-password-wrong-two-more-times-hell-lose-240m-in-btc-forever) who had just two chances left to guess the password of a hard drive holding **7,002 BTC**.

**""This whole idea of being your own bank — let me put it this way: Do you make your own shoes? The reason we have banks is that we don't want to deal with all those things that banks do.""**

## 7. Scams Proliferate

Throughout the year, we've heard endless stories about people who have lost everything after falling victim to scams.

The most common involve victims receiving texts or emails that appear to be from their crypto exchange — telling them to log in immediately because someone has been trying to access their funds.

This leads them to a fake login page, and once they enter their email address and password, fraudsters drain their accounts in the blink of an eye.

[One couple ended up losing **$700,000** in Bitcoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/couple-who-lost-700-000-attack-coinbase) because of such an incident — and said they received little support from Coinbase in investigating what happened. Erick Richardson, who was offered just **$500** in compensation by the exchange, told *CNBC*:

**""It felt like they kicked sand in my face. Is there even anybody senior at Coinbase looking at this? Somebody made a calculation and said, 'OK, this is what happened to this guy. He lost 21 Bitcoin. Let's give him $500.'""**

## 6. Fake News Hits Walmart

The news was hurriedly broken by a number of established news outlets — and retweeted by the Litecoin Foundation.

[There was just one problem: It wasn't true.](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/analysis-as-pump-and-dumps-go-bogus-walmart-announcement-was-wildly-successful)

Walmart quickly denied that it was entering into such a partnership. And LTC, which had surged sharply on the news, crashed back down to Earth in the blink of an eye.

It was a sophisticated scam that hoodwinked many people… and taught journalists to be super careful of the announcements they see online.

OpenSea's Nate Chastain [had been accused of purchasing NFTs](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/opensea-admits-senior-employee-used-insider-information-to-trade-nfts) before they were promoted on the website's homepage — and later selling them for a profit.

## 4. John McAfee Dies Aged 75

Back in June, [John McAfee was found dead in his prison cell](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/john-mcafee-found-dead-in-spanish-prison-cell-hours-after-extradition-to-u-s-approved) — hours after a Spanish court ruled that he can be extradited to the U.S. to face tax evasion charges.

Days earlier, he had told a judge that he feared he would die behind bars if he was taken into American custody.

Best known for creating antivirus software, McAfee became a colorful member of the crypto community with his outlandish predictions about Bitcoin’s future price.

## 3. Bitcoin's Stomach-Churning Corrections

No asset goes up in value constantly — and Bitcoin painfully proved that this year.

It plunged from highs of **$64,000** in April [to lows of **$29,700** in June](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/bitcoin-falls-below-30-000-for-first-time-in-weeks-and-suffers-weekly-loss-of-10)… wiping out its entire gains for 2021.But like a phoenix from the ashes, Bitcoin came back stronger — hitting **$67,000** in October and **$69,000** in November.A cocktail of unfortunate news stories — including the Evergrande crisis, the Omicron coronavirus variant and the Fed unveiling plans to end stimulus — led to another corrective phase as 2021 drew to a close. During the first weekend of December, BTC briefly dipped as low as **$42,000**.

While longer-term Bitcoin investors have been taking all this volatility in their stride — it's nothing new for them, after all — it caused a fair amount of panic for those who are new to the space.

## 2. India's Crypto Ban

As China pushed ahead with a crackdown on mining, India revisited its plans to heavily restrict the use of cryptocurrencies.

There had been murmurings that anyone caught dealing in digital assets [could face time in jail and a hefty fine](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/india-crypto-ban-may-bring-18-month-jail-sentences). However, conflicting reports have suggested ""private cryptocurrencies"" will be subject to regulation instead — something that could be workable for the country's **20 million** investors.

Plenty of uncertainty about what India will do next is expected in 2022. The crypto industry had only just started to get back on its feet — with Bollywood stars promoting local exchanges in big-budget ads.

## 1. SQUID Token Collapses

Perhaps the most unfortunate story of 2021 relates to the SQUID token.

A project inspired by the popular Netflix show Squid Game had promised to offer a play-to-earn experience like no other.

Players would be able to participate in the same games that feature in the TV program, and potentially earn big crypto prizes for coming out on top.

SQUID's value surged — and plenty of attention was given to the project, with a number of major media outlets writing glowing articles about the token's performance.

Unfortunately, the project had no official ties with Netflix.

Those who had bought into SQUID were trapped because of an anti-selling mechanism — and had little choice but to watch helplessly as the token surged in value, apparently reaching **$2,800**. Minutes later, it plunged to **$0.01**.",cryptocurrency

8. Charles dropped a new AMA where he mentioned very briefly that they are actually going to look into read-only UTxOs. If it’s possible to have these types of UTxOs while preserving determinism, it would be a big change since transactions must currently consume inputs. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJcVEJ1a6eg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJcVEJ1a6eg) Some background reading on read-only UTxOs: [https://github.com/Emurgo/Emurgo-Research/blob/master/smart-contracts/Unlocking%20The%20Potential%20Of%20The%20UTXO%20Model.md](https://github.com/Emurgo/Emurgo-Research/blob/master/smart-contracts/Unlocking%20The%20Potential%20Of%20The%20UTXO%20Model.md)

18. Charles drops a video on the eToro user limitations. It sounds like IOHK knew nothing about this. Interacting with exchanges falls in the Cardano Foundation’s wheelhouse. It’s unclear whether the CF knew anything. He also pointed out it’s very interesting that an old line exchange like Bitstamp has decided to LIST Cardano during this same period. Charles also mentioned that they haven’t seen any regulatory activity on IOHK’s end. eToro is a relatively small source of liquidity for Cardano and there shouldn’t be much of an impact.

32. The Cardano Community takes a moment to enjoy contemplating the circumstance that there will never need to be a “magical Cardano 2” in order for our blockchain to survive. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1465089315340488704](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1465089315340488704)

58. The heads of Circle, FTX, Bitfury, Paxos, Stellar Development Foundation, and Coinbase appeared before the House Financial Services Committee. As expected, the questions from some of the House Committee members belied a misplaced focus on things like terrorist financing while others understood the need to regulate crypto appropriately so that crypto innovation is not forced offshore. There was significant focus on stablecoins due to the President’s Working Group placing so much focus there. One representative also chose to focus heavily on the energy consumption of Bitcoin mentioning coal power plants coming back on line to fuel Bitcoin mining. The witnesses from the crypto industry seemed to focus on dispelling misconceptions and also pushing for a single crypto focused regulatory body as opposed to the fragmented regulation that is typical in Washington.

investing,"Given inflation, what do you think about investing heavily in the commodities index - S&amp;P GSCI?","So my own take on things is that inflation is much higher than expected, much less transient than expected, and the Fed in its current constellation is proposing little more than immaterial rate hike that will have a negligible impact on inflation. Given my perception (and I could be totally wrong, but let's take this for a given) that the entire equities market is hyperinflated, and even so-called ""safe stocks"" like big-tech are immensely overvalued, and that since the real rate hikes have not yet happened because no one (JPOW, Biden) wants to be the one that deflates the asset bubble by doing the necessary, that bonds will not provide any interesting investment for the time to come, but commodity prices seem to be skycorrected, and as I understand it, they are a good tradition hedge against inflation. But I am thinking not of hedging, but rather using this as a principal core of investment, until the rates are reasonable. Can I get any feedback on this thought? Pros and cons? Other alternatives? One that I can think of personally, is that I'm not sure a basket of all commodities is best, since as I understand it, some commodities like Gas and Oil in an inflationary context will drop massively along with the drop in consumption - so maybe Basic Necessity commodities?

algorand,ALGO FI Experience,"It is a very small investment, but I wanted to experience AlgoFi.

I swapped ALGO for exactly 100 USDC.

Supplied those 100 USDC AlgoFi to earn 3.09% APR.

Supplied 100 Algo coins to earn 2.53% APR.

Borrowed 100 Stbl and paying 2.00 APR. I am utilizing about 61% of my borrowing limits.

Staked those Stbl coins to earn 6.68% APR.

Haven't done the math exactly, but that should come out to just a bit higher than 7% APR.

Conclusion: This is a very conservative, safe, and easy way to get a MUCH higher interest rate than your bank. However, I may not continue because I am expecting higher returns on some ASAs or Yldly staking. I am going to keep my investments for awhile to see what they announce the next couple of weeks.

Bitcoin,"How to relate economic growth, inflation, and monetary expansion?","TLDR: central banks show you the reality the way is more convinient for them, but theoretical GDP growth with real monetary expansion means nothing

Since I started my personal journey through the Bitcoin rabbit hole, I am becoming more and more interested on how money and monetary policy has a surprisingly overlooked impact on virtually every human activity. 

I posted this question a couple of days ago on r/macroeconomics, but apparently either no one is interested on this or there is nobody there :)

I copy from my post there: 

So the ECB just posted in LinkedIn this pic:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ongskcr6c9781.png?width=1201&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=055a02d40512b6e135147fb1d7cbffffd82b5634

They are basically saying: 2021 was great because, even though we had a 2,6% inflation (according to how we measure it), we had a 5,1% GDP increase (on nominal €, I assume)

But if you do a bit of research you see that the yearly M3 money supply was 7,7% in october (YoY), with an upwards trend ([link](https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/money-supply-m3)).

Isn't it a coincidence, that the % of monetary expansion equals the percentages that the ECB reports as economic growth and inflation?

Couln't it be another possible explanation, like that what they report as economic growth and inflation is BS, taking into account a 7,7% monetary debasement?

Or put another way: since GDP is ultimately the value of the finished goods and services produced in a region during a year, whenever monetary expansion = GDP growth + inflation, the real economy has grown 0

Bitcoin,Here’s Why Bitcoin’s Programmatic Monetary Policy Is Superior.,"Bitcoin is an incredible monetary revolution that highlights a system that is the opposite of the current monetary and financial system.

In the current system, monetary policy is defined by central banks. Thus, a minority of people who are not representative of the people make arbitrary decisions that impact the vast majority of the Earth's inhabitants.

This gives us USD Money Supply that keeps increasing with the Fed using out of thin air money printing as the answer to all the ills of the economy.

Bitcoin offers the opposite vision with a hard-capped 21 million unit supply and a programmatic monetary policy that protects you from the natural human penchant for corruption.

With Bitcoin, the rules of the game are written in advance, and they don't change. This allows you to plan your life without the risk of arbitrary decisions changing the rules of the game along the way to your detriment.

In the latest issue of the In Bitcoin We Trust Newsletter, I bring all this to light to show you why Bitcoin's programmatic monetary policy is superior.

personalfinance,Age Restricted Trust Options,"Looking for some info regarding what type of options might exist for my situation.

My grandmother passed back in 2020 and left her children an inheritance. My father died about 25 years ago, and her will was written such that his 1/4 of the inheritance would go to me and my sister (each getting 1/8 of total). However, when my grandfather and grandmother wrote the will back in 1994 (just after my father died), they put in a clause stating that none of the children or grandchildren would have access to the inheritance until age 35. I'm currently 30, will be 31 in April.

In total, the inheritance is about $180k. From reviewing the will, there are really no situations that it suggests early disbursements may be made, and the ""guardians"" of the trust (my aunt &amp; uncle) are not really open to an early disbursement as waiting until age 35 is what my grandparents wanted.

However, at age 30, I'm currently sitting on $26k in student loans. I've used the graduated repayment plan, so when my payments resume (now in May 2022), I'll be paying about $600 for 2 more years before the payment jumps up again.

My main questions - are there options out there that would allow borrowing against the trust to pay the student loans (essentially using the trust as collateral)? Do the guardians of the trust have a say in whether or not this type of arrangement occurs? Is it a smart option - the loans are broken out at different interest rates, the highest of which is 6.5%.

Edit: To add, the trust currently holds cash &amp; farm land. One chunk of the farm land is being sold off in the next couple of months, but the other may remain in the trust. Rent payments being received on the farm land are also being deposited into the trust. Not sure if the real estate makes a difference, especially considering I have no access to it until I turn 35 in 2026.",finance

In this Reddit, I'd like to share my honest experience of using Hodlnaut, the lending platform famous for yielding the **highest interest rate** (**APY**) of up to 12.73%. 

1. You are allowed to deposit and withdraw **any time** you like. Anyway, it's your crypto!
2. It **does not need a lock-in period**. Deposit your crypto and start getting paid next Monday at 5 p.m.
3. There's **no minimum deposit**; you are allowed to deposit as much as you like. 
4. The interest is **compound** (it's APY).
5.  One of the distinctive features about Hodlnaut is you get to choose the crypto that each asset earns; if you have for example, Ethereum in your account, you can pick Bitcoin as your interest payout asset. 
6. It **does not charge for deposits**; it charges on withdrawals though. Yeah, the management team knows it's a pain in the neck, so last month they allowed 1 free withdrawal every month. (Still needs to improve!).

CryptoCurrency,IPO and ICO under USA's law and rights,"*USA's law actively regulates the issuance of shares and tokens. Learn about the rules of their placement and taxation of cryptocurrencies. Information about the current legislation will help to avoid problems with the fiscal authorities.*

In July 2017, the United States Exchange and Securities Commission equated [ICO](https://coinful.net/explaining-icos-so-you-can-actually-understand-it/) to **IPO**. Its representatives warned traders and investors: the USA legislation on securities transactions will be used for all crypto assets that are put up for sale. It applies to decentralized organizations and ordinary companies. The rules are the same no matter the asset: dollars or cryptocurrency. 

# What does the SEC's decision mean in practice? 

In fact, now in the eyes of USA's law, the initial offering of tokens is regulated by the same legislative acts as the initial offering of shares. Since the SEC's decision, companies that issue cryptocurrency assets are required to register transactions. Violation of this requirement will be punished in accordance with applicable law. Crypto exchanges are also required to register with the exchange and securities commission.

The SEC made a decision regarding the ICO after checking the legality of transactions with the DAO cryptocurrency project. When it was launched, investments in the number of millions of dollars were attracted, in Ethereum. DAO acts as an analog of the venture fund; it attracts investments for project funding in the area of digital coins. Control is carried out by a computer application. The code contains all information about corporate work, operations performed, salary payment schedule, management, etc.

The regulator has not yet taken any measures against the DAO, but it warned all market participants. The changes are aimed at protecting traders and investors. 

# Tax regulation ICO

The USA internal Revenue service (IRS) deals with taxation issues in America. According to the 2014 guidelines, cryptocurrency is proprietary. Transactions with it, including mining, are subject to taxation.

The administration sets

* Salaries that are paid in cryptographic currency are subject to payroll tax and Federal income tax.
* The nature of losses or profits from the exchange or sale of coins depends on whether the cryptocurrency is the main asset of the payer.
* Payments for the services of the counterparty under the signed contract in cryptographic currency are subject to taxation.
* Information on payments in digital currency should be sent to the appropriate authorities. If a USA citizen receives income in coins, he must necessarily declare them in dollars.

USA's law actively regulates IPO and ICO. Such actions are aimed at protecting investors and exchanges. Before registering an initial token offering, it is important to familiarize yourself with the legal regulations and follow them accurately.

Looking for advice/experience with getting a personal loan. My wife and I have about $20,000 in debt across 5 credit cards and an expensive personal loan $5,000(paid down to $2,000). I think we should get a personal loan to pay everything off for a lower interest rate and have 1 bill, not 6. Everything has been this way since we got married a few years ago. I was expecting to make more money but I have had health problems instead. We also need a new car pretty soon. My wife has $3,000 in savings from a bonus and is expecting a $2,500 bonus in May '22. 

Her credit scores are roughly: 690 TU - 711 EQ - 722 EX

Her family tells her to get a car loan first and look into a personal loan after. My idea is personal loan 1st because I think it is much harder to get a personal loan than a car loan. I told her to put $1,000 into her credit cards and see where her score lands. She put $500 into 1 of the credit cards a few months ago and her score went up 12 points. 3 of the 5 CC are closed but the 2 CC open are 20 years old, so we don't want a loan that requires closing the CC accounts.

personalfinance,"Father passed away, want to support my mom with her mortgage","My father (59) passed away very suddenly earlier this month.

I (28) want to ensure my mother (53) can continue to live in the home for which they were paying a mortgage. She has expressed a desire to keep the house or at least stay in the same neighborhood. She loves her job and where she lives.

According to Zillow, the property is worth 2.2m (I doubt it would sell for that much, but that's the only data point I have). There's about 500K left on the mortgage and 70K on the HELOC. My dad made about 250K-300K a year, but my mom makes only about 50K/yr. Interest rate is 3.875% and between principal, interest, taxes and insurance, the mortgage comes out to about 4K a month. She can barely cover the mortgage on her salary, so me and my brother (24) would like to direct deposit a portion of our income into her checking account to help cover the mortgage, bills and other expenses. Is this the best way to do this? Are there tax implications for gifting this money?

Also, I don't want this post to get too convoluted, but would it be possible to refinance to reduce the monthly payment or would she need someone to cosign given her income situation? My father had a ton of investments as well (we've found about 2m so far, there's probably more, we are still trying to track down everything. His passing was very sudden and we have slowing been getting access to his password managers and reverse engineering the location of the money) but I don't want to dip into those unless absolutely necessary.

I just don't really know how to best navigate all this. I just want the best for her. I don't want her to need to worry about finances...

Just wanted to say thank you for all the helpful replies.

Our top priority now is being there for my mom and trying our best to make Chritmas special.

It sounds like my mom shouldn't require help with the mortgage once we unravel the life insurance and investment accounts. It also sounds like we may want to consult a financial advisor to help us decide what will be best for my mom's financial well-being. We will certainly hold off at least a year before making any major decisions.

Crypto savings accounts in some cases can allow you to earn absolutely legit interest rates of 20% APY and more on your crypto assets by simply staking them with a service provider. 

BlockFi

BlockFi offers its Interest Account to all registered users allowing you to earn up to 9.5% APY on your staked crypto assets including Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDC, etc. The crypto savings account has no minimum balance and no hidden fees. The interest rates accrue daily and are paid every month directly to your wallet.

Asia-based AAX Exchange is a privately held digital asset exchange leading crypto adoption in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2021 it announced its own crypto savings platform offering the highest rates on crypto savings with users earning up to 60% APY on their assets. 7-days fixed savings product.

Midas is the custodial crypto-investment platform founded in 2018 focusing on producing passive income on the core assets, and DeFi market. It has managed to accumulate over 18,000 investors and raise more than $22 million in assets. The platform uses different models of volatility prediction, correlation, strategies, collateral asset models, and hedging, allowing it to provide high interests rates on the market - up to 23%.

Celcius Network

Celcius Network offers considerably high rates but lacks full transparency on how the interest rates are calculated. The interest rates are paid according to loyalty tiers ranging from 2.02% to 17.78% on 14 different cryptocurrencies. The network starts paying interest every week and you can withdraw at any time you wish.

[Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/)

The saving accounts are ranked in tiers with specific tasks required to start saving on the platform. Its Earn feature offers rates from 0.5% to 8.5% for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and 14% for stablecoins like USDC. The platform pays out weekly rewards in USDC.

Nexo

Best known for its loaning platform, Nexo has also made a name for itself on the crypto savings market. Nexo’s high-yielding interest accounts offer as much as 12% APY on 20+ different crypto assets with the interest paid daily. It offers simple interest payments and short lockup times (less than 24 hours).

There are much more platforms you can look up such as Coinbase, Binance, Gemini, Bybit, WhiteBit (30% APY btw), well, mostly exchanges that offer you to open saving accounts.

long story short - I received an email from FAFSA, about applying for repayment plans. IDR or IBR stuck out to me but i am Not sure which would be better nor what the catch would be, as I am not that financially savvy.. but would not want the overall amount of debt it to rack up that interest rate of 2.750% over time..

I only make 1,440 a month, rent is 625 a month along with the other expenses like food and utilities. I don't have a car and rely on the bus or sometimes an Uber when the bus doesn't cut it.

So I have $345k of debt on the house. Zero other debt. Cars and everything else is bought for cash. Credit cards are paid off in full each month, and I can keep cards at zero spending while the refinancing app is being processed.

Here is the question.

I'm looking at my 2021 numbers. And I can pay my monthly vendors' bills either during the last week of December or during the first week of January. That makes a difference of about $50k. So I can make my 2021 net income either $30k or $80k. (All my businesses are structured as s chapter corporations. So whatever the corporation doesn't pay, that's my income as distribution.)

Normally, I would pay as much as I can before the end of the year to lower my taxable base. But I'm thinking, if I declare $80k net income in 2021 and I had net income of $46k in 2020. (They only look at the last two years?) And I have excellent credit score and no other debt, am I likely be able to refinance my $345k mortgage?

The downside of declaring higher net income this year is I would have to pay more for 2021 health insurance. My projection for income was $49k, so I got maximum credits on a gold plan. If I declare $80k, it means I would likely pay around $9k more for health care for 2021 while filing my 2021 return. (I switched to bronze plan for 2022, but in 2021 it was gold.)

At the same time, if I refinance, I might actually reduce my interest portion of the payments by more than $9k. So this would offset my health care payments increase.

Of course, if I declare $80k net income and pay back the health insurance credits and still don't get approved for mortgage refinancing.... well, that would suck.

So what say you smart people of personalfiance? Is it worth trying? Am I likely to be able to refinance mortgage with my numbers?

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:** 2019 income -$76k (negative), 2020 income $46k, 2021 income $80k.  Mortgage $345k, no other debt, excellent credit. Would I be approved to refinance my mortgage?",finance
economy,Say NO to Traditional Interest Rates in 2022,"Similar to traditional finance’s bank savings accounts, crypto firms across the ecosystem offer a savings plan for users who’d wish to earn passive income on their crypto assets. Crypto savings accounts in some cases can allow you to earn absolutely legit interest rates of 20% APY and more on your crypto assets by simply staking them with a service provider. 

BlockFi

BlockFi offers its Interest Account to all registered users allowing you to earn up to 9.5% APY on your staked crypto assets including Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDC, etc. The crypto savings account has no minimum balance and no hidden fees. The interest rates accrue daily and are paid every month directly to your wallet.

AAX Exchange

Asia-based AAX Exchange is a privately held digital asset exchange leading crypto adoption in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2021 it announced its own crypto savings platform offering the highest rates on crypto savings with users earning up to 60% APY on their assets. 7-days fixed savings product.

[Midas.Investments](https://midas.investments/)

Midas is the custodial crypto-investment platform founded in 2018 focusing on producing passive income on the core assets, and DeFi market. It has managed to accumulate over 18,000 investors and raise more than $22 million in assets. The platform uses different models of volatility prediction, correlation, strategies, collateral asset models, and hedging, allowing it to provide high interests rates on the market - up to 23%.

Celcius Network

Celcius Network offers considerably high rates but lacks full transparency on how the interest rates are calculated. The interest rates are paid according to loyalty tiers ranging from 2.02% to 17.78% on 14 different cryptocurrencies. The network starts paying interest every week and you can withdraw at any time you wish.

[Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/)

The saving accounts are ranked in tiers with specific tasks required to start saving on the platform. Its Earn feature offers rates from 0.5% to 8.5% for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and 14% for stablecoins like USDC. The platform pays out weekly rewards in USDC.

Nexo

Best known for its loaning platform, Nexo has also made a name for itself on the crypto savings market. Nexo’s high-yielding interest accounts offer as much as 12% APY on 20+ different crypto assets with the interest paid daily. It offers simple interest payments and short lockup times (less than 24 hours).

There are much more platforms you can look up such as Coinbase, Binance, Gemini, Bybit, WhiteBit (30% APY btw), well, mostly exchanges that offer you to open saving accounts.

The benefits of crypto savings account over a traditional savings bank account are obvious. Сrypto savings usually yield far more and have advantages over traditional savings. While we have considered only a few platforms that exist on the market, what platforms do you already use among mentioned or just planning to try in 2022?",finance

ethereum,What Jack Dorsey told me over a cup of coffee,"&amp;#x200B;

We met at Vesuvio Café recently in San Francisco, to ponder DeFi, Web 3, and metaverse. He was already seated when I arrived, instantly recognizable at a small corner table with his viking’s beard and shaved head. Going into the interview I assumed DeFi, Web 3, and metaverse were all real things, but surprisingly, I left with the understanding that none existed yet, filled with hope of what the real versions of them can bring. In his tweets, Jack hasn’t explained this fully to anyone, instead concentrating on venture capitalism and risks of shoddy protocol designs. We shook hands and I let him set the record straight.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

*Let’s cut through the preamble and get right down to it Jack, the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum, what do you think of it?*

**“Ethereum’s Network is a tokenized orgy of swaps, wraps, burns, mints, and stakes. Dapps do what exactly? Nothing. Nothing of value. They simply optimize token interactions to keep the orgy going. This is not Web 3.0, and this is not DeFi. The real versions of these will not require tokens, and instead will require real business products and services, from your kid’s lemonade stand, to global publishing. And from there, you realize exactly what’s going to happen:**

# DeFi and decentralization at large will naturally build around a global stateless money.

**Without that, you can’t actually have any of the other stuff—not the real versions at least. Money is not TPS, TX cost, or throughput. Those are all features of a blockchain. The only money that exists within the Ethereum Network, or any other smart contract platform, is actually worse than fiat—stablecoins. If you don’t believe me, then consider this simple damning statistic: 83% of all altcoin volume is from stablecoins. And get this, that percentage keeps growing. They’ve completely pushed out everything in what’s called** ***Gresham’s Law*****”**

*\[Gresham’s Law is an interesting economic theory explaining how bad money can drive out good money and I’ll link the Wiki for that below. My coffee arrived and I asked Jack to continue\]*

**""The hidden problem of course is that stablecoins collateralize everything, so with a supermajority of all transactions being these, ask this: What happens should unfavorable regulation arrive? If any of them start wobbling on their pegs, is there enough arbitrage to steady things? Absolutely not, because by then, the tx costs in the EVM will be over $500, and a bottleneck will have formed, trapping the most vulnerable people and projects. The chain reaction from even the smaller stablecoins breaking will spread everywhere. Game theory brings me to the conclusion that USDC will survive and trade at a staggering premium of $1.45 briefly as people are willing to sacrifice large percentage losses to avoid even bigger losses elsewhere. And huge outflows looking for safety will naturally run for bitcoin, but the wrapped version (WBTC) will quickly run dry and trade at a monster premium to even spot.”**

*It’s been said that SEC chair Gary Gensler is a friend of bitcoin as he used to teach that and a blockchain course at MIT when he was a professor there. What do you think?*

**“I call him the hangman.”**

*\[It was hard to finesse anything more out of Jack who was staring at me across the table after this statement, so I asked him about Ethereum’s move from PoW to PoS\]*

*Processing img v0gctq5czb781...*

**“It’s important in my opinion, that** ***The Merge*** **is complete before regulation drops. Because what we talked about above is just stablecoin regulation. If the Ripple lawsuit concludes, and their tokens are designated securities, then the SEC has federal legal precedent, and most smart contract and PoS platforms are in trouble as well. The crash could be extraordinary, a drawdown of 80% or more for even the most popular projects. This is also where bitcoin could pivot and assert permanent dominance over the crypto-asset space as well.**”

*I have to ask about Solana.*

**“Well, when the regulation drops, they’ll probably flip the switch and turn the blockchain off. A re-imagining of TVL.""**

*\[At this we both laughed like teenagers, then he gathered himself and continued\]*

**""But don’t worry, they’ll reboot every so often when the developers get calls from their VC friends looking to exit, a middle of the night type thing, contingent upon what time-zone they dial in from. When that's done they'll reboot and let plebs race to zero""**

*What was your Eureka moment when you realized it was bitcoin that would ultimately dominate the rest?*

**“It became clear to me years ago that whichever project established itself as money, and replaced the world’s money, would win everything. The only project with a one-dimensional design, purpose-built for that specific task was bitcoin. Few respect that electronic cash has been an obsession and goal of brilliant cypherpunks since 1989. It took them 20 years, innumerable projects, trial and error to finally solve the double spend problem with one-directional entropy and coinbase (no not the exchange). Its full stack is impossibly simple yet sophisticated. Few respect or understand the work and IQ it took to accomplish this, and are quick to jump for cheap script alternatives that all sit around waiting for bitcoin’s halving to do anything.”**

*\[It’s here I noticed someone standing behind me. Another meeting he had, dressed in a suit and carrying the physiognomy one might associate with lawyers. I asked Jack a final quick question about what he would tell anyone in the space on the sidelines about what to do.\]*

**“The separation of money from State is where my money and efforts are getting placed, because decentralization at large comes with it, then everything falls into place after.”**

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, Dec 23, 2021. Merry Christmas!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, December 23, 2021**

The stock market continued its positive momentum, with all three major indexes pushing higher for the third straight day to close out the holiday-shortened week as investors continue to digest a trove of new economic data, including a report on inflation, and the FDA approval of Pfizer (PFE) and Merck’s (MRK) coronavirus anti-viral pill. 

**Notable Numbers Today**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): +0.61%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): +0.75%
* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.55%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +0.81%
* Volatility Index (VIX): -5.15%
* Tesla (TSLA): +5.81%
* Crocs (CROX): -11.93%

Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) rose 5.7% in November, the fastest pace in over three decades. PCE price index rose 0.6% for the month, slightly lower than the 0.7% monthly gain in October. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 4.7%

Personal incomes rose 0.4% in November, slightly lower than a 0.5% increase in October. That followed a 1% plunge in September, when federal unemployment benefit expansion came to an end. 

Consumer spending, which accounts for 70% of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.6% in November, a solid gain but below the 1.4% surge in October.

Kathy Bostjanic, Chief US Financial Economist at Oxford Economics. said “Consumers spent with less enthusiasm in November as they shifted their holiday shopping to earlier in the season and continued to contend with escalating prices and reduced product availability.”

While the consumer price index (CPI) is the better known price gauge, the Federal Reserve prefers to follow the Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures price index in setting its interest-rate policies to fight inflation. The PCE price index tracks the actual purchases consumers are making each month while the CPI follows a fixed market basket of goods.

The Labor Department’s Weekly Unemployment Report showed that initial jobless claims last week totaled 205,000. The latest print brings the four-week moving average for new claims to its lowest in 52 years, reflecting a very tight labor market. 

Merck (MRK) received authorization from the FDA for its anti-viral coronavirus pill, the second at-home treatment approved in the US. This follows Pfizer, who received approval for their COVID pill yesterday. 

The pill developed by Merck in conjunction with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, called molnupiravir, was shown to reduce hospitalizations and deaths by around 30% in clinical trial data. Pfizer's pill was reported to be 90% effective at preventing hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients.

On Wednesday, the latest estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, third-quarter U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) was revised higher. Analysts now expect GDP to show a 2.3% annualized increase in economic activity in Q3, up from the 2.1% rise previously estimated. 

Moreover, the Conference Board’s highly anticipated Consumer Confidence Index report showed a greater than expected increase in December. The institution's headline index crept higher to 115.8 in December, based on the latest release. This was above the 111.0 expected, according to Bloomberg consensus data.

**Highlights**

* November sales of new U.S. homes jumped 12.4% to a seven-month high. The Census Bureau reported that new home sales rose 82,000 last month from October to 744,000, buoyed by low mortgage rates and higher demand in the housing industry.
* U.S. durable goods orders rose by 2.5% in November, up from the prior month, boosted by a sharp rise in aircraft orders.
* Core capital goods orders, a measure of business investment in equipment that excludes aircraft and military hardware, fell 0.1% after an upwardly revised 0.9% increase in October
* Electric carmaker Tesla Inc will stop allowing video games to be played on its infotainment systems while its vehicles are moving, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Thursday.
* Meta (FB) appealed the UK’s ruling that it must sell moving-image company Giphy.
* fourth-quarter sales in the U.S. are expected to jump 42.8% to 97,417 electric vehicles from a year ago and 28.8% over the previous quarter, the latest automotive industry forecast from auto information company TrueCar.
* TikTok was the most visited website in the entire internet in 2021, beating out Google.
* Nio announced that it received the U.N. certification on cybersecurity management, which is a major global mandatory regulation with regards to cybersecurity. It is widely applicable in countries such as the EU, the U.K., Japan and South Korea.

We are entering Terra Era! Yes, I just coined that myself, but you’re welcome to use it.

Terra (LUNA), which has been mentioned in the newsletter since the beginning, has gone up 96% and is at $95. Today it surpassed Binance in TVL. Its TVL has grown by 56% in the last week! Scroll to the NEWBIES section below if you don’t know what TVL means. Terra now holds $20 billion in assets and is number two behind Ethereum. To give you an idea of how fast this chain has grown, on Jan 1, 2021, Terra only $53 million in TVL.

&amp;#x200B;

The primary catalyst of growth is the burn mechanism of LUNA to mint UST. I wrote about it in a previous report. The other is Anchor Protocol, which gives a whopping 20% APY on the UST stablecoin. Before Anchor, a typical APY for stablecoins was 5–10%. So why continue keeping dollars in a greedy bank that gives you less than 1% APY? Aspects like this help support the future thesis of crypto.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*The other is Anchor Protocol, which gives a whopping 20% APY on the UST stablecoin*

Terra is a young network, and the Columbus 5 upgrade in early November opened the gates to 200 plus protocols. Its focus remains on DeFi, but Terra is integrating protocols focused on NFTs, payments, metaverses, and even games.

Keep Terra on your radar and find good entry points when the price drops.

**Bitcoin (BTC)** is having a very bullish day after yesterday’s quiet day. Since early this morning, some traders have been taking advantage of the low liquidity to push BTC past a 49k resistance. As a result, **BTC is up 5% to 50.9K**.

**Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D**) is flat, signaling that investors are entering all crypto spaces and not solely Bitcoin.

**SushiSwap (SUSHI)** is having a solid breakout from 11-month lows after news of leadership restructuring. Sushiswap is one of the most utilized DEXes in crypto and is fourth in TVL for DEXes, with $5.51 billion locked. Rumors circulate that the new director wants to modernize the swap to look like a centralized exchange. Sushiswap is accessible on 13 different chains, and inner turmoil has hurt Sushiswap price in the past six months. I would expect a strong rebound in price with SUSHI’s new sentiment. SUSHI currently sits at **$7.29**, far from its high in March 2021 of $23.00.

**Near Protocol (NEAR)** is **up 26% to $13.60.** Volume is entering NEAR after partnering with **Terra (LUNA)** on Dec 21st.

# Trade Set-up DOT

 

Polkadot (DOT) has been underperforming since Nov 5th and has dropped 56% despite Parachain Auctions and all the hype. The first five auctions are now complete, and Polkadot went live on Dec 17th after five years of research and development. Nevertheless, DOT remains one of my favorite projects, and its multi-chain architecture has the potential to play an essential role in the future of blockchain.

If the crypto market continues to climb next year, I believe DOT will be a strong performer, and right now is the time to pick it up at a highly discounted price.

I remain unconvinced that technical analysis is a good tool for predicting future prices. However, it is still a valuable tool in visualizing past price actions and patterns. Nevertheless, DOT is beginning the last leg of an Elliott Wave Pattern on the Daily Chart. The previous three days show a bullish breakout of DOT price, and the RSI is healthy at 50.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2j8f3603de781.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27fbe71a5b64aa6c0b5171efe5879cfa898c1284

If the pattern holds and reaches the .618 fib level based on the 4th wave, we can see DOT get to $75 around late March or Early April. This period coincides with the FOMC meetings which will hold a lot of weight on how far crypto climbs in 2022. I wrote about this in a previous report.

I would recommend adding a stop loss in the $20–22 range in case the market continues to retreat downwards. Take profits along the way and zero out your stop loss after you’re up 20–30%

**What is TVL?**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e4t6b1s9de781.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=633ebce1cc82081a9a0247ed394fa6bd5ad967fe

TVL is an abbreviation for TOTAL VALUE LOCKED and is a metric unique to crypto. It represents the total amount of assets deposited into decentralized protocols. These could be assets utilized in liquidity mining, staking, earning interest, or used in other smart contract utilities. In crypto, the assets are typically coins or tokens of various types but extend to include NFTs.

If you view a protocol like a bank, all the money and assets currently in the bank are the TVL. Therefore, assets will continuously flow in and out of the protocol but will not move for years.

Types of crypto protocols that contain locked assets:

* *Chains*
* *DEXes*
* *Lender/Borrowing services*
* *Yield Providers*
* *Insurance*
* *Options trading*
* *Staking*

The total TVL for the entire crypto currently sits at $256.12 billion.

To give you an idea of how fast crypto is growing, on Dec 30th, 2020, the total TVL was at $19.18 billion. The market has more than 10x the value of assets locked in protocols.

The preferred location to view TVL is [Defi Llama](https://defillama.com/).

Now that you understand TVL, the following Monday, I will explain how it can serve as a helpful tool in evaluating protocols and the crypto market as a whole.

personalfinance,Medicine School Loan suggestions: Take Loan or Not?,"Hi all,

Thanks for reading! Appreciate your suggestion and thoughts. 

I am a 25y nurse on track to apply to medical school in May 2022. Other info: single, no dependent or college loan.

 1) Is it worthwhile to relocate to TX resident and qualify for $25000/yr tuition as opposed to $60000/yr in IL?   I gotta accrue 12 months of residence before qualifying for in-state. Therefore, if i relocate to TX now, I open up opportunities to 10 affordable schools, whereas I lose out one opportunity to the IL state school. I will still apply broadly, so it seems TX relocation is favorable regarding options. True or not?


2) is it worthwhile to push back medical school for one year and work as an RN to pay off tuition before school starts? 

3) I am opposed to the federal loan forgiveness program, but in what circumstances would you recommend this?


Feel free to provide TX specific tips/relocation tips too! 

Thank you for your help!",finance

Bitcoin,"The end of ""Fiat"" and Bitcoin mass-adoption starting to happen.","Do you remember this [post about mass adoption 9 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/rlfwax/dont_know_how_many_of_you_saw_this_but_this_guy/) ?

Well, this is starting to happen right in front of our eyes. Check this out:

[El Salvador president says](https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1474119003169865728):

&gt;What has been called by international organizations as ""The Bitcoin Experiment"", is nothing more than the world watching how mass adoption changes a country’s economy.  
&gt;  
&gt;If it’s for the good, it’s game over for FIAT.

&gt;The end of ""Fiat""  
&gt;  
&gt;It's very necessary, but it will not be a pretty sight

&amp;#x200B;

Just wait until the ""[Bitcoin bonds](https://archive.ph/W6ijb)"" of El Salvador are sucessful and they can prove that they can borrow at a better interest rate without the IMF help. Then wait until other countries (specially those abused by the IMF) jump in.

personalfinance,I have a mortgage question,"I am frustrated and looking for any advice or options that I may not have thought of.

I have been attempting to get a mortgage loan through my bank. I have enough money in the bank to cover more than the loan amount, I have excellent credit, I have zero debt.

I currently pay rent and storage for my RV. Buying a house would lessen my monthly burden by over $500 a month.

I have not worked in the last year, by choice. I spent the last year travelling and enjoying life.

The bank will not approve the loan without 6 months of income showing. The crazy part to me is, that income is coming from my investment account into my checking account. It is not new money, it is money I already have.

I am exploring asset only loans, but would prefer a loan through my bank. They are trying to work with me as the loan officers I have talked to also agree that this makes zero sense. Any other ideas here?

Current options are

1. get an asset only loan from another lender
2. wait 6 months. Downside to this is my rental agreement is up in Feb and I do not want to continue paying for a rental as it feels like a waste of money. Also the landlord will not do a month to month lease, or 6 month, only a year.

I realize it is not the best time to by houses right now. Prices are high, interest rates are low. But, I would rather my money go towards something that will make me money, and cost me less monthly than my current rent.",finance

8. Charles dropped a new AMA where he mentioned very briefly that they are actually going to look into read-only UTxOs. If it’s possible to have these types of UTxOs while preserving determinism, it would be a big change since transactions must currently consume inputs.

18. Charles drops a video on the eToro user limitations. It sounds like IOHK knew nothing about this. Interacting with exchanges falls in the Cardano Foundation’s wheelhouse. It’s unclear whether the CF knew anything. He also pointed out it’s very interesting that an old line exchange like Bitstamp has decided to LIST Cardano during this same period. Charles also mentioned that they haven’t seen any regulatory activity on IOHK’s end. eToro is a relatively small source of liquidity for Cardano and there shouldn’t be much of an impact.

32. The Cardano Community takes a moment to enjoy contemplating the circumstance that there will never need to be a “magical Cardano 2” in order for our blockchain to survive. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1465089315340488704](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1465089315340488704)

58. The heads of Circle, FTX, Bitfury, Paxos, Stellar Development Foundation, and Coinbase appeared before the House Financial Services Committee. As expected, the questions from some of the House Committee members belied a misplaced focus on things like terrorist financing while others understood the need to regulate crypto appropriately so that crypto innovation is not forced offshore. There was significant focus on stablecoins due to the President’s Working Group placing so much focus there. One representative also chose to focus heavily on the energy consumption of Bitcoin mentioning coal power plants coming back on line to fuel Bitcoin mining. The witnesses from the crypto industry seemed to focus on dispelling misconceptions and also pushing for a single crypto focused regulatory body as opposed to the fragmented regulation that is typical in Washington.

personalfinance,Why should lenders accept to re-finance a mortgage?,I have read that one of the best reasons to refinance a loan is when interest rates have dropped. Now this doesn't make sense - why should the bank agree to a lower interest rate when it stands to benefit from a loan given at a time when interest was high? A startup wouldn't refinance a 200k seed investment from the first investors for 20% of the company once the company is worth 1B. So why should the bank do that?,finance
Bitcoin,Bitcoin gives you abundant access to the only two riches that matter in life: Time and Freedom.,"Having a lot of U.S. dollars in your bank account will give you the illusion that you are rich. This is the same problem with any fiat currency.

However, with your U.S. dollars, you will not have access in abundance to the real wealth of life. You will not be able to live your life on your own terms. Because of the endless inflation of the U.S. dollar, you will have no choice but to spend more and more money.

If you want to keep your fiat money, its value will melt over time due to the inflation engineered by governments for their own benefit.

The economist and philosopher Friedrich Hayek had already identified the problem in the mid-1970s when he said:

&gt;“I do not think it is an exaggeration to say history is largely a history of inflation, usually inflations engineered by governments for the gain of governments.”

We have had the demonstration of this phenomenon in an amplified way since Mars 2020. It has a name: the Cantillon effect. In the current system, you are forced to act according to the wishes of the Fed. It is the Fed that gives you the strategy to follow. If you choose to fight the Fed in the current system, you will keep losing purchasing power.

The U.S. dollar you own does not really belong to you since you cannot use it as you wish.

You are forced to spend it, and even worse, within the framework set by governments and banks. The latter may prohibit you from making certain transactions for totally arbitrary reasons. They may also confiscate what you own for equally obscure reasons.

There are far too many opportunities for censorship in the current monetary and financial system.

Much more than just fiat money in abundance in your bank account, you must seek to obtain in abundance the two following riches: time and freedom.

Time is the scarcest and most precious thing in the world. Having time is the most important thing in life. If you couple that time with the freedom to spend it as you wish, you will have immediate access to what matters in life. Having all the time you want to live your life on your own terms is priceless.

Bitcoin's unique monetary system allows you to save the fruits of your labor while being guaranteed that no one can censor you. So you'll solve two fundamental problems with Bitcoin. You have complete freedom to live your life on your own terms thanks to Bitcoin and its unique properties.

Bitcoin is a true revolution that is accessible to everyone on Earth. This is even more revolutionary because all you need is a smartphone and an Internet connection to buy Bitcoin. By buying Bitcoin, you are voting for a better system.

If you choose to buy Bitcoin, you are voting to take control of your life by giving you the chance to have abundant access to the two essential riches of life: time and freedom.

While Bitcoiners have understood this for some time, a majority of the general public has not yet realized this. We are only at the beginning of the Bitcoin revolution. By opening your eyes before others, you can be among those who will benefit the most from this revolution.

It is up to you to make the effort to put aside the illusion of the wealth that the U.S. dollar can provide and discover what real wealth lies elsewhere, and that Bitcoin is your best chance to access it.",cryptocurrency

defi,(Part 2) Deep dive into Terra Ecosystem,"Hello all,

This is gonna be a long post.

In celebration of Binance listing UST and LUNA breaking 100$, I would like to update my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/ok9xhq/deep_dive_into_terra_ecosystem/) nearly half a year ago on the Terra ecosystem. There's a ton of euphoria right now, and so its always good to take a look back at the fundamentals.

A lot has changed since then and by now I'm sure many more people have heard about Terra, maybe even used some of its dapps. For those that are brand new, I recommend reading my original post first. For those wondering if it's too late to get into LUNA, I will present why I think LUNA still has much room to grow.  I won't cover every protocol, just the ones I think are most interesting/significant. Still, there's a lot to go through so let's get started.

**A quick refresher**

Terra is a blockchain developed by TerraForm Labs based on Cosmos SDK (this is important because it allows Terra to connect to all other blockchains in the Cosmos ecosystem, more on this later). Their main products are a suite of algorithmic stablecoins, the most prominent being UST tied to the dollar. UST retains its peg through its relationship with LUNA, where LUNA absorbs the volatility of UST. LUNA is minted when selling UST, and burned when buying UST. In practice, 1$ of LUNA **always equals** 1$ of UST, even if UST loses its peg. This creates arbitrage opportunities, where if UST is at 1.50$, you can sell 1$ of LUNA for 1.50$ UST and immediately bank 50% profit. This increases supply of UST as people sell LUNA for UST and the peg returns to 1. In reverse, if UST is at .50$, people buy 1$ of LUNA with .50$ UST, which decreases UST supply until the peg returns to 1. Again, videos on this below:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HLiZxkbxfY&amp;t=917s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HLiZxkbxfY&amp;t=917s)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL8tcVHyHMM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL8tcVHyHMM)

Stablecoins are the most important product in all of crypto, no question about it. I honestly can't imagine a time without stablecoins when people took profits into BTC, itself a highly volatile asset. But stablecoins are also not a risk-less product, they are subject to regulators scrutiny and issued by sometimes shady companies (cough...Tether) that may or may not have the funds available to prevent a bank run. A decentralized stablecoin for defi is a no-brainer, and UST is the best of the best currently (DAI is backed by centralized stablecoins and both DAI and MIM are supply constrained, in that they can only be minted with collateral. There are no limits on how much UST can be minted). Protocols on Terra are important to the extent that they drive organic demand for UST. In other words, LUNA can survive and thrive even if all protocols on Terra die out as long as UST is adopted by other blockchains as their main stablecoin. This sets Terra apart from others, its goal is not competing with Solana, Ethereum, Avalanche, or any of the other L1s, its goal is to create the most robust and usable algorithmic stablecoin for all of crypto. A bet on LUNA is a bet on the adoption of UST. Keep this in mind.

[This graphic was created in July though at that point we only had Anchor and Mirror running. Now many of these projects have launched or are soon to launch! \(though a lot of them are terminated as well\)](https://preview.redd.it/i9yaexxb2e781.png?width=2364&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09544f1c9143236c0d080d14d800ea392e8dbbce)

Launched: Anchor, Mirror, Angel, Valkyrie Protocol, Pylon Protocol, StarTerra, Angel, Talis, HERO, Apollo, Spectrum, Orion Money, Kado, Chai, Loterra, LOOP, Stader, Nexus, Harpoon (now Kujira).

Soon to launch: Mars, Kinetic, Ozone, Suberra, alice, Levana, Astroport, Prism, Spar, White Whale, Neptune, Glow.

I may have missed some so let me know if I did.

Even with all these new protocols, the core of the Terra ecosystem is still Anchor, so let's see what has changed since.

**Anchor: Savings and borrowing**

Last time I wrote about Anchor it was burning reserves and had just been given a lifeline by TFL. Deposits and borrows were a fraction of what they are today. TVL in the protocol has grown exponentially and is one one of the top 10 defi protocols across all chains. Impressive, considering it operates only on the Terra blockchain whereas many other protocols exist across blockchains. Just recently, Anchor devs announced their intent to make Anchor a cross-chain platform, which would undoubtedly bring in even more capital. On top of that, yield reserves have been growing quite consistently with the addition of bETH and rising value of LUNA. However, with deposits continuing to eclipse borrows, there will eventually come a point when Anchor can no longer sustain its close to 20% interest rate. TFL has been transparent about the fact that the rate cannot be sustained forever, so lowering rates is not cause for panic. Even 15% is far better than any traditional banks or other stablecoin earning dapps/wallets (Celsius 8%, [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) 12%, etc). When this happens, I believe devs should implement a tiered structure of interest rates rewarding those that hold ANC tokens with higher interest. But until then, enjoy your 20% for as long as it lasts :)

[Current total deposits\/borrow vs. the time of my first post. Interestingly, that little blip in borrows during the May crash at the time felt like a disaster. Today you can barely see the drop.](https://preview.redd.it/s9n1e238me781.png?width=1992&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6153917a151a9a852dec5ce01b9e53d68f1eb7f6)

**Mirror: Synthetic assets**

24/7 trading of the most popular stocks from anywhere in the world on the blockchain, what's not to like? Unfortunately, Mirror has run into some problems in its time. At one point holding nearly 2b in TVL, Mirror today has only half of that according to DefiLlama. On Mirror itself, the TVL statistic has been removed from the landing page. What happened to Mirror? I believe there were 3 main factors involved: 1. Execution 2. Regulation 3. Full decentralization

1. Even in its heyday, Mirror listed new assets far too slowly. And when it did, it listed things like mDOT or mBTC, synthetic versions of cryptocurrencies which serves no discernible purpose other than for LPs to farm MIR tokens. Because all anyone was doing was farming MIR, the price of MIR fell and has not been doing much since. Perhaps Mirror could have done better by focusing on more exotic asset classes to list (commodities?) that would attract new capital into the protocol, but it may be too late for that now considering...
2. regulations. It started when Uniswap delisted synthetic tokens from their DEX frontend, this included all Mirror based tokens. Shortly thereafter, we learned that Do Kwon (founder of TFL) was served (albeit unjustly) a subpoena by the SEC at Mainnet 2021 over Mirror. Hardly surprising that the SEC would be concerned about a synthetic stock market. Although Do pushed back against the SEC by suing them back, this created a lot of FUD regarding Mirror and cast its future into shadows.
3. Perhaps as a result of these events, TFL relinquished any control of Mirror and turned it into a fully decentralized protocol run 100% by the community. Although decentralization is regarded as the holy grail in crypto, it became quickly apparent that full decentralization too soon without any leadership is not beneficial to anyone. A quick look at [Mirror governance](https://mirrorprotocol.app/#/gov) tells the story.

[Full decentralization without leadership is a mess.](https://preview.redd.it/mt3iotvwqe781.png?width=1974&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ae5bf4d5e51827c63d0e9e95817b5eeea52d130)

Long story short, I think Mirror is unfortunately a dying protocol (contrary to my original thesis) and there's not much I can see that would save it.

On the bright side, there are plenty of new protocols that have since launched or are launching that will soak up the value of Mirror, let's take a look at some of the most prominent ones.

**Launched:**

**NFTs:** NFTs arrived on the Terra blockchain with the same insane excitement as any other blockchain. One of the earliest and most hyped projects was Galactic Punks (punks in space) which minted on [Randomearth](https://randomearth.io/home). Since then tens if not hundreds of additional projects have launched and minted. I won't talk about any of them individually in detail as there are just too many. Feel free to browse Randomearth! My personal favorite is definitely [Hero](https://www.heronft.io/). Just look at Do Kwon's profile picture, how cool is that?

[**Pylon**](https://gateway.pylonprotocol.com/)**/**[**StarTerra**](https://starterra.io/): Both of these are launchpads on Terra, and both are pretty unique in terms of launchpads. Pylon was the first and incubated by TFL. It uses a clever system called ""Pylon Pools"", where users can deposit UST in exchange for tokens from new project launches where the amount is determined based on how long you lock your UST, options being a 3 month/6 month/12 months vesting period. This is a ""risk-less"" investment in that you recover your original UST amount at the end of the vesting period, and also allows smoother project launches that dampen price volatility. There is also Pylon Swap, where users that stake Pylon's own governance token MINE are allocated a certain amount of new project tokens in a presale (though these are much rarer with the preferred being Pylon Pools. Overall the protocol works as its intended, though there have been criticisms that MINE stakers are not rewarded enough for holding MINE. The team behind Pylon is working on improving benefits for stakers with recently implemented retroactive airdrops for long term stakers. I am excited to see what other innovative launches they come up with in the future.

StarTerra is the first gamified launchpad where stakers are divided into 1 of 3 factions and rewards are allocated differently to the stronger of the factions. To be honest, I have not looked much into this project as their launch was very rocky and received a lot of community distrust. However, I know that since then the team has worked hard to improve their reputation with the community and projects are continuing to partner with StarTerra. Anyone more involved, feel free to comment below on this project!

[**Loterra**](https://loterra.io/): If crypto isn't gambling enough, you're welcome to gamble more with Loterra! Basically a lottery protocol that charges 1UST per ticket and draws every 3 days. There are some cool features though. LOTA stakers are rewarded a portion of every lottery winning including jackpots. There is also the ability to play ""lossless"" lottery, where it uses Anchor yield to buy recurring tickets whilst keeping your principal amount intact.

[**Orion Money**](https://orion.money/): One of if not the most anticipated and hyped up project launches on Terra which to be honest up to this point has done little more than disappoint. Orion is a stablecoin savings protocol that leverages the yield of Anchor on other blockchains. It allows deposits of USDC, USDT, BUSD, and others on Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon and pays up to 15% interest by converting and depositing these coins into Anchor. It was said to be the one to open the floodgates to the masses. However, Orion has not seen the expected growth as TVL has stagnated and even fallen over the past few months with only a couple hundred million in TVL, this compared to Anchor's 5 billion in UST deposits (over the same period Anchor deposits increased by several billion). Furthermore, Orion hyped up its airdrop for months and required all recipients to stake to the Orion validator in order to be eligible. Months of staking led to a measly 1% of all tokens being airdropped to loyal stakers. Of course, free money is free money, but it still leaves a sour taste in your mouth. With UST now being available on Binance (listed today), Huobi (listed yesterday), Kucoin, and potentially many more exchanges to come, UST on-ramp will become increasingly easy and there is little reason to not use Anchor directly within Terra. That being said, credit is due for a solid team and an innovative product that unfortunately just has not gained much traction.

[**Apollo**](https://app.apollo.farm/)**/**[**Spectrum**](https://terra.spec.finance/vaults): Both are yield compounders that do exactly what they are supposed to do, there's not much more to say here. Use them to boost your yield on LP pairs within the Terra ecosystem. Spectrum launched a bit under the radar but has since proved its robustness with audits and UI enhancements. Apollo had a pre-launch token mining program which was a great success and one of the fairest launches to date. Kudos to both platforms.

[**Nexus**](https://nexusprotocol.app/)**:** Nexus is a yield optimizer leveraging Anchor Earn and Borrow. During the May crash, many accounts borrowing UST on Anchor were liquidated when the price of LUNA used as collateral (called bLUNA) plummeted. New borrowers became hesitant to borrow for fear that they would be liquidated overnight. If there are no borrowers, Anchor Earn cannot sustain its high interest and the protocol would collapse. Nexus aims to help alleviate the problem by providing a system of automated loan managements. You deposit bLUNA into their vault which they use to borrow UST at a preset ratio safe from liquidation and autonomously readjusts itself to maintain the same rate. The borrowed UST is then deposited into Anchor Earn, the interest from borrowing and depositing is used to buy PSI tokens, and the PSI tokens are used to pay interest to those depositing bLUNA into the vault.

[**Kujira**](https://kujira.app/): The Japanese word for whale. Contrary to Nexus protecting from liquidations, Kujira aims to allow everyone the opportunity to benefit from liquidations, whereas before, liquidations would be sniped by bots. Kujira lets you bid for liquidated bAssets (bLUNA, bETH) at a discount to their current value by depositing UST. It works like a charm from what I can tell, though I haven't personally used it (feel kind of bad profiting off people being inadvertently liquidated...but free market and all that, the option is there).

[**Stader**](https://staderlabs.com/): Probably the most interesting protocol in this list. Stader is a liquid staking and auto-compounding platform that allows you to stake LUNA without any unbonding period (usually 21 day unlock on TerraStation). The base yield from LUNA is compounded automatically while still allowing stakers to receive all the airdrops they would have received if they had just staked LUNA normally. In exchange for staking LUNA on the platform, you are given a token called LUNAX, which is a representation of your stake much like how your UST turns into aUST when you deposit into Anchor. LUNAX will open up a whole new world of degen leverage opportunities that are currently in the works. Check out the video below, I don't think I can explain better than him.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0PTNguCP88&amp;t=621s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0PTNguCP88&amp;t=621s)

[**Angel**](https://www.angelprotocol.io/): A one of a kind charity protocol that is always worth a mention. Angel provides perpetual donations using yield generated from staked LUNA. It runs a validator for staking LUNA, and all interest generated from staked LUNA is given to charities. It is a great concept and definitely worth supporting. To date they have already donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to various charities around the world that you can see on their website.

Other launched projects (that I am not very familiar with) include, TerraFloki, Loop, Valkyrie, and maybe others I've missed. And onto the up-and-coming projects, there are a few highly anticipated ones around the corner.

**Coming soon**

[**Astroport**](https://astroport.fi/)**:** Can you believe Terra has the second highest TVL of any chain without a fully fledged AMM DEX? Neither can I. Astroport, incubated by [Delphi Labs](https://delphidigital.io/labs) (a big investor and supporter of Terra who also helped design Axie Infinity), aims to be Terra's go-to exchange. Currently there is only TerraSwap, which is essentially a re-skinned version of Mirror's backend that leaves a lot of functions to be desired. People who've been in the ecosystem all know the number of times TerraSwap has broken or been hit with stupidly high slippage out of nowhere. Astroport is launching in a few days and is currently in Phase 2 of its ""lockdrop"" campaign, a 3 step process to ensure the DEX launches with substantial liquidity already provided and rewarding early providers with ASTRO tokens. It is a bit complex but if you're interested it is quite an innovative model and you can read about it [here](https://astroport.medium.com/countdown-initiated-announcing-astroports-astrodrop-and-launch-date-229d3d8b61cb). Phase 2 is ongoing and you still have the opportunity to contribute to the ASTRO liquidity bootstrapping pool for ASTRO rewards if you want to! [https://lockdrop.astroport.fi/active-phase](https://lockdrop.astroport.fi/active-phase) Astroport will make the Terra ecosystem even more robust and give users one more reason to never leave again. The DEX launches in 3 days!

[**Ozone**](https://agora.terra.money/t/ozone-insurance-mechanism-v2-1/914): Terra's native insurance protocol has been in the works for some time. It will allows you to buy insurance in case of UST depeg, smart contract risks, etc. Ozone was funded recently by TFL with \~4 billion UST from burning the LUNA held in their community funds. Last month, Risk Harbor announced they would be in charge of operating Ozone. [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/risk-harbor-announces-charge-terras-150000785.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/risk-harbor-announces-charge-terras-150000785.html) When this project finally launches, it will provide safety assurance for many users, opening up the ecosystem even more to the masses. As a side note, the community pool burn of LUNA resulted in so many fees that will go to pay staking interest that the rewards for staking nearly doubled to around 9-10% per year and will remain consistent for the next few years.

[**Mars**](https://twitter.com/mars_protocol): Another project incubated by Delphi Labs, Mars is a lending and borrowing protocol set to launch early next year. Not much is known about it yet, but it is also highly anticipated. You can watch this video to learn more about it [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waIb2\_jseg&amp;t=394s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waIb2_jseg&amp;t=394s)

[**White Whale**](https://www.whitewhale.money/)**:** Allows retail investors to help maintain UST's peg and profit from arbitrage opportunities by pooling assets.

[**Levana**](https://levana.finance/): Short for Leverage any Asset, basically does what its name suggests. It will allow you to go full degen and buy leveraged assets such as 2x LUNA. What's not to like?

[**Prism**](https://prismfinance.app/): A very innovative protocol that will split yield-bearing assets such as LUNA into principle and yield components, name pLUNA and yLUNA, where one represents the base token and the other represents the future yield of the base token. This allows you to do things like theoretically borrowing against your future yield revenue. I am very excited to see the full functionality of this protocol once it goes live.

**Airdrops**

Finally, we can't talk about Terra protocols without talking about airdrops. Almost every protocol launched on Terra has had some form of airdrop to different participants in the ecosystem, particularly LUNA stakers. It is a tradition I expect will continue. Even projects launching on other blockchains have airdropped or will airdrop LUNA stakers, including Comdex and Shade Protocol on Secret Network (all part of overall Cosmos ecosystem).

[Full airdrop chart, credit to Crypto\_Carlosa on Twitter for making and updating it.](https://preview.redd.it/vgo1vqylkg781.png?width=1856&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e1f085619c143b41853ca8ac719f21a245725e4a)

**Beyond Terra**

Terra now has a whole suite of defi projects driving demand for UST, but UST is not limited to Terra. Since I last wrote about Terra, UST has found its way to Solana, Fantom, Harmony, and linked with other Cosmos blockchains through Cosmos IBC and been listed on Osmosis (the premier DEX for all Cosmos-based blockchains, UST serving as the de-facto stablecoin). As regulation around centralized stablecoins inevitably continues to tighten, I predict defi ecosystems will increasingly adopt UST as their central stablecoin.

UST has also appeared on several centralized exchanges since, the most notable being Binance just this morning (a great Xmas gift for all). It is also listed on Kucoin, Huobi (just yesterday), Coinbase Pro, and others. Though being listed on CEXes is not the premier goal of UST, it definitely drives adoption and lowers barrier of entry for anyone who wants to enter the Terra ecosystem, which is a great thing for all.

Rumor has it (though not really a rumor anymore since Do Kwon confirmed it) that TFL is in talks with the government of Busan to in some way utilize their stablecoins. If it ever comes to fruition, it would represent a killer use-case and validation for decentralized stablecoins used by a government. However, government bureaucracy moves slow so I wouldn't hold my breath.

**Spending UST**

The big question on everyone's minds is how to even spend all that yield, assuming you aren't a complete degen leveraging everything to the limits. So what options are out there?

Chai: A payment company that launched with Terra in the beginning and uses Terra stablecoins. It can be used in Korea and is actually a huge use-case for Terra that I haven't mentioned but is worth a further look if you are interested.

[Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com): My go-to method. Just transfer your LUNA and convert to USDC/USDT (they haven't listed UST yet) and top up your Visa debit card. I don't wanna shill for CDC but fuck it their card is awesome (its metal from second tier up), the benefits are great, and its so easy to use. And just a tip, the [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) app exchange rates are god-awful so its better to sell your LUNA first on Binance or elsewhere and transfer BUSD to CDC over Binance Smart Chain (super low fees), then convert to USDC/USDT to top up (no fees for swapping stablecoins).

Binance: With Binance listing UST and also offering their own debit card, spending UST should be incredibly easy for anyone with a card.

[Kado Money](https://kado.money/): Kado allows you to spend UST directly on many different things, as well as providing a card that can be topped up with UST.

[Terra Cards](https://www.terra.cards/): Gift cards using UST (for US based users only)

[Travala](https://www.travala.com/): Pay for flights and hotels using UST! Easy as that. They also accepts dozens of other crypto too.

**Is it too late to get into LUNA?**

No one can predict price movements, but with a long term time horizon, strong assets tend to move up and to the right (just look at a long term chart of any asset you can think of, heck even Bitcoin). 

LUNA is now trading around ATH at 100$, a huge milestone for everyone involved. However, now is not the time to be FOMOing in, this is true for any asset at ATH's. The listing on Binance has been rumored for a while and may prove to be a sell the news event, as LUNA is already up more than 100% in the past month leading to this listing. Of course, I would be more than happy to see LUNA continue to make ATHs, but I urge caution and restraint to everyone. DCA in if you must. That being said, I believe LUNA is still undervalued compared to other blockchains. As a ratio of MktCap to TVL, LUNA is priced lower than almost every notable blockchain in the top 10 besides Fantom. And none of the other coins have tokenomics on par with LUNA, a hyper deflationary token as long as UST adoption increases. Again, a bet on Terra and LUNA is a bet on UST and algorithmic decentralized stablecoin winning the stablecoin war.

So for an answer to the question, I would say it's not too late. However, there may very well be better entry opportunities in the short term. Stay safe out there all you apes. 

Any questions or comments are welcome!

**TLDR**: The defi ecosystem on Terra is thriving. It has come a long long way since the crash in May. UST is being adopted across blockchains and listed on more and more major exchanges both CEX and DEX. As UST is minted, LUNA is burned. More UST = higher value of LUNA, not financial advice.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,"Instagram is ""actively engaged with NFTs""","The social network Instagram announces its intention to enter the NFT sector. Has the hype reached an all-time high? Market Update.

Especially the NFT space once again wrote big headlines in the last weeks. Adidas went live with its own collection and Nike acquired an NFT start-up to push further into the space. Now news reaches us that Instagram, a social network owned by Meta, is also looking to expand into NFTs.

In a video, Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri responded to a question about what he thought about NFT integration on the social media platform. While there was nothing concrete to announce yet, Mosseri responded that the company was ""actively looking at NFTs and how to bring them to a broader audience."" This is not surprising - as part of Meta, the platform is likely subject to a similar Metaverse drive.

**Japan as NFT stronghold**

It is striking that the search term ""crypto"" and ""NFT"" are currently at the same level. On the one hand, this reflects the current NFT hype. On the other hand, it also provides information about the search behavior of people who, according to the figures, are now more likely to search specifically for NFTs than for the crypto space in general.

A regional comparison also reveals some developments. For example, while France is just as interested in the crypto space in general as it is in Bitcoin specifically in terms of search queries, Japan records the highest NFT interest within a country compared to the other two search terms, with a value of 52 percent.

Germany, on the other hand, shows the most interest in Bitcoin. A look at the various federal states reveals that Berlin in particular sets the pace in the NFT sector.

CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin gives you abundant access to the only two riches that matter in life: Time and Freedom,"Having a lot of U.S. dollars in your bank account will give you the illusion that you are rich. This is the same problem with any fiat currency.

However, with your U.S. dollars, you will not have access in abundance to the real wealth of life. You will not be able to live your life on your own terms. Because of the endless inflation of the U.S. dollar, you will have no choice but to spend more and more money.

If you want to keep your fiat money, its value will melt over time due to the inflation engineered by governments for their own benefit.

The economist and philosopher Friedrich Hayek had already identified the problem in the mid-1970s when he said:

&gt;“I do not think it is an exaggeration to say history is largely a history of inflation, usually inflations engineered by governments for the gain of governments.”

We have had the demonstration of this phenomenon in an amplified way since Mars 2020. It has a name: the Cantillon effect. In the current system, you are forced to act according to the wishes of the Fed. It is the Fed that gives you the strategy to follow. If you choose to fight the Fed in the current system, you will keep losing purchasing power.

The U.S. dollar you own does not really belong to you since you cannot use it as you wish.

You are forced to spend it, and even worse, within the framework set by governments and banks. The latter may prohibit you from making certain transactions for totally arbitrary reasons. They may also confiscate what you own for equally obscure reasons.

There are far too many opportunities for censorship in the current monetary and financial system.

Much more than just fiat money in abundance in your bank account, you must seek to obtain in abundance the two following riches: time and freedom.

Time is the scarcest and most precious thing in the world. Having time is the most important thing in life. If you couple that time with the freedom to spend it as you wish, you will have immediate access to what matters in life. Having all the time you want to live your life on your own terms is priceless.

Bitcoin's unique monetary system allows you to save the fruits of your labor while being guaranteed that no one can censor you. So you'll solve two fundamental problems with Bitcoin. You have complete freedom to live your life on your own terms thanks to Bitcoin and its unique properties.

Bitcoin is a true revolution that is accessible to everyone on Earth. This is even more revolutionary because all you need is a smartphone and an Internet connection to buy Bitcoin. By buying Bitcoin, you are voting for a better system.

If you choose to buy Bitcoin, you are voting to take control of your life by giving you the chance to have abundant access to the two essential riches of life: time and freedom.

While Bitcoiners have understood this for some time, a majority of the general public has not yet realized this. We are only at the beginning of the Bitcoin revolution. By opening your eyes before others, you can be among those who will benefit the most from this revolution.

It is up to you to make the effort to put aside the illusion of the wealth that the U.S. dollar can provide and discover what real wealth lies elsewhere, and that Bitcoin is your best chance to access it.",cryptocurrency

Since this is my first time being SE and if I was issued a tax refund last year, do I even need to file for this quarter or can I wait till April 15th?

I am also very confused about ""estimated taxes"" and ""pay as you go""

Why do I have to estimate my entire yearly income earning when I can just pay as I go per quarter? Why is it an estimate if IRS calls it pay-as-you-go?

For example, September through December is the 4th quarter tax payment. Why can't I just pay taxes on my net income the exact amount that I earned for that quarter? For example, if I earned $10,000 in net income that quarter, I pay (92.35%\*10k)\*15.3% for SE, and my state / federal (Per tax bracket).

I'm assuming specifically for the 4th quarter I will pay the exact amount? But what about the other quarters? Why do I have to estimate those taxes? Why do I have to assume how much I'm going to earn for the entire year and then divide it by 4? That sounds a little crazy because I literally cannot estimate how much I'm going to make per quarter for an entire year; my industry is very volatile and my earnings fluctuate drastically. Why can't I just pay taxes on exactly what I earned in net income for that quarter? Am I missing something here?

For example:

**January to March**, I earn $20k net income. I pay taxes on that net income of $20k  by April 15th.

**April - May** I earn $5k in net income, I pay taxes on $5k by June 15th.

personalfinance,Should I refinance student loans to free up cash for more investing?,"Been on here for a few years but made a new account since I'm sharing personal information.

I'm 23M and have $110,000 in student loans at an interest rate of 3.96%. I started working 6 months ago after getting my masters and am fortunate to be making $85,000 a year. No other debt and I am living fairly cheaply with 3 roommates in a decent apartment. My loans are currently financed to be paid off in 6 more years which gives me a massive monthly payment of \~$1720. With my income I can very comfortably pay that amount, but I'm starting to feel like I should have financed for a longer period with rates being so low which would of course allow me to invest much more each month and at age 23 that seems valuable. For example it looks like I could refinance to 20 years at 4.8% and be paying \~$730 a month which would free up an extra thousand a month to invest. I feel confident that I am the type of person who would ACTUALLY invest the extra money instead of spending it.

Do you guys think I should refinance or stay where I'm at?

personalfinance,Why is my second pay check withholding so much from my paycheck for federal taxes. Will I get a refund?,"I just got my first full time job which started on Nov 29th 2021. My first pay check (for a week) was 1442.31 before taxes. Here were my taxes:

20.91 Employee Medicare
165.42 Federal income tax
1.88 MA paid family leave 
3.58 MA paid medical leave
66.60 MA state Income Tax
89.42 Social security.

My take home for the week was 1094.50. Now, I was expecting that to double on my following paychecks as my usual pay period was every 2 weeks. However, I just got my second pay check of 2048$. All the taxes except federal income tax we’re basically consistent with what I expected (doubled because of 2 weeks pay). My federal income tax went from 165.42 to 471.10. Why did that happen? And will I be getting any money back when I file 2021 taxes? 

During my onboarding I was made to fill out a withholding form which I didn’t 100% understand. I filled as a single payer with 0 deductions as I don’t have any dependent. Also, how will my 2021 taxes be calculated since I’ve only worked and earned for like 32 days.

personalfinance,Some guidance with student loan and situation,"32m 65-70k gross annually. Great healthcare office job with benefits, work remote on some days, but location is about an hour+ drive total. 15% to my 403b and maxing out my Roth monthly. Since I’m new to my organization, employee match is only 1%. Followed little to no financial advice in my 20s and started seriously investing in retirement in my early 30s (30k in roth 10k in 403b). I have about 55k in student loans (40k consolidated in a mortgage loan by my parents/10k in federal). I have to pay 1.7k monthly for the mortgage loan. Got out of a bad relationship in June last year (cheap rent) and was kicked out. Now with the 1st gen parents, who drive me nuts. The savings are great, but I just can't deal with them anymore. I'm leaning heavily towards renting a place and I’m looking at 1br for a little over 2k monthly (NY/NJ area). Presently, I don’t think I’m ready to buy a house and to deal with the responsibilities as single person. I want to go heavy on the consolidated student loan. The pause on the 10k federal will be ending next month. Should I cut back on my 403b and roth short term (1-2 years) and go heavy (let's say 3k+ monthly) to pay off the student debt? I thought I'd be able to deal with the home situation, but I'm going crazy here. Any suggestions that could help steer me in a better direction would be appreciated. Thanks",finance
personalfinance,Advice on Student Loans and Investing/Retirement,"Long post incoming ahead!

Adding this in after writing the post: I'm 27 and late to entering the workforce (started last year). Will be making ~50k with small step increases and COLAs as time goes on.

So, I owe about $17k (Direct unsubsidized) and make 50k+. I'm single with no dependents. Looking at the estimates on the calculator, an ICR plan would give me a $134-145 monthly payment. Total paid $16,931 and $4k forgiven. I currently am on standard repayment @ about $250 a month. REPAYE would be $272-350 a month and pointless. No PAYE or IBR for me.

My goal is to invest any cash I can rather than throw it at loans. Would taking the ICR plan and applying for PSLF be the way to go for me? I have about a year of service for a federal employer, but need to start up the application/certification process still.

My actions would be: apply for ICR now (with payments starting after forbearance ends). Once that switches over, begin the PSLF certification process and renew yearly. That sound good?

I had $10k for nuking loans but decided to make that my e-fund and threw it into i-bonds last week. I live with my parents (paying $400/month in rent). No e-fund and minimal cash savings at this very moment. Planning to move out next fall.

For the investing side, I have my TSP, Roth IRA, and taxable brokerage. Also, I'll have my FERS pension in retirement. The TSP is currently getting 10% Roth contributions and 100% invested in the C-fund. I only got TSP access this August so the balance isn't much, like $2.4k or something. I'll start doing some Traditional contributions as I break into the 22% bracket over the years.

Roth IRA has $6.2k and will be maxed yearly in SWTSX (Schwab total market). I plan to use this for a house down payment in 5-10 years.

Taxable brokerage is worth $23k-ish and has a hodgepodge of crap when I started ""learning"" to invest in March 2020. It's mostly VTI. I'm planning liquidate the non-VTI stocks/ETFs (about $5-6k) next March once they're long-term cap gains to help fund the Roth IRA and save for moving out.

personalfinance,Investments for my infant child,"My daughter gets about $2,000 in cash each year for Christmas. My wife and I would like to set this aside for her to use later in life (perhaps after she has moved out and needs money for first apartment/home expenses, etc). I looked at the Wiki, but most advice is tailored to teenagers and older.

I’d like to do something that’s inflation proof and wouldn’t impact my wife and I financially (we don’t owe taxes on earnings). Ideally, stock investments would be good, however, savings bonds are also tempting.

Our biggest goal would be just ensuring that the money isn’t devalued simply sitting in a savings account earning a pittance of interest. I think savings bonds meet this mark, but the interest is taxable if not used for college expenses. Obviously I have no idea what my daughter’s life goals will look like, but I don’t want to throw it into a 529 and have it get a federal penalty for non-education uses. (We do have a 529 we have already started for her, so it’s not as if she won’t have some money already set aside by us for this purpose.)

Does anyone have any recommendations? Would savings bonds be the ideal ‘investment’ in this scenario?

personalfinance,Low % Debt Payoff vs. Emergency Fund,"Hello everyone, I’m on mobile so I apologize for poor formatting. 

I currently have multiple ‘low’ interest debts to pay off and make a decent salary. I’ll list them below, but I wanted to ask, would y’all have an e-fund first or pay down the debts? I’m extremely debt adverse and now realize that after many poor financial decisions that increased my stress. I’ve paid off $67k this year by selling financed ‘things’ and paying down what I could. 

Emergency Fund Needed (3 months): $12,000

Debts:

•Chase (0%) - $3,800 ($100 minimum)

•Personal Loan (9%) - $18,790 ($340 minimum)

•Private Student Loan (4.65%) - $19,565 ($135 minimum)

•Federal Student Loan (4-6% as I have numerous loans under PSLF) - $22,474 ($25 minimum)

•Credit Union Auto Loan (2.99%) - $40,284 ($560 minimum)

•Mortgage (3.625%) - $216,662 ($1,473 minimum)

All-in-all, my minimums are ~$2,633 per month. All of my bills being paid leaves me with just over $1,900/month. I currently have $6k in savings and will be receiving some additional funds totaling me up to ~$19k by March 2022. My question is which should I do; pay down debt and keep a $1k E-fund, max the E-fund and then redirect everything else to debt repayment (3-6 months away) or split the left over funds to $900 bills, $1,000 E-fund? 

Again, I’m debt adverse, but also worried about emergencies at home since it’s an older home, though with good bones and recently renovated via my funds. I’m leaning towards splitting it $900/$1,000 until the additional funds hit, then drawing out enough to leave $12k in savings and using the remaining $7k to hit debt off the bat - again, about 3 months away. 

Thanks for any advice and such. Just let me know what y’all recommend and what y’all have done, if you were ever in the situation that I am in.",finance
personalfinance,How much house can I afford? And am I currently over-saving for retirement?,"Here's my situation: I'm 25, salary is $90K with 15% bonus, working remotely in a fairly MCOL suburb just outside a major city. Non-retirement savings are $65K. I just start contributing to and maxing my 401K and IRA this year  (plus back-maxing my IRA for 2020); those accounts sit at $35K. So take home after taxes and retirement is roughly $3,850.  
  
Only debt is $30K in federal student loans, which I had been planning to pay off once interest/payments kick back in. I live at home, with no car payment/insurance; the only ""bills"" I have are whatever monthly costs I have for going out, drinks, ordering food, hobbies, clothes, etc. Maybe around $500 a month, some months more some less. So I'd say on my *worst* months that leaves me with $3K per month after maxing retirement accounts and living life.  
  
I guess I'm trying to figure out if/how much home I can afford? I'd like to move out within the next year or so into the city but can push it off if needed. I'd like to pay off my student loans so they're over with and I don't have to deal with them anymore, but I could use that money for a down payment also. I'm also not sure if I should dial back my retirement contributions as I'm saving about 28% of my net salary right now.",finance

I wanted your thoughts on large banks/financials for the next 6-12 months+

I know financials have already moved up, but it feels like there is some more room to run until the Fed actually moves up rates and finishes taper. 

When rates moved up from 2004-2006 and 2016-2017, large banks did well. But stock markets were also strong, so it is hard to tell. 

I am not looking at smaller banks or regionals for this, trying to focus on larger banks such as BAC, JPM, C, WFC. 

Logically banks have more money to make on loans if rates are higher, but I assume their volume will be lower in terms of lending, especially if housing market slows down

Just want some thoughts or any good data if possible

CryptoCurrency,How to make money off shit coins,"The misconception with shitcoins is that you need the shitcoin to go to a dollar or that the price even matters at all. None of that matters. The only thing that matters is market cap.  It doesn't matter if a coin has 1 quadrillion or 100 supply. What matters is the market cap. If the 100 supply coin has a market cap of 100 billion, how difficult do you think it is to get to 200 billion? Pretty damn difficult just to double your money. Now, the 1 quadrillion supply token has a market cap of 50k, getting to 100k isn't that hard. A cough could push it over. A million market cap will happen just from organic growth over time. As long as you do 10-30 minutes of research on your shitcoin, you'll be fine.

Most shitcoins that tick these boxes will make you money as long as you remember to pull out:

-Verified devs: Don't have to be doxxed but they need to be visible along with their socials

-Whitepaper: Proves they put some effort in the shitcoin.

-Website and all the socials: Proves they put some effort in shitcoin

-Audits: Audits cost money which is an indicator the devs aren't there to honeypot or rugit

-MarketCap under 500k: Easy to flip, biggest returns

-New listing (1-2 days old): Catch that wave of hype

The biggest pump will come within 48 hours and then, usually, you'll see 1-2 months of downward movement before they shoot past 5 million, before trending downward again. Some rare shitcoins will surprise you and shoot past 100 million.

This is because the first few days sees the most hype and excitement. Everyone is looking for the newest thing. As it pumps the movers &amp; shakers take profit and move on leaving a group of bagholders who believe in the project.

The next big pump comes when things actually start happening for the project such as:

-Exchange listings (Hotbit, WhiteBIT, BitUp, Bitmart, ETC)

-Utilities unveiled(Usually something to do with NFTs or swaps)

-Marketing budgets are pretty fat from taxes

-Definitely not a rug or honeypot

-Devs are a little seasoned by now

Almost every shitcoin I bought in April-June are now 3 million to 400 million. All of them I bought around 50k-500k. But! If you hold, and holding is fine, you will see a loss of 50-90% for months between the pumps. If you're not financially secure you will not survive this. You'll invest $500, it'll drop to $250, you'll move it to this new coin that's been out for 3 weeks that everyone is talking about, lose 20-40% just in taxes from selling and buying, then that coin will drop 50-90%. This is just the token’s own tax and not your federal taxes. You will lose every single time you change lanes. Pick a lane and stay in it.

You either buy within the first few hours of launch and then sell when you get your 10x, or you buy and hold. If you hold, always take your initial investment but no more. Why? Because you're in this for life changing money not bill money. You're trying to build a nest egg of hundreds of ""what ifs?"". Any one of these could 100x. As long as you keep taking your initial investment out when it 10x you'll be fine.

Edit: Some people are confused by the taxes. Exchanges don’t allow for tokenomics in most situations but decentralized exchanges do and that’s where all tokens are born. Tokenomics is how a token actually makes money to grow. Example: you want buy Shitcoin. f you buy $100 of Shitcoin you will be taxed 10%. That 10% is broken down into 5% reflected rewards, 3% liquidity and 2% marketing. 5% goes to the devs and 5% goes back to holders. So you end up with $90 of Shitcoin. Now, if you decide to sell, you’ll also be taxed 10%. Now you’re the proud owner of $81.

Slowly but surely this can make you allot of money.

CryptoCurrency,Decentralized currency is a better term for Crypto Currency,"Explaining  crypto to a lot of my family I always get negative feedback like its used for drugs, illegal gambling and so on. So naturally its really hard to explain it to anyone who has anecdotal negative bias against it which is typically fed by media.

Calling it decentralized currency (which it actually is) has gotten me way further in trying to explain it to new people. 

Actually Decentralized currency is a better name, since ""Crypto"" is only a way on how the goal of decentralization is achieved. ""Cryptography"" is not the use case of Crypto,  just the means to achieve it.  

This would be like calling an airplane - a jety machine, or a boat - a floatie device.

CryptoCurrency,LPT: It's healthy to look at things from a different perspective,"I - like many of you - am heavily invested in the crypto market. I've gone through all sorts of crypto phases - from skepticism to curiosity to FOMO. My whole crypto journey has led me to look at the market from a macro perspective. Since then, I've been looking at how likely it is that the crypto market is a bubble waiting to burst. I'd like to share a snippet of that journey with you.

I base my belief on the following indicators that usually cause an asset bubble:

* **Interest rates might be low**, which tends to encourage borrowing for spending, expansion, and investment. ✔
* **New products or technologies** spur demand and, whenever something's in demand, its price naturally rises (what the economists dub demand-pull inflation).  ✔
* **Herd mentality**: doing something because everyone else is. ✔
* **Short-term thinking**: just looking at the immediate returns, or thinking you can ""beat the market"" and time a quick exit. ✔
* **Cognitive dissonance**: only accepting information that confirms an already-held belief, and ignoring anything that doesn't. ✔

Another way of describing a speculative bubble: 

&gt;""A situation in which news of price increases spurs investor enthusiasm, which spreads by psychological contagion from person to person, in the process amplifying stories that might justify the price increases, and bringing in a larger and larger class of investors who, despite doubts about the real value of an investment, are drawn to it partly by envy of others' successes and partly through a gamblers' excitement."" - Robert Shiller

All the facts that point to an asset bubble apply to the crypto market. But to find out how dangerous and scary it really is, we would need to know how much leverage is involved in cryptocurrencies. After all, the more credit involved, the more damaging the bursting of the bubble.

[ BTC: All Exchanges Estimated Leverage Ratio ](https://preview.redd.it/myfozacp5p781.png?width=576&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18d36846cc6bf8faf904ca1305737680e9c910b0)

A look at this chart shows that the leverage ratio has reached an all-time high of 0.21. The leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of open interest divided by the reserves of an exchange. So, for example, a ratio of 0.21 would be if the open interest was 2 and the reserve of all exchanges was 10. I believe that the fact that the market is over-leveraged only exacerbates the risk of an asset bubble.

So what are the implications of this for me? While I believe cryptocurrencies are an important part of our future, I think only 3-4 coins will survive the crash that will eventually come. Therefore, I am currently rethinking my investment strategy and shifting my funds from various altcoins mainly to Ethereum since I believe ETH is one of the coins that will survive. 

I wanted to share these thinking steps with r/CryptoCurrency because I think it's healthy to look at things from a different perspective instead of creating a huge circle jerk. Especially when a lot of people are investing their hard earned money. I hope this post serves to do just that. Providing a different perspective.",cryptocurrency

I have a master's degree in teaching and 48k in federal loans. I'm about 3 years away from Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). I'm in income based repayment.

I don't have a budget but am naturally good at saving so I have 25k in the bank right now.

We're considering new kitchen appliances when they go on sale for the new year. The house could also use rewiring as it has some old knob and tube wiring.

Here's where I need advice. I hate my job and have applied to graduate school for ecology. My goal is to work for Fish &amp; Wildlife, DEQ, EPA, etc. doing water quality or invasive species work. I could also do nonprofit or environmental consulting with the degree. The first two options would still qualify for PSLF, but consulting would not. All the programs I applied to would be funded.

2. Do we need to update wiring before selling?

3. If the house sells for a large profit, what do we do with the money while we rent?

4. Is this career change a ridiculous idea? Should I stay in public school teaching and just do a mediocre job for 30 more years until retirement? Should I stick it out for 3 more years for loan forgiveness and then change careers at 37 years old?

5. What do I do with my loans during grad school? Keep paying on income based repayment or defer payment until graduation?

6. Best plan for my 25k in savings?

personalfinance,"24y/o, ~$50k federal student loans and received $10k from mom last week","Some background: the title is in reference to my gf. We are both 24 and recently moved to a MCOL area after she finished up grad school. Her income will increase next year as a result (~$80k take home) but she will be taxed as a W2 and 1099 for a while in 2022 as she builds her client base. We are currently renting but hope to buy within the next 2 years when (if) the market slows. We will likely get married in that time frame as well. No plans for kids in the near future. No other debt besides the student loans.

Given this, she plans to put all of the $10k towards the loan debt. What is the best way to go about this to maximize the money?

Should she invest it and pay the loans over time from the invested money and try to get more from the $10k over time? Or should she pay $10k towards the highest interest loan(s) in a chunk?

Her mom has a trustworthy financial advisor/broker that my gf plans on speaking with. I am also wondering if she should invest it herself to avoid the fees from the advisor, since the investments would likely be very safe plays.

We are not used to dealing with larger sums of money, but my time lurking led me to the two options I mentioned. Is there anything we are not considering? Very open to constructive criticism.

stocks,Help me analyze HD fundamentals,"I'm trying to understand company fundamentals a little better and was digging into HD at finviz.

I have a 5% position that I got into at cost basis $276 and I'm up 43% so far.

Someone said they're overvalued and may correct.  Especially as the Fed tightens next year?

Does that mean I should sell out of my position or just hold?

Here are some fundamentals I'm wondering about.

So according to finviz:  Home Depot is:

PE is 26.55
Ps is 2.89
Peg is 1.94

The ones in RED on finviz were:

PB 401.08!!  Yikes that can't be good right?!

P/FCF 81.56

Debt/eq 37.82

Are the eps ok?

EPS next year 4.76%   where does that stand?

EPS next 5 year. 13.70%


How do they know what EPS will be in the future?

Are those just estimates by analysts or something?

stocks,Do you sell out of positions every time a stock becomes overvalued or do you just hold?,"I have 5% positions in a lot of stocks I plan to hold for 10 to 20 years in names like UNH HD MSFT ASML GOOGL etc. Blue chips I call them.

I thought more or less we are taught to just hold and ""ride the waves"" up and down and add when things go lower (on sale maybe) and more or less never sell on good companies.

So I assume that the consensus is not to sell a position every time one of your stocks becomes ""overvalued""?

I mean id probably have to sell all my stocks if that were the case lol!

I mean I already have 20% cash for when some positions sell down if fed taper causes 20% or more correction next year or whatever.

I thought that the consensus was more ""time in the market instead of timing the market""?

For example I could say I'm selling all my long shares of MSFT cause I think they're overvalued and think they'll fall next year and then I sell and they continue up another 10%.

Isn't it better to instead to just hold my MSFT (for example) rather than sell and hope it goes cheaper to buy in lower?

Then if the market does tumble 40% next year buy more MSFT at a possible 40% discount?

Should I be jumping in and out of my positions every time a stock becomes ""overvalued"" or do you just have to use your own judgement?

vet,"Advice needed, epileptic labrador mix.","So I'm looking for some advice/reassurance around an issue I'm having with my dog. Below I'll give a quick outline of him.

Male

Labrador mix Staffy

Approx 4 years old

No previous medical conditions (before 2 months ago)

Fear based aggression.

I rehomed him approx 2 years ago after he had been through 3 different owners. The original owner stated ""someone showed up at my door with a puppy and said do you want it for free"" 
He's clearly had a rough first few years due to scars and general behaviour. 

So my dog started having partial facial seizures about 2 months ago he was taken to see the vets and put on epiphen 60mb twice a day. He's started having breakthrough seizures in the past 48hours and it's spiked my anxiety a fair bit. 

Onto said problem. I'm a UK resident and my finances are worse than f***ed. I cannot afford the blood tests + sedation to confirm epilepsy and keep an eye on medication levels in his system. I'm just able to keep up with actually paying for the epiphen. 

He has a tendency to become aggressive after a fit due to being confused. I don't want to rehome him but I can't financially afford the treatment he needs. I have spoken to all the rescues in my area and have hit brick wall after brick wall. 

I've spoken to the charities about rehoming him but haven't gotten nowhere. 

The Rspca have issued a £100 voucher and are unwilling to issue anything else. 

I'm pretty confused as to what my next steps are going to be. I have no family/friends I would be willing to trust to provide the care he needs and am really dubious about private rehoming.",cryptocurrency

Conventional wisdom says this advantage will be gone once the fed raises rates. While this might be true, is it possible that the **reversal is not going to be as strong** as analysts believe due to behavior of new-to-market retail investors, who are:

* More likely to stick to ""story stocks"" -- and look beyond earnings, dividends, or PE ratios.

* Less interested in ""boring"" investments like bonds. 

* Less likely to put their money into buying a house, as the housing market is out of reach for many people in their 30s and 40s.

* Increasingly tribal and seems to identify their ownership of stocks like being a superfan of a sports team.

* Looking at ownership of certain meme stocks as a political or anti-establishment statement.

* More likely to believe the ARK narrative that in the long term tech is deflationary, and more likely to hold and ""buy the dip"".

personalfinance,Pay off mortgage (on a rental) or invest?,"This sub has kicked me into high gear in trying to understand and improve my finances. It's something I've been putting off and, regretfully, I dislike myself for it very much.

Here's my dilemma, one of many, but I'm prioritizing...

In 2008 during the real estate market crash, I bought a condo for $48,250. Lived in it for about 7 years and moved on to buying a house, starting a family, etc. That was about 5 years ago. Ever since then I've been renting it to the same renter (and not raising the price).

My mortgage is $253 (principal + interest). Yes, it's that low.

My association fee is currently $222/mo., property tax is about $170/mo. All that is $645 while the rent is $1100. So I net $455/month, when there's no issues to take care of.

Now,  **I still owe roughly $21000 on it and my interest rate is a whopping 6.875%! I still have about 17 years to go before it's paid off at the current rate.**

**Do I pay this off or invest instead?** 

My wife and I have about $100,000 to invest (of the total \~$200,000 in cash that we're trying to grow cajones and invest, more on that later...).

With such a high interest rate, does it make sense to invest $100k or pay off the $21k first and invest the $79k only?

Some online calculators told me to ""keep the loan"" but I've learned so much already from the folks in this subreddit that I just must ask here.

**Update (TLDR;) :** a few Redditors already responded with great input, so I feel like I owe a little more information for better context:

**INCOME:**

Myself: 

* $100,000/year (38) + 15% bonus + a variable amount of company stock (somewhere $3-5K/year). I'm very underpaid for my position, I recently found out...
* A sporadic income from a very small business I am a partner in. This year it will give me about $24,000. This is not common, usually we're talking 5-10k per year at best.
* Rental property (aforementioned condo) - $1100/month, $455/month net income.

Wife:

* $40,000/year (39) + commission. Her commission varies insanely, however, for the past 5 years her salary never totaled more than \~ $70K. In 2015, she had the best year, about $100K in commission only (NET) which is how and why we upgraded our living situation and inflated our lifestyle (blah). 
* Important note: for the past 3 years, her commission and salary were minimal due to several factors (2018 had a baby, took some time off; 2019 got diagnosed with aggresive form of breast cancer, took a year off for treatment and recovery - extremely lucky and grateful; 2020 - well, covid; 2021 - ramping up but still no cigar).

**SAVINGS:**

\- CASH \~$200,000 sitting in normal savings accounts. If you read the paragraph above, having cash helped us feel much more secure when wife has fallen ill. Fortunately, we were mostly financialy unscathed with the exception that she wasn't making as much as she normally does. But, very fortunate we had no crazy bills.

\- 401k:

* $288K in mine (current savings rate of 15%)
* $129K in wife's (current savings rate of 10%)

\- 529 (MESP, we're in SE Michigan)

* $17,000 at the moment. Our daughter is 3.5 years old. Planning for in-state college (but who knows...).

**WHAT ABOUT OUR GOALS?**

Ah, where to start. 

1. **Save enough in 529 to provide our daughter** at least tuition to a 4-year in-state school. Fifteen years to go. I'm currently contributing $200/month to that, not nearly enough if college prices keep rising the way they do.  
**How to get there:** throw the $24K from my side-business into this account in addition to current contribution to ensure goal #1 is met.
2. **Retire by 58 (in 20 years)**, if we're still alive. Given the illness history with my wife, who knows what tomorrow will bring. Yes, nobody ever knows, but once you've been scarred deeply, it's a very real fear.  
**How to get there:** 

* max out my own 401k starting with next month. She won't be able to do hers since her income is still on the lower end.
* invest $100,000 of our saved up cash into VTI, VOO, or a combination of some ETF, REIT, individual stock.
* hope social security doesn't get super diminished by the time we need it.

CryptoCurrency,Erdogan says Turkish crypto law is ready,"During a meeting with economists and business leaders, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said a bill is ready to better regulate cryptocurrencies.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ready for Parliament**

[ABC Gazetesi writes](https://abcgazetesi.com/erdogan-kripto-para-yasasi-hazir-yakinda-gecikmeden-meclise-gonderecegiz-412268) that according to Erdogan, the crypto law will be sent to the Turkish parliament unchanged.

&amp;#x200B;

In July, former Deputy Finance Minister Sakir Ercan Gul, who was fired by the president earlier this month, told local media that Turkish regulations would resemble the frameworks implemented in the U.S. and Western European countries.

The cryptocurrency law will define different types of digital assets and introduce measures to better protect investors.

&amp;#x200B;

**Not fond of crypto**

Turkey has had a tumultuous year, and that's just talking about cryptocurrency and not even the volatile lira. Turkey's central bank shared a decree in April banning the use of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment.

In September, Erdogan said Turkey was at war with crypto. For a moment, it seemed that the bitcoin price fell because of these words, but turned out to be nothing more than a storm in a glass of water. These words were then mocked by the crypto community as the Turkish lira collapsed like a pudding.

&amp;#x200B;

**Turkish Lira more volatile than crypto**

The troubled, Turkish fiat currency collapsed to record lows against the U.S. dollar and the euro on December 20, losing more than 60% of its value since the beginning of that day.

Erdogan strongly believes that inflation should not be fought with higher interest rates. In the same week, the president shared a scheme in which the Treasury and the central bank would reimburse losses on converted lira deposits against foreign currencies, sparking the largest intraday rally ever.

&amp;#x200B;

**Off from the dollar**

The Turkish currency rose more than 20% that day. Unheard of (except in crypto of course). The plan was to be less dependent on the dollar, and the Turks put their money where their mouth is by converting $900 million worth of USD into lira, according to Finance Minister Nureddin Nebati.

The lira received a big boost from what traders and economists called backdoor dollar sales by state-owned banks, backed by the central bank.

Sentiment slowly turning positive as business activity improves and financial conditions ease (equity, debt markets)

Commodity prices normalizing after working through post-war adjustments (commodity markets)

The US dollar has emerged from World War I as a reserve currency, alongside the pound sterling (currency markets)

**Executive Summary:**

* Nothing material impacts the broad equity markets this week, but the overall tone is firm and cheerful. Optimism has started rearing its head more often in the FT and WSJ. The Dow ends the year +11% after surviving the worst deflationary recession in living memory.
* On Tuesday, the WSJ lays out a fantastic front page article discussing how Henry Ford dazzles audiences and shapes public opinion through a barrage of media appearances. He is not just a great businessman, but also a tastemaker. Ford owns the largest car company and largest Hollywood film studio, and wields both to brilliantly influence society.
* Historical Fact: Henry Ford and Elon Musk, while separated 100 years apart, personify the celebrity-businessman. There’s one thing, however, that Musk and Ford would disagree on: Tesla and SpaceX spend zero on marketing. Who knows what Ford would have done with Twitter!?
* Wall Street attention is now turning to the forthcoming Five-Power Economic Conference (US, UK, Japan, France, Italy) which is expected to take up exchange rate, debt funding, reparations, and other kindred problems. Significant uncertainty regarding the value of German assets hangs over markets; German debt, on average, lost 60% of face value, while the mark dropped 80% against the dollar during 1921.
* Wednesday’s FT headlines an article titled “Russians Revive,” which details Lenin’s plan to return confiscated property under his New Economic Policy. This “free market with state control” mandate revives dormant shares on the London Stock Exchange. In chaotic trading, speculators bought anything from Russo-Asiatic stock to Trans-Siberian Railway bonds. Other lesser known companies followed in sympathy, all surging 15-25%.
* Historical Fact: If this sounds funky, just wait 7 more years. In 1928, Stalin scraps Lenin’s NEP and dives head first into pure communism (known as the Great Break). Several of Stalin’s policies will remain until 1991 when the USSR dissolves.

personalfinance,Receptionist at physician’s office refused to process new insurance information.,"Hi all. Hopefully someone can help to clarify my options in this situation.

I’ve had the same primary physician for 2+ years, during which time I had BCBS for federal employees, which I now realize was great coverage. A few months ago, I left federal service for the private sector, and now have a Cigna HSA high deductible plan, which covers only the most basic preventive treatments.

I have to have lab work done every three months for a prescription medication I’m on, and with my old insurance I was only responsible for a small fee (&lt;$100) and a $10 copay. However, the last time I went in, I had my new insurance. I informed the office of this over the phone when I scheduled my labwork, and they said it would be no problem, although they are not a Cigna preferred provider, so I would likely have to file a claim for the cost of the lab work.

When I checked in for my appointment, the receptionist did not confirm whether my insurance had changed. Then, after the appointment, I informed her of my new insurance coverage and provided her with my new insurance card. She responded with something like “I’m going to pretend like i didn’t see that, because I’m trying to go to lunch and don’t want to deal with all that. Just pay your old $10 copay and you can be on your way. I’ll add your new insurance next time.”

This seemed very odd to me, but I paid the $10 and left, planning to call the office later to explain the situation. Instead, just a couple hours later, a more senior receptionist called me and said because they are not in Cigna’s network, I would be responsible for the entire cost of the lab work done. He warned me that it would be several hundred dollars but that in situations like this, the physicians will normally try to lower the patient’s final bill as much as they can, and they will contact me before a bill is issued.

Fast forward to last week: I receive a bill for over $700 for the labwork. Never received any further communication from anyone in the office. 

My question is: what leverage do I have to try and negotiate a lower bill? To me, the receptionist’s refusal to process my new insurance and collection of my previous $10 copay seems like a violation of some sort, but I’m not knowledgeable enough about medical providers’ responsibilities with regard to health insurance to be sure. I just want to be as well-informed as possible when I call the office to try and negotiate a lower price somehow.

TLDR; Receptionist at physician’s office refused to process my new insurance and charged me a copay for my old insurance, which was later discovered by the office after I had had labwork done. Physician is not in my current insurer’s network, and I am being saddled with a $700+ bill. Do I have any recourse, or leverage to negotiate a lower price? The whole situation seems sketchy, and  maybe even a violation of laws related to healthcare / insurance.

I didn't expect to get a job this high paying until I finished grad school (Engineering Management). It is a (W2) contract for hire position though so it isn't a permanent position perse, however they predict the contract will be at least for a year and has a high likelihood of conversion. Even if it doesn't work out, I feel confident I could at least land a job in the 80k range given the unicorn salary this job has if I had to find a job as soon as possible if it ends rather than getting converted. Anyways, I am 26 years old, have 26k in undergrad debt (deferred) and I am in grad school. I just started grad school and I am predicting it will be about 45k if I get loans for the whole thing. Currently have 4k of credit card debt that will be getting wiped out the first month at this new job, and then next month's income will essentially cover a 3 month emergency fund at minimum as far as my current cost of living goes (1300 rent + utilities, 100$ internet, 175$ car insurance, $300ish for food, all in all about 2k worth of expenses)

Anyways, am I actually able to buy a house now? I am living and going to school in Boulder CO, about a 45ish minute drive from the office and I love living here. The new job is hybrid so I can work from home some of the time at least. I really want to buy a place in Boulder but as you may know, the housing market here (and in CO in general) is absolutely insane. I am single, so having a house with more space just to have more space seems like a waste when a condo or townhome is much more fitting for me. I don't have anything saved up for a downpayment but I know interest rates will be going up soon so I feel like if I were to buy a house now would be the time regardless of how inflated housing prices are. Boulder (in my opinion) will only ever go up in property value as there are lots of tech companies here with offices as well as it being a college town. I would much rather live alone, but I am not totally opposed to roommates. If anything, I would consider a roommate perhaps half the year on a month to month basis and would be very picky on who it would be. I know a roommate if I were to BUY would be the ideal scenario, but I see it more as a nice boon some of the time rather than a necessity. 

That's basically it, should I even consider BUYING a house or condo at this point? I have seen 2/3 bed condos and townhouses out here between 400-500k which is about what my pricing range would be given these mortgage calculators I have been using. I don't know if its logical, but I fucking hate the feeling of renting the place I live and my money essentially doing nothing for me. Ideally I would want to live in Boulder forever and I would definitely consider renting out my first place for students if I manage to pay the mortgage early, but I really don't know which direction would be the most beneficial for me at this point.",finance
stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning December 27th, 2021","Good Sunday afternoon to all of you here on r/stocks! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 27th, 2021.

# **It looks like Santa Claus is on his way to stock investors in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/23/santa-claus-may-be-on-his-way-to-stock-investors-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; After a period of turbulence, the decks may be cleared for a good old-fashioned Santa Claus rally in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Stocks were higher in the past week, after a rough stretch that continued into Monday. The S&amp;P 500 recovered and is up about 3.5% for December as of Thursday.
*****
&gt; “I think all the things we’ve been concerned about for the month of December to a certain extent, are in the rearview mirror,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “We know what the [Federal Reserve] is going to do. We know while this new variant spreads faster, it’s not as dangerous, and we know Build Back Better legislation is now 2022′s business... I think the market can find a path of least resistance to the upside as we wrap things up.”
*****
&gt; The market has a lot of history on its side that trading days before the year-end are positive for stocks. According to the “Stock Trader’s Almanac,” the Santa Claus rally period — the final five trading days of the current year and first two of the new year — is mostly a time when the stock market gains. The S&amp;P 500 has been positive nearly 79% of the time on those days since 1928 and has gained an average of about 1.7% per rally.
*****
&gt; Add to that the fact that when the market has had a strong year, the momentum historically has carried into the final trading sessions. In that regard, the S&amp;P 500 is up about 25% for the year.
*****
&gt; According to Bank of America, when the S&amp;P 500 has already seen such solid gains, the final six sessions are positive. Since 1980, there have been 10 instances where the S&amp;P 500 was up 20% or more going into the last stretch of trading and in nine of those years, it ended the final six days higher.
*****
&gt; # A notably rocky December
&gt; Stocks head into the final sessions of the year with a tailwind, after several weeks of choppiness.
*****
&gt; “This has been the fourth rockiest December since 1987. The average daily move for the S&amp;P 500 has been 1.1%,” said Hogan. “That’s a lot of action.” The most volatile Decembers were in 2000, 2008 and 2018.
*****
&gt; Hogan said volume in the last week of the year is typically 20% to 30% lower than normal. “In a low-volume environment, when the market picks a direction, it tends to move in that direction in a robust fashion,” he said.
*****
&gt; Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, said positive news on the Covid omicron variant this week was the catalyst that reversed the market’s sell-off. There were studies showing omicron to be milder than other variants of the coronavirus. Further, the Food and Drug Administration approved pills from Pfizer and Merck for the treatment of Covid-19.
*****
&gt; “Whereas the market was focusing on everything that could go wrong since Thanksgiving, people are now just taking a sunnier view,” Hickey said. He expects that view will likely prevail in the coming week.
*****
&gt; “As we get toward the beginning of January, we’ll see how markets are positioning themselves,” Hickey said. He said investors will start to turn their attention toward the upcoming earnings season; they do not seem to be overly optimistic, which could spell some upside surprises.
*****
&gt; “Going into the last earnings season, there was a ton of negative sentiment based on supply chains, inflation and labor shortages. We ended up having a decent earnings season. It’s more mixed this time,” Hickey said.
*****
&gt; # High-growth stocks hit
&gt; The selling in November and December dented stocks. Some high-growth stocks and ETFs were down sharply as investors moved into safety plays. Funds that took their lumps in December include the Ark Innovation ETF and iShares Expanded Tech Software Sector ETF.
*****
&gt; “I think some of these growth areas that have gotten hit hard will do a little better. They could see a bounce early in the year,” Hickey said. “They sold off for a number of reasons. One was concerns over the Fed. Also people had made so much money, and the feeling was taxes are going up. People were selling stocks ahead of higher taxes. That’s more of a question now with a divided Congress.”
*****
&gt; In the past week, the fate of President Joe Biden’s Build Back Better stimulus legislation was put in doubt when West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin said he would not support it. Analysts expect to see further versions of the spending plan.
*****
&gt; Bespoke’s Hickey said January could be positive for stocks, and with opportunities for some stocks to bounce if stung by tax-loss selling. “The January effect is a positive. All those tax-loss sellers that compressed multiples are buyers,” he said.
*****
&gt; One of the stocks he’s watching is Boeing. “It’s one of the few big cap stocks that was down a lot. I think you can see that,” he said. The airplane maker has gained more than 6% in the past week, but it’s still down 16% over the past six months.
*****
&gt; # Rate hikes and housing data
With the Fed forecasting three interest rate hikes for next year, economic data of all sorts is front and center for the markets.
*****
&gt; The housing market has been a huge beneficiary of the near-zero rate policy, so all data on housing will be closely watched. On Tuesday, home prices data will be released. Pending home sales are to be reported Wednesday.
*****
&gt; David Petrosinelli, senior trader at InspereX, said the next big data point for the market will be December jobs in early January. He expects markets to be relatively quiet next week.
*****
&gt; “Next week is generally a snoozer, the week before New Year’s,” he said. “All the action’s going to come in the first week in January.”

&gt; # Do You Believe In The Santa Claus Rally?

&gt; “If Santa should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.” —Yale Hirsh

&gt; December is widely known as one of the best months of the year for stocks, but most don’t realize that the majority of the gains happen in the second half of the month.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/chart-12.22.21.jpg?ssl=1))**

&gt; Equity strength at this time of the year is widely known as the Santa Claus Rally, but the term is somewhat misunderstood. Discovered in 1972 by Yale Hirsch, creator of the Stock Trader’s Almanac (carried on now by his son Jeff Hirsch), the real Santa Claus Rally is the final five trading days of the year and first two trading days of the following year, not just December. In other words, the official Santa Claus Rally is set to begin Monday, December 27. Fun trivia this is the latest any Santa Claus Rally can start and latest it has started in 11 years.

&gt; So how likely are these seven trading days to be higher? Well, there isn’t a single seven-day combo out of the full year that is more likely to be higher than the 78.9% of the time higher we’ve seen previously during the Santa Claus Rally. Additionally, these seven days are up an average of 1.33%, which is the third-best seven-day combo of the year. Do you believe yet?

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-12.22.21-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Taking a bigger picture view, here is the win rate of any single day. We are in the middle of an incredible 11 day streak with each day having a greater than 50% chance of being higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Blog-12.22.21-3.jpg?ssl=1))**

&gt; “Why are these seven days so strong?” asked LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Whether optimism over a coming new year, holiday spending, traders on vacation, institutions squaring up their books—or the holiday spirit—the bottom line is that bulls tend to believe in Santa.”

&gt; The LPL Chart of the Day illustrates how the Santa Claus Rally has performed since 2000. Usually these seven days are higher, which leads to strength in January and beyond. But what stands out to us is that the times Santa didn’t come, January was lower each time. Now do you believe?

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/chart-12.22.21-4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Let’s take a closer look at what happens when things don’t go according to plan. Remember, Yale Hirsch told us, “If Santa should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.” This is because the New York Stock Exchange is at the corner of Broad and Wall Streets.

&gt; Going back to the mid-1990s, there have been only six times Santa failed to show in December. January was lower five of those six times, and the full year had a solid gain only once (in 2016, but a mini-bear market early in the year). “Considering the bear markets of 2000 and 2008 both took place after one of the rare instances that Santa failed to show makes believers out of us. Should this seasonally strong period miss the mark, it could be a warning sign,” explained Santa Claus believer Detrick.

&gt; We wish everyone a great end to 2021 and happy holidays!

&gt; # NASDAQ &amp; Russell 2000 Most Bullish Day After Christmas

&gt; This year the day after Christmas is also the beginning of the Santa Claus Rally. The Santa Claus Rally was discovered and named by Yale Hirsch in 1972 and published in our 1973 Stock Trader’s Almanac as the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year. This short, sweet rally is usually good for about 1.3% on the S&amp;P 500, but the real significance of the SCR is as an indicator.

&gt; It is our first seasonal indicator of the year ahead. Years when there was no Santa Claus Rally tended to precede bear markets or times when stocks hit significantly lower prices later in the year. As Yale’s famous line states (2021 Almanac page 116 and 2022 Almanac page 118): “If Santa Claus Should Fail To Call, Bears May Come to Broad and Wall.”

&gt; Since 1988, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have enjoyed the greatest frequency of gains and average gain on the day after Christmas. NASDAQ has advanced 72.7% of the time with an average move of +0.39%. Small-caps have also advanced 72.7% of the time with an average advance of +0.39%. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have slightly softer records, but bullish nonetheless. Two days after Christmas, the market remains bullish however, the frequency and magnitude of gains does ease with NASDAQ bringing up the rear.

&gt; # S&amp;P 500 Performance Around Christmas

&gt; With Christmas just two days away and markets closed tomorrow, many investors are on the watch for a 'Santa Claus' rally. In all periods in the post-WWII era, the average S&amp;P 500 performance in the week leading up to Christmas is a gain of 0.5% with positive returns just over two-thirds of the time. The average performance in the week after Christmas is slightly higher at 0.7%, but the consistency of positive returns is the same. This year, the S&amp;P 500 has performed considerably better than its pre-Christmas average gaining 2.25% through midday Thursday. Since 1945, the S&amp;P 500 has traded up more than 1% in the week leading up to Christmas 23 times (30.3%), and in those prior 23 years, the average week after Christmas performance was actually a bit weaker than normal with an average gain of 0.3% and positive returns just over 60% of the time. That compares to an average gain of 0.7% in the same week for all years since 1945.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/Avg-perf-based-on-week-before-xmas-122021-3.png))**

&gt; The table below lists each year since 1945 that the S&amp;P 500 was up over 1% in the week leading up to Christmas along with how it performed in the final week of the year. Of those 23 prior years, there were actually 14 where the S&amp;P 500 rallied 2% or more in the week leading up to Christmas with the last occurrence seven years ago back in 2014. While those types of gains may have put investors in a good mood for the Christmas holiday, it didn't leave much powder left for the last week of the year as the median gain was just 0.05% with positive returns half of the time.

&gt; # Best and Worst Performers Since Thanksgiving

&gt; Although the Russell 1000 is now pretty much right back in line with its pre-Thanksgiving level, certain stocks have seen dramatic moves during that same span. Of the 25 stocks that have experienced the largest gains since 11/25, 19 were down on the year leading up to Thanksgiving, and the average stock had declined by 20.0%. Since then, those 25 stocks have gained an average of 13.1%, with Smartsheet (SMAR) and Chegg (CHGG) leading the group with gains of 22.2% and 20.4%, respectively.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/Best-perf-since-122221-2.png))**

&gt; Of the Russell 1000 members that have performed the worst since Thanksgiving, their average YTD performance leading up to Thanksgiving was a gain of 85.7% while the median performance was much less but still an impressive +25.6%. Of these 25 stocks, 18 were positive YTD through Thanksgiving, and the average decline since then is 23.6%. Everbridge (EVBG) and DocuSign (DOCU) topped this list with declines of 37.2% and 36.6% since Thanksgiving, respectively.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/Worst-perf-since-122221.png))**

&gt; Based on the data above, it appears as if there was some rotation in the Russell 1000 as investors shifted from leaders to laggards. Essentially, the worse a stock performed between the start of the year and Thanksgiving, the better it has performed since, at least for the top 25 movers to the upside. For the 25 stocks that have declined the most since Thanksgiving, there seems to be very little correlation between the size of the move to the upside before Thanksgiving and performance since then. In the charts below, GameStop (GME) Upstart (UPST) were omitted from the chart but included in the R squared calculation due to visual distortion.

&gt; # December Volatility Spike

&gt; December typically tends to be a month of lower stock market volatility following a period in late October and early November when volatility tends to peak. This year, however, has been quite different. As of yesterday's close, the one-month rolling average of one-day absolute moves for the S&amp;P 500 was 1.06%. (This means the S&amp;P 500 has been averaging a daily change of +/-1%+ over the last month.) As shown in the dark blue line below, this has actually been the most volatile one-month period for all of 2021. As the light blue line shows, daily volatility for the S&amp;P 500 is usually plummeting at this time of year as traders typically slow down dramatically around the holidays.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/rolling-vol-122121.png))**

&gt; Since the 5-day trading week was established back in September 1952, December has historically been the least volatile month of the year, averaging an absolute daily change of 0.61%. This year, the average daily change since the start of December has been 1.07%, which is far above the next closest level seen in March 2021 (+/-0.83%). October, the month that has historically been the most volatile month of the year, ranked 6th in 2021.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/Avg-daily-chg-by-month-122121.png))**

&gt; So what tends to occur when volatility inverses its seasonal trend in December? Since 1953, there have been five prior years where December was the most volatile month of the year: 1973, 1978, 1985, 1995, and 2018. Below we show how the S&amp;P 500 performed in January following the five prior years listed, and we also show the full next-year change. As shown, January was positive in four of five instances, and the one January that saw a decline was in 1974 when it fell only 1%. In the most recent occurrence, the 9.2% decline in December of 2018 was followed by a 7.9% move higher in January of 2019. In the following year, the median performance of the S&amp;P 500 was +14.6%.

&gt; # Bears Still Outnumber Bulls Despite Rally

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is currently at record highs, but recent sentiment readings are still relatively bearish. However, this isn't necessarily negative for markets, as it gives the opportunity for bears to shift their position, which would likely be accompanied by an increase in equity purchases. AAII's reading on bullish sentiment moved from 25.2% last week to 29.6% this week. This week's reading is still 6.7 percentage points below the average since 2009.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/AAII-bullish-122321.png))**

&gt; In turn, bearish sentiment dropped from 39.3% down to 33.9%, which is only 1.8 percentage points higher than the historical average level. This week's reading was also the second-largest week-over-week decline in bearish sentiment since September 9th.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/AAII-bearish-122321.png))**

&gt; Neutral sentiment ticked higher by 1.2 percentage points, resulting in 36.6% of respondents reporting a neutral view of the market. This is the lowest absolute change in a month and is 5.0 percentage points higher than the average level.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/12/AAII-neutral-122321.png))**

&gt; The NAAIM Exposure Index moved higher this week alongside bullish sentiment. The index ranges from +200 (levered long) to -200 (levered short) and this week the index moved from 52.2 to 67.0, essentially erasing last week's significant drop. That indicates reporting investment managers' exposure to US equities is roughly 67%.

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great final trading week of 2021 ahead r/stocks. :)",finance
personalfinance,Should I pay off my student loans?,"I'm 24 and graduated last year. I have about \~31k in student loans. After graduation, I moved back in with my parents because I worked from home. It didn't make sense to move out and rent a place just to stay in and work all day. lol. Because of that, I was able to aggressively save up to pay for my loans. Since the interest rates were 0% on my loans (all federal loans), I saved the money in my savings accounts instead of paying towards my loans.

Now that I have saved enough to pay it all with one fat check, should I?

My interest rate on the loans is about 4% --may be less; it's not crippling whatsoever. With that in mind, does it financially make sense to start making only the minimum payments and put that money to other use, such as investing. I've been maxing out my Roth for a while and already contribute to 401k as well. So, I'll mostly be putting that money in a taxable account. Or, maybe even a deposit for a house? I plan on staying with my parents for another year or so. I can keep adding to the 31k to save up for a modest house in a few years. This may be a tad bit ambitious but just a thought in my head.

What makes sense to you guys? I kinda just wanna pay the damn thing off. I don't have any other debt so I will truly be free after. But, if I dump that 30k into index funds and if it returns  6% on average over 10 yrs, I will come out ahead with \~2% a year, right?  Math is crude. Just some simple thoughts. Additionally, throughout 10 yrs, the inflation --if it stays bad --will also indirectly eat away some of my debt, right? With this approach, I'll be in debt longer than I want to; however, I'll also have a bunch of money compounding while I'm young.

I feel like my current thoughts are callow and vacuous. The payment pause was recently extended; it resumes in May. I have time to think about it thoroughly but I would really appreciate any ideas or suggestions. How should I determine what's financially sound?

And, what about the talk about loan forgiveness? I would beat myself if I wiped out my loan only for it to be forgiven later. 

Thank you and Happy New Year!! Also, Thanks to everyone who takes the time to answer all these finance questions here! I'm mostly a lurker here bc a lot more people here know way more than I do. lol",finance

personalfinance,"Savings bond, leave as is or move to CD","I apologize if this is a dumb question, I read the wiki on savings bonds but didn’t see this type of question answered.

For Christmas my parents gave us a stack of savings bonds that they have held onto since we were born. Some have matured, some still have 1-7 years remaining. 

We realized all of the bonds purchased after 1994 have really crappy interest rates (.4-.5%). These do not mature until 2024-2029

My question, my bank is currently offering CD rates at .6-.8% for 48-60 month terms or other online options like synchrony seem to offer 1% though I haven’t looked much into these.

Would it make sense to cash these low interest savings bonds and put them into a CD instead? Or hang onto them and see if CD rates go up significantly since it’s not a huge difference?

Bonds in question add up to about $1500. All have reached face value.",finance
solar,"Will NEM3 affect SGIP in CA (aka, real-world costs of adding storage to a solar system)?","From skimming the proposed resolution on NEM3, it looks like they're suggesting rebates toward the purchase of battery storage *for grandfathered NEM2 customers who elect to move to NEM3*. The big question that brings to mind is: **would the new NEM2-to-NEM3 rebate** ***replace*** **the rebate currently offered through SGIP**, or is it expected that it will be possible to get *three* rebates/credits (1 federal, 1 SGIP, and 1 for moving to NEM3)?

personalfinance,Need help selecting funds for 401k,"I need help selecting funds for my employers 401k.  I talked with the company's financial advisor last year and he suggested split between large, mid-cap, and small-cap growth.  I just started contributing last year and was advised to do 50% large cap, 20% Mid cap, 20% small-cap, and 10% oversees.   

My annual return this past year was 5.7%, which seems on the low end.  If I would have just invested into Blackrock Equity Index, which mirrors the S&amp;P 500,  I would have had 15-20% returns this past year.  The FA said the growth funds were better performing when the market is down or something along those lines.  

I am 32 years old and make approximately 200k.  In addition to maxing out my 401k, I have a separate account at vanguard that I plan to contribute about 30-50k a year as I don't qualify for Roth IRA.  I put 100% of that into VTSAX.  I went to grad/law school and just started investing for retirement so I have some catching up to do.  

I can't seem to find the expense ratios on the Mywayretirement growth funds but the Blackrock Equity Index fund has a .02% expense ratio.   I ended up putting 25% of my contributions towards that for next year and taking it away from Large Cap Growth but maybe I need to re-think my investments altogether.  Would putting 100% in Blackrock Equity Index be a bad idea?

Any advice would be appreciated.

ethereum,Noob/crypto-skeptic coming in peace with questions,"I am really interested in Ethereum but I am having a hard time understanding Ether the currency’s fundamental value. There is a whole lot of info out there and I’ve spent some time reading [Ben Yu’s Medium articles](https://medium.com/@intenex/cryptocurrency-101-7197684775fd?source=user_profile---------4-------------------------------) and listening to a few episodes of Bankless. But a lot of the arguments I see for why to invest in crypto are along the lines of: 

* crypto is just in its early days and soon everyone else will be getting into crypto too and the sooner you get on board the richer you’ll be
* this is the Renaissance and in the Renaissance you should move to Florence and partake in innovation and wealth creation not continue to live in Medieval times
* [the logic in the @Peruggia thread about buying a famous NFT](https://twitter.com/peruggia_v/status/1370258347341934593) which is basically just that more people will have crypto and want NFTs in the future

This could all be right. The world is getting more digital and I’m inclined to believe the trend will continue, but these are not explanations for why crypto will grow, they’re just statements that it will and self-fulfilling arguments that you should join in. 

My understanding of why Gold or the USD are valuable and good financial instruments is that they are 1) scarce (ETH ticks this box and I understand will even more so with ETH 2.0) and they are 2) useful, desirable on a fundamental level - gold, because it’s shiny and desired for jewellery/other industrial uses, USD because it has been relatively stable for a long time and has the backing of a historically  reliable institution. The Fed is obviously fallible but if a bank loses all your money you are at least somewhat protected by things like FDIC.

I totally agree that there are problems with both Gold and USD. Gold is a bad currency because transaction costs are high and USD is unpredictable because it’s subject to the whims of the Fed, inflation, etc. 

I also understand that Ether has an advantage over BTC because of the Ethereum environment supporting DApps, DeFi, NFTs. What I don't understand is the where Ether and BTC get their fundamental value. If Ether's fundamental value comes from what it can be used for in the Ethereum world, and BTC does not have an equivalent environment, what is BTC's fundamental value? 0? Is the idea that when a recession comes people will hold onto their Ether because of its usefulness in things like DApps? I can imagine a lot of people panicking and selling if there isn't a good story about why Ether itself is fundamentally valuable. 

I love the ideas of decentralization and democratization that I hear on these pages and I really want to believe in the future value of a currency like Ether but I just don't understand it so I'm trying to check myself before I splash an irresponsible amount of money into it. Any help would be really appreciated. Cheers",cryptocurrency

Holiday sales rose at the fastest pace in 17 years, even as shoppers grappled with higher prices, product shortages and a raging new Covid-19 variant in the last few weeks of the season, according to one spending measure. Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks all kinds of payments including cash and debit cards, reported Sunday that holiday sales had risen 8.5% from a year earlier. Mastercard SpendingPulse had expected a 7.4% increase. The results, which covered Nov. 1 through Dec. 24, were fueled by purchases of clothing and jewelry.

Holiday sales were up 10.7% compared with the pre-pandemic 2019 holiday period. By category, clothing rose 47%, jewelry 32%, electronics 16%. Online sales were up 11% from a year ago and 61% from 2019. Department stores registered a 21% increase over 2020.

A broader picture will be revealed next month when the National Retail Federation, the nation’s largest retail trade group, comes out with its combined two-month results in mid-January. The results will be based on an analysis of the November and December sales figures from the Commerce Department. Analysts will also be dissecting the fourth-quarter financial results from different retailers that are slated to be released in February. Overall, analysts had expected a strong holiday season, fueled by early shopping that started back in October in anticipation of a product shortage. Consumers were also determined to celebrate the holidays after a muted one a year ago. Still, November saw a slowdown in retail sales, in part because of the early shopping. And omicron, which has fast become the dominant version of the virus in the United States, has now spoiled holiday plans for many Americans who have had to cancel gatherings last minute. The National Retail Federation said early in December that holiday sales were on track to beat its already record-breaking forecasts for an increase of 8.5% to 10.5% compared to the year-ago period. Holiday sales increased 8.2% in 2020 when shoppers, locked down during the early part of the pandemic, splurged on pajamas and home goods, mostly online.

The group expects that online and other non-store sales, which are included in the total, will increase between 11% and 15%. The numbers exclude automobile dealers, gasoline stations and restaurants. Holiday sales have averaged gains of 4.4% over the past five years, according to the group.",finance

personalfinance,Thinking of interest rate arbitrage,"Hello, 

So I recently was watching an Andrei Jikh video about how the one percent invest your money and he mentioned the term interest-rate arbitrage to seem very interesting to me.

Just a disclaimer that if I seem very ignorant and uninformed I apologize, I am just a 20 year old trying to learn more about it.

I currently have no debt (other than credit cards which are like 200$ nothing big), and I go to school for free because my financial aid covers it. I have a 782 credit score and I currently work 2 jobs both are relatively easy and I’m just looking to increase my net worth.

On the show Manifest (I just started watching it) the main character Ben is faced with a big financial bill I guess.

He is a Math professor so he uses math to figure out how he can pay off his debt that he owes.

He says that “we can take out a small business loan, invest it, and use the interest to pay back the insurance company.”

Not financial advice of course but if there was hypothetically a way that, I can borrow money essentially to invest with a low interest rate, and use those funds to invest into something that pays me a higher APY than the interest rate that is given, thus generating positive equity through borrowed money. 

Of course it’s a calculated risk, but I do not look at debt as a bad thing, if it can help you increase your net worth. Probably staking that borrowed money into stable crypto coins like USD AND GUSD or investing it into the stock market VTI, can Yield me 7-10% gross revenue. 

It is something I have been thinking about, I have not done as much research, thus the reason for my ignorance, but could someone hypothetically do that, not to pay off debt but to potentially make a 3rd source of income?

I've seen plenty of reputable market watchers including some at Morgan Stanley seeming to predict a possibility that the stock market may trade kind of sideways for a while now.

I use Visa everyday and V has been a consistent stock for along time which is attractive. As far as a long term “safe” bet Visa seems like a solid option for the start of my diversification.


PayPal is a name I hear thrown around all the time on these subreddits however I do not understand the hype. Now I am not a person that spends a ton of time diving deep into companies which is where I could be missing something but I do not see Venmo being added as a payment option on Amazon being a game changer for PayPal.

Again, I am not very educated about PayPal as a company so I invite someone to tell me why my belief is wrong. 

SoFi is the company I just used to refinance my student loans.

stocks,Margin Interest Rates,"I have been scouring the margin handbook for TD ameritrade and have more questions than answers. I have looked at past reddit posts and have not found answers yet.

How and when is margin interest rate charged?

All  I found in the handbook was that for a margin account, interest accrues and is paid once the stock position is sold...

So this is how I understand margin - I have 100,000$ cash and 200,000$ stock buying power in my margin account. Say I buy 80,000$ worth of stock which uses 40,000$ cash and 80,000$ stock buying power, which has me borrow 40,000$. Pretend I hold this for a full year with TDA's 9.0% interest rate. Then I proceed to sell for a 0$ gain as the stock traded sideways and just broke even. Am I charged (40,000 \* 0.09) = 3,600$ for holding this stock position thus only receiving 36,400$ back? Or more as the amount is compounded daily? 

OR...

Is interest only charged on ""Day Trade Buying Power"" that I hold over night once ""Stock buying power"" is depleted? For example, Day Trade BP might be 400,000$ while Stock BP is 200,000$. If I day trade 300,000$, am I charged interest on just the 100,000$  that is beyond my ""stock buying power""?

economy,PPF : How do you get Rs 1 crore in 25 years if you invest in it?,"The Public Provident Fund is one of the safest long-term investments. This is a sovereign guaranteed investment. Usually has a higher interest rate than a fixed deposit (FD). PPF schemes have many benefits for the common man.

A PPF account can be opened with a minimum amount of Rs.500. Up to Rs 1.5 lakh can be invested in a PPF account in a financial year. Salaried, small traders, big traders, self-employed, gig workers, freelancers.

The government revises interest rates on a quarterly basis. By investing Rs 1.5 lakh per annum, it is possible to raise up to Rs 40 lakh over a period of 15 years.

Can be extended for 5 years after a period of fifteen years. Then if you invest at the rate of Rs 1.5 lakh per annum, you will get Rs 66 lakh in twenty years. Even if the maturity is extended for another five years thereafter, if you invest Rs 1.5 lakh per annum, the total amount you will get for the entire plant will be Rs 1 crore. If the government revises interest rates (increases) then your returns will increase further

**Interest rate:**

The PPF interest rate for the December 2021 quarter was 7.1 per cent. However, the interest rate is expected to increase slightly in the January-March quarter of 2022 as part of the revision. At one point in the past the PPF interest rate was even twelve per cent.

However, when it comes to tax benefits, all together there is a tax deduction of up to Rs 1.5 lakh. If there are two PPF’s accounts one should close it. There are tax benefits under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act..

**PPF Key Features:**

Sovereign Guarantee – Legal Immunity – No Tax on Investment, Interest, Returns – Loan Facility – Minimum amount of Rs.500 per annum can be invested. – Rs 1.5 lakh per annum can be invested with tax deduction.

**Loan facility:**

*****
&gt; U.S. stock index futures indicated a higher start Monday as markets reopen after the Christmas holiday and investors assess the spread of the omicron Covid-19 variant.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose by about 74 points. S&amp;P 500 futures added 0.3% and Nasdaq 100 futures ticked up 0.4%.
*****
&gt; Airline stocks fell after a holiday weekend that saw thousands of flights canceled due to Covid-related issues. The rampant spread of the omicron variant led to a staffing shortage at a time when airlines were looking to ramp up their schedules to meet high travel demand.
*****
&gt; United Airlines fell 1.9% in premarket trading, while American Airlines dipped 1.6% and Delta Air Lines was off 1.7%.
*****
&gt; Shares of GoDaddy jumped more than 4% in early morning trading after the Wall Street Journal reported activist investor Starboard Value LP took a 6.5% stake in the domain registrar.
*****
&gt; Investors are looking for a Santa Claus rally to close out a year in which the S&amp;P 500 has gained a whopping 25.8%. The benchmark index historically gains during the Santa Claus rally period — the final five trading days of the current year and the first two of the new year.
*****
&gt; On Thursday, with markets closed Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 196.67 points, or 0.55%, to 35,950.56. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.62% to 4,725.79 and closed at a record. The 500-stock average sits less than 0.4% from its intraday record high. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.85% to 15,653.37.
*****
&gt; Helping boost sentiment were new studies suggesting that omicron has a lower risk of hospitalization than other Covid variants.
*****
&gt; U.S. infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday that cases of Covid-19 are likely going to keep surging as the omicron variant rapidly spreads across the globe.
*****
&gt; “Every day it goes up and up. The last weekly average was about 150,000 and it likely will go much higher,” Fauci said on ABC’s “This Week.”
*****
&gt; The U.S. has reported more than 52 million total cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. Driving the surge is the omicron variant, which took over as the dominant strain earlier this month.
*****
&gt; A slew of economic data on Thursday last week showed a stable economy with improving labor and spending trends, but inflation at high levels. The Federal Reserve’s closely watched core personal consumption expenditures price index rose 0.6% in November from the month prior. Core PCE rose 4.7% year-over-year in November, higher than the 4.5% rate expected.
*****
&gt; On the data front Monday, the Dallas Fed manufacturing index is due out at 10:30 a.m. ET.

personalfinance,Looking for Help with Balance Transfer from my husbands to mine.,"We share finances completely. Husband is disabled and taking care of our son. He can not work as then we would have to pay for daycare and his earning potential would be far less than daycare would cost. 

I’ve had a job this whole time. We share a bank account and credit cards. However, my credit was really shot for a while due to student loans. But his credit is great as we just opened 2 cards and have been paying great on them for years. 

Anyway, I lost my job 3 months ago. And I’ve been trying to get one ever since. I found one but they don’t start till next week. Due to rent and bills the credit card we both use, but under his name, is up to 9,313k. It caps out at 11k. It’s 29.24% interest, Amex every day card. Even with a 787 credit, that interest rate seems super high. Every time we’ve asked for a decrease they’ve said no. It was $114 in interest last month. 

Long term now that I have a job coming up we won’t be spending, but we want to pay that off ASAP. So I was thinking if we both got a balance transfer card, we could clear the debt with less interest.

I’m not looking for people to tell us we’ve made poor financial decisions or that I shouldn’t take on the debt. I literally spent the money myself. Even under his name, it’s still my debt. I paid the rent and bills and bought groceries, I won’t apologize.

I’m just looking if anyone knows any balance transfer cards that allow you to transfer a debt from one person to another. As I finally have good enough credit. I’ve read the card holders agreements on several balance transfer cards and have found nothing regarding this at all. 

Thank you!",finance

I'm just trying to plan to pay off in the next 2 years and predicting what the monthly interest rate would be for proposed payments and is never consistent. 

Does this have to do with when the payments are received and maybe the nature of varying number of days in months? It doesn't seem to be as cut and dry as dividing the yearly APR by 12. Is it maybe divide by 365 and then factor in the length of the month?

CryptoCurrency,U.S. Crypto Regulation for 2022 - Cesspool of Political Infighting or Real Change?,"If Sen. Lummis's proposal for a new crypto regulator is passed, then there might be hope for sensible U.S. laws in 2022 (emphasis on the might.)

Right now too many overlapping agencies and departments claim to have some role in regulating crypto, from the SEC, to CFTC, to Treasury. Someone has to be in charge (and understand the use cases behind this tech revolution.)

Her proposal would create:

&gt;""a new organization under the joint jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission to oversee the digital asset market.""\*

That already poses problems. What does ""joint jurisdiction"" mean? Who is footing the bill for the organization? Will it be staffed with people who can actually make decisions or just recommend to the heads of the SEC and CFTC?

Without clear regulation a spot Bitcoin ETF is almost impossible. So are rules over custody services, stablecoin reserve requirements, and a host of other critical issues.

Then there's the political quagmire of Congress where bipartisanship has gone to die.

Since crypto is becoming a political issue, maybe it will serve as a singular point of light in an otherwise dismal political year.

I have posted here before and have read the Wiki! I just wanted a brief confirmation on what to do with short term money.

I currently have a good salary of $73k (as of August of 2021 so still new) and have very minor expenses. I live at home with my parents still and intend on buying a house within the next year or two hopefully as I just turned 25.

My only expenses are an auto payment with 2.99% interest that is being auto paid each month. 

Then I pay some other minor things such as phone/data, auto insurance, gas, etc.

I have a solid emergency fund of $7.5k 

My Roth IRA has been maxed since I started it in 2020 so it has the full $12k so far and I will be putting $6k right at the start of 2022.

I can’t contribute to an HSA and my job does not offer any retirement benefits for me to contribute to.

I do have $13k federal student loans but it was just waived until May I believe. So come May I will pay that off in full too as it is 5% interest.

Anyways, I have saved up over $60k and it is killing me that it is losing value in my savings account. 

Should I just start putting it into a taxable account with mutual funds even if I would like to buy a house in the relatively near future?

P.S. my Roth IRA is in vanguard and all in VTSAX and a TDF VTTSX.

If the I-bonds are purchased after the tax refund is processed, what would the interest rate be? Would it be the semi-annual rate of 3.56% or would it be the variable rate on the issue date (7.12%)? Does the interest rate update every 6 months like electronic I-bonds?

investing,What do you think about inflation linked US Treasury bonds?,"You can buy up to $10,000 Inflation linked US Treasury bonds per person per calendar year and I am considering doing so before the year ends.

The “catch” is you can’t touch the money for one year. Then if you pull out the money before five years, you lose the last three months of interest. Also the interest rate will change and probably fall below its current rate in the future, but can’t go below 0.

What should I do?","I'm looking to buy a new car in the next couple of months, and though I could pay for nearly all of it in cash I'd rather take out a medium-sized car loan (Borrow maybe 15k/4-5yr) and invest the rest. I'm hoping to not drain my savings/investments, would to diversify my credit, and I don't mind a little risk.

Recently, my credit score dropped from \~780 to \~720 due to my parent's credit card; I'm still on the account from when I was a teen and they've run up 50+% utilization over the holiday season (though they always pay in full every month). Nothing else about my credit has changed (my own cards are usually \~5-10% utilization and I have no debt). I'm concerned that this drop is going to affect the interest rates I can get on a loan to the extent that I should reevaluate how much cash I put down. I'm wondering how much I can expect this to be a problem.

A few questions here:

1. If the card's utilization goes back down in the next cycle (normally my parent's card is \~20%), can I expect my score to bounce back in the next 1-2 months or will it take more time?
2. This entire thing has convinced me I should have my parents take me off the card, but would I be hurting myself short-term if I do it before I take out a loan? (The account age is \~15yr, which is 10yr older than my oldest credit line, and it accounts for \~30% of my total reported credit)

personalfinance,Is whole life a good investment vehicle for tax free income and compounding?,"My wife and I looking at getting life insurance just in case something happens to one of us because she has student loan debt, about 50K worth. We want to be able to cover that if something happens.

We want to eventually start getting short term rental properties and I know instead of graduation bank loans if you have enough cash value in your life insurance you can borrow against that as a loan while your money still grows and compounds and your “paying yourself” at a lower interest rate and without taxes. 

So that would set us up to use our insurance to buy cars or rental properties without taking out a bank loan and not stopping out money from growing. I’ve seen arguments against it because you could just pay term and pay the premium difference into a Roth, but you can’t borrow against or use that money at anytime tax free.

I work a second job at a chain coffeeshop, and can enroll in a 401(k) through them. My biweekly paychecks are approximately $200. I can enroll in a 401(k) through Fidelity that'll contribute 8, 10, or 12% per paycheck.

My parents still pay my insurances and support where needed (ie if my electric bill is too high), and I'm still a dependent on their taxes. Because of this, I have some flexibility with my income, even though it's low.

Should I enroll in the 401(k), and if so, what %? I have some concerns because the plans say the account will likely grow, unless there's a major global catastrophe, which feels... increasingly plausible, especially with Omicron. 

tldr; My income is about $1,400/month, $400/month of that is eligible for an 8%, 10%, or 12% 401(k). Parents partially support me, so I have flexibility right now. Should I start a 401(k), and what % of my paycheck should I contribute?",finance
personalfinance,Which loan to pay off first?,"My friend has two student loans. One is federal ($25k 5% interest), the other private ($90k 5% interest). 

She told me that she was going to put $1k towards the $25k federal loan right before interest begins accumulating again. I suggested that the $1k would save more money in the long run if she put it towards the $90k debt. Her logic was that putting money towards the federal load first is better since all of the $1k pays the principle.

Besides telling her how to manage her money, am I wrong in suggesting to put the money towards the $90k loan? Also how can I calculate what option would be better?",finance

Happy holidays and thanks in advance for any feedback.

My wife graduated with her Master's this year, and she accrued some interest on her Federal Student Loans. She did not pay a single penny through the pandemic but saved all the budgeted money for her loans.

If she goes tonight and makes a payment tonight towards the interests, would we be able to deduct that payment from our taxes? Otherwise, we will instead continue saving the payments until January or whenever the payments start.

ethereum,"My bull case and why I'm all in on Ether, tell me how I'm wrong!","TLDR; Vitalink says he doesn't care much about price but the current roadmap certainly seems designed to increase the value of ETH.

1) **Eth price is driven by supply.** At least for ETH/BTC, current supply/demand seems to be a very good predictor of price. This is seen very clearly on the [halvings](https://coinmarketexpert.com/bitcoin-log-chart-analysis-a-thorough-investigation/) impact on bitcoin price. Predictable events drive up bitcoins price, simply because there is not enough coins to meet demand.

2) **Mining adds a lot of ether to supply.** POW mining is a commodity business. These industries tend to have very low margins(because competition is very fierce). This means most miners will have costs(hardware, operations and electricity) very close to the rewards they currently get. I believe most miners sell almost all of their mining rewards to cover these costs – adding supply. Currently adding \~4.6 million ether per year(ETH inflation is 4%).

3) **The merge will stop this supply** As the merge happens, mining will suddenly stop. Thus removing the biggest contributor to ether supply,

3.1) Another way to think of this is, Ether is currently paying for POW, once this is no longer needed, this value will instead contribute to ethers price.

4) **Ether is going to become a better store of value.** If ether goes deflationary due to high burn-rates, this will make ether a more interesting asset to hold. Further reducing supply in circulation.

5) **A lot more ether will be taken out of supply as trust in staking increases.** Since staking generates returns, I believe more ether will go in to staking over time. This may increase inflation of ether, but also removing ether from circulation. According to [this](https://medium.com/@business_40259/ethereum-2-0-may-achieve-1-deflation-every-year-despite-slow-upgrade-progress-9bc34f488a4b) article, 100 million ether staked would still generate 1.8% yearly returns to stakers. The central banks are starting to warm up to higher interest rates, but right now, this kind of ROI is not that easy to come by for liquid assets. If 100 million ether are staked, that would be 85% of all ether in existence.

7) **Increased costs of transactions will reduce supply.** I haven't been able to figure out how this works exactly, but my understanding is, increased transaction costs on the base layer will either be burned – decreasing supply or awarded to stakers –Increasing ROI on staking. This in turn will increase the number of staked coins, and that will also decrease supply.   

8) **Scaling ether will increase transaction-costs(on the base-layer)**. Contrary to popular belief, sharding and other scaling solutions will first alleviate congestion on the base-layer. But as transactions get cheaper, more transactions will happen. Currently, we see people are willing to pay 20-60 USD for transactions. Over time, we will see the same thing on layer 2(though possibly a bit lower fees due to price elasticity). 100s of layer 2 transactions can then be bundled and all their fees will be used to create a single transaction on the base-layer.

I've been struggling find good data on amongst others, daily burn rate, staking rewards and mining rewards. If someone can share that with me, I could quantify some of these statements better. I'd also love to know what i've gotten wrong here.",cryptocurrency
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, December 27, 2021","*The following was written on the*[ *recap I wrote December 3*](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r8as26/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_friday_december/)*: “On a personal note, I am taking this opportunity to do some very small dip-buying. As usual, I believe the market is overreacting (as it tends to do). While it is important to acknowledge the risks present in the market and be prepared to act if they arise, I personally believe Omicron fears are overblown (I remember we had the same song and dance when Delta was first discovered). More concerning is the Fed’s change in attitude towards inflation. That said, the only thing discussed so far has been accelerating the timeline for tapering asset purchases. As I have said for months at this point, I am not worried about tapering. If/when the Fed begins discussing raising interest rates, then I will step back and reassess.”* 

*During that time, there was so much fear-mongering and doomsaying going around on social media and even mainstream media. All those articles, understandably, caused a lot of panic, especially among newer retail investors. The stock market will always be dominated by cycles or rallies and pullbacks and always overreacts, to the upside and downside. The most important thing when playing the market is managing one’s emotions. Always stay calm, be flexible and be prepared to act if your thesis is proven wrong.  Do your own research and never pay attention to mainstream financial media like CNBC.* 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, December 27, 2021**

Remarkably, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) hit a new all-time high for the 68th time this year, driven higher by a rally in technology stocks, a very strong start for the bullish end-of-year rally typically called the Santa Claus rally. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) is up more than 4% in the last five trading sessions alone. I for one am absolutely loving it.

On Monday, market participants cheered on a new report that showed retail sales in the US soaring past analyst estimates and a new report suggesting that Omicron, while more contagious, is much less severe than previous variants and less likely to cause hospitalization.

**Notable Numbers Today**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): +1.41%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): +1.65%
* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.99%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +0/91%
* NVIDIA (NVDA): +4.40%
* Microsoft (MSFT): +2.32%
* Apple (AAPL): +2.30%
* BridgeBio Pharma: -71.64%
* Volatility Index (VIX): -1.84%

A report by Mastercard (MA) showed total US retail sales jumped a remarkable 8.5% from November 1 to December 24 thanks to soaring eCommerce sales. This is very encouraging as we continue to deal with supply-chain disruptions and elevated prices. eCommerce sales jumped up 11% this holiday season while sales at physical stores rose 8.1%, according to the same report.

According to three separate studies coming out of South Africa, England, and Scotland indicated that people infected with Omicron are somewhere between 50-80% less likely to be hospitalized when compared to previous coronavirus strains. 

[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/covid-omicron-delta-hospitalizations.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/covid-omicron-delta-hospitalizations.html)

For context, more than 69,000 Americans were hospitalized with Covid-19 on Christmas Eve, [according to data ](https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-utilization)from the US Department of Health and Human Services. This represents an increase of around 2% compared to last week. While unfortunate, the figure remains below peak hospitalizations during the Delta surge and is half of the record-high from January, despite infections surging more than 50% in the month of December

[https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-utilization](https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-utilization)

Dr. David Katz, President of True Health Initiative, said “One of the ways pandemics end is significant mutation of the virus. It looks like Omicron may be our friend in that regard, significant mutations different enough from the parent that it doesn’t make people as sick.” 

The market will head into 2022 with several key considerations to weigh but with its biggest focus on the course of the pandemic and rising inflationary pressures as well as the measures the Federal Reserve could take in response.

* November[ sales of new U.S. homes jumped](https://finance.yahoo.com/home-sales-jump-12-4-151247687.html) 12.4% to a seven-month high of 744,000, buoyed by low mortgage rates and higher demand in the housing industry.

Polkadot,Eliminating Irrational Token Allocation and Creating True Unit of Account with SORA,"Let me start off by saying, the SORA ecosystem can’t be explained in a single post. So, I’m going to try my best to simply introduce you to the *algorithmic decentralised central bank*. Let the rabbit hole begin.

Reduction of purchasing power, supply shock, and inflation are terms that are frequently being used by economists to describe the current global monetary conditions. These terms being used are derived from the backbone of the existing monetary system, where central banks issue fiat money into the economy based on predicted [**credit creation**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1057521912000877).

As we can currently see, there are two major issues in this practice. First of all, the present fiat currencies are not backed by any commodity and derive their value solely from the trust that the people place on it and the regulatory government.

This brings us to the second issue, centralization. Having central monetary authorities regulating the issuing of purchasing power increases the risk of human error, greed, and increases the miscalculated risk of a supply shock, thus leading to an incalculable monetary economy.

This is where the creation of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies comes into play. Exchange rate &amp; value stability (Storage of Value property of money) are important factors to determine Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency’s value.

We are all aware that bitcoin has been described as a hedge against inflation and as a unit of value. This is due to Bitcoins monetary policy having a fixed supply and a predictable injection and allocation via the network's computational mining system. But does this solve the issues our current financial system has?

Volatility in the price of many cryptocurrencies is often a major obstacle to their widespread adoption. The purchasing price of most cryptocurrencies is determined by secondary markets. While this is a desirable feature for a non-sovereign currency to have, crypto markets are prone to psychological influence, such as excessive fear and greed (FUD, FOMO, etc.), making most of them too volatile to be accepted by stores.

The XOR Token Bonding Curve solves the issue of value instability. The XOR token has all the attributes of money. It is embedded with the value of other assets; including but not limited to DAI (USD), ETH, [**VAL**](https://medium.com/sora-xor/sora-validator-rewards-419320e22df8) and [**PSWAP**](https://wiki.sora.org/polkaswap/pswap-tokenomics#the-pswap-token) tokens, making XOR a true store of value. (More assets can be added or removed via [**multi-body sortition**](https://medium.com/sora-xor/the-sora-parliament-af8184dae384)). This significantly increases the trust in the monetary value as the token’s value is influenced by the backed assets.

The token bonding curve (TBC) manages the supply of tokens via the use of smart contracts in a rational way, without the involvement of humans or a central government, to create a system that avoids the boom-bust problems of traditional economies and the deflationary economics of many cryptocurrencies.

In simple words, the TBC is essentially an infinitely liquid, decentralised central bank. At any time, you can buy newly minted XOR from the token bonding curve using some specific reserve assets or sell your XOR tokens (which are instantly burned) for one of those assets.

The TBC uses a simple model where there are two linear functions: a Buy-Price Function and a Sell-Price Function.

Now I know what you are all thinking. *“Why would we want to mint tokens? Isn’t this one of the main issues of our current financial system?”*.

An economic system has not only money (unit of account/store of value/medium of exchange), but also a means to allocate money and control quantities of money allocated. To design a successful blockchain ecosystem for the real-world economy, the allocation of purchasing power is key to laying a strong foundation for the economy.

[The Quantity Theory of Disaggregated Credit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfdlctvHH4&amp;t=489s) (Prof. Werner, 1992, 1997) discusses that money may be injected into the economy in proportion to the productive purposes. The result is a sustainable growth without inflation and with a more equal income and wealth distribution: Money is allocated for productive, sustainable work, producing income streams and not speculation.

To summarise, SORA’s decentralised economic system seeks to improve society through responsible money creation and allocation, however, unlike existing centralised and privatised systems currently in existence, SORA does so with the community first and foremost.

It is embedded with the value of other assets; including but not limited to DAI (USD), ETH, [**VAL**](https://medium.com/sora-xor/sora-validator-rewards-419320e22df8) and [**PSWAP**](https://wiki.sora.org/polkaswap/pswap-tokenomics#the-pswap-token) tokens, making XOR a true store of value. (More assets can be added or removed via [**multi-body sortition**](https://medium.com/sora-xor/the-sora-parliament-af8184dae384)). This significantly increases the trust in the monetary value as the token’s value is influenced by the backed assets.

The token bonding curve (TBC) manages the supply of tokens via the use of smart contracts in a rational way, without the involvement of humans or a central government, to create a system that avoids the boom-bust problems of traditional economies and the deflationary economics of many cryptocurrencies.

In simple words, the TBC is essentially an infinitely liquid, decentralised central bank. At any time, you can buy newly minted XOR from the token bonding curve using some specific reserve assets or sell your XOR tokens (which are instantly burned) for one of those assets.

The TBC uses a simple model where there are two linear functions: a Buy-Price Function and a Sell-Price Function.

Now I know what you are all thinking. *“Why would we want to mint tokens? Isn’t this one of the main issues of our current financial system?”*.

An economic system has not only money (unit of account/store of value/medium of exchange), but also a means to allocate money and control quantities of money allocated. To design a successful blockchain ecosystem for the real-world economy, the allocation of purchasing power is key to laying a strong foundation for the economy.

&amp;#x200B;

[The Quantity Theory of Disaggregated Credit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEfdlctvHH4&amp;t=489s) (Prof. Werner, 1992, 1997) discusses that money may be injected into the economy in proportion to the productive purposes. The result is a sustainable growth without inflation and with a more equal income and wealth distribution: Money is allocated for productive, sustainable work, producing income streams and not speculation.

To summarise, SORA’s decentralised economic system seeks to improve society through responsible money creation and allocation, however, unlike existing centralised and privatised systems currently in existence, SORA does so with the community first and foremost.

39. The heads of Circle, FTX, Bitfury, Paxos, Stellar Development Foundation, and Coinbase appeared before the House Financial Services Committee. As expected, the questions from some of the House Committee members belied a misplaced focus on things like terrorist financing while others understood the need to regulate crypto appropriately so that crypto innovation is not forced offshore. There was significant focus on stablecoins due to the President’s Working Group placing so much focus there. One representative also chose to focus heavily on the energy consumption of Bitcoin mentioning coal power plants coming back on line to fuel Bitcoin mining. The witnesses from the crypto industry seemed to focus on dispelling misconceptions and also pushing for a single crypto focused regulatory body as opposed to the fragmented regulation that is typical in Washington.

I've accumulated about 20k of credit card debt that I've been paying off but it's slow going. I've recently started looking into getting a personal loan to pay it all off in one shot. I'm looking at a 36 month term so I can get my credit score bumped up before we are looking to buy. My current utilization is at about 50% so my score is getting dinged for that. My interest rates range now from 11% to probably around 19%, it varies on the card. I've been quoted an 11.5% rate for a personal loan with a payment around $650 a month.

CryptoCurrency,I call bullshit on the “Ethereum gas fees are broken” narrative.,"It’s been a repetitive mantra heard over and over again: Ethereum high gas fees mean that the chain is broken and has no future. 

Even a CT native like Colbie is jumping on the ‘let’s bash fees on Ethereum’ bandwagon. 

*“Ethereum has failed at scaling in a way that allows the chain to be used by regular people. It’s prohibitively expensive to use on L1 and the L2s are very new and have their own UX issues.”*

https://cobie.substack.com/p/trading-the-metagame

Now one thing that’s correct in the quote above is *regular people*. And that’s where you see that this narrative of high gas fees is comparing apples to oranges. 

Ethereum L1 is not meant to be used directly by regular people. The same way that cargo air freighters are not meant to transport civilians not their luggage. You don’t book a cargo plane for your shipping. You go to FedEx or UPS (an L2) to send your package. 

I think Polynya does a great job of explaining how Ethereum’s rollup centric roadmap will scale Ethereum and transform Ethereum L1 into the settlement layer for the internet, effectively bridging most of not all other chains. 

https://polynya.medium.com/rollup-centric-ethereum-roadmap-november-2021-update-f8a8f6f518ce

If you have not read about the difference between monolithic and modular blockchains you’re NGMI. 

If you can’t see how Ethereum is transforming into the layer zero for industrial users, you’re gonna be late to the party. 

I’d love to hear how I’m an ‘Ethereum shill’ and should go all in on ‘meme coin X’, or perhaps some other low ball efforts. Or perhaps you have some actual view points I again could learn from.

investing,Expectations and asset allocation for 2022,"Hey guys,

With 2022 approaching ever so quickly, I was wondering what your approach to the upcoming year is in terms of asset allocation. 

I must admit that 2021 ended with quite a few developments that I would not have expected at all. In spite of supply chain issues, rising inflation, the continuous disruption of economic processes by COVID variants and an approaching end of the Fed’s more than generous support of the US market, most of the large indices are trading at or near their all time highs, with no signs of a short-term slowdown (granted the volatility has been up as of late mostly thanks to Omicron).

I honestly never would have expected markets to keep the course this easily with all the above mentioned uncertainties/headwinds coming at them. With that being said, what are your macro level expectations for 2022 and how does it affect your overall asset allocation?

I for starters am sitting on a relatively big pile of cash waiting to be deployed once markets cool down. My underlying assumption is that we are going to see some sort of major correction in the near to mid future and I’d like to profit from that.

With that being said my current allocation looks something like this:

-37,5% in real estate (as investment, not personal)
-23,5% in a 2,8% yielding life insurance 
-19,5% in stocks
-18,5% in cash but intended to be in stocks eventually
-1% in other financial assets

So what are you guys’ thoughts going into 2022? Are you intending to modify your allocations once the fed raises the interest rates? And how are you currently allocating your assets? 

Looking forward to hearing about your approach to 2022! :)",finance

CryptoCurrency,If you had any money in a bank account this year instead of in stable coins collecting interest you lost ~6.8% of your money.,"The average inflation rate for the US dollar in 2021 is reported to be ~6.8%. That is the highest rate of inflation since 1982. Thats means $1000 at the beginning of the year is now only worth $932. The national average interest rate for savings accounts is 0.06 percent, according to Bankrate’s Nov. 24, 2021 weekly survey of institutions. 

If you didn’t utilize crypto exchanges paying interest on stable coins of 8.5%-14% then you lost money. This is an example of how backward and broken your banking “high yield interest accounts” are. They are a scam and the uneducated are being sucked dry if their hard earned money. Although the S&amp;P 500 stock market index has gone up ~29% year to date, stocks and index funds are still more volatile then the best chosen 1:1 pegged stable coins that are kept in insured against losses exchanges. 

Investing in crypto, real estate, and stocks is a great way to diversify but we all need money on the side for a rainy day. A “just in case” account. But we can’t let our money disappear overtime just because we don’t touch it. Stable coins collecting interest for the time being is one of the only ways to grow a savings account and I hope more people realize this. 

Unfortunately the true rate of inflation is not only 6.8% percent. That is just the average. Energy costs recording the biggest gain (33.3% vs 30% in October), namely gasoline (58.1% vs 49.6%). Inflation also increased for shelter (3.8% vs 3.5%); food (6.1% vs 5.3%, the highest since October of 2008), namely food at home (6.4% vs 5.4%); new vehicles (11.1% vs 9.8%); used cars and trucks (31.4% percent vs 26.4%); apparel (5% vs 4.3%); and medical care services (2.1% vs 1.7%). On the other hand, the inflation slowed for transportation services (3.9% vs 4.5%). Excluding food and energy, inflation went up to 4.9% from 4.6%, the highest since June of 1991. * these are educational facts about the market, not financial advice * My opinion is that stable coins are the future and so is peer to peer lending.

CryptoCurrency,"My bull case and why I'm all in on Ether, tell me how I'm wrong!","*Disclaimer, this assumes ether achieves their roadmap and manages to increase transaction volumes, reducing cost on layer 2.* 

TLDR; Vitalink says he doesn't care much about price but the current roadmap certainly seems designed to increase the value of ETH.

1. **Eth price is driven by supply.** At least for ETH/BTC, current supply/demand seems to be a very good predictor of price. This is seen very clearly on the [halvings](https://coinmarketexpert.com/bitcoin-log-chart-analysis-a-thorough-investigation/) impact on bitcoin price. Predictable events drive up bitcoins price, simply because there is not enough coins to meet demand.
2. **Mining adds a lot of ether to supply.** POW mining is a commodity business. These industries tend to have very low margins(because competition is very fierce). This means most miners will have costs(hardware, operations and electricity) very close to the rewards they currently get. I believe most miners sell almost all of their mining rewards to cover these costs – adding supply. Currently adding \~4.6 million ether per year(ETH inflation is 4%).
3. **The merge will stop this supply** As the merge happens, mining will suddenly stop. Thus removing the biggest contributor to ether supply,
4. Another way to think of this is, Ether is currently paying for POW, once this is no longer needed, this value will instead contribute to ethers price.
5. **Ether is going to become a better store of value.** If ether goes deflationary due to high burn-rates, this will make ether a more interesting asset to hold. Further reducing supply in circulation.
6. **A lot more ether will be taken out of supply as trust in staking increases.** Since staking generates returns, I believe more ether will go in to staking over time. This may increase inflation of ether, but also removing ether from circulation. According to [this](https://medium.com/@business_40259/ethereum-2-0-may-achieve-1-deflation-every-year-despite-slow-upgrade-progress-9bc34f488a4b) article, 100 million ether staked would still generate 1.8% yearly returns to stakers. The central banks are starting to warm up to higher interest rates, but right now, this kind of ROI is not that easy to come by for liquid assets. If 100 million ether are staked, that would be 85% of all ether in existence.
7. **Increased costs of transactions will reduce supply.** I haven't been able to figure out how this works exactly, but my understanding is, increased transaction costs on the base layer will either be burned – decreasing supply or awarded to stakers –Increasing ROI on staking. This in turn will increase the number of staked coins, and that will also decrease supply.
8. **Scaling ether will increase transaction-costs(on the base-layer)**. Contrary to popular belief, sharding and other scaling solutions will first alleviate congestion on the base-layer. But as transactions get cheaper, more transactions will happen. Currently, we see people are willing to pay 20-60 USD for transactions. Over time, we will see the same thing on layer 2(though possibly a bit lower fees due to price elasticity). 100s of layer 2 transactions can then be bundled and all their fees will be used to create a single transaction on the base-layer.

* SolarEdge SE3800H
* 12 - SolarEdge DC Optimizer
* sweb/app monitoring - 5 years data

* $14,500, price per watt installed $2.98
* State: Maryland ($1k state incentive)
* Utility: Potomac Edison

* Expected production 1-year: 5900kWhs
* SREC income 1-year: $450
* Expected payback \~11 years

Couple of comments:

* I don't want solar on the house-- its a historic house and while I love the look of solar, I think that it detracts from the historic charm
* I'm not planning on financing
* I'm tracking the Build Back Better bill which I understand will bump the 26% federal credit to 30%
* I drive an EV (10k miles/year)
* I don't have 240v electric in the garage currently, so a run back to my panel is in my future even without solar
* The company that provided the quote is a friend of the family, so I'd like to do business with them, even if they're 5-10% higher than the absolute best price I could potentially find. As such, I don't have any comparison quotes.

&amp;#x200B;

Couple of questions:

1. Is $2.98 per watt installed decent?
2. I understand that lots of people on here seem to prefer micro-inverters, and this quote is obviously not. Should I ask for a similar quote with emphase micros?

altcoin,The Rug Pull - A True Story - The true story of a cryptocurrency rug pull,"**About your author: CryptoQuestion is an independent platform providing free resources for cryptocurrency investors. From an on-demand Q&amp;A service to online courses, from our weekly** [**Moonshot Monday**](https://cryptoquestion.tech/weekly-podcast/) **podcast to our weekly Staking and Farming Review. Visit us at** [**www.cryptoquestion.tech**](http://www.cryptoquestion.tech/)

We are all suckers for a good story.

The best stories are the ones that provide you with a lightbulb moment. I much prefer stories about how a business idea is going to solve a particular problem and leave me multiple times richer than the story from a girlfriend about her day at the office and how her training is going for her upcoming marathon. The latter is guaranteed to put me to sleep, the former will light a fire inside of me.

And so it was with Candela Coin.

Like many of us hunting for the next big thing in cryptocurrency we uncovered Candela Coin after reading a short post on a Reddit forum. It is the small hidden posts that usually reap the most lucrative rewards. This post wasn’t your normal spam you find on most Reddit crypto forums. It was more thought out and immediately captured our imagination.

‘A project which aims to cut out the big electricity corporations by allowing end users to share solar power generated from their own panels via micro grids. All powered by the Candela Coin. All this for a valuation of $100,000. The founder was also doxxed, always a good sign. Compared to its nearest competitor, Power Ledger with a market cap at the time of $100 million, Candela was looking like a diamond in the rough!’

Whilst we liked the look of Candela we realized execution was key to its success. It wouldn’t be cheap to roll this concept out to the masses. When we quizzed Candela’s founder Avi he told us he was independently wealthy from a previous venture and was able to finance this project from his own resources. Red flag #1.

In the space of a few months the price of CLA climbed steadily as more people discovered this project and bought into its story.

CLA was originally an ERC-20 token which as we all know is expensive to buy with extortionate gas fees. In order to overcome this objection Avi set up the same coin on BSC. One token was supposed to be a store of value and the other a utility token. Which one was which was never totally clear. It was always assumed that the proceeds from the sale of these new BSC tokens would go towards the project but no one asked the question and Avi didn’t dwell on the subject. Red flag #2.

When the NFT craze started Avi decided that he would launch a range of NFTs. That was quickly followed by his announcement that Candela would be entering the metaverse. What the hell these two initiatives had to do with Candela’s core business is anyone’s guess. Laser focus is essential to the success of any startup. Red flag #3.

Whilst all these developments were going on a few disgruntled CLA investors started to share private messages they had received from Avi and his merry band of angry helpers. It became very clear that Avi and co were in the habit of threatening and abusing anyone who questioned his decision making and the legitimacy of his project. Derogatory comments about investor’s mothers were just the tip of the iceberg. Red flag #4.

From these private messages it also became clear that Avi was holding tokens on behalf of investors and refusing to hand them back. A red flag right there. Red flag #5.

In order to attract bigger investments Avi launched a whale group. To qualify investors had to invest a minimum of one million tokens. In exchange for this investors would receive additional benefits including a Candela branded solar panel that it was developing, according to Avi anyway. Despite multiple promises these panels never arrived. Red flag #6.

There were multiple other red flags. Like the time when Avi announced that Candela was going to list on the Canadian Stock Exchange. He then qualified this by saying that he would need to raise money through a share issue first. The big venture capital firms he told us he had closed never materialized and the $100,000 he raised no doubt went straight into his well oiled pocket.

His final lie was his promise of a listing of CLA on a large central exchange. That announcement was made on Friday and the listing was scheduled for the following Monday.

It was a cold grey day when I awoke on Monday at 5am. The first message I opened was from a community member who was asking why the CLA Telegram channel had restricted chat and their Twitter account was closed. Avi had also changed his Telegram name to ‘ABC’.

Within a few hours everyone was screaming rug pull!

Avi had gone to ground. Some speculated that he had run off to his newly built Mexican mansion with his ill gotten gains.

Within 24 hours Avi re-emerged. It was a hack he insisted. Why would he throw all his hard work away for a few dollars he complained. The listing was on schedule for next Monday he promised. Oh and for good measure, I was a total loser for doubting him.

Then he disappeared again and hasn’t been heard from since. Rug pull complete.

No doubt Avi walked away with a couple of million dollars from his scam. He is probably trying to enjoy his Christmas surrounded by Mexican hookers, cheap cocaine and Tequila with the sole purpose of taking his mind off the chaos he left behind. He is no doubt under the illusion that he got away with it. But he forgot one thing. He stole from Americans. The Feds have a low tolerance for such shenanigans. His time will come. Hiding in Mexico didn’t help El Chapo, it won’t help Avi Shane Verdugo...

According to a recent report, 73% of projects listed on PancakeSwap will turn out to be scams. What this sad story demonstrates is there are an abundance of believable and compelling stories circulating the cryptocurrency ecosystem. A minority will be real and from those real ones only a fraction will succeed. That is why it is important that when investing in this market you must take profits. Don’t HODL, like Avi and his merry band of supporters urged investors. When you hear the word ‘HODL’ remember, that is red flag #7. Sell!

defi,The Rug Pull - A True Story - The true story of a cryptocurrency rug pull,"**About your author: CryptoQuestion is an independent platform providing free resources for cryptocurrency investors. From an on-demand Q&amp;A service to online courses, from our weekly** [**Moonshot Monday**](https://cryptoquestion.tech/weekly-podcast/) **podcast to our weekly Staking and Farming Review. Visit us at** [**www.cryptoquestion.tech**](http://www.cryptoquestion.tech/)

We are all suckers for a good story.

The best stories are the ones that provide you with a lightbulb moment. I much prefer stories about how a business idea is going to solve a particular problem and leave me multiple times richer than the story from a girlfriend about her day at the office and how her training is going for her upcoming marathon. The latter is guaranteed to put me to sleep, the former will light a fire inside of me.

And so it was with Candela Coin.

Like many of us hunting for the next big thing in cryptocurrency we uncovered Candela Coin after reading a short post on a Reddit forum. It is the small hidden posts that usually reap the most lucrative rewards. This post wasn’t your normal spam you find on most Reddit crypto forums. It was more thought out and immediately captured our imagination.

‘A project which aims to cut out the big electricity corporations by allowing end users to share solar power generated from their own panels via micro grids. All powered by the Candela Coin. All this for a valuation of $100,000. The founder was also doxxed, always a good sign. Compared to its nearest competitor, Power Ledger with a market cap at the time of $100 million, Candela was looking like a diamond in the rough!’

Whilst we liked the look of Candela we realized execution was key to its success. It wouldn’t be cheap to roll this concept out to the masses. When we quizzed Candela’s founder Avi he told us he was independently wealthy from a previous venture and was able to finance this project from his own resources. Red flag #1.

In the space of a few months the price of CLA climbed steadily as more people discovered this project and bought into its story.

CLA was originally an ERC-20 token which as we all know is expensive to buy with extortionate gas fees. In order to overcome this objection Avi set up the same coin on BSC. One token was supposed to be a store of value and the other a utility token. Which one was which was never totally clear. It was always assumed that the proceeds from the sale of these new BSC tokens would go towards the project but no one asked the question and Avi didn’t dwell on the subject. Red flag #2.

When the NFT craze started Avi decided that he would launch a range of NFTs. That was quickly followed by his announcement that Candela would be entering the metaverse. What the hell these two initiatives had to do with Candela’s core business is anyone’s guess. Laser focus is essential to the success of any startup. Red flag #3.

Whilst all these developments were going on a few disgruntled CLA investors started to share private messages they had received from Avi and his merry band of angry helpers. It became very clear that Avi and co were in the habit of threatening and abusing anyone who questioned his decision making and the legitimacy of his project. Derogatory comments about investor’s mothers were just the tip of the iceberg. Red flag #4.

From these private messages it also became clear that Avi was holding tokens on behalf of investors and refusing to hand them back. A red flag right there. Red flag #5.

In order to attract bigger investments Avi launched a whale group. To qualify investors had to invest a minimum of one million tokens. In exchange for this investors would receive additional benefits including a Candela branded solar panel that it was developing, according to Avi anyway. Despite multiple promises these panels never arrived. Red flag #6.

There were multiple other red flags. Like the time when Avi announced that Candela was going to list on the Canadian Stock Exchange. He then qualified this by saying that he would need to raise money through a share issue first. The big venture capital firms he told us he had closed never materialized and the $100,000 he raised no doubt went straight into his well oiled pocket.

His final lie was his promise of a listing of CLA on a large central exchange. That announcement was made on Friday and the listing was scheduled for the following Monday.

It was a cold grey day when I awoke on Monday at 5am. The first message I opened was from a community member who was asking why the CLA Telegram channel had restricted chat and their Twitter account was closed. Avi had also changed his Telegram name to ‘ABC’.

Within a few hours everyone was screaming rug pull!

Avi had gone to ground. Some speculated that he had run off to his newly built Mexican mansion with his ill gotten gains.

Within 24 hours Avi re-emerged. It was a hack he insisted. Why would he throw all his hard work away for a few dollars he complained. The listing was on schedule for next Monday he promised. Oh and for good measure, I was a total loser for doubting him.

Then he disappeared again and hasn’t been heard from since. Rug pull complete.

No doubt Avi walked away with a couple of million dollars from his scam. He is probably trying to enjoy his Christmas surrounded by Mexican hookers, cheap cocaine and Tequila with the sole purpose of taking his mind off the chaos he left behind. He is no doubt under the illusion that he got away with it. But he forgot one thing. He stole from Americans. The Feds have a low tolerance for such shenanigans. His time will come. Hiding in Mexico didn’t help El Chapo, it won’t help Avi Shane Verdugo...

According to a recent report, 73% of projects listed on PancakeSwap will turn out to be scams. What this sad story demonstrates is there are an abundance of believable and compelling stories circulating the cryptocurrency ecosystem. A minority will be real and from those real ones only a fraction will succeed. That is why it is important that when investing in this market you must take profits. Don’t HODL, like Avi and his merry band of supporters urged investors. When you hear the word ‘HODL’ remember, that is red flag #7. Sell!

CryptoCurrency,"Why you should stake your coins, and why you shouldn’t do it on an exchange","Some coins are able to be ‘staked’. Typically, these are ‘proof of stake’ coins which, rather than processing transactions through computational ‘mining’, uses percentage of ownership to reach agreement on transactions.

The upshot is that you are able to earn rewards through owning coins, just like an interest rate. ‘Staking’ your coins puts them towards this consensus and rewards you - no expensive mining required!

The ‘interest rate’ earned for a coin can vary wildly, but the higher this rate the more crucial staking becomes, as if you are missing out, you could be, in effect, significantly eroding your investment.

Some exchanges make it easy to stake or ‘earn interest’ from your crypto. But this is often a false economy - exchanges will take a large cut of the rewards. Some coins, such as ATOM, will also award stakers in other ways - like free airdrops. Exchanges keep these all to themselves, of course.

Staking via an exchange can have advantages - sometimes giving you more flexibility, if perhaps you are only planning on keeping a coin for a short period. But get your coins off an exchange to maximise your rewards, and of course, ‘not your coins, not your crypto’!

TL;DR: Staking gives you freebies, but doing it on an exchange means you will miss out on a significant portion of these.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,IRA contribution strategy before transitioning to zero income,"I'm in an unusual financial situation and would like help checking my reasoning.

32 M in California, earning plenty now but dropping to essentially zero income starting in Nov. 2023. I'm wondering how I should fund my 401k &amp; IRA in 2022 &amp; 2023.

Here's what I'm thinking:

* Max out traditional 401k  
(no match, but still worth it so I can get taxed in a lower bracket later)
* Max out traditional IRA  
(even though it isn't eligible for immediate tax advantage since 401k is already maxed out)
* Then starting in 2024, slowly convert that traditional IRA to Roth  
(shouldn't cost much if I stay in the 10-12% federal bracket)

Is that a good plan? Does it depend on my existing IRAs (which I hear matters for conversion math), or is it a good plan regardless?",finance
personalfinance,Debt consolidation personal loan or pay off CC overtime? Appreciate any advice!,"Hi all, thank you in advance for any advice and suggestions.

For context, due to some major family circumstances I had to rely heavily on credit cards over the past few years. At the highest, I had \~$100k in credit card debt (consolidated across 6 credit cards). Over the past \~year I've been very diligent and have been able to bring this down to now **\~$42k** (consolidated across 3 credit cards).

* Chase $22k @ 15.99%
* Chase $8k @ 15.99%
* AmEx $12k @ 24%

I've thought about taking out a personal loan that has a lower interest rate that my CC but thinking about the pros / cons. Mainly, I'm trying to avoid a big hit on my credit score which I have worked hard to bring up overtime (650 back in 2018 to 730 today). Additionally, there is a chance I may need to apply for a mortgage in the next 1-2 years. I make a very good living (subject to NYC taxes) at $170k gross income. I'm in my mid 30's and hoping to get married / buy a house / etc. in the next few years so hoping for some financial baseline. 

Unfortunately, I'm not saving anything at the moment because I'm so focused on paying off this credit card debt and want to start fresh (have no other debt). If my plan goes smoothly, then I'm hoping to pay off the $42k over the next 9-10 months if I pay directly into my credit cards but I'm wondering if it's better to go the debt consolidation route and take out a personal loan?

*FYI, I applied for a Discover IT card a while back to try transfer balance but was only given a $2k credit limit...*

**TLDR, Decreased CC debt from $100k to $43k. Was planning to continue paying to cc directly but considering taking personal loan without impacting credit score materially and impacting ability to take out mortgage.**",finance

personalfinance,Cashing out a 401K check?,"Hello all, I need some help. I worked at a hospital for a little under a year as a rehab technician. Apparently I had a 401K with this hospital (I never looked at check stubs, just looked at the checking account amount- I also do not remember ever opting into a 401K plan but regardless we’re here now) &amp; they ended up sending me my check from it, with the federal withholdings tax already withdrawn. 

Gross amount was: $557
The amount I received on the check: $446

- I talked with my bank about cashing it. 1 person told me that if I cash it I’d get no penalties since they already took out the federal tax.
- Another person at the bank told me I *would* get penalized come tax season for cashing this check instead of investing it.  

So I have a couple questions: 

1. should I roll this over to an IRA?
OR
2. should I just cash this check &amp; start over with the 401K when I start my career in 3ish years? (post graduate school) 

3. would I get penalized for cashing the check come tax season? If so, how much?",finance

CryptoCurrency,"Banks should be ashamed of their ""high yield"" savings accounts","0.5% APY is not high yield and banks should stop saying it is. It is a fucking embarrassment to call an interest rate of 0.5% ""high yield"" when the inflation rate is at 7%. What's worse is that even the most trash low-level garbage Cryptocurrency you can think of offers 10 times more than that without questions.

And banks can fuck off telling people about the ""risk"" of saving money in Cryptocurrencies. At least there are stablecoins BACKED BY ACTUAL ASSETS and PUBLICLY traded exchanges [unlike banks who can literally give money out of thin air.](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/fractional-banking/)

Honestly, its tiring to see banks scamming people with ""high yield"" savings accounts. Remember, even with a ""high yield"" bank savings account with 0.5% APY, if you deposit $100k, you are getting $500 the first year,  $502 the next and so on. It's an absolute scam when considering an inflation of even fucking 2%, you are losing a compounding $2000 from the first year alone.

 It's even more stupid when you realize the figures I gave you don't exist anymore. You need a time machine for 2% inflation and you're going to be lucky to find an interest rate of even 0.2% unless you are Jeff Bezos himself.

TLDR: Even if you put a tenth of your savings staked in stablecoins, you'd still make more than if you put it in a bank. There's nothing special about  banks that should give them the authority to give such embarrassing interest rates with inflation rates so high.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Paying off credit card debt,"Good afternoon,

First off, thank you for anyone who takes time to read this post. I really appreciate what you all do on this sub and I think it is incredible helpful for people. Recently, I found that over a variety of credit cards my wife has racked up about 50k in credit card debt over the last several years. After the initial shock we began going to counseling with an emphasis on financial wellbeing which has been helpful to get over some of the trust issues that arose over this problem. I also have to admit that I bear some of the responsibility for our situation as I knew my wife was overspending and my coping mechanism was to just ignore the issue rather than be proactive and help her with her spending problems. We also have two small children (2 1/2 year old) and 5 month old which has made it difficult to fully delve into the issue as much as I would like. 

To start, I understand buckling down and cutting spending is a must. We have started to do this and are able to make somewhat significant gains in beginning to pay the cards down. The issue is that the interest rates are so high and with our current income and expenses I feel like we need to consider debt consolidation options. I really want to get this debt out from over our head and have a consolidated plan to take care of it as it is causing me extreme stress on a daily basis. I am going to list some of the options we are considering and I would love you opinion on if this is a viable way to just get this high interest debt taken care of and have a plan. I fully understand non of these options are ideal as well.

1) Roth IRA Withdrawal - We each have about 30k in our individual Roth IRA's. I am under the impression that I would be allowed to withdraw our personal contributions tax/penalty free. We are both in our early 30's and while not ideal, still have some time to build this back up before retirement. We are both public workers and this is separate from our government backed pensions. 

2) Home Equity Loan - Currently we owe about 220k on our home and its current value is 380k. A home equity loan would allow us to pay off our high interest credit card debt and consolidate that into a lower interest payment. 

3) Home Refinance Cash-Out - I don't fully understand how this option works - we just recently refinance about two years ago with a decent interest rate (2.99) and this seems like it would be a less than ideal option, especially if we were not able to lock in a interest rate comparable to our current rate.

I understand that the best thing to do would be buckle down, live well below our means, and pay it off over time. Unfortunately with two new children, child car, etc. it just seems insurmountable. I feel like I could just have one payment to focus on and not be so stressed about the massive interest associated with it I could get this debt taken care of in a timely manner. I am very ashamed to have to write this post, any help would be truly appreciated more than you know. Thank you.",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, December 28, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, December 28, 2021**

After four positive sessions and a new record high yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) took a breather with tech stocks cooling down  in a very choppy trading session. Market participants continue to weigh surging coronavirus cases throughout the world thanks to the highly contagious Omicron variant. 

**Notable Numbers:** 

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -0.08%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -0.46%
* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.29%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.61%
* Volatility Index (VIX): -0.79%
* Krispy Kreme (DNUT): +10.85%
* Allbirds (BIRD): -11.39%
* Lucid Motors (LCID): -4.3%

On Monday, global COVID-19 cases hit a daily record, with more than 1.44 million infections reported worldwide.  Infections from the highly-transmissible Omicron variant — found to spread 70 times faster than previous strains — comprised much of the newly tracked cases. 

[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/15/omicron-found-to-grow-70-times-faster-than-delta-in-bronchial-tissue](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/15/omicron-found-to-grow-70-times-faster-than-delta-in-bronchial-tissue)

However, it is very important to note that Omicron has so far been a lot less severe compared to coronavirus strains. three separate studies coming out of South Africa, England, and Scotland indicated that people infected with Omicron are somewhere between 50-80% less likely to be hospitalized when compared to previous coronavirus strains. 

[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/covid-omicron-delta-hospitalizations.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/covid-omicron-delta-hospitalizations.html)

For context, more than 69,000 Americans were hospitalized with Covid-19 on Christmas Eve, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services. This represents an increase of around 2% compared to last week. While unfortunate, the figure remains below peak hospitalizations during the Delta surge and is half of the record-high from January, despite infections surging more than 50% in the month of December

[https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-utilization](https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-utilization)

In light of Omicron’s lessened severity, the Center for Disease Control Prevention (CDC) eased guidelines for quarantining after exposure to Omicron, halving its recommended isolation time from 10 days down to 5 days. 

Data shows that the majority of coronavirus transmission ""occurs early in the course of illness,"" the CDC explained — generally in the one or two days before symptoms begin and two or three days after.

""Therefore, people who test positive should isolate for 5 days and, if asymptomatic at that time, they may leave isolation if they can continue to mask for 5 days to minimize the risk of infecting others,"" the CDC said in a statement.

[https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html)\\

The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index showed prices for homes in the US continue to moderate for the third straight month, though numbers remain very elevated. The index, which tracks average home prices in metropolitan areas posted a 19.1% annual gain in October, down from 19.7% from September. The 20-City Composite posted an 18.4% annual gain, down from 19.1% a month earlier. The 20-City results came in very close to analysts’ expectations of an 18.5% annual gain, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.

[https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-home-price-growth-slowed-in-october-11640700007](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-home-price-growth-slowed-in-october-11640700007)

The rest of the week is expected to be mostly quiet for investors, with trading volumes low and little economic data and earnings releases.

Looking ahead, the market will head into 2022 with  two key considerations to weigh: the course the pandemic takes and rising inflationary pressures and the Fed’s reaction to such pressures.

**Highlights** 

* U.S. President Joe Biden is considering Sarah Bloom Raskin to serve as vice chairwoman of supervision at the Federal Reserve, according to a Wall Street Journal Report.
* Fortinet (FTNT) a cybersecurity stock, was the best performing tech stock in the S&amp;P 500, rising roughly 150% year-to-date.
* A U.S. judge dismissed a lawsuit accusing Microsoft Corp's LinkedIn of inflating the number of people who watched video ads so the networking platform could overcharge hundreds of thousands of advertisers.
* US reality star Paris Hilton launches a new metaverse business, called “Paris World’, on Roblox (RBLX). While I’m a proponent of the metaverse, it’s not surprising to see people trying to cash in on the hype. 
* For the first time since 2016, the S&amp;P 500 is set to outperform the Nasdaq this year. As of yesterday’s close, the S&amp;P 500 is up roughly 28% this year compared to Nasdaq’s 23%. This underscores the rotation out of tech witnessed in 2021.
* Elon Musk is drawing anger from Chinese officials after the country submitted a complaint to the UN’s space agency alleging China’s space station Tiangong, which is currently being constructed in lower atmosphere, was forced to take evasive action to avoid collision with two SpaceX satellites
* The new Spiderman movie ‘No Way Home’ has absolutely demolished box office records this year, already grossing more than $1 billion since its Dec 17 theatrical release, selling more than double the tickets as the runner-up. I watched it… it was an amazing movie.

I recently was alerted of an application for lines of credit using my personal information. I was originally monitoring Experian (but only Experian, silly me) and went ahead and created accounts at the remaining 2 credit unions.

Lo and behold, there were 2 more attempts that I was not notified for that occurred yesterday. Thankfully, all of the applications were rejected, but they are all posted as hard inquiries counted against me and my credit score. I am getting a house built that I will be closing on in approximately 3 months, so I went ahead and filed disputes all of the unrecognized applications. Please note that my Experian account was already frozen prior to this (but again, only Experian, thinking it would freeze it everywhere)

Actions I've taken thus far:

* Froze my credit report at the remaining bureaus (TransUnion, Equifax, and the 4th smaller one that I can't remember atm)
* Placed a 1-year fraud alert on all of the credit bureaus
* Signed up through Discover for Identity Theft protection (monitors and alerts for all 3 credit bureaus)
* Called each company where the applications were filed, identified the applications in question, and had them marked as fraud
* Filed a dispute through each of the credit bureaus for the fraudulent applications
* Checked existing lines of credit for any fraudulent transactions

Is there anything else I need to do? I can't seem to file a report through [identitytheft.gov](https://identitytheft.gov) since no accounts were successfully opened, but I am incredibly terrified at the potential risk of my mortgage and new home coming up soon.

I should note my credit scores are still 790, 750, and 760, but I basically want to make it impossible for more hard inquiries to come about and keep 'dinging' me which will consequently affect my mortgage interest rate.

I realize those two communities rarely overlap, but for those of you with more expertise in the former community, I invite you to deep dive Vail Resorts and look at the slow burn which has been festering over the past few years in the skiing community, particularly in the West. Vail Resorts’ business plan has them buy local ski resorts across the country and adding the resorts to their “Epic Pass” collection - a season pass which allows the holder to ski at any Vail Resorts mountain at any time - then firing many of the well paid experienced employees including all of local management, HR, customer service and Finance folks - deferring all non-core mountain ops (ski patrol, lift operators, instructors) to their Broomfield, CO headquarter office staff. This coupled with Vail’s cutthroat approach towards employee benefits and customer relations has resulted in huge staffing shortages and absolutely atrocious guest experiences at several Vail resorts, notably at Stevens Pass (WA), Afton Alps (MN), and Park City (UT), as thousands of Epic Pass holders descend on these understaffed resorts this winter. The meltdown and shitshows are visible across the web, notably on r/stevenspass and @epicliftlines (on IG). Vail leadership clearly doesn’t care and continues to issue empty apologies with no corrective action. The new CEO Ms. Lynch clearly has her work cut out. At some point (soon I think) people are going to stop buying Epic passes and switch to Alterra properties (Ikon Pass), which have demonstrated they can provide a far superior guest experience even in the current Covid environment/labor market.

MTN appears to have few retail investors (96% institutional). I wonder if it’s time to make Vail the next meme stock.",finance
CryptoCurrency,How to avoid scams and invest safely!,"This are the top 5 investment schemes that people fall for:

&amp;nbsp;

• Advanced fee scheme: scammer tries to convince the victim to send money (to pay gas fees for example, or trade for you and make a profit) and claims he will repay you an enormous amount of money for your help. Spoiler alert: he isn't.

&amp;nbsp;

• Boiler room scam: using unfair or dishonest sales tactics. Someone sets up a fake company (usually trading company) and promises low fees/high interest rates. Once you have deposited you will never be able to retire your money, so only use trustworthy exchanges and store your crypto on a cold wallet.

&amp;nbsp;

• Fake Guru (investment seminar scum): self-proclaimed millionaires claim they have discovered the secret to get crazy rich crazy fast. They only want you to buy their course/seminar/textbook so they can make a buck. Once you fail with you own money they will tell you it was your fault and that you must have done something wrong when trading at 125x leverage or doing the high risk-high reward stuff they encourage. Think about it, if they really had an easy way to get rich, why sell it to you and not use it?
 
&amp;nbsp;

• Pump n' dump scheme: they are the most known. Usually organizated through chat rooms in telegram for example, this schemes target small market cap tokens/coins/shitcoins in order to move the price as demand rises exponentialy for a few minutes. They promise guaranteed returns as other people (bots, big investment firms etc) will jump into and buy when they see the price rises. In reality the organizers of the sheme have already bought a sizable amount of this coin and sell it to you once everyone involved raises the price. In a matter of minutes/seconds the price returns to normal and you lose most of your money.

&amp;nbsp;

• Ponzi scheme: finally the most referenced but least understood. They usually promise incredibly high returns ""guaranteed"" (really high APY). You feel the hype for this great opportunity and call friends, family or coworkers so they don't miss this opportunity. In reality, no value is being generated and investors are paid using money that they/other people have put into the project. Once this blows up, those that ""bought high"" or ""entered late"" are literally left with nothing. They might keep going as people keep joining but eventually the scheme runs out of money or cashes out. The pyramid scheme is a variation of the scheme in which you are paid more if you bring other people to the scheme.

personalfinance,Should I use my 27k for a down payment on a home or pay off my (interest free) student loans?,"USA for reference.

I graduated nursing school Spring 2020 and have been working ever since. My mom offered to let me live at home and sink my whole salary into my student loans from a previous degree, and I took her up on it. Last year I was able to pay off ~30k in debt from Sallie Mae, one loan had 9% interest and the other 3%. Now the only money I owe is on my interest free federal loans. I owe 28.5k. When I was paying off the Sallie Mae loans, I would just immediately transfer almost all of it every two weeks into that account, but since the federal government keeps pushing back the deadline, I’ve just been keeping the money in my account. I don’t have to make a payment until March, and it keeps getting pushed back with the pandemic, so who knows when I’ll actually be required. Currently I have 27k saved up. 
Here’s my question. My fiancé and I are ready to move in together. We have discussed the idea of buying a house. He has 9k saved and my mom has offered to give me 5k for a down payment, it’s possible his parents will do the same. We will be a dual income household with no children in the near future. Should I use my 27k for the down payment and take advantage of the interest free loans that keep getting pushed back or should I just go ahead and pay the loans off and be done with them?",finance

stocks,Do the bonds in BITO (And similar ETFs) offset the time decay of etfs that follow futures?,"So, as many of you know, BITO is an ETF that attempts to mirror the price of bitcoin using CME's bitcoin futures. I was looking into their holdings, and unsurprisingly they've begun averaging into the january contract, split about half and half. Now futures contracts are usually priced with interest rates included in further dated contracts, which means that the fund is bound to lose money over time. 

I've noticed that they carry bonds in the portfolio though and quite a significant amount too. I've also read some comments that said the fund won't actually follow the movements of bitcoin, so my question is, does these bonds actually offset the backwardation on bitcoin futures contracts, and if not, are there any scenarios that might cause BITO and other ETFs like it to deviate from the spot bitcoin price?",finance

personalfinance,Personal loan or private auto loan,"I’m looking to buy a used car to help with my commute to work. The price range of the cars I’m looking at are around 4k-6k. I will have a decent amount saved up to help but I’m trying to decide if I do a personal bank loan, or a private auto loan.

The issue with the private auto loan is the majority have a minimum of 5k, so I won’t really be able to make a down payment but I can use what I saved up for the monthly payments. The pro of the private auto loan is that interest rates ranges aren’t as broad so I have a better chance at securing a better rate.

Now with the personal loan, I can take a smaller amount out as compared to the private auto loan, so less debt. However the range of rates is higher and I could very well be stuck with an interest rate in the 15%+ range.

So which would be smarter, private auto loan or a personal loan?",finance

CryptoCurrency,The Ghost of Mt. Gox: Introduction,"*""This shit is convoluted as fuck""*

&amp;#x200B;

**Introduction**

This is part of hopefully of a 12 part series I've decided to do on the issues of centralized exchanges in the crypto space. Primarily focused on the issues of liquidity, transparency and  of course a large amount of dubious speculation around conspiracies.

The title "" The Ghost of Mt. Gox"" comes from a comment from a person who unfortunately deleted their account. For those that don't know [Mt. Gox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox) (Magic The Gathering Online Exchange) was at one point the biggest BTC exchange in the world. Handling nearly 70%+ of all BTC trades. It was founded in     Jed McCaleb who was one of the first \~2000  people in the world to start actively start talking and using BTC. Legend has it that McCaleb didn't know how to purchase BTC so he repurposed a Magic The Gathering card trading site he had built to facilitate the purchase. The truth is probably less entertaining but I like the idea that  a multi trillion dollar asset started its first exchange because a bunch of nerds wanted to change their Magic Cards for Magic internet money

However McCaleb didn't stay at Mt. Gox for Long. He eventually sold the exchange to a man who would go on to lose 850,000 BTC ( $42,5 Billion currently);  Mark Karpeles! McCaleb leaving to eventually create XRP and XLM.

Mark is a special man. From the time he attempted to make a bot to trade against his customers but ended up losing money. To renting the most expensive offices he could find in Japan while a hacker siphoned thousands of BTC from the Mt. Gox account. A running joke in some crypto circles is that Mt. Gox was run on cracked screen laptop with a faulty power supply. I'm in the belief that even if Mt. Gox was run on quantum computer, Mark would have found some way to fuck it up. Actually I'm in the belief that  Mark's actions or lack of action in handling the Mt. Gox crisis lead to the myth of the 4 year cycle

For you see it was the hack and the subsequent collapse of Mt. Gox that assured in the end of the first BTC bull run. If the farce of Mt. Gox hadn't occurred BTC may have continued its run with out pause. However we entered a bear market and the 2017/18 run while different ended in the same tragedy of  greed and hubris. A -85% crash that nearly 90% of the crypto industry never recovered from. However BTC and others such as ETH and ADA where rebirthed  like phoenixes powered by both  the Federal Reserve's and Tether's fiery printing.  With 38% of all USD printed in 2020/21 and nearly 94.57% USDT in existence printed in 2020/21. Hopefully this time will be different

The ghost of Mark's actions or if you like negligence; linger on with us not only  through the scars left by the hack. But through the path he opened. A path that is littered with shell companies, insolvency, greed, corruption, fraud and most importantly a fuck tone of money

Because while Mt.Gox collapsed and Mark suffered years of investigation. He may actually become a one of the richest people alive. A billionaire! However that is dependent on if the Mt. Gox coins are ever found and settlements to customers. He will join the ranks of the man who sold him Mt. Gox, McCaleb who became the 40th richest man on earth in 2020. In fact many of the people involved in Mt. Gox went on to become some of the richest people on earth. Their customers on the other hand are only paper millionaires waiting on the Japanese court system

This is the Ghost of Mt. Gox

A system that is built from the ground up to take advantage of the user and profit the operator. In the case of Mt. Gox its only saving grace was that Mark was comically inept. His schemes to trade against his customers and cover up his loses  foolish but not malicious . But what if some one or a group of people where just a little bit smarter than Mark

personalfinance,"“Gifted “ down payment, and optional contract for mortgage","Hey there! I had a question about being gifted money for a down payment. My partner is willing to “gift” me the down payment money, but we have an agreement that they will live for free with me in the house (which would be under my name only). Approximately $40k would be gifted, and $1700 would be removed from this balance for each month lived together. 

My partner (understandably) wants some assurance that they are not going to completely lost of the money should we go our separate ways. I agreed that if we decide to split up and move apart, I would repay the remaining balance over a 10year period at 3.5% interest rate. 

I realize this is not directly a “gift”, but for the sake of my mortgage, it would be. I offered to write up a contract after I close on the house, creating new debt after closing, rather than before which could throw off my mortgage. 

Is there a legal way to do this? Would writing up a legal contract and telling my mortgage lenders about it affect my approval/lending? 

And yes, I’m aware that there are many people that will disagree about getting that much money as a “gift”. For reference, my partner are in an extremely happy, healthy, mature relationship. We both make 6 figures a year, and I have no other debt to my name. I understand that giving me $40k is not the greatest financial investment for her, but she sees it as home security for a few years without any kind of rent payment, as well progression for both of us in our relationship. Also for reference, it is less than 10% of her liquid cash, and she has no debt.

Edit 1: As stated below, it’s completely fine if there’s not a way to legally do this and we don’t proceed. We’re just looking for information. We’re not going to push something down an illegal or wrong path, and we’re not desperate about moving forward with this. Just trying to learn is all :)

CryptoCurrency,"If I kept 10,000$ in savings in USD in 1975, how much depreciation will happen to it?","Taken from Investopedia but it doesn't answer my question:  


[Currency depreciation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currency-depreciation.asp), in the context of the U.S. dollar, refers to the decline in value of the dollar relative to another currency. For example, if one U.S. dollar can be exchanged for one Canadian dollar, the currencies are described as being at [parity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parityprice.asp). If the [exchange rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchangerate.asp) moves and one U.S. dollar can now be exchanged for 0.85 Canadian dollar, the U.S. dollar has lost value relative to its Canadian counterpart and has therefore depreciated against it.

A variety of economic factors can contribute to depreciating the U.S. dollar. These include monetary policy, rising prices or [inflation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp), demand for currency, [economic growth](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economicgrowth.asp), and export prices.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Defaulted Student Loans?,"Hello as the title states I have about 6.5k in default ATM and the only student loans I have. I can pay this in full and clear it up as I want to go back to school now that I am older and not a flakey young adult. The question remains however whether this is the best idea.

I see with a rehab plan I could get the default off my credit but I fear that I wont be able to get Assistance in time for the coming year as this can take up to 10 months. If I pay the loan in full from the default (It default start of the pandemic and has been frozen since). Will this clear the default from my credit report? Or would it be best to start the rehab plan and then just pay it in full?

Thank you in advanced for any advice or comments I have tried searching google for this but have not found any information.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: 

Part II

I guess I will add this here as well. I am considering taking out 9.8k a semester in Federal Direct Loans as I get enough to cover the semester and more via the Pell grant. The idea is that if I do this it wont accrue interest while I pursue higher education and will allow me to cover my child support and other costs and focus on school full time while being able to take care of my children. This may change soon and I may have them full time with no child support cost but I need to be able to have at least \~12k aside for this. (2 semesters would be about \~20k in loans.)

The field I am looking at is Aerospace and the mechanical engineering degree I get along the way will land me roles and positions that I will be able to afford this loan repayment and the ability to focus on my schooling without worrying about a full time job as well will set me ahead more than the loan will set me back. 

To clarify my defaulted loans are the result of me being young and trying to get through school on my own working full time while going full time. I got burnt out and they are the result of 2 semesters of this burnout. I will be doing it right this time and I wont be wasting my money. This is why I chose to wait to go back.",finance
personalfinance,2022 Financial Goal Advice Needed,"During 2021, I worked a side job where I took home around 18k in additional income. I used this for savings, spending, and debt payoff. 

In 2022, I would like to be more intentional with this income, and am seeking advice on what to use it on. I’d like to use the majority of it for one thing, rather than split between debt, saving and spending, as it made me feel like I wasn’t making any progress (admittedly I wasn’t making progress at times).

Here are my four considerations: 


1. Most of the projected 18k to savings

2. Pay off three debts totaling 13k with 0% interest 

3. Pay off a private student loan of 19k with a variable interest rate currently 5.2%

4. Pay off a large chunk of my car loan of 26k with an interest rate of 7.2%

35. In macro news that could affect all of crypto including Cardano, it looks like Evergrande (one of the largest real estate developers in the world) has finally formally defaulted on its debt obligations.

39. The heads of Circle, FTX, Bitfury, Paxos, Stellar Development Foundation, and Coinbase appeared before the House Financial Services Committee. As expected, the questions from some of the House Committee members belied a misplaced focus on things like terrorist financing while others understood the need to regulate crypto appropriately so that crypto innovation is not forced offshore. There was significant focus on stablecoins due to the President’s Working Group placing so much focus there. One representative also chose to focus heavily on the energy consumption of Bitcoin mentioning coal power plants coming back on line to fuel Bitcoin mining. The witnesses from the crypto industry seemed to focus on dispelling misconceptions and also pushing for a single crypto focused regulatory body as opposed to the fragmented regulation that is typical in Washington.

Wealthfront and Betterment at the time offered to do the conversion, and I went with Wealthfront.  I didn't want to put $6,000 in it, because I feared some tax mistake might be made.

I already have a federal work TSP account, which is now about $200,000.  This year I put in $15,010, so I figured with the $19,500 limit per year, I would put the rest into the Wealthfront Roth IRA.

I put in $3,522 into the Wealthfront Roth IRA account I made in 2020, a few days ago, and now I think I made a mistake.

I think I'm not allowed to add money to this Wealthfront Backdoor Roth IRA account, ever?

I am supposed to make a new Backdoor Roth IRA account, every year?

**Does that mean, if I did a backdoor Roth IRA for 10 years, I have 10 different Backdoor Roth IRA accounts?**

Which means, I should have opened a IRA, converted it to Roth IRA, pay taxes, with a new account each year?

stocks,"Realizing These 7 Trading Mistakes Saved Me Over $200,000 in Losses This Year","If you’ve recently started trading, you’re likely very disturbed by the recent pullbacks and volatility, especially among high-flying household tech stocks like Docusign, Roku, and Teladoc, which are down 45% from recent highs. Even more jarring was the complete crash of Chinese darlings Alibaba, Tencent, and JD.com due to concerns that the communist government in China would be, well, communistic. 

Institutional investors used fears of inflation and the latest COVID variant as a reason (excuse) to get out of positions they knew had been overbought. And all the stop losses got triggered thereafter, creating a snowball effect. This has restored some sanity to the market, though I’d argue many stocks are still overvalued.

 I’m going to lay out 7 mistakes everyone makes when investing below in the hope that it provides some guidance to those who need it. If you feel you don't need, just don't read it. Thanks.

**Expecting the Market to Rise in a Straight Line**  
 While this seems straightforward, many people believe the stock market only goes up and never down. This is not true. The market goes up 80% of the time BUT not all companies are taken on that ride and you should expect a 10% pullback every other year. 

Likewise, the number of smaller pullbacks of 5% have become more common over the past decades and now average around 5 per year. Keep in mind, these pullbacks represent the average of a bundle of 500 stocks, meaning some stocks are affected a lot more than 5% and others less than 5%.

**Not Picking An Entry Point**

These market pullbacks represent great buying opportunities, but should not be relied on as the entry points because in the moment investors don’t know if it’s a 5, 10, or 20% correction. Instead of trying to predict the future outcome of a pullback, I have a set list of companies I want to buy always ready to go with my target price.

Think of this list as your budget - you determine this entry price and you don’t budge from that target. If the stock drops to the price or below, it’s a buy, and you enter the trade. I may lose more money on the way further down but that’s OK, I got my entry price and need to have faith in the investment rebounding. I have gotten burned more times than I care to count by getting impatient and buying a stock above my target price only to watch in horror as it tumbles back down to the price I wanted to pay to begin with six months later.

Truth be told, this is more a game of patience and good technology. I set price alerts using Fidelity (always to my phone not email) and I try to ignore the FOMO as the stock rides up high quickly.

Being a successful investor is a lot like being on a diet at all times. I’m constantly hungry for more, wanting to jump in an enjoy decadent treats, and having to sacrifice my desires for better outcomes. If I’m not feeling the friction of personal restraint, I’m not investing, I’m just gambling.

**Setting Entry Prices Based on Graphs Only**

OK, so I need to set an entry point to avoid being the bag holder - how do I do that? There are many ways. The worst way IMHO is to look at a chart and pick a number based on where a stock has been previously aka a previous dip. Technical analysts will often point to support and resistance lines in graphs and talk  about whether or not a stock will hold its fall at a resistance point or break out through a previous resistance line. 

New support and resistance lines are forming all of the time because of the micro and macro environments. Said plainly, events cause these levels - they are not mystical levels that form on their own. People react to events and prices change. And many levels are created by people in support of their own thesis these lines exist, self-perpetuating their existence. Usually, they are formed around events. The events could be company news or it could be macro news about the inflationary environment, policy changes, or other world events. So it’s critical to track events and know what’s going on with the company and the world before going in. You can do this through the news or by using technology.

I use a software system to keep track of major company events and help me understand how they will impact the price movement. I haven’t found a more efficient way of doing that.

If you’ve taken account of events, the next thing to do is find a way to value the stock. There are many ways to do this and I plan on writing a post with more detail on that in the near future. For now, I’ll note a few simple ways to do this.

**Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E)** \- the P/E ratio gives an analysis of the stock’s price relative to its annual earnings or profit. The higher the P/E, the more expensive the stock. The easiest way to understand this is to think about your investment as the share price and the annual return on that investment as the earnings. If the P/E is 20, it would take you 20 years to recoup your investment in terms of the value of those earnings. This ignores a lot of things like inflation, free cash flow, the total assets of the company, company debt, and how fast the company is growing. But it’s a useful back of envelope way to give an idea about whether the investment may turn out well. If a stock has a P/E above 20, the company should be growing double digits annually, not be riddled with debt, and have competitive positioning so it doesn’t get crushed. If it’s trading over 60 P/E, it should be growing earnings and revenue triple digits to justify the valuation, or be in a position to dominate a market for many years to come.

Other valuations include the Price to Book ratio, the Price to Sales Ratio, and the Enterprise Value to EBIDTA. We’ll have to cover these in another post. For now, know they exist but you can use the P/E as a north star to guide your entry points and avoid overpaying for stocks. In an environment of low inflation, P/E matters less than it does than in an environment of higher inflation, where companies with less earnings and cash flow have to borrow more at higher interest rates to continue growing.

So set your entry price on a reasonable P/E ratio that is in line with the historical 5-year P/E of the company and its peers (Fidelity makes this readily available). If you buy a company with no earnings, it’s going to get crushed every time there’s an inflationary scare because in order to grow, that company has to borrow money or raise more money by selling more shares or debt, which dilutes the company’s value. Likewise, if their high growth stalls for even one quarter, the stock will go into free fall. So you need to monitor earnings results very closely if you own one of these stocks.

**Creating a Portfolio That is High Risk**

If I had a hundred dollars for each time someone asked my opinion about Nio, PlugPower, or Docusign, I’d be able to pay a full year’s college tuition. Yea, these stocks have done very well until now. But they are volatile stocks all based on the premise of future domination with little evidence to back that up today. Don’t get me wrong, I LOVE growth stocks. But they should compose a portion of a portfolio, not the whole pizza.

I allocate 20% of my portfolio to growth stocks and that’s pretty high, but I’m willing to lose over half of that for the longer term gains. I would never be 100% growth stocks as that is an easy way to experience immense pain as these stocks are likely to crash heavily as we’ve seen recently. And I buy and sell these stocks - I don’t hold them forever.

There are far better experts than I at creating the killer portfolio allocation, but my advice is to carve it up into stable dividend payers like Verizon, large cap leaders in tech like Apple, large cap healthcare companies (I like Anthem), large cap payments companies like Visa and Mastercard, strong value mid-cap companies like my favorite: Crocs, some consumer staples stocks that people need even when things are bad, some semi-conductors that aren’t overpriced, and companies leading in new industries that actually make money. 

**Buying At The Peak Price**

If you’ve ever bought at the peak, the following scenario should sound familiar: An event happens, the stock you’ve been hearing about all year, which is up 100%, rallies 13% today and another 15% the next day. Analysts up their price targets, the news is buzzing that the company is unstoppable, and days later the stock is up another 50%. You’ve heard about this company for a long time and have wanted to buy it but waited. Everyone you know owns it, brags about their gains, and it looks like it’s making another unstoppable, huge run. Not wanting to be left on the sidelines missing out again, you throw some money at the stock, buying at its peak. A week later, UBS calls the stock’s valuation detached from reality and lowers its price target, sending the stock down 15%. In the days that follow, it continues to sink, with analysts downgrading their estimates. Then they miss their earnings target, and the stock plummets further. You’re unsure what to do, so you do nothing and watch your losses pile up. You are the bag holder.

If the description above sounds uncomfortably familiar, don’t fret: you’re not alone. We’ve all been there. The only thing to do is to learn from the events and take the lesson that it’s very risky to buy at the peak, where a peak can be defined as the point at which everyone knows about it, is talking about it, and has already invested in it. If you come in after, you’re taking on more risk than the possible reward. So what should you do when you want to own that stock? Wait. Set a reasonable entry point and wait. You might have to wait 9 months. Women do this for children all the time while being wildly uncomfortable. You can handle not buying a stock for 9 months.

There is another way to play it that’s more complicated: you could pick a price that is a little above your entry point and sell a put. That gives someone else the right to sell the stock to you at that price and in return you collect the premium for the contract. If the stock you want is trading at 300 and the price you want to pay is 200, sell a $30 put at 230. If the stock never comes down, you make $30 a share, and you have profited from the stock. Congrats! If it does come down under 230 and the contract is exercised, you end up buying the stock at 230 but pocket a $30 premium, making your net purchase price 200 - just the price you wanted! Win win.

**Losing Faith &amp; Conviction**

After taking a beating on a stock or ten, it’s easy to lose faith in your abilities to make sound investments and even easier to lose conviction in your other stock purchases. It’s these moments where you need to remind yourself that the market goes up AND down and you will have many more years to make money (if you’re healthy) provided you learn from your mistakes and continue trying.

I write down everything I’ve learned in a list that I revisit time and time again. This list is now 30 points strong on what not to do based on 30 ways I’ve lost money. It’s now a list of how to make money in the stock market (and how to populate blog content).

If you write down what went wrong, you’re committing to lifelong learning and to be improving. If you don’t and opt to wallow in self-pity, you’re bound to not only repeat these mistakes, but you’re likely to sit out on future market rallies because you lack conviction. The best buying opportunities comes when market participants feel powerless and are willing to sell their stock at steep discounts.

“When there’s blood on the streets, buy property.”

**Not Having an Exit Plan**

How much money do you want to make on your investment? The answer can’t be infinity and I don’t know isn’t much better. Professional wealth managers aim for 6% a year, net of fees. The S&amp;P 500 returned an average of 7.5% over the past 20 years.

So what will I do if a stock I own goes up 300% in one year? I sell it and wait for an opportunity to buy it again when it comes back down to earth. Why? Because I’ve accomplished the returns I’m looking for. I sell it because I reached my exit price, even if that happens a lot faster than I thought it was going to because my goal is to make money not to own stocks.

Some stocks *are* long holds. Visa, Apple, Microsoft, Google - it’s ok not to have a lifetime price target on these. For others less established, I like to have a goal. I bought Lemonade stock at $44 for example. When I bought it pre-IPO, I thought it was a 10X stock over 10 years. In the first year, the stock skyrocketed to 175. It was too much too fast for the trajectory I was expecting so I sold some at 80 and the rest at 120. Making 2 x and 3x my money in one year reached my goal of 10X return over 10 years in terms of the annual return, so I was out. I also thought the valuation was not justified. Others agree, and the stock is back at $44 now. If I had bought and held, I would have achieved no profit. Instead, I grossed $50,000 on a $20,000 investment.

In case you’re curious, I do plan to buy Lemonade again IF they can prove they are able to gross more revenue per existing client. Right now they are paying too much for customer acquisition.

Just remember to take taxes into account when determining your profit targets. In my case, I held LMND for a year prior to selling, so I paid capital gains taxes not income tax rates.

Good luck.",finance

cardano,One more time... why Cardano REALLY doesn't need burning.,"Recently I've heard so many people going on and on about burning. Cryptoviser has been complaning about Cardano not burning coins almost daily in his YouTube videos. And I noticed that in his comments there is not a well formulated response for the position AGAINST burning. Charles has complained about it in his videos, but also not really gone into the arguments against it as far as I could find. So I tried to outline the arguments against burning ADA, and would be curious to see if you agree with my arguments and if you have anything to add. This is the comment I just posted under his video:

One last attempt to explain why Cardano REALLY doesn't need burning. So.. you are a fan of burning because the reduced supply will push up the price, right? I 100% agree. But it is not just about burning, but about the inflation rate, and the stock-to-flow ratio right? So if you design a coin with an insanely high inflation rate, and insane amounts of burning, but still having a high inflation rate, this burning would only 'look' good, but would not lead to a low supply, right? 

So... on Messari (not big fans of Cardano) you can check the inflation rates of crypto (all figures below taken from Messari.io). Cardano currently has an inflation rate of 2%, which is similar to Bitcoin at 1.8%, both reducing over time. In contrast, Solana has an inflation rate of 10%, Luna of 3,5%, Doge of 4%, Avalance 33%, Cosmos 6%, Algorand 22%... this is all INCLUDING BURNING. So Luna, even though they burn a TON, still has an inflation rate almost twice that of Cardano. Ethereum used to have a really high inflation rate too, but due to burning it is now very low (according to Messari 0,5%), but that depends on the number of transactions, so in a bear market this would probably be higher, same with Luna, in a bear market when the UST printer turns off, the inflation rate will be even higher than it is now. So... Cardano has great tokenomics, and doesn't need burning to reduce it's supply. These other coins DO. 

The ADA that is newly issued goes towards staking rewards and catalyst funding, both bring true value to the network. This is ultimately what it is about, a crypto can have high inflation in the start, but if it creates fundamental value with a lot of demand for it, that is not a problem. In addition, the value of a fixed monetary policy shouldn't be underestimated. The fact that Bitcoin hasn't changed it's monetary policy makes it reliable. Cardano shouldn't change it unless it is really needed and brings value to the network, not because other crypto's with insane inflation rates decided to start 'burning'. 

Lastly, the stock-to-flow is also something to dive in to, Bitcoin Cosmos 16.7, Avalanche 3, Bitcoin 56, Ethereum 184, Cardano 50, Solana 10, Luna 29,  Algorand 4.5. This is what the stock-to-flow model from Bitcoin was based on. Those projects that do a lot of burning like Ethereum and Luna may have an okay stock-to-flow now, but when the burning is reduced in the bear market, it will not be as good. Nevertheless, I do think Ethereum has solved it's problem through burning. And Cardano and Bitcoin never had a problem to begin with.

PS: If others have already outlined these arguments in other posts, I would also love to hear it!",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,We should create our own DAO and hire lobbyists in Washington,"It's well-known that big players have already entered the crypto ecosystem, and that some of them are trying to write the rules in their favor.

For example, the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz launched a huge lobbying effort this fall, supposedly to teach lawmakers about the wonders of crypto and DeFi. But they are doing this for themselves, not for the general good. Here's what an expert had to say to *The New York Times* :

&gt; “This is a pretty nakedly transparent attempt to benefit their bottom line.” -Lee Reiners, a former supervisor of systemically important financial institutions at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 

That got me thinking. If even major players like Andreessen Horowitz, which is an early investor in Coinbase and a lot of start-ups, can't speak for us... who will?

**The answer is pretty obvious : we should do it ourselves.**

Here's how it would work. We create our DAO via Alchemy, and then we use the money raise to hire a lobbying firm in Washington to meet lawmakers in our names. I think one of our first objective should be to eliminate tax laws that disadvantage cryptocurrency investors, but the decision would be left in the hands of the DAO community. If that first step goes well, we could push for other legislative changes.

It doesn't cost that much to hire a lobbyist, and I think a six-figure investment could yield great results. A six-figure investment isn't much for a sub with 4 millions members.

Obviously, I didn't think about all the details of such an operation. But I wanted to test the water here and see if this sub is interested in such an attempt. So, what do you think? Should we make history one more time?",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Roth IRA vs Student Loans - where to put lump sum vs small chunks,"Finally purchased a house, the down payment and closing costs ended up being far less than I had planned and saved for in this market. 

So now (after setting aside an emergency fund) I have enough left where I could put 6k into my Roth IRA right at the beginning of the year to max out and give it more time to grow. 

However, I still also have a small chunk of student loans left to pay off. The payments for the loans are still under the government forbearance, where I don't currently have to make payments and won't have interest added (so I have been investing my loan payment money since the loan became ""interest free"" during the pandemic). The amount I have left on the loan is slightly over $6k, but I'd still have enough to pay it off in full instead of the Roth (but not enough to do 100% for both). When I do need to make loan payments, they are only $100 min payments, but the interest rate on the loan is 6.8%.

So when the loan forbearance ends, would it be smarter for me to pay off the entire loan that has 6.8% interest, but not max out the Roth and just slowly add to it throughout the year and not reach the max 6k.

Or do I put my lump sum 6k into maxing out the Roth at the beginning of the year, make my minimum $100/mo loan payments (when the 6.8% interest comes back into play), and hope the market gives better than a 6.8% return next year?

I know the stock market is never a sure thing, but that time in the market is better than timing it. I would like to max my Roth, especially if interest isn't currently being applied to the loan, but I'm not sure when that will kick back in and 6.8% is still pretty high and within the general range people expect for market returns.


Or if there is some combination of these options I should do or anything I'm not thinking of. I appreciate any advice! Just trying to be as smart as possible with my money and not kick myself later.

Bitcoin,Will Bitcoin work for lenders and borrowers in an economy?,"Remember, the action of lending money at interest is *necessary* in an economy because it allocates capital from those who don't immediately need it (savers, retirees, etc.) to those who do (entrepreneurs, business startups, etc.). So the (potential) issue for Bitcoin in this regard, is whether it can be used for such a purpose, given that it's scarcity continues to *increase* as time goes on.

So, the increasing scarcity presents a unique challenge in the lending space for Bitcoin, because borrowers will almost certainly have *more and more trouble* paying back their loans, as time goes on. Which actually makes it difficult for lenders to lend Bitcoin, as the risk of not being paid back is so great and there is no possible backstop for the loans. Any posted collateral may not be sufficient in time. So how do you structure a loan in such a currency? Could there ever be mortgage loans in Bitcoin? Awfully hard to lend someone Bitcoin for 30 years, god knows how much that loan will be worth at maturity and remember - the debtor must continue making payments through thick and thin, all the ups and downs.

How to mitigate counterparty risk with Bitcoin loans? Hard to do. So...compensate with a high interest rate? Then the borrower will *really* have trouble making the repayment! It's hard to structure it in a way that works, if you think about it. Now maybe that will change with universal adoption of Bitcoin and a more stable value/less volatility, but there will always be the issue of increasing scarcity, which makes loan repayment so challenging.",cryptocurrency

investing,Fundamental Valuation Models of Ethereum,"**Too Long; Didn't Read**

Ether, the token of the Ethereum network is a yielding asset. We can calculate an intrinsic value for the ETH token using traditional finance valuation models. 

You can find these in the following [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_r4DVzqWgoP7k0y-YXVdyKfEtpTaY-F6f5s9lc7sBNE/edit?usp=sharing). This spreadsheet is read-only and won't be edited to meet the rules of /r/investing, is provided as is.

Hope you enjoy the analysis and motivates an interesting discussion.

**Introduction**

The cryptocurrency asset space is largely misunderstood by the market resulting in significant inefficiencies in its valuation. From wild speculative valuations in tokens with no specific purpose, to some very significant undervaluations in others. I think the best way to help the market find the fair value of each asset is by building valuation models that root the value of the token in its fundamentals. The expectation is that armed with better models, market inefficiencies will diminish with time.

**Intended Readership**

This post can be beneficial to those well-versed in traditional finance and fundamental valuation models that do not understand what cryptocurrencies are and see them as shiny magical tokens with no intrinsic value.

On the opposite end of the spectrum it can be beneficial to those well-versed in cryptocurrencies; what they are, their use and purpose and understand their utility. But are not necessarily familiar with financial valuation models.

The large decoupling between these groups of people is probably cause of the severe mispricings occurring in the space. Hopefully this post and the valuation models provided can help bridge the gap between the two.

**Understanding Ethereum**

Ethereum is a settlement layer capable of executing smart contracts (small programs), in this regard you could consider it as not too dissimilar in functionality to a payment processor (e.g., Visa, Mastercard, Square...) that is also able to host and execute applications, like a Decentralized App Store. This settlement layer is highly decentralized and secure because it relies on thousands of independent nodes validating all the transactions executed on the network; there is no downtime, the network is censorship resistant, and is not owned by any individual or organization. This is the value proposition of the network, not every use case benefits from these properties but for those that do Ethereum is the leading platform.

**Ethereum Monetary Policy**

To pay for the security and decentralization the network pays its validators, remunerating them for their work. Additionally, this remuneration serves as an incentive for anyone to join the validation effort, increasing the security and decentralization of the network. This remuneration has 2 sources; newly minted tokens and transaction fees paid by the users of the network. I´m going to provide analogies rooted in traditional finance to help illustrate the parallelisms.

- Newly minted tokens are not too dissimilar to the issuance of new stock. When a company emits new stock existing shareholders dilute themselves (they have a smaller share of the company) and the newly created shares are given as remuneration to a subset of them, for example to employees as part of a stock based compensation program. It´s important to understand that creation of new tokens does not create value out of thin air, as it´s self-diluting. Instead, there is a transfer of value from all token-holders to the validators that receive those newly minted tokens.

- Transaction fees paid by the users of the network can be compared in this analogy to the revenues. When a user wants to settle a transaction on the network it pays for its use. The more transactions and the more valuable the fees of those transactions the more revenue collected by the network. A traditional finance person should immediately understand that if there are cash flows entering the system you can use those to create a valuation model. The throughput of the network is an scarce resource so the price paid for transactions is subject to demand and supply dynamics.

The revenue of the network (i.e. the transactions fees) is used in one part (around 20%) to remunerate the validators and the rest (around 80%) to reduce the token supply. These percentages are not fixed by the protocol but are instead a result of demand for the available transaction throughput, the values here quoted are the currently observed proportion. The token supply reduction operates in a way not too dissimilar to a stock buyback program, where income of a company is used to reduce the circulating supply of shares. This token supply reduction is commonly  nicknamed ""burning"".

**Monetary Model**

The network generates revenues. These revenues are used to pay validators for their work and reduce token supply. At the same time the network issues new tokens, that are used as another source of remuneration for the validators. The interplay between the token supply reduction through burning and the token issuance determines if the token supply is deflationary (net token destruction), inflationary (net token creation) or flat (no net change). Thus Ethereum's monetary policy is defined programmatically but is also adaptative to the market, if the price of Ether falls too low for its given revenues it will enter a strong deflationary regime to self-correct the situation. This gives Ethereum a very strong monetary policy (arguably stronger than Bitcoin) and consolidates the token as a store of value as it can be used to calculate a long-term lower bound price of the token. You can see this in detail in the Monetary Model tab.

**Yield Model**

With the introduction of a burn mechanism Ether became a yielding asset, the burn mechanism results in an effective yield for all token-holders in much the same way a buyback results in shareholder yield for shareholders. Ether becoming a yielding asset will be cemented even further with the transition to Proof of Stake (a.k.a. ""the merge""). With it, token-holders can become validators of the network and receive also the fee revenue (the other 20% of the network revenues). 

Yield opens up an entirely new price discovery mechanism. Without yield, the price of a token is purely based in supply and demand (this is the current situation for most cryptocurrencies). We may know the supply ahead of time, as it's defined algorithmically, but demand is fickle and changes on a whim. This results in a lot of volatility, particularly with low market capitalizations and small circulating supplies.

But yield gives us a comparable across asset classes. All else being equal, money tends to flow to higher yielding assets to extract that yield, in doing so the price of the underlying asset increases reducing the yield. This causes assets to converge relatively quickly to a yield comparable to the rest of asset-classes given certain measure of risk (e.g., volatility, total loss of capital, etc...) and expected growth. If the price of Ether becomes too low for a given value of the network fees, it will result in a very large yield and investors will flock to it to obtain the yield. This allows us to build a yield based valuation model. You can find said model in the Yield Model tab.

**DCF Model**

Discounted Cash Flow models are the gold standard of valuation. In a Discounted Cash Flow model the intrinsic value of an asset is computed taking into account the future cash flows it will generate and to which the stakeholder is entitled.

The idea is very simple, if an asset generates cash flows the value of the asset should be that of all the future cash flows it will generate. At the same time, receiving a large lump-sum very far in the future should be worth less than receiving it today as there is a time value of money. Money today can be invested and receive with it certain rate of return, so we should discount the future cash flows to take into account the time value of money.

We can do this with Ethereum and calculate its intrinsic value. DCF models are particularly sensitive to our assumption of the expected future cash flows and the discount rate so they will be more accurate the better you can forecast them. You can find this model and some base assumptions in the DCF Model tab.

**Why 3 models?**

In truth, there should only be one model, the one that correctly predicts the intrinsic value of the network. And this model is, in fact, the DCF model. The problem is that correctly forecasting the future cash flows and having a proper estimation of the discount rate is very difficult which makes DCF models quite prone to the garbage in/garbage out phenomenon, where poor assumptions lead to poor predictions of the model. Because of this we can benefit from 2 models that are very simple in comparison:

- The Monetary Model gives us a very good long-term lower bound of the token value. As the network will execute its monetary policy in a way that leads to this price acting as a lower bound long-term. Since the price set by the Monetary Model must hold true in the long-term we can use this price as the terminal value of the DCF.
- The Yield Model gives us a very good short-term view of the token value. As this yield can be obtained today, giving the market a powerful mechanism to quickly reflect the price that results in a yield comparable to the rest of asset classes (given certain measure of risk). If you set the discount rate to your expected yield you can view the Yield Model as the first-order expansion of the DCF model.

So the two models are simplified version of the DCF for two different regimes: long-term (Monetary Model) and short-term (Yield Model).",finance

Stocks ended the day mostly flat in a pretty uneventful day as the stock market took a breather from the four-day Santa Claus rally that saw the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) gain roughly 4% in just over a week. With no new economic data being released this week and the year coming to a close, volume in the market has dried up, with volume in SPY coming in at roughly 50% average volume. I expect the market to be mostly flat for the rest of the week then pick up once again in 2022.

On Monday, global COVID-19 cases hit a daily record, with more than 1.44 million infections reported worldwide.  Infections from the highly-transmissible Omicron variant — found to spread 70 times faster than previous strains — comprised much of the newly tracked cases. 

[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/15/omicron-found-to-grow-70-times-faster-than-delta-in-bronchial-tissue](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/15/omicron-found-to-grow-70-times-faster-than-delta-in-bronchial-tissue)

However, it is very important to note that Omicron has so far been a lot less severe compared to coronavirus strains. three separate studies coming out of South Africa, England, and Scotland indicated that people infected with Omicron are somewhere between 50-80% less likely to be hospitalized when compared to previous coronavirus strains. 

[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/covid-omicron-delta-hospitalizations.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/covid-omicron-delta-hospitalizations.html)

, the Center for Disease Control Prevention (CDC) eased guidelines for quarantining after exposure to Omicron, halving its recommended isolation time from 10 days down to 5 days. 

Data shows that the majority of coronavirus transmission ""occurs early in the course of illness,"" the CDC explained — generally in the one or two days before symptoms begin and two or three days after.

""Therefore, people who test positive should isolate for 5 days and, if asymptomatic at that time, they may leave isolation if they can continue to mask for 5 days to minimize the risk of infecting others,"" the CDC said in a statement.

CryptoCurrency,The argument against Bitcoin in 2022.,"Normally, I *hate* the use of an ATH to factor performance. But this is more about flexibility than striving for a new ATH. Usually, I would think that provides a lot of growth potential. But in reality, hitting an ATH takes time. And there's history to show it. This year, there were multiple ATH's set, lost, and regained.

But want I want to look at specifically is BTC's patterns between ATHs. These are the charts from 2021.

It's important to recognize the drop percentage in the last chart is the drop to the bottom that occurred on Dec 3rd. We're currently down from the last ATH by about 31%.

So, with these charts to examine, there are some *really* interesting patterns to account for. And this is what is leading me to look towards other coins instead of BTC for 2022.

First, out of all price movements throughout 2021, every ATH recovery occurred within the span of a month (31 days) except for one - our summer of despair (April - October). The rebuild throughout was important - but it took a *long* time. We're currently in the second occurrence like this. We're 49 days off ATH putting us well outside of the pattern of one month ATH recovery. 

Second, every recovery period between ATHs shows the bottom occurring around the same time during the recovery period. The bottom out date relative to the period entire period is strikingly similar.  The chart below shows the approximate timing of the bottom throughout each ATH period.

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|Total Period|Bottom Out|Bottom Out Period %|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Jan 8 - Feb 8.  |31 days|Day 13|42%|
|Feb 21 - Mar 13 |19 days|Day 6|32%|
|Mar 13 - Apr 13 |30 days|Day 11|37%|
|Apr 14 - Oct 20 |189 days|Day 69|37%|
|Oct 20 - Nov 8 |19 days|Day 8|42%|
|Nov 10 - Present |?|Day 23|?|

That's... crazy. Like, really crazy. Every single bottom in between ATHs in 2021 occurred between 32-42% of the way back to the ATH. The average of bottom out period is 38% of the way through the recovery.

So, if we apply that to our current model and *assume* that the bottom has already occurred (the dip to $42k on Dec. 3rd) - it gets interesting. That would make the current trend look as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

|Date|Total Period|Bottom Out|Bottom Out Period %|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Nov 10 - Present |**61 days**|Day 23|*38%*|

So what does that mean? If this recovery looks *anything* like *every single other recovery this year*, BTC can potentially reach it's previous ATH around January 10th, 2022. Which... is looking... kind of crazy. If we compare it to the long recovery in the middle of the year, it looks even weirder.

Currently, if the model is close to accurate, we are approximately 80% through the expected ATH recovery, If we look at the long recovery, 80% of the way would be about September 12th. At that point, the price was *down* *31% from it's starting ATH* \- and *up 61% from the bottom*.

For us today, at 80% through this model recovery, *our price is down 32% from it's starting ATH* \- and *only up 12% from the bottom*.  So our recovery is clearly *much slower*. And to hit anywhere near the model's expected recovery date - there would have to be major price action. Which isn't impossible - but looks slightly unlikely due to the year's coming hurdles.

So, it suggests one or more things. One, that the bottom of $42k wasn't actually the bottom. This - I don't believe. I think there are more than enough incentives for whales to maintain $42k at this point and after the events of the last few months. Two, that the recovery model is wrong. This - I don't believe. Patterns are patterns until they aren't. If this one breaks the model but the next one returns to it - the model isn't necessarily wrong, but there are anomalies like with every kind of TA. Three, that this is one of those anomalies. This - I believe.

I think there are more than enough outside factors to influence the recovery period at present time. With the trading behaviors in massive 100x leverage being restricted, the massive influx of institutional money into crypto *companies*, the growing battle of *countries taking sides in crypto*, the FED tapering bonds and raising interest rates, the current and coming launches of major layer2 DeFi protocols, the exploding NFT marketplace, the emerging P2E gaming sectors, and more... there are so many variables involved that simply didn't exist even... last year. 

There's not a whole lot of institutional interest in *pumping* Bitcoin for increased value - while at the same time there isn't a whole lot of interest in *dumping* it below current levels. This suggests a lot of... crabbing. And I think this is part of the natural evolution of the crypto markets and Bitcoin specifically.

So, I think there are a few important things to take out of all of this.

1. We've already seen incredible economic volatility and disruption because of the pandemic. Crypto has weathered it well.
2. The most influential outside aspects to 2022 will be the FED tapering bonds purchasing to zero and raising interest rates - most likely to settle around .9%. This is going to impact crypto - but no nearly on the level the pandemic has. And it shows no justifiable reason to abandon it's trajectory from the last few years.
3. Crypto is macro driven by institutional investors - and micro driven by retailers. The major issue is on-risk assets being tapered when interest rates rise. And they most likely will. But that too, will also be relative to the risk assessment. Crypto functions on faith - just like every other investment. And the faith in crypto has grown massively in the last few years.
4. Institutional investment in crypto evolved from security investments (parking cash) to include technical investments (staking crypto development companies). This put an extra responsibility on the institutions that have done so - and the pattern hasn't slowed. VCs and Pools are pouring money into crypto companies - almost all of which have an interest in maintaining their respective coin/token/operations. Search Google News for crypto company investments and it's flooded with announcements day after day.
5. The bear rejection for BTC at $42k at the beginning of December was a solid message. It didn't hit a support level - it was the fucking Rohirrim whooping bear ass. So much so, for the rest of the month, the bears couldn't break $45k after *numerous* attempts.

With all that being said - I don't expect 2022 to dip much further than we already have. Even if we did drop below $45k, there's no long-term interest in now further embedded institutions pulling support from their own investment projects - as the crypto holdings are no longer such high-risk assets to keep on the books.

And finally, the pièce de résistance. Bitcoin's lost dominance.

&amp;#x200B;

[BTC Dominance YTD](https://preview.redd.it/tskwo7wipj881.png?width=1834&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b10ef2077916d471741f92082b1f20fc433acd1e)

Through the entire year, Bitcoin has steadily lost it's dominance in the crypto markets. HOWEVER, the comes with a gigantic caveat. That dominance has been essentially held at 40% since the drop in May. It bounced back up over the summer, dipped again in September, bounced back up, and dipped back to 40% where we are currently.

Now, here's the COOOOOOOOOL part.

&amp;#x200B;

[WHAT THE FUCK](https://preview.redd.it/rn98n4y8qj881.png?width=1834&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e676249db1f214347ad8bcdb4cf308791e7aa6ea)

It happened! Like a Christmas miracle or something, BTC dominance dropped below it's held line from May. And we've been dancing on it for the last four days now. We haven't seen this since 2018, and things back then were *entirely different than they are today*. New markets, new rules, new money. There is no reason to believe BTC will suddenly spark dominance back to 70%+ again. The technology and use cases of crypto today simply prevent that from being possible.

So - does BTC manage to creep back towards 50% dominance? Doubtful. BTC's major use for macro investors is as a secure investment. But the coming year is going to limit on-risk assets. BTC itself isn't tied to any major crypto tech or coming public uses. It's becoming a pseudo-onramp for crypto in general. But the alt coins... oh... the alt coins... 

That's where the institutional investments went. Not the security holdings (that's what they've been selling) - the actual futures investments into buying shares of crypto companies. The hundreds of billions of dollars that have been invested into the alt projects. 

So, what I'm looking for are projects that are exceeding bitcoin's performance since May (our last break to 40% dominance). And now, with our hovering around it longer than ever, call it what ever you want - but the flippening is happening in real time. And it has been for a while now. The thing is - if the project couldn't succeed between May and now, how can I expect it to rebound from prior to May?? 

So, I compared the performance of some of the more popular alt projects against BTC since May 18th to see performance during BTC rise and falls. And the results are interesting to say the least. Are you ready?? MORE CHARTS!!!

Bitcoin is up 9.26% since May 18th. So that's my par. I opted to run it against a bunch of coins/tokens including ETH, SOL, ADA, LUNA, DOT, AVAX, DOGE, SHIB, MATIC, ALGO, LINK, ATOM, FTM, LRC, ONE, CRV, and ANKR. All top 100 MC projects - many of which are mentioned quite a bit in this sub.

The highest performing against BTC is LUNA. The lowest performing is DOGE. The really cool part is seeing how Doge clearly has been lagging behind BTC while LUNA took the hit and exploded in August.

&amp;#x200B;

So, we put it altogether and what do we get... ???

Well, let's take a look. LUNA, LRC, FTM, SOL, and AVAX are charging along like crazy. I don't put much stock in the meme market - but if you're looking, SHIB is keeping it's hold, but it has been lacking beyond the other outperforming coins/tokens.

The Normies are are fairing about the same. Though, CRV, ONE, and ATOM are showing some slight potential.

But holy shit the Stinkers.

DOGE is dead. LINK is on life support. DOT?!? ANKR?? I'm not surprised to see ADA down and falling, but even seeing MATIC lower than BTC since May is showing me that MATIC's return to hype levels may be approaching the peak of it's *large* growth potential in the coming 6-12 months. 

Take this for what you will - but I'm giving strong consideration to consolidating into LUNA, FTM, and possibly one other project for the coming months. I think the history shows clear potential, the door is being held open by BTC, and the power of these projects against a falling BTC is incredibly impressive. The resilience during mad BTC swings is showing me that they can whether the coming 2022 better than most of these other projects.

Obligatory NFA - and wish everyone the best. I hope this helps at least one person figure out what they want to do - whether it be along with this concept or otherwise. 

P.S. Obligatory - hate on TA all you want, there's a reason Wall Street uses charts and not magic 8 balls.

I am in one higher tax bracket (I’m at the very bottom end of mine) but we noticed one LARGE difference in our paychecks: I am paying federal withholding tax and they are not. I pay about $500/ paycheck to this and they pay none. Who is in the wrong here, and how do we get this corrected? I know Texas done not have income tax… is this what I am paying?

Also, on our recent tax returns they received significantly more than me, despite me making way more and trying to apply 5k in loses I had from stocks to my tax return (did not work). Any help here is appreciated as well for specialized help. 

TLDR: partner who makes 40k less/year takes home more per paycheck because they don’t pay federal withholding tax and I do.",finance
CryptoCurrency,New to crypto or looking to start your journey? Then you should be informed about some common misconceptions about cryptocurrencies.,"Are you new to cryptocurrencies or is looking to start your crypto journey? Hearing a lot of bad things from crypto? This should kickstart you and raise your opinion on cryptocurrency.

I listed some things that always pop up whenever I mention crypto to my non-crypto friends. And no, I haven't forced anyone so far, I never really start any crypto preachings. If they ask me, then that's the only time I talk about crypto, them asking me shows their interest in the scene.

Well to be honest, even people who are already years now in this scene are still informed wrongly regarding some of these points. I've had some crypto talks with friends who are invested in it as well during some drinking sessions and you'll be surprised how different lots of people look at crypto, even the well-informed ones.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Cryptocurrency is illegal**.No it's not. Yo won't be taken by police nor judge by federal law for owning crypto, or for using crypto in transactions. Well bitcoin started as a currency to purchase illegal things and used in the dark web for some more weird stuff. It's only deemed bad stuff by the government because it is hard to regulate, and is a threat to the current norms in place, that is letting them stay in power - money.
* **Cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous and untraceable**.Yes, but not entirely. Bitcoin is known to be used to buy illegal things and other stuff in the deep web, because of its untraceability. But wallet addresses are forever publicly accessible in the blockchain as well as the transaction between wallets. It is as transparent as you can get, even more transparent than what we have right now with banks and other payment entities. It's only anonymous because wallet(addresses) doesn't necessarily need to be associated with the user. Then again, KYCs are in place in most of crypto-focused and crypto-enabled services now. Wallet addresses are now associated with verified people, still not publicly though, but you are traceable.
* **Cryptocurrency has no intrinsic value**.Yes, but no, and so is US Dollars. How much money can be printed and in circulation used to be tethered to how much gold the country owns, but not anymore, a country can potentially mint money out of thin air anytime they want. It is said that it is a global vote of confidence on what the value of the fiat is against tangible commodities, but what actually is stopping them? Most cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin actually resembles precious metals and other trading commodities that have global intrinsic value - more than fiat money, crypto has a limited supply and a defined production rate, and the production is transparent in the blockchain. Given that, crypto is easily transferrable as well, more than trading commodities, it takes a click away!
* **Crypto is a waste and bad for the environment**.Well this isn't entirely false, since crypto required computing power, it is unavoidable to leave carbon footprints and consume energy. The huge consumption of energy is only attributed to the old and inefficient hardware that was used since they are pretty cheap and readily available, modern hardwares now are more energy-efficient than the past. Unpopular opinion, China didn't entirely do bad for culling down almost half of the mining industry. We all know that miners will keep coming back, but at least they're gonna use modern hardware now!Going back, what doesn't consume energy these days? Cryptocurrency is being used worldwide for various activities now aside from being a payment option. If people are actually concerned about the environment then there are certainly other areas to cut energy consumption cost, entertainment for instance. There are a lot of apps now (which requires a lot of computing power to maintain) such as instagram, wechat, snapchat, tiktok, and other stuff that literally has no use aside from entertainment. I'm not saying that entertainment is not important, it certainly helps keep people sane as do I, but there too much services catering to it. Now that's a waste.
* **Cryptocurrency is a bubble and will eventually pop**.Well this has been a debate for a decade now, and it will certainly never run out of doubters. Crypto may pop, but in a sense that it will be less volatile from mass adoption, but it definitely is here to stay. Cryptocurrency is an innovation on par with the internet, educate yourselves and embrace it.
* **Cryptocurrency is speculative**.While a part of the whole scene is still speculative, it now has real world applications and is innovating day by day. Lots of projects are popping up, with solutions to real world problems. Processing daily transactions amounting to billions of dollars a day, from people worldwide. Services that are being used by people around the globe.
* **Cryptocurrency is a scam**.Crypto is not and never will ever be a scam. These crypto scams are attributed to human stupidity and greediness. Period. I don't know why people keep on yapping about crypto being a scam when there are millions of people getting scammed over other supposed investment as well - stock scams, bonds, etc. Mostly these scammers are people posing as brokers or traders promising multiple returns of their investments from investing in bitcoin. We also have shitcoins, but that is a tale for another day.
* **Cryptocurrency is for criminals**.While it most certainly is true that in the past, bitcoin was primarily used for those kinds of transaction. Tons of research now shows that a lot of people are now using crypto for normal day to day transactions, and now with KYCs in place it is not easier to track transactions. Crypto is still being used for illegal and illicit activities true, since wallets doesn't require to be mapped to a person's identity but it certainl dwindled down now. And does it really matter though?
* **Crypto is easy money**.While it technically is, being a lose-all scheme can be said as well. There are certainly investors who got rich overnight, but that also took extreme levels of luck. You still need to do a lot of research, but it still may not be enough to be certain about your success.
* **Cryptocurrencies is trying to replace fiats**. Contrary to popular belief it is not trying to replace the money system we have in place. Bitcoin proposes a payment alternative that allows 2 entities to digitally and securely transact without the help of a third party. That really should speak worlds. In fact the payment processing we have right now is still a little faster than blockchain transactions and more cheaper (ehem ETH). Then again, we have a lot of choices to choose from, you just need to do a little of research. Most people use XLM to transfer value accross wallet/exchanges. I use algo as an alternative, thanks to a fellow redditor who suggested Algo for its fast and cheap transactions, when I can't use transfer XLM out of my exchange, because Binance said no.


Edit: Since a lot of people are pointing out ripple's xrp for anonymity, yes the sender is anonymous as far as I know. Hence, it being considered as one of the criminal-friendly crypto.",cryptocurrency

solar,"Installing panels on a low-pitched, nearly flat roof -- do I need new roofing?","Site evaluation was done. My home is a cape-style w/ a large dormer on one side.

One of my roof is pitched at 7 degrees, which in their words, is relatively flat. The roofing material is a single layer of shingles that is roughly 9 years old. The roof is otherwise in great shape.

Per the installer, they suggested removing the layer of shingles and replacing it with a different roofing material, which they called ""Liberty 2-ply."" Their reasoning for this approach is because there is a high risk of water damage. In situations of snow or rain, water can collect and pool on that side of the roof leading to an increased risk of water penetration. They explained that the panels itself and cause a capillary effect and draw the fluid up the low slope making it even harder for the water to drain down.

Their suggestion is to replace the shingles with the 2-ply roofing material along w/ some underlayment and they can install the panels over it. Comestics is not a big issue since I can't even see that roof. They are quoting me a little less than $6k for this roof job (and they also mentioned that I can get 26% back through the federal incentive rebates). If I elect to not proceed, I would need to sign a waiver indicating that I have been informed of the high risk for leaks if I move forward with the solar install.

CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin and Ethereum are both going to be extremely scarce in the future. Fiat isn't. Secure your future while you can.,"It currently takes the Fed only about 15.4 cents to print a $100 dollar bill to continue the Fiat scam. The gold standard was abandoned in 1971, and most Fiat money has been printed basically out of thin air since. We are at the most rapid point of this ""printing"" since around 50% of all dollars in circulation were printed in just the last 18 months.

# Here's the circulating dollar supply

[The vast majority of liquid currencies were printed after 2008 and is continuing to accelerate](https://preview.redd.it/nhdh5jlzhk881.png?width=730&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=841d5d2b14654a42455e19880c02a1dc2dd63a37)

# Now, Lets talk about Bitcoin and Ethereum

**Ethereum:** The entire mining industry is already on thin ice when talking about Ethereum. With the new upgrades and the hash rate cuts, it should be expected that the in the very near future, the circulating supply of Ethereum is going to **decrease** unlike the dollar. We can already see signs of this happening as Ethereum supply keeps dropping throughout exchanges.

[Total Ethereum in circulation since Ethereum was made](https://preview.redd.it/p4lzofhujk881.png?width=1260&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=40b1c96228397b2c896110c3de0902e27d865030)

**Bitcoin:** Miners are already being kicked out of countries, and as there are fears of a new energy crisis (we are already seeing one in Europe) the profitability is going to decrease more and more. **Unlike the dollar where it costs 15.4 cents to print $100 dollar, some miners can literally expect to make a loss mining Bitcoin due to its current scarcity, which is systemically guaranteed.** The halving cycle also makes mining even more difficult as time goes by. **90% of ALL Bitcoins have already been mined.**

&amp;#x200B;

Fiat is a terrible investment, yes we know that already but it is worse than you think since Fiat circulation basically jumped by **8x** in just the past 12 years alone. You may not feel the effects now, but over the long term it is going to be a catastrophe.

So what's the takeaway? With Fiat they know they cannot contain inflation forever with an 800% jump in circulating supply, so they are going to drag it with inflation for decades, and perhaps centuries with the excuse of ""stability"".

Crypto on the other hand is going to be exceptionally scarce in the future. Yes it might be still volatile short term, but in terms of long term profit, it is by far one of the most reliable investments you can count on.

TLDR: The best thing you can do currently for your future is to stockpile cheap Crypto for whats to come. Fiat has been turned into an experiment after 2008, and we can already see things going wrong with near double digit inflation rates. Crypto is designed to make you rich through scarcity while modern fiat will make you poor through abundance. Don't take the chances and buy Crypto for cheap while you can.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Will mortgage interest rates stay low - should we refi now or later?,"We bought our first home last year.

But I have many years of work so it will come through.)
This first round of forgiveness improved my credit score and Credit Karma says we could get a better rate on our mortgage.

I’m 26. 

I make about 6k a month after taxes and the mortgage will be between $2800 to $3000. A month. Including all the things, HOA, Taxes, insurance etc.

That is at about 50% of my take home and I’m starting to get nervous. The home will be done in about 2 months and I just wanted to get others thought. 

I saved for my down payment of 5% so I should be okay there.

I know having a home comes with tax advantages but. Did I bite more than I can chew?

It leaves me with little room for my 401k and other investment such as Crypto, REITS or I should say diversification. Edit: [ maxing out 401k, Roth IRA, HSA, other no real estate investments]

1. Don’t be in this situation. If you can get out, do it. It’s not work the stress you’ll endure for the coming years. There a better ways to invest your money.
Peace is important.

2. Your HOA should never be that expensive.

3. Sublet if you can’t get out. You can use AIRBNB, furniture finder, other long term leasing service for travel nurses. Or simply just rent one or two rooms in your home. You’ll have less financial stress 

3. Your mortgage insurance + property taxes WILL increase every. This depends on factors based on where you live. You should research this before.

4. Don’t Panic!

5. Create a plan of action for when you get into your home. You’ll most literally make it but you need to have a plan. Be diligent.

personalfinance,Confusion on Series I Bond Rate?,"Hi all I just recently bought some I-bonds from treasury direct and I am trying to understand the rate that my money grows at.

What would my money be compounded at annually then? It would only be slightly over 3.56% (about 3.592%) and not 7% right?

I have been considering going back to school in 2022 as I have grown older and more definitive in what I want to do. I have a plan and I just wanted some opinions of you chap and chappet's. 

At this very moment I have about 6.5k (2 semesters) of my original student loan from when I was fresh out of high school that is currently in default. I have the funds to pay this off with my 2021 tax return and I currently have about 8k in the stock market from my last return. These defaulted right at the start of 2020 which for obvious reasons have moved no further other than just the status itself. I should be able to have them paid off before they try to garnish wages or collect on that default. **AND DON'T YOU WORRY I REALIZE HOW LUCKY I AM FOR THAT!**

Now onto the plan. I qualify for about 6k in grant money as well as about 9.8k in federal loans per semester. Since I DO NOT want to risk another burnout like when I was fresh out of high school I am contemplating getting the maximum amount and using this to pay for my monthlies rather than also needing to have a full time job. The lack of financial support and the expected family contribution calculation made things very hard when I was 18/19 but things have changed. I also only was able to get about 3k in loans per semester back when I originally enrolled. 

Expense wise I do have child support that runs me about $10.8k a year currently that I am sure would change once they recalculated as I would be a full time student. I have worked some things out with my parents and I will be paying rent but it is cheap and I cover some of the other utilities as well as provide my own food and what not. This is about a total cost of \~$6k a year. Everything added up I'm looking to have about $19.5k in expenditure as it stands. Upcoming court may change this significantly. 

Is this a sound idea? I am looking to go into Aerospace and am starting my way down that path and I would think that the ability to pay these sorts of loans back as well as proving myself early with high marks. The added ability to be able to network and focus on my studies without needing to work 40 hours on top of this would ensure my success. There is of course inherent risk here as nothing is for sure but I feel as tho given the type of loan and the prospective career path would be worthwhile. Especially since 40% is money that I would not need to pay back.

personalfinance,Roth 401k Rollover to Roth IRA question,"Hi,

I recently left my employer in which I had a Roth 401k account. My understanding is that the Roth 401k would be split into two checks. 1) My contributions should rollover to my Roth IRA and 2) the 401k matching contributions from my employer should rollover to my Rollover IRA (traditional pre-tax).

My questions are:

1. My current Roth IRA has monthly contributions invested in VTSAX. Once I rollover the Roth 401k portion to my Roth IRA, should I reinvest that money into VTSAX or once rolled over to just leave it in the Roth IRA? If I do leave it in the Roth IRA, will the money grow? This is my first time rolling over money so I am not sure what to do.
2. The employer 401k contributions being rolled over from my Roth 401k to my Rollover IRA, same question as above. Do I let this money sit in the Rollover IRA and if so does it grow or do I need to invest in an index/mutual fund for it to grow? My goal is to eventually move this money into the Roth IRA and take the hit on the tax.
3. This question is part of question 2. Is there a formula someone can provide to help estimate how much in taxes I would have to pay once I move money from the Rollover IRA to the Roth IRA? Rolling over = 19k, Age= 30, Federal = 24%, State = 4.95%, annual = 172k

CryptoCurrency,The Ghost of Mt. Gox: Part 1 - Centralizing the Decentralized,"**Note**

This is the second post in a series I'm doing on centralized exchanges

**Part 1: Centralizing the Decentralized**

The crypto currency market is a world of dualities. Or to be more precise it is a world of reality and false narratives. [Bitcoin (BTC)](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) is the be all end all while simultaneously old technology that needs to be [replaced](https://www.blockchaincenter.net/flippening/) by newer better tech such as [Ethereum (ETH)](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/). While ETH it self is considered [fundamentally broken not only by the public but the developers themselves](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/). Resulting in the now fabled ETH 2.0; a version that moves away from Proof of Work [(POW)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp) consensus to Proof of Stake [(POS)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp). Similar to the endless stream of [ETH Killers](https://forkast.news/what-are-ethereum-killers-prospects-with-eth2/) such as ADA, SOL, DOT, EOS, XTZ etx..... Regardless of the fact that most don't address the [BTC Trilemma](https://academy.shrimpy.io/post/what-is-the-blockchain-trilemma) including ETH itself. Which up to this point has no clear monetary policy

Now are you confused?

If no, congratulations you are one of the many people in the world that pretends to understand this nonsense

If yes, then we can continue our journey

If you feel offended by me saying that it is nonsense then let me take some time to break it down. BTC was created by a mysterious individual/ group going by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. As ""*A peer to peer electronic cash system""* utilizing block chain technology. Which in its simplest terms was meant to create a system in which individual market actors world verify not trust transactions. In theory liberating the financial system from the bureaucracy and red tape of modern day payment systems. Most impotently the idea of irreversible final settlement. For the most part this system works. I can send BTC from my wallet to any other wallet in the world without fear of a third party halting the transaction. However there where and are issues around transaction speed and fees. Which to an extent have been addressed by [layer 2s](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/16495/layer-2) such as the [lightning Network](https://lightning.network/)

So now you should be wondering if BTC works to an extent why do we have ETH and thousands of Alternative Crypto-currencies ( Alt-coins). If BTC can be used for final settlement for goods and services then why do we need specific coins for particular markets?

Why don't market participants integrate BTC lightning wallets to facilitate payments similar to [El Salvador McDonalds](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/09/07/mcdonalds-starts-accepting-bitcoin-in-el-salvador/?sh=1e1196b66264)?

The answer to both was surprisingly given 10 years ago around BTC's infancy with the term ""*Shit-coin""*

*"" You say that now, but if bitcoin really takes off I can see lots of get-rich-quick imitators coming on the scene: gitcoin, nitcoin, witcoin, titcoin, shitcoin... Some of them are sure to attract users with promises like ""Why use bitcoin, where you can only generate 50 bitcoins every few months? Use shitcoin instead, and you'll get 51 shitcoins every 2 minutes"".*

*Of course the cheap imitators will disappear as quickly as those 1990s ""internet currencies"" like flooz and beenz but lots of people will get burned along the way."" -* [u/Riback Nov 8th 2010](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1647.msg20646#msg20646)

u/ Riback's statement still holds true to this day. Because all Alt Coins ultimately are derivatives of BTC that derive their value paradoxically from both their proximity to BTC and their perceived distance from it. E.g ETH both benefits from its similarities to BTC but attempts to distance itself from it by being focused on being a network of things rather than just a store of value. This then makes ETH more profitable in the eyes of speculators but simultaneously more risky. Just as ETH killers benefit by being competitors to ETH as ETH is to BTC but must find a gimmick to differentiate themselves. Such as Solana ( SOL) use of Proof of History, Polka-dot (DOT) as a ""layer 0"" etc....

However while the cryptocurrencies may compete among themselves for market dominance in this great game. The reality is that they do not and most likely will never be able to [compete with traditional financial systems](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-blockchain-scalability-problem-the-race-for-visa-like-transaction-speed-5cce48f9d44) or even BTC in integration and usability. Due to 2 issues

1. Most things can be done off chain
2. The BTC trilemma can not be ignored with out a shift towards centralization. Which opens a door for exploitation

Due to the fact that we have thousands of Alt-coins it is evident that both have been ignored. Due to to incentive of exploitation

While it is not know is Satoshi Nakamoto ever even earned a dollar from BTC. The founders of ETH, ADA, DOT, XLM, SOL etc... have become some of the richest individuals in the world. However they are poor compared to the [operators of exchanges and traders](https://www.cnbctv18.com/cryptocurrency/7-cryptobillionaireson-forbes-2021-list-of-richest-americans-11592172.htm). This is because of the Ghost of Mt. Gox

As we have established most Alt-coins have no purpose but are perceived to have value. This has been exemplified the most with the rise of [Meme Coins in 2021](https://coinmarketcap.com/view/memes/). With coins such as SHIB, DOGE, FLOKI INU etc...That are basically jokes being worth billions

Because similar to the Magic the Gathering Cards that Mt. Gox was originally meant to trade. Alt-coins have become financial Pokemon in an insane competition of market dominance. Facilitated by the machinations of the centralized exchanges such as FTX, Binance, Kraken, Coinbase and Kucoin. However while it would easy to just say it is a great game played by those that want ""Financial freedom"" it is not

As the people who have benefited the most from both the bull and bear cycles are not the early investors or developers but the exchanges. The battle is rigged in favor of the gym

To an extent this has been facilitated by issue of liquidity. While now you can book a flight to El Salvador, book a hotel and get some McDonalds for dinner all in BTC. This is a recent development and is only 1 of 18,000+. For the rest you must still convert your Alt-coin into an internationally recognized fiat currency. Until you convert your Alt into BTC or fiat it is worthless. Regardless of the hypothetical millions you may be holding. This then has given the Centralized Exchanges (CEX) the position of gate keepers

While in recent years the development of Decentralized Exchanges ([DEX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_exchange)) such as Uniswap ( UNI) have been created as a possible immune response to CEXs market influence. Most if not the majority of individuals still depend on CEX's ability to exit the market. You convert you ETH to MANA on Uniswap but need to send it to Kraken to get fiat to pay rent. Worse of all there are primarily only 2 major liquidity providers in the market, [Alameda Research](https://www.alameda-research.com/) and [Cumberland](https://www.cumberland.io/). But wait there is more these 2 companies get provide liquidity and own part of FTX and Binance while also having their main source of funds being loans from Tether a stable coin provider of USDT. [Accounting for 70%](https://protos.com/tether-papers-crypto-stablecoin-usdt-investigation-analysis/) of all USDT purchases from Tether

This has essentially made crypto currencies ironically one of the most centralized markets in the world as it is essentially dependent on the actions of 3 companies; Alameda, Cumberland and Tether

If the user base of BTC had rejected the offer of quick money and trading that Mt. Gox offered and instead maintained the Peer to Peer model Satoshi envisioned we may not have found ourselves in this situation. Websites such as [local Bitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/) offered users the ability to sell and purchase BTC for fiat. However they only promised the financial freedom to make final settlement outside of traditional markets. Mt Gox and centralized exchanges offered financial freedom in Lamborghinis and million dollar suits. As ridiculous as it sounds millions of people have fallen for this. They play the great game in hopes of becoming wealthy. While some do the majority an estimated [80% +](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/if-you-re-day-trading-you-will-probably-lose-money-here-s-why-1030667770) based off traditional markets lose all or nearly all their starting capital in the long run.

But this money doesn't disappear it through a complex system of market manipulation flows back to the exchanges. The house always wins and with 10x, 20x to 100x leverage the process is faster and more efficient in maximum extraction

This is why the most profitable people in the crypto industry have been on average those that bought BTC in the early 2010s and died; or forgot their wallets. By not participating in the day to day market they have out performed nearly everyone. If they pull a Jesus or remember their password they can take advantage of the CEX system and cash out fiat. Depending on if it isn't too large of an amount

CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin is a FAILURE (The Satoshi Vision Paradox),"I want to get this up as I think I want to write a longer paper on the topic.

My thinking is this.

The original vision was for use as a online payment method, not as a store of value. Bitcoin has been taken over by institutional investment. Id like to coin the term, the Satoshi Paradox. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Bitcoin is intended as a alternative to cash
2. People want to acquire Bitcoin to use instead of cash
3. Value of bitcoin goes up due to demand
4. People refuse to spend bitcoin because price rises due to step 3
5. Bitcoin Is now longer a viable alternative to cash and becomes an investment
6. Satoshi is not happy as Bitcoin has failed in its objective.

The lack of centralization and monetary policy is what has killed the Satoshi vision. 

What is interesting though is the broad scope of decentralization is that its the users that can pick what a crypto is used for. So to some extent the rejection of the Satoshi Vision and the embracing of store of value is paradoxically inline with the intention of a decentralized currency.

The lack of centralization and monetary policy is what has killed the Satoshi vision. 

&amp;#x200B;

Id like to open up a discourse on this paradox so when I start writing the paper I have community input to do some deeper digging on. I could be completely wrong, so what do y'all think?

stocks,CUE Health ($HLTH),"**The Thesis for Cue Health ($HLTH) :**

**This is my first big write up so please be friendly and constructive with your comments :)**

As many of you all are aware, with what seems like the 100th strain of COVID-19— Omicron— spreading across the world, COVID-testing kits are once again in hot demand. I’m doing this write up to explain my bullish stance on COVID test kit suppliers going forward.

**Why Test Kits :**

* It is clear that we will have to co-exist with COVID, so shutting down our economy is not an option. Thus, mass-vaccination and testing have become the optimal strategies.
* Given vaccination rates have plateaued, nation-wide testing is the best thing we can do to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic.

**Context:**

The Omicron variant, which now is the dominant (and most contagious) strain in the United States, has driven daily US COVID cases past the Delta variant’s peak. However, the United States severely lags behind European countries for COVID testing. In these countries, such test kits are ubiquitous, while there is a test kit shortage at US retailers. For instance, those in the US have to spend at least $14 for a two-pack at U.S retailers, compared with $5 or less in some countries, such as Germany (WSJ). The U.K government distributes free tests to its citizens on a weekly basis. While the countries’ differing healthcare systems contribute to this, it is undeniable that there exists a severe COVID testing shortage in the United States. In fact, President Biden admitted last week that “I wish I had thought about ordering a half a billion \[tests\] two months ago, before Covid hit here.”

As such, there should be no doubt that the United States government will become more proactive in its acquisition of test kits, emulating the U.K and other European countries, which are giving out so many free kits so people can test themselves every week.

The Biden Administration recently announced the purchase of 500 million home kits. The contracts to purchase the tests have not been finalized, but even if we were to conservatively assume an average purchase price of $15, that is $7.5 billion going into the COVID test kit supplier market. To put that into perspective, the largest federal contracts that have been granted to COVID-test manufacturers are around $500-600 million with Celltrion and Abbott.

**Bottomline: Omicron is SPREADING FAST, and the lack of supply for test kits creates an asymmetric demand/supply relationship, with the government compounding the price inelasticity of demand. The few companies that are able to supply up-to-par test kits have strong pricing power.**

[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/12/23/us/omicron-case-count.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/12/23/us/omicron-case-count.html)

**Overview of COVID Test Manufacturing Market:**

The market is pricing for a mild growth in the next two years yet underestimated the recent momentum. The testing trend is top-down and is only beginning to develop. First, the DoD or HHS will start granting generous contracts to vamp up manufacturing capacity; as Omicron continues to spread, businesses and organizations will purchase large quantities of tests for their employees to minimize disruption from the pandemic; massive and regular testing will become the norm: households and businesses will order tests in bulk orders on a regular basis.

**Why Should I Invest In Cue Health ($HLTH) ?**

Out of the various COVID testing manufacturers, Cue Health ($HLTH) is one of the best out there with over $480 million in federal contracts as well as To-B contracts with Google, Mayo Clinic, the NBA, Canada Air etc. Rather than making antigen rapid tests, Cue developed the NAAT (Nucleic Acid Amplification) testing method. As of this moment, Cue is the only NAAT test manufacturer that has developed its own integrated platform solution and can manufacture in-house. Mayo Clinic conducted thorough research and concluded that Cue’s home testing kits results have a 98% match (vs. \~85% sensitivity for Antigen tests) with PCR Lab results.

TLDR: Cue’s testing method is revolutionary by producing testing results virtually identical to those conducted in a professional lab in under 20 minutes !!

As a result of its superior testing capacity, Cue Health demands a high premium for its kits, which so far its clients (the federal government, premier healthcare providers, prestigious national sports leagues etc.) are willing to pay for. Aside from its top-notch caliber of clientele, Cue’s 60% GM and 10%+ NI business, along with their recent IPO, will inject them with enough cash to expand on their product offerings outside of Covid testing. This will in turn generate more cash to capitalize even more on their superior technology, creating an upward flywheel effect.

Moreover, it is very likely that Cue Health will be one of the beneficiaries (gain new federal contracts) under the recent initiatives from the Biden Administration. Its $481 mill contracts last year in October include both capex on new manufacturing facilities and $6 mill testing kits. The company sees its capex expand rapidly in that quarter from $4.8 million to $30.5 million in Q1FY21 and 27.1 million in Q2. Since Capex decreased to $19.3 million next quarter, we can reasonably estimate that total capex will be south of 100 mill, since the company will finish ramping up its manufacturing capacity within a year. This implies that each testing kit for Cue costs around $60 (way higher than the average Antigen kit). Given that their 12-month TTM revenue of $438.9 million and the majority of their revenue is, for now, federal contracts, it can be estimated that they’ve at least delivered 4 million testing kits as of today. It is very likely that they will gain a decent piece of the 500-million testing kits federal contract.

**The Bear Case:**

South Africa’s decline in COVID cases may suggest that its Omicron peak has passed. It will be worth observing whether this decline occurs in the United States. If cases steadily decrease, this might prompt investors to believe that testing demand will start dying down once again, causing selling pressure.

**Mitigating Factors:**

The Biden Administration, along with many influential people in the healthcare community have expressed their regrets over not escalating testing programs, reiterating that they will not repeat their mistake of distributing enough COVID to help combat potential surges. Furthermore, a vast majority of Cue’s clients will still require Cue’s products and services. The federal government and businesses will still need to test their employees on a regular basis; travelers will still need negative results to be cleared for cross-border traveling. Therefore, while the eventual dying-down of Omicron might affect market sentiment, its fundamentals remain robust as there will always be a huge need for rapid COVID testing.

**Conclusion:**

Going forwards, we will be seeing a fundamental shift in attitudes and business behaviors regarding COVID-testing in the United States. As Scott Becker, the CEO of the Association of Public Health Laboratories acknowledges that “we can’t be caught flat-footed again \[in regards to the severe shortage of testing\].” Any short-term concerns on whether testing demand would die down have now completely dissipated. This tailwind will certainly last well into 2022 and potentially further down the road as it is almost consensus now that we will co-exist with COVID. As long as that is the case, Cue Health ($HLTH) will stand to be one of our largest winners .

financialindependence,"Discussion: New FRED article demonstrates that many workers retired ""earlier than they otherwise would have"" - but that might not mean early retirement is on the rise","Two days ago, the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank's ""On the Economy"" blog published [this](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/december/excess-retirements-covid-19-pandemic) post, titled *""Excess"" Retirements during the COVID-19 Pandemic*. It links back to Miguel Faria e Castro's essay [The COVID Retirement Boom](https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/economic-synopses/2021/10/15/the-covid-retirement-boom), which frankly isn't much longer or more informative. It, at least, acknowledges right up front that it is a back-of-the-envelope estimate. I figured it might be an interesting read for this community, given that these are almost all, by definition, early retirements.

Unfortunately, my disappointment with the FRED blog continues. This isn't to say that it's not a useful essay, and it's probably *directionally* correct, but I found the math behind it to be disappointing and the depth of analysis in the article to be lacking. From the chart:

&gt; NOTE: The percentage of retirees is a 12-month moving average, and the Baby Boomer trend is a cubic trend estimated between January 2008 and February 2020.

I'm not in academia, but this seems a bit intellectually lazy. Surely there’s data on the number of boomers by age and a model could be built with projected retirement rates by cohort. The analysis seems to hinge on the divergence between model and reality that starts [here](https://i.imgur.com/ZVHVGBh.jpg), but it seems like the modeled behavior is pretty divergent from the prior several years of data, based on what, a few months of convexity?

The overall point remains valid, but it seems the quantification may be a bit off. The key quote:

&gt; a significant number of people who had not planned to retire in 2020 may have retired anyway because of the dangers to their health or due to rising asset values that made retirement feasible.

This SOUNDS like ""early retirement on the rise"", right? This intersects interestingly with a great [New Yorker article I posted about](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/p6fvn1/the_great_resignation_walden_and_fire_a_fantastic/) back in August, talking about the drivers of the Great Resignation. The FRED article confirms that the Great Resignation is, in fact occurring (many previously posited it as a reshuffle rather than a resignation, because reporting at the time focused heavily on actual resignation numbers rather than net employment). As we can see, Labor Force Participation Rate has [somewhat stabilized](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=Kmyq) about 2 percentage points below its pre-pandemic levels. This confirms that folks have indeed left the labor force. To counter the discussion of a gender gap, we can look at November 2021 vs November 2019 by gender:

 * [LFPR - Men](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS11300001): -1.5% (69.3% to 67.8%)
 * [LFPR - Women](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS11300002): -1.4% (57.6% to 56.2%)

I'll bring in a third source, however, in a Pew article from November titled [""Amid the pandemic, a rising share of older U.S. adults are now retired""](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/11/04/amid-the-pandemic-a-rising-share-of-older-u-s-adults-are-now-retired/). A few interesting data points from the [first chart](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/11/04/amid-the-pandemic-a-rising-share-of-older-u-s-adults-are-now-retired/ft_2021-11-04_retirement_01a/):

 * In Q3 of 2019, 48.1% of adults over 55 were retired. By Q3 of 2021, that number was 50.3%
 * Interestingly, though, this is shown almost entirely in the 65-74 age group, rising from 64.0% to 66.9%

There are some fun crosstabs on the [last chart](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/11/04/amid-the-pandemic-a-rising-share-of-older-u-s-adults-are-now-retired/ft_2021-11-04_retirement_03/), most notably that this is somewhat concentrated in higher-educated, American-born, metropolitan folks, but I think that's largely noise compared to the question at hand. The first chart is where the meat is, and it leads to a conclusion that I think runs somewhat counter to the narrative. **The Great Resignation appears to be driven in part by less LATE retirement (65-74), rather than more early retirement.**

I haven't pulled in the relative *sizes* of the cohorts to show what % of that 2% LFPR decrease is accounted for by this age cohort, so I'd happily welcome someone else jumping in on that one, but it seems to me that the story of the pandemic enabling early retirement may be overblown, and instead gave a big kick to those that were already past what we would consider to be traditional retirement years.",finance

personalfinance,2020 Tax Witholding / New W-4 Question,"Hi! I have been doing some housekeeping with my personal finances and noticed that I have 2 allowances for tax witholdings. This is in line with what I elected a few years ago when I started at my company, which was appropriate for a single person with no dependents. However, I understand that in 2020 there was a change to tax witholdings on the W-4, and I never updated my W-4 to the new version. I updated to the new W-4 today where I marked myself as Single and left the rest blank, which I understand is the equivalent of marking 2 allowances previously. 

My question is what happened to my tax witholding elections in 2020 and YTD 2021 since I didn't update to the new W-4? Did the 2 allowances I marked previously  ""roll over"" / get grandfathered in after the new W-4 came out? Or did I get defaulted to a specific tax witholding under the new W-4 based on my 2 allowances? 

Not sure if this is relevant, but when I filed my taxes for 2020, I owed $4.4K to the Fed, which is the most I've ever owed before. I'm thinking this could be related to the tax witholding election changes...

Did not updating to the new W-4 result in reducing the amount of tax witholdings in 2020 and 2021, vs. 2019 and prior years?  

For reference, in 2020, I was promoted and my salary increased from $95K to $140K. I also received a promotion and annual bonus of $115K. Not sure if this may have also played a part in owing $4K in taxes.

I'm not too familiar with taxes and have been searching online for a few hours and wasn't able to figure this out on my own. Appreciate the guidance, thank you in advance!",finance

A cryptocurrency ATM (crypto-machine, or BTM, which stands for Bitcoin Teller Machine) is a device that allows buying or cashing in bitcoins (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ether (ETH), Dash (DASH), Litecoin (LTC) and others. Instead of a bank card, it uses a crypto wallet from which coins are debited or sent to.

They are most popular among users who don't have constant access to high-speed Internet, and also among those who don't have a bank account or don't want to have one for privacy reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

How the sector is developing

The first crypto machine was installed in October 2013 at a Waves coffee shop in downtown Vancouver, Canada. According to Coin ATM Radar, in September 2020, the number of cryptomats worldwide exceeded 10,000. A year ago there were only 6,000; at the beginning of the summer there were 8,000. In just one year, their number has increased by 67%. And although compared to more than 3.5 million conventional ATMs it is like a drop in the ocean - the trend itself is important. The sector is actively growing and shows no signs of slowing down. As cryptocurrencies grow in popularity and confidence in them increases, there are more and more crypto machines.

&amp;#x200B;

Most crypto machines are in the U.S. (7,800 - 127% more than a year ago), Canada (812 units) and the U.K. (260 units). Crypto machines are also popular in developing countries and countries with unstable financial markets. The demand for the service in the Latin American, Asian and Australian markets is also growing rapidly. In total, crypto machines are installed in 71 countries. Russia currently has 51 cryptomats, Ukraine has 23, and Kazakhstan has 3.

&amp;#x200B;

In total, there are more than four dozen manufacturers of cryptocurrency ATMs. Genesis Coin (35% market share) and General Bytes (30% market share) produce the most devices, as well as Lamassu, BitAccess, Coinsourse. They operate slightly differently, but we won't go into details - there usually aren't many cryptomats around to choose from anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

Regulation of crypto machines: how they are treated by authorities around the world

Cryptocurrency ATMs allow you to buy and sell digital currencies and convert them to cash. Anything related to cash is the domain of bank regulators, so they can't leave cryptocurrencies out. Therefore, in countries where cryptocurrencies are permitted and regulated, crypto operators must comply with anti-money laundering legislation. In the U.S., for example, they must comply with the same standards as banks: register with the Federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as well as obtain a state license. In Canada they have to report all transactions over 10,000 Canadian dollars (about $7400). The authorities often accuse cryptocurrencies of being used by criminals to hide their profits. In reality, criminals launder about $1-3 billion through cryptocurrencies and $0.8-2 trillion through banks and cash. Thus, no more than 0.3-1% of all digital assets are used for criminal purposes.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,What is the best way to manage short term (1-1.5 yr) liquidity needs?,"Long time lurker, first time poster! Thought I'd ask the opinion of the knowledgable people who are on this sub.

About myself:

29M, 780+ FICO score. I believe I have built up enough safety net (\~$75K Roth/\~$130K 401K/\~$20K Cash/\~$30K Other Assets) to be in a good spot to take a calculated risk in my career. I currently make decent money at my current role but have the opportunity to switch to a position where the net pay (salary+bonus) comes out to \~50% increase for me. While a large chunk of the increase would be performance related bonus, I am informed that the bonus targets are regularly met. Without the bonus, it is more like a 15% increase. The role is also something I think I would like to try out.

The Liquidity Need:

I have a repayment contract at my current employer due to them sponsoring my Masters education. If I leave now, I have to pay back the amount they have put towards my tuition on my last day. I intend to do so if I decide as I also think it is the right thing to do. It is to the tune of about $60K. I worked it out and assuming I make the \~50% increase, I can pay this money in a little over a year. On the low end with just the salary increase, it would take me \~3 years to break even. As you can tell from my personal financial position, most of my net worth is tied up in retirement accounts with not much in cash to fund the job change if I choose to take it.

I've tried to search around for secured/unsercured personal loans, borrowing against 401K, maximum self funding by selling assets and other avenues.

What is the overall best way (considering interest rates, tax considerations, risk management, etc) to get the $60K that I would need if I decide to pursue this opportunity? Would love to hear any alternate methods I have not considered.",finance

personalfinance,Company went bankrupt and didn’t provide service. Filed a dispute with Affirm and Affirm sided with merchant. What are my options?,"Hello,

I’m looking for advise here because I honestly don’t know what to do about this situation or next steps as I’ve exhausted a lot of my options. 

Back in November, I signed my dog up for a 21 day board and training program. I went through this company who trained my other dog and I saw great results and decided to move forward with their board and train for my other more reactive dog. This included a transfer out lesson and a lesson at home plus equipment. I signed up for this via an Affirm loan of about $4k. I signed some contracts detailing their policies etc and of course their refund policy stating no refunds once training starts. No big deal, I knew I liked them and couldn’t see a reason why I wouldn’t continue service. 

The day I dropped off my dog I was given a run down of what would happen. I was to receive daily pictures and videos of progress, there were about 6-8 other trainers and my dog would receive training every hour during operating hours (about 12 hours a day). 

5 days after dropping my dog off, the company sent an email stating they have filed for bankruptcy. Great. In a separate email, they stated all training except the board and train would cease immediately. For the remaining, the trainings will be finished by only the owner. Additionally, we would not receive the 2nd at home transfer lesson. It also stated “if you feel uncomfortable about this at any time you may pick up your dog ahead of schedule”. 

I waited a few days to ponder my options and ultimately decided on picking him up due to:

1. No longer receiving any pictures or videos with updates. 
2. I highly doubt one guy was going to be able to provide the promised level of training as 8 trainers originally (because who knows how many dogs they still had in their board and train) 
3. A copious amount of bad Yelp reviews and social media posts from clients who claimed they signed up and provided money only for them to claim bankruptcy and keep the money + claims from people saying their dogs stopped being fed. 
4. I was not going to receive part of what I paid for (the transfer out lesson) nor further continued support which is also a benefit they state. 

I picked up my dog only 7 days into training. The owner would not come out to speak to me and the person I spoke to stated she didnt work there anymore but was a family friend helping out. She couldn’t provide any info about my dogs training nor a refund and simply stated bankruptcy lawyers would reach out. 

That same day I filed a dispute with Affirm and provided all information. 

2 months later, they close the dispute stating that the merchant provided the contract terms and that “services would have continued if I didn’t choose to pick up my dog” and told me I would need to work it out with the merchant, who obviously has disconnected their phone lines and make it impossible to contact any one about this. 

Afterwards, I tried filing a complaint with the CFPB and getting someone on the phone with Affirm. I spoke to someone who stated they would reopen the case and review further. 

The next day they closed the dispute yet again stating the same exact thing as before and then sent another message about my CFPB complaint stating that the late payments won’t affect my credit. 

So, that’s where I’m at. At this point I don’t know what my options are if I’m just SOL. Do I suck it up and pay it? Do I not pay it and just let it eat my credit? Do I lawyer up? Any advice appreciated. 

TL;DR 

Dog training company filed bankruptcy 5 days after taking my dog. Training I was promised was not going to be given such as quality, additional lessons, etc and company stated I can pick up my dog. Filed a dispute with Affirm and sided with merchant claiming “service would have continued”",finance

stocks,Cathie Wood was put to the test in 2021 and next year won't be any easier,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/recapping-cathie-woods-ark-innovation-wild-ride-2021-165922730.html

Despite a year marked by underperformance, Wood is keeping pace with the disruptive innovation strategy that positioned her as a bull market poster child last year after her allocations to the so-called “stay-at-home” picks that benefited from COVID-19 lockdowns earned her an annual return of 150%. Even as those stocks fall out of favor, Wood, whose firm declined a request for an interview, is sticking to her plan, arguing that naysayers should instead be worried about “safe” indexes like the S&amp;P 500 with values she says have soared above those of the underlying companies they track.

Wood has doubled down on her stance that she can do just that, shrugging off losses and dismissing fears of a “bubble,” even as it stands to be tested by the sell-off of high-growth tech stocks likely to be worsened next year if the Federal Reserve acts on expectations to raise interest rates as many as three times, making such companies particularly vulnerable.

Next year will be a really challenging year for Ark funds as federal reserve will raise rate at least 3 time. It is almost to the end of year and investors should reevaluate if ark funds could still generate a positive return for 2022. Investors might easily lose direction since many of them just follow the trend and buy into the funds without really understanding what kind of stocks that the funds are holding.",finance

personalfinance,Tax question - W2 and additional income - first time filing...,"Hey guys,

Not sure if this is the right thread to post this in but just going for it anyways. Just to give some information before I asked the question, this is my first year actually filing taxes as I had some funny circumstances before which didnt require it.

Im married and want to file jointly. I have a W2 job that I started in July in Florida (am a resident here).

My Gross Earnings is $22,153.81.

Taxes paid $2,748.28 ( Federal Income Tax - $1,053.51, Social Security $1,373.54, Medicare $321.23) After tax I made $19,405.53.

I was also helping a friend with their house as they were stuck in Europe. His house was basically abandoned since the end of 2019, so I ended up spending $1,874 on cleaning, repairs, etc. in his house. He told me that he couldnt repay me so I should put it up on AIRBNB and try to rent it to some friends, etc., ended up making $1,596.72 on his house ($550 was on AIRBNB and the rest was personal). I also ended up spending $1,500 on home improvements elsewhere (I dont own a house myself though).

I also did a one-off job for someone who paid me $560 on Paypal.

My question is, 1. do I report this additional income, 2. How? 3. Any tips in general?

Edit: I do have an LLC but I set it up to sell sunglasses on, I havent done any business on it yet, but the LLC bank account is also my personal bank account.

Edit: My wife is not currently working as we are waiting for her Greencard to come in so its just my income.

So I told my dad I was using it but after I used it, it showed no activity so he thinks I figured out a way to bypass it. So I tried to turn it off, I went back and chose the option “Off”. However, the address is still stuck as the last one when I chose “change daily”. How can I reset this MAC address to the physical one on my pc? Thanks for reading, i really neeed help.

personalfinance,Young And Finally Have Some Money In The Bank - Want To Be Smart About It And Not Squander It Or Let It Lose Value,"In my early twenties. I graduated from college two and half years ago and work a corporate-type job in my field making $55k. I’m casually looking for a job with more pay but it’s not super urgent. I found a pretty decent deal on my apartment and split rent with my girlfriend (we moved in together about a year ago) so I pay $648/month in rent. I recently refinanced my private student loans and have a 3.2% interest rate on those now. $330/month for those. I have just over $20k in a high yield savings account and ~$4k in checking.

Basically, I don’t want that $20k to just sit idle and depreciate over time. I have no illusions of getting-rich-quick by any means, basically just want to outpace inflation and turn some amount of that money into more money as much as possible.

I was thinking about investing $10k of that money in an index fund and keeping the other 10k in savings as a rainy-day fund. Does this sound like a good idea? Is there anything I should do first? If you think that’s a good idea, any advice on index funds? Never done this before.

My home is worth roughly $1.8 million, but I purchased it for about $530k 12 years ago. The remaining balance is $325k and the interest rate is 5.375%, monthly payment is $2375. I am 54 years old and make about $250k/year. I am wondering about what the best option for me is:

My wife and I will stay in the home until I retire, then may sell it and move somewhere cheaper or stay in it - not sure yet.

10 year mortgage (\~$3000/month) to pay it off so the home is paid off when I retire (planned for 65). 

15 year mortgage (\~$2150) or 30 year mortgage (\~$1400), invest the difference and pay off when I retire

personalfinance,Poor Escrow estimation methods by lenders?,"The last 2 mortgages I've been a party to (including my current one) on primary residences, the Lender has done a **horrible** job at estimating escrow payments.  The previous one would consistently **over** estimate the payment resulting in a large refund at the beginning of the year, then over correct and **under** estimate the following year, resulting in our payment yo-yo'ing back and forth every other year.  Fortunately this wasn't a hardship for us, but it was deeply frustrating.  Therefore every other year they were significantly over the federal maximum allowed minimum balance (2 months of anticipated escrow payments).  On top of this, in our State (Florida), there is no requirement to pay interest on escrow funds, so the overpayment would sit for up to a year earning no **interest**!

Our current mortgage servicer seems to be playing the same shenanigans on our current mortgage, after our first full year.  We just got an overpayment refund of $3,500(!) for last year, again with no interest paid.  Our projected taxes and insurance costs were significantly lower than projected, and I don't totally blame them for that (though their initial estimates were crap, I knew that our taxes would be much lower since the former owners didn't claim homestead exemption).  But on **top** of that, apparently we were about $475 short of projected escrow the previous year (of which we only had 3 payments since we closed in 9/2020), so they \*added\* 1/12 of that amount to every payment.  Which seems insane, since they were projecting from only 3 payments?

Larger picture seems that they always calculate high on every estimate, AND then project to have the highest minimum balance in escrow legally allowable.  Since they don't have to pay out any interest, I'm sure they're making money on this.  And there seems to be no consequences to them for collecting thousands of dollars over the legally allowed minimum balance?  Am I understanding all of this correctly?

It seems like they at least have the estimates reasonable for next year, though they are still setting the lowest minimum escrow balance at exactly the maximum Federally allowed balance (Escrow = 746.40, projected minimum balance  = 1492.80, which surprise, surprise = 2 x 746.40 EXACTLY!).",finance

* I have been in my first “real job” for about 10 months at this point
* My take home pay is roughly 5k AUD per month, plus occasional overtime and an annual bonus between 8-12k
* I have recently purchased my first property with a deposit and have a 550,000 mortgage, with a interest rate of around 2.3%. Monthly mortgage repayment is around 2200. Now I know this loan sounds large for a single income of only 5k but hear me out.
* I am fortunate that I live in a winter tourist town with very limited housing supply, and my current plan is to do a short term lease to seasonal workers over a 16 week period and will be able to get 800 a week minimum. (Market price is 200-250 per person per week during winter. )During this time I will move back home with my parents in the same town, and live for free. Additionally, during the off season I will move back into the house and get a roommate, can probably get 120-150 per week for 6 months as a conservative estimate. In short, I can live at the house for 8-9 months of the year and have my yearly mortgage repayments effectively halved from rental income. (I know I will be taxed higher)

* My income will steadily increase every 12 months from my start date by about 10k before tax, for at least the next few years.

What can I do from here to maximise my financial gains on my “spare” money? What investment strategies will provide relatively safe returns?

Due to my ability to pay off so much of the mortgage, should I put some of my spare money into the mortgage to start chipping away at it a bit faster?

What would be a good next move? What is a good financial goal to move toward next, taking into account my circumstances?

All of that to say I'm finally considering making a switch for checking and am wide open to suggestions. Here are my current thoughts:

USAA CASHBACK REWARDS CHECKING - I'm a USAA member. This account caught my attn because it's a checking that offers points which is something that appeals to me (specifically for future travel plans). I recently opened a renter's insurance policy with them so I've already planted the seed into their eco-system that everyone talks about. I haven't been able to find many reviews on this account, but based on how much everyone raves about USAA it seems like a good deal. Anyone else feel have experience/insight on this account?

Charles Schwab Checking - I know I'd need a brokerage account in order to do this, but that is actually something I've been meaning to do to expand my portfolio so that doesn't seem like much of a hindrance.

Online accounts - I've seen pretty intriguing offers and accounts, but I still have some trepidation about moving my $ to an online bank

Axos Essentials - seems like a good basic account that would meet my needs. No perks or benefits from what I can tell.

Chime - seems like another good checking account. Nothing special. Still cautious about having an online account.

personalfinance,Student Loan numbers don’t add up!,"I am looking at refinancing my private student loans again. I have a balance of close to $60,532. I keep trying to do the math using online calculators, but it looks like my payments aren’t adding up. The servicer is Firstmark Services through Brazos Higher Education. Has anyone experienced this or would know why the numbers don’t make sense? I make a payment every month if $695 and have an interest rate of 3.72% but according to my loan details still have 105 months left of my loan term. I’d appreciate any help!",finance
personalfinance,"Emergency Fund in place, debt accounted for, retirement accounts set up. What next step should I take toward achieving my 5 year goals (listed below)?","5 year goals:   
1. Buy my first property  
2. Be more than prepared for retirement  
3. Have a nice investment portfolio outside retirement  
4. Not a goal but will need to buy a new car

I'm making personal finance &amp; goals a priority of mine in 2022, and have revisited my budget for the new year. I've been saving 30-40% of my Net Income for a few months but have revised it so that I save more (\~45%), with the hope of achieving everything in my 5-year plan. I feel there's room to set myself up better for retirement and/or start investing (mutual funds, maybe stocks). Most of my savings these past 2 years has been dedicated toward building my Emergency Fund and setting myself up to pay off my highest-interest rate loans just prior to forbearance ending. Now that I'm set up there, what do you think my next step should be?

personalfinance,Student loan refinancing,"I have great credit and get paid 100k a year, is 2.65% on a 7 year loan a good interest rate? Any recommendations on lenders?

39. The heads of Circle, FTX, Bitfury, Paxos, Stellar Development Foundation, and Coinbase appeared before the House Financial Services Committee.

There was significant focus on stablecoins due to the President’s Working Group placing so much focus there. One representative also chose to focus heavily on the energy consumption of Bitcoin mentioning coal power plants coming back on line to fuel Bitcoin mining. The witnesses from the crypto industry seemed to focus on dispelling misconceptions and also pushing for a single crypto focused regulatory body as opposed to the fragmented regulation that is typical in Washington.

personalfinance,Investing Advice for frugal 22yo (FIRE),"* I'm 22yo, just graduated college/started working full time June 2021, been frugal my whole life
* Looking to be financially free (comfortable living off investments) and *maybe* retire early
   * Comfortable  = 50k spending a year? Not sure yet
* I make 85k (salary + bonus) and take home 64k after federal, state, Medicare, SS tax.
   * After Rent + other spendings (24k), I'm left with 40k or 3.3k a month or $770/wk
   * My salary is expected to grow 7-10% a year, 5% 401k match, and company stock awards
* Current net worth 52k with 52k invested
   * Brokerages 39K, HSA + Roth 401k + Roth IRA 8k, Series I Bond 5k
   * I do have 15k cash sitting to pay off student loans soon, but also for emergencies if needed
* I put $500/wk or $26k/yr into my brokerages
   * $400/wk goes into boring ETFs (QQQ, VOO, VTI, SCHD etc)
   * $100/wk goes into individual stocks, selling credit spreads on SPY, buying LEAPS
* I put in 5% of my paycheck into my Roth 401k ($157 biweekly) just to get my company match.
   * Cannot buy/trade individual stocks or options in my 401k
   * The max per yr is 20k, $157\*26 = $4082
* I max out my Roth IRA (6k/yr) where I invest more aggressively than my 401k

My questions are

1. Since I want the *option* to retire early (mid 30s-40s), I'm not sure how much to allocate to my brokerages vs my Roth 401(k). Is my currently allocation (invest all in brokerage) ok? Should I gradually shift towards the Roth 401k as I grow older?
2. Too much of my net worth in stocks/ETFs? Should I look to get some equity in a house? If so, when? 20% down payment in my area is around 50-60k
3. I'm going to be a higher tax bracket next year (12% --&gt; 22%), would this change anything in terms of my current investing plan?
4. Any other advice for the above bullet points. Would love to hear any and all opinions.

Thank you all in advance.",finance

CryptoCurrency,2021 End tips and ideas for new people entering crypto in 2022,"Morning team - happy NYE (England Resident so it is early here) 

Thought i'd produce a sort of small checklist (Mainly for new people entering the crypto space in the new year) although some people already in this space may also benefit:

\- Find the best crypto platforms for staking and earning passive interest from your coins, i know platforms like CDC offer good interest rates and for other coins like ZIL there are apps like moonlet,

\- Try to research potential airdrops, most end up being pointless or scams but some could be useful and could be worth getting. 

\- Earn free crypto through BAT &amp; Brave, it is a miniature amount monthly but they are still better than nothing. 

For me staking really is a good form of earning passive income, I Currently stake DOT / EWT / ZIL and plan on staking OCEAN in the next few months, i've actually made a loss on ZIL as i bought at 7p and it's now at like 5p, however that loss has been mitigated by the amount of ZIL i earn from staking,

Let's move forward in the new year and help all new people we can, have a great NYE TEAM!",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,An average persons critique of bitcoin,"I made a post in the subreddit of my small country asking if there's anyone with a negative attitude towards bitcoin who is willing to have a one-on-one conversation, so i could hear their criticism, respond to it, and in doing so maybe test my knowledge and argumentation.

In short, no one was willing to actually talk, but i got a slew of comments dissing bitcoin - enough of them that i decided to do some statistics to share with you: **what are the average persons arguments against bitcoin?** Maybe this sheds light on the average persons view on bitcoin and helps some of us to be better prepared to answer questions in the future or approach someone new to bitcoin.

Overall, 80% of the comments were negative towards bitcoin, with the average negative comment garnering 6,5 upvotes and the average positive comment 0.75 downvotes.

**It's not money (60% of answers)**

Many points were made that i would gather under the general message of bitcoin not being an actual form of currency or store of value. The reasons used (in order of popularity) were:  
\- I can't use it to buy anything  
\- It's an example of the ""greater fool"" game  
\- It's not backed by anything (gold, silver and real estate were brought up as better alternatives)  
\- It's just speculation  
\- It doesn't create value  
\- It's value is based on just belief  
\- It's a pyramid/ponzi scheme

**It's bad money (43% of answers)**

A number of people saw bitcoin as something that at least tries to be some sort of currency, but totally fails because of it's shortcomings. The reasons used (again in order of popularity), were:  
\- It's easily manipulated (by the illuminati, mining equipment producers or whales)  
\- It's volatile (here, everyone brought this years price as an example of infinite up and down movement, failing to look beyond. Also, Elon tweeting and changing the price was quoted many times)  
\- Transactions are slow and expensive  
\- No one will want to pay with bitcoin if it's value is bound to rise in the future  
\- It supports crime  
\- Governments will ban it  
\- It deepens economic inequality (small number of wallets hold most of the coins)  
\- Mining is just like printing money

**It's bad for the environment (19% of answers)**

Here, both bitcoins energy usage and e-waste in the form of used graphics cards were quoted as damaging nature. Many had the opinion that mining is ""stealing"" much-needed energy from the grid, causing energy shortages. Proof of Stake was mentioned as a better solution multiple times.

**Inflation is good (14% of answers)**

This surprised me. Many, many people saw inflation as something not needing to be solved. They argued saving money is bad for the economy and inflation provides incentive to consume goods. They pointed out that bitcoin disrupts the ability for world banks to conduct monetary policy and steer the economy, which they should be able to do. It was also pointed out that it would be impossible to take loans in a currency that constantly deflates.

**The price of graphics cards (11% of answers)**

Here people were blaming bitcoin mining for the chip shortage and inflated prices of graphics cards. It was said that computational power is wasted on mining and should be put to better use, i.e. to do science.

**If it's so good, why is it still not used after 10 years (11% of answers)**

Also a point that, for me, was made surprisingly commonly. The fact that bitcoin is not the reserve currency of the world after existing for 10 years, despite being advertised as ""the future"", was seen as proof that it never will be. On many occasions people were asking for concrete information about future adoption: when exactly can i pay with it, how much longer exactly do we have to wait for the volatility to end, how much exactly will it cost in the future?

Only a few people were non-aggressive and had actual questions, one of which i could not answer, so maybe you could help me out: if mining power falls in the hands of fewer and fewer growing mining pools and powerful miners, doesn't that make bitcoin less decentralized?

Hope this somehow helps.",cryptocurrency
stocks,"Pelosi’s husband bought Google, Disney call options that would pay off if bull market continues","U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband may be be positioning himself to profit from the ongoing rise in the share prices of some of America’s biggest companies. Paul Pelosi, the California Democrat’s spouse, bought call options that give him the right, but not the obligation, to purchase shares in Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, -0.31% GOOG, -0.34%, memory-chip company Micron Technology Inc. MU, -2.37%, [Salesforce.com](https://Salesforce.com) Inc. CRM, +0.31% and Walt Disney Corp. DIS, +0.68% at prices that are upwards of 45% below their closing trading levels on the days in which he made the transactions, according to a periodic transaction report filed with the government.

Federal law requires members of Congress to file reports within 45 days after they or their spouses purchase or sell securities exceeding a value of $1,000, along with a rough estimate of how much the transactions were worth.

Pelosi, owner and operator of a San Francisco–based real estate and venture capital investment and consulting firm, purchased between $500,000 and $1 million in call options in Alphabet stock with a strike price of $2,000 and an expiration date of Sept. 16, 2022, about 30% below the closing price of the stock on Dec. 17, 2021, the day of the transaction, according to FactSet. He bought between $250,000 and $500,000 in call options in Micron shares with a strike price of $50 and an identical expiration date, about 45% below the closing price on Dec. 21, the day of the transaction.

The speaker’s husband also bought between $600,000 and $1.25 million in call options in Salesforce with a strike price of $210 and an expiration date of Jan. 20, 2023, about 15% below the stock’s closing price of $247.21 on the day of the transaction, Dec. 20. He bought between $100,000 and $250,000 in call options in Walt Disney shares with a strike price of $130 and an expiration date of Sept. 16, 2022, roughly 13% below the stock’s closing price of $148.76 on the day of the transaction, Dec. 17.

personalfinance,"Any benefit to paying off student loans now, way before interest even starts?","My federal student loans have been further paused by COVID-19 relief through May 1st, 2022, meaning 0% interest and a suspension of loan payments if I understand correctly. My family is insistent that I pay off the loans today - approximately $7,500. But, I wonder if I should just wait until sometime in April.

I figure that I might need the funds for some other emergency like needing a new car if mine breaks or some medical expense. Perhaps there is even some sort of a tax benefit by waiting until next year to pay it, since I started my only 2021 job in August and next year could have a higher taxable income.

Is there any benefit - financial or otherwise - to paying off my student loans in full now, before the new year? Am I forgetting some vital piece of information? Thanks.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Met with a Financial Advisor who oversees $650+ Million.. Is highly against against crypto and does not offer Crypto to his clients.,"Through some business contacts and seeking some investors into a business I’m looking to start-up, I was introduced to a financial advisor. All i have to say, is this guy is damn good. Runs and operates his own practice and works with individuals in over 26 states. I could go on and on about him. Been fortunate enough that putting myself out there has led to this connections. 

I had some business questions, financial questions and questions in regards to the infrastructure bill. Once I got to my Crypto question and asked his thoughts - here was his response:

“You want to know my thoughts on the whole crypto? I don’t like it and here’s why. It has no backing and currently all speculative. The value in which some of the assets are worth is ridiculous. I just don’t see the point in it, yet. Why are you so heavily invested?” - I gave my reasons and he then said this to me..

“I had a client walk in yesterday, we’re talking someone bringing close to 5 million for me to oversee and help them. One of their main questions was, do I offer crypto? I told them no and they took their business to another state. Sure, that amount sucked to see walk out, but i can’t offer it if I don’t believe in it.”

I’m not saying we’re still early, as it seems each day we get closer and closer to mass adoption - but I just thought I’d share my story about meeting with someone whose name has been all over the country and oversees some massive money. Needless to say, we may be doing business in the future and will have to help him learn crypto, lol!

Edit: I think i should add clarification - While he sees crypto as speculative and overpriced currently for use cases, his main concern is centered around the infrastructure bill, student loan postponement/forgiveness, interest rate hikes and so on. He’s keeping a close eye on all of that info and will update me as it moves. He’s not calling a “crash”, but he has mentioned things are going to get very choppy possibly this year and into 2023.",cryptocurrency

He has been setting aside money to pay them off since the start of covid, but has not paid a dime directly to them since they were put on pause. He now has the entire amount of the loans (~34k) saved up in his HYSA and earmarked to go to pay them off once the pause ends. We are getting married in early May, and prior to covid, the plan was for him to pay them off before the wedding. I wanted to minimize debt we bring into the marriage. Now, he wants to wait to pay them until the pause ends (regardless of when that is) or until the loans are forgiven. I see his point, but it does make me uncomfortable to carry around extra debt unnecessarily. What do y’all think?

Additional info:
- We will combine finances after marriage. 
- Combined income will be around 300k give or take about 40k. 
- Only other debts are car loans (~18k mine and ~44k his, but his payment is covered in full every month by his job)
- We pay off our credit cards every month
- We plan to buy a house in the next couple years, we want to buy something around $300k with a 20% down payment which we are working on saving up.",finance

Ford Motor Co. is recalling nearly 185,000 F-150 pickup trucks over an issue with the vehicle's driveshaft that could increase the risk of a crash, according to documents filed with federal safety regulators this month.


The recall of some 184,698 units from model years 2021 and 2022 that may be affected is due to an issue in which ""underbody heat and noise insulators may loosen and contact the aluminum driveshaft, which could damage the driveshaft and cause it to fracture,"" according to the safety recall. Ford notified the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the recall Dec. 16.


A fractured driveshaft could cause the loss of drive power, or the loss of vehicle control if the driveshaft comes into contact with the ground, according to the recall notice. ""Additionally, unintended movement could occur while parked if the parking brake is not engaged. Any of these scenarios can increase the risk of a crash.""

As of Dec. 7, there had been 27 reports of fractured aluminum driveshafts, according to Ford. The Dearborn automaker says it is not aware of any injuries or crashes related to the issue.",finance

personalfinance,Selling financed vehicles to get out of negative equity,"I purchased a certified used suv in 2020. My loan amount was really inflated because I had negative equity on the vehicle. The car payment is $508 but my wife and I have been contributing $600 most months. The terms of the remaining loan are 59 Months (originally 72, which is terrible I know), 4.99% interest rate. The current payoff amount is $25,667. I received an online appraisal from Carmax for $24,000 (I have already shopped around with carvana and vroom). My previous appraisal that expired on 12/27 was $25,000 so I am really kicking myself, but I wasn't able to coordinate the logistics of dropping off the vehicle in time before the previous quote expired on 12/27.

Our main goal is to lower our monthly payment, increase our monthly cash flow to pay down credit card debt. We have another vehicle, an old honda SUV. Our daily commutes are negligible, my wife's daily commute is 5 miles round trip, I work hybrid, mostly remote and occasionally I have to travel locally a few times a month to check on nearby properties (property management) and also carry out other misc. tasks. At this time the newer car is more of a luxury than a need (when I purchased it in 2020 I was in a different job that required a more dependable vehicle, and we did not have that second vehicle).

We could definitely afford the payment, but getting out of the really bad car note is a plus for us, we would have to pay the difference of $1,667 to proceed with the transaction of course. We also figure that for a monthly payment of $600, we can get into 2 separate vehicles instead of what we are paying for 1, as we anticipate the old beater car not lasting forever, but in the meantime, maybe 3-6 months sticking with the 1 older car to save up some money. I guess another alternative is to put the $1,667 toward the principal and try to refinance, but I don't think the monthly payment would be that much lower if I wanted to shorten the loan term.

Any thoughts?",finance
Trading,Can someone help me understand how margin trading works,"I am about to begin margin trading and have been doing research, here are some of the question I couldn't easily get an answer to from Google

\- Is margin interest rate charged per month or annually?

\- How exactly is the interest rate calculated? If I have $1000 in cash and have 1:4 margin available as buying power with an interest rate of 8%, do I pay 8% of $4000 at the end of the month? Even if I only used the full available margin sparingly?

\- I am getting contradictory answers from this online, some say you're charged the interest rate only if you hold overnight with margin, others say you're charged so long as you use the margin for trading regardless of whether you use it intraday or hold overnight, what is the truth of the matter?

\- If I execute a successful trade on margin does all the profit belong to me and I'll only have to pay the monthly/annual interest rate or does my broker get a cut from the profits I made using their provided money?",finance

Some of this money is from unused stipends which is untaxed and not counted towards income. I make $70/hr hourly so roughly $10,000/month thats taxed. I will be taking home rounghly $53,000 by the end of this contract come the end of April.

   I have $26,000 invested in a 403b through Fidelity over the last 3 years at my old job with that I’m still technically employed at. I put in about $2500 into 403b roth this year. Can I still contribute to my 403b by transferring money from my checking? The only way I know how to contribute is through my paycheck and I haven’t had one there in 2 months. I’d like to max out my Roth contributions, can I make up the difference through a Roth IRA? I can contribute to a 401k through my agency, but they won’t match (3%) until I’ve worked with them roughly 6 months. There is also a chance I could switch agencies for different contracts so I may never have any employer matching.
  My level of financial/investing knowledge is limited, but I’ve always been responsible.  I didn’t start my career until later in life and I’m trying to play catch up financially. I’m doing my best to learn I just need to know where to start. 
 As mentioned I just bought a house for 245,000 with 5% down. I have a loan for about $232,000 with a 3.25% interest rate. Part of me really wants to pay off another 15% so I can have the PMI removed (~$40/month), but I realize there may be better places to put my money. 
   Finally, My fiance (getting married in September) is a teacher and her income is roughly $3,000 per month. She has a pension and a 403b I thought about just having her put most of her check into her retirement funds.
Sorry for the lengthy post and thank you in advance.

edit: I forgot to mention that portion of my income is stipend money which is untaxed. so If I was to maintain this rate all year it would be $127,000/year. Mind you my rates can fluctuate so I may be making less in 4 months or possibly more depending on the needs.",finance

CryptoCurrency,"2022 is likely to be a market for deep value investors. Even right now, as BTC is weak, some fundamentally strong coins are up 100% in a week. I think this trend will continue of undervalued coins catching up","Happy new year everyone!

We are just coming from a 2021 market where literally everything pumped, from dog coins to squid to the worst imaginable shitcoin and jpeg, everything had their day. Many millionaires were made, almost all the top coins posted their ATHs in 2021. 

Yet some coins were fundamentally delivering value, but never pumped as much as a dog coin did. Few protocols that generate constant revenue, week after week, but are not even in the top 100 because the bull market decided a dog coin is worth $50 bn market cap, but not a protocol that generates revenue of $100m a year. 

Right now, as BTC is in the dumps, couple of coins are strongly moving upwards - FXS and CVX have both done almost 100% this week. CVX controls billions of dollars under its belt, and is turning into one of the crucial infrastructure plumbing for defi but is just at the edge of the top 100. FXS may be even behind, though the team never stopped building. 

COMP, an OG lending protocol is now available almost at a 2020 price. SNX is another protocol that has been beaten to death endlessly simply because it didnt create any hype to pump its price, but prioritised building. SNX has an entire L2 chain Optimism surrounding it, with multiple projects like Lyra, Kwenta and Aelin brining futures, options and venture capitalism investing to layer 2, but it's not even in the top 100. Because pump and dump shitcoins could generate hype and push their prices up

Well, at one point all the hype runs out. You can only pump a coin based on ""reflections"" and burns so much... when the narrative dies, the shitcoin quickly falls out of favor and is forgotten. 

Those projects that kept building silently throughout the past few years will get a chance to shine. 

So pick your targets carefully, we may be seeing a fundamental shift in the market over the coming year, as the fed tighten interest rates and liquid cash is removed from the system, all the hype coins are very likely to disappear and projects that have cash flow and users more likely to take centre stage.

Reinstatement amount due is $177K. Current principal balance is $159K at 4.75% interest rate. Lists overdue payments as $153K with an additional ~$20K in lender paid legal fees. Property is prob worth $300-350K depending on its condition.

Around the same time, my grandfather passed away. He left me with a significant inheritance of $50,000.00. I have three student loans (two from Federal Govt and one from a bank) totaling $52,559.45. The two federal loans total $42,576.06 with interest rates ranging from 4.66% to 2.75%. The bank loan was a $10,000 loan, now $9,984.65,  with an interest rate of 4.59%.

I've calculated my budget to show I will have an excess of $900 each month, not factoring in the months I will be paid three times.

As it stands right now, my emergency savings are non-existent and I am only putting $30 a month towards my Roth IRA, which is at less than a grand.

What would be the best course of action for me to take? Should I use all of the $50k inheritance and a few months excess budget on student loans to pay them off asap so I can start growing my retirement? Should I just pay off the high-interest loans and put the rest of the inheritance elsewhere, like a CD or robo-advisor (betterment, etc)? Or should I do something completely different?",finance

personalfinance,Logistics of financing a new car and investing the saved amount?,"hi /r/personalfinance,

My partner and I have saved up enough cash to purchase a new car that we've been wanting. A pretty common piece of advice that I've read here and in other PF books/forums/etc is that when interest rates are low (&lt; 3%), one is better off taking the financing and investing the saved amount. What I haven't seen accompany that advice is how that all is supposed to work in practice.

Is the idea that you finance only an amount that your monthly cash flow can handle (i.e., use the saved amount to make a big enough down payment that you can incorporate the monthly payments into your normal budget), then invest the rest and leave it alone? Or are you supposed to be withdrawing from the invested amount on a monthly basis to make the payment? Or maybe some third option that I'm not understanding. 

At the heart of it, I'm just trying to understand the benefit of this path vs the opposite where we would pay for the car in cash and then invest the amount that we otherwise would have spent on monthly payments.

thanks!",finance

CryptoCurrency,Why DeFi won't replace the normal loan system and most likely won't go far,"So I stumbled on a hornets nest with my last post. Now I want to play devil's advocate and kick the hornets nest to see what happens. Note I actually do think DeFi will take off when Web 3.0 takes off. Where you can do things like use your house deed NFT as collateral similar to what you can with banks.

But one of the problems with DeFi is how it works, and this will hold it back and is why I said even in that post it won't replace what we have now.

# How DeFi works right now

How it works is pretty simple. Lets say you want to use your coin x as collateral. You have $100 worth, and the DeFi protocol uses a 80% which means you can owe up to 80% of the collateral (some are lower so note this). You normally would borrow in a stable coin. If coin x price drops a bit then you can get liquidated, but if it goes up then you can borrow more. Note the interest rate which normally is around 1%-10%

But if what you owe is greater than the limit (normally there is some wiggle room and it's very upfront about this), then you will get liquidated.

But because you only need to have the accepted asset, this means anyone at any age for any reason can take out a loan with no question and no KYC. And since it's a trustless system you don't have to worry about something like a bank foreclosing or whatever on a loan by of screwup of theirs (look at examples during the 2008 crash of things like this happening when someone got trigger happy).

&amp;#x200B;

# The problem

This means you will need to have the collateral upfront to actually get the loan. Meaning student loans and first time house buyers most likely won't be able to do this at all. And startups and other things like that won't be able to do this.

And this is where the majority of loans are. Where you have to prove you have a stable job, you can pay back your loans on time, and follow whatever backwards logic of rules.

Plus without it becoming far more user friendly, it would be hard for it to become mainstream.

# In theory

In theory it might be possible to do some undercollateralized loan with DeFi. But this would require some credit scoring system like what happens in the USA. But the problem with this is we are a little ways out from something like this to be out since it would be hard to make that trustless. Like if someone figures out how to game the system then problems will happen.

&amp;#x200B;

# Where DeFi is currently useful

Note I never taken out a loan before and don't really care much around that. I'm more interested in the technology and how it can fix some other problems. But the biggest thing I can see DeFi being useful for is microloans. From my understanding it's pretty hard to get banks to agree to microloans like $500 or whatever because they don't view it as worth their time or whatever. Lets say your car breaks down, you run into some health problem, or something else. You have some coin x and have more than enough to pay for the problem. But you don't want to sell because taxes or some other reasons. You can get a loan out on that by using it as collateral. Then as long as you pay it off in time then all is good (maybe you need the money now and you get paid in a week or 2).

&amp;#x200B;

UPDATE: I forgot to add, one of the interesting things with DeFi is you don't need a human to take out a loan. Meaning if your company is ran by an AI or maybe some DAO. It can take out the loan with no problem
