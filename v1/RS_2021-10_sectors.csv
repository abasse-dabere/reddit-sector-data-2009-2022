I pulled some recent paychecks to look at how much my retirement contributions were affecting my taxes.

For reference, I make $26 an hour, roughly $31 with my shift differentials. Paychecks are bi-weekly

2 paychecks ago:

Total earnings: $2438.41. I have 404.67$ pre-tax deductions ($373.60 into HSA, 457b and 403 accounts; $31.07 for dental and health insurance)

withholding tax federal: $178.47 Medicare and social security: $170.38

Someone told me that federal tax rate does not include Medicare and social security and my federal taxes should be somewhere above 12% based on my extrapolated income of $63,388 from this pay period but it comes out to 11.4% including pre-tax deductions

My most recent paycheck I increased my retirement contribution by $200 a paycheck. I also only made $2163.95. Fed withholding tax is only 7.8% of my post deduction income.

I just stated working in June, so maybe it's because my income for the year is still low ($14,500 total for the year so far). So maybe that's why.

I am worried that I may be hit with a lot of back taxes, but I think it is far more likely I just don't understand taxes at all. Any input would be wonderful.",finance

cardano,"Cardano Rumor Rundown October 1, 2021","Hey Everyone!

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. In late 2008/early 2009 it turns out Hal Finney was learning Haskell and trying to figure out how to reduce C02 emissions from a (future) widely used Bitcoin. That sounds a lot like Cardano. [https://twitter.com/seal\_kiman/status/1443593563846193155](https://twitter.com/seal_kiman/status/1443593563846193155)

3. Wow! It‚Äôs looking like Meld has landed a partnership with a mobile provider in Nigeria with nine million customers. Not many details out at this point (Sept 30). But, that certainly sounds like it could be gigantic. [https://twitter.com/MELD\_labs/status/1443548879966949382](https://twitter.com/MELD_labs/status/1443548879966949382)

4. If Web 3 will really be a building of new economies out of online communities and the units of value of those economies will be tokens and NFTs, it seems like a blockchain like Cardano that can generate those assets natively without smart contracts is going to be a central player.

stocks,Some mistakes I've made as a new investor.,"I'm writing this for me as much as for anyone else.  I don't expect seasoned investors to learn anything from this, but new guys might be able to pick something up, or at least be able to relate.

**Background:** I had been investing in a target retirement fund with annual contributions, but I didn't have much interest in stocks until the GME saga.  GME was my first stock purchase, and after that I realized I could be buying individual stocks.  I also had a lot of money on the sidelines due to reduced spending during Covid, stimulus checks, some gifts from my family, etc.  I decided to fully invest.

Since then, things have been OK, but September has not been a good month for me (as it hasn't been for most of us).  I have thought of a few things thats I could have done leading up to this that would have muted the impact and helped me perform better in the long-run.  Here's a list of them:

1. **Have my strategy clear before buying in.**  I rebalanced my portfolio several times as I learned more, and some of those led to me selling at a loss because I feared I had made a bad purchase.  I'm talking about fundamentals as well as about my investment thesis in general: do I want index funds?  Individual stocks? Growth stocks?  Value?  Dividends?
2. **Don't buy all at once.**  I think the statistic is that 67% of the time lump sum beats dollar cost average (correct me if I'm wrong).  Well, it looks like I was the 33%.  In my particular case, this was super important because I was sitting on a large one-time investment that won't be repeated in the future.  My income doesn't match what I initially invested.  I wish I had been more patient and waited for better buying opportunities, or at the very least invested a set quantity every month or so.
3. **Don't mess with foreign exchange or other things I don't understand**.  I was worried about inflation so I put all my portfolio's cash in FXF Swiss Franc trust.  Fed promptly took a more hawkish turn and rate fears caused the dollar to rise and the franc to fall.  I bled money.  I did not understand how rates or other factors would affect the value of this investment.
4. **Double check dividends**.  A small one but I didn't realize that the dividend yield on Google Finance isn't always in line with the truth or what the payout is long-term.
5. **Don't just look at PE or other near-term indicators.**  I was adamant about avoiding overvalued stocks, which I am happy about.  That said, I would see a stock with a PE of 15 or less and say ""well that's fairly priced!""  Not necessarily.  A mistake I made twice was forgetting that some companies did better during Covid, so their earnings per share are high right now but might not be as high going forward.  The same with dividend yield and other indicators.  This was the case with LOGI and NTDOY for me.  I should have had a better understanding of the company's revenue and fundamentals.
6. **Remember we're dealing with money here.** I know this sounds silly, but as a young first-time investor all of this is kind of fun and exciting.  That's all well and good, I think, but I suppose I may have lost sight of the fact that this isn't just something you should do willy-nilly.  You really have to know what you're doing before you hit that buy button.  Seeing a lot of red has made it all very real for me, which is great in the long-term.  Experience is the best teacher.

That said, I thought it was fair to share some of my successes:

1. **I avoided hype or overvalued stocks, and I bought good companies.**  Luckily my portfolio is quite conservative, so no matter how far down we go I am confident that long-term I will be okay.  The only issue is that I could have done better if I had been more prudent.
2. **I bought some dividend stocks.**  Some people might disagree with me, but the benefit of having some dividend payers is that they continue to pay out even in the event of a downturn.  Who knows where the market is going, but if we do have a protracted correction or bear market, I feel a certain comfort in knowing that my portfolio includes a healthy dividend component.
3. **I kept an emergency fund**.  I invested in series I (inflation protected) bonds as a second-tier emergency fund.  Like I said, I was really excited about investing, and invested the bulk of my money.  If I had been just a little less prudent, I wouldn't have kept a solid savings fund and would now feel like I was in more trouble than I am.
4. **My retirement is safe in a target retirement fund.** I didn't want to play around too much.  At age 30 I can always afford to work harder or switch jobs or something if my brokerage account tanks.  But I don't want to play around with my retirement.  Yes, the indexes are bleeding, but long-term we all know that they're going up.  Better safe than sorry.
5. **I learned.**  It's all a learning experience. I could have had better long-term gains on my initial investment, but hey, all of this is the price of lessons well learned.

Hope y'all find value in this.  Feel free to share anything you've made a mistake on or where you've done well.

Good luck to all!",finance

energy,"Oil price dynamics, opec decision and US federal reserves, discussion","Hello everyone,
I was wondering what the community thinks about the next OPEC meeting, and if you think that Biden will eventually decide to release US oil reserves 

Personally, I think that OPEC might prefer not to give much space to US gov requests as we are still approaching winter and COVID is not yet dead 

Plus, the supply and demand imbalances look horrific for next year (US Midterm elections in November) thus it would make sense to use reserves next year eventually

Thanks a lot for your feedbacks",energy

He sent a screen shot of just the 2.875% rate showing that it was locked, and said that it was fine to sign the first estimate since it's just a ""working document"" and can be changed later.

stocks,"U.S. inflation rises sharply again in August and stays at 30-year high, PCE shows","The cost of goods and services rose sharply again in August and left the rate of U.S. inflation at a 30-year high, with all signs pointing to price pressures snaking into next year. The personal consumption expenditure price index climbed 0,4% in August, the government said Friday. It was the sixth straight big increase. The rate of inflation in the 12 months ended in August edged up to 4.3% from 4.2% ‚Äî the highest rate since 1991, when George H.W. Bush was president.

Until very recently, Federal Reserve leaders insisted inflation would start to fall back to toward pre-pandemic levels of 2% or less by the end of this year. Yet in the past week senior central bank leaders acknowledged inflation could remain high well into 2022 because of ongoing shortages of crucial business supplies and and even labor. The central bank wants inflation to average 2% a year in the long run, using the PCE gauge as its starting point.

**Big picture:** The highest rate of inflation in decades is squeezing families and businesses and acting as a bit of a drag on the economy. The big question is how long it lasts. Most of the increase in inflation is tied to the full reopening of the economy. A huge burst of pentup demand overwhelmed the ability of businesses to keep up, especially with computer chips and other materials in short supply. Faced with higher costs, businesses have raised prices, too. Thus the surge in inflation. These shortages were expected to ease by now, but instead it looks like it could get even worse. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the shortages could last until next summer. 

A separate measure of inflation that strips out volatile food and energy prices rose 0.3% in August. It‚Äôs known as the core rate and is viewed by the Fed as a more reliable weathervane for inflationary trends. The increase in the core rate over the past 12 months was unchanged at 3.6%, but it was also at a 30-year peak. The PCE index is viewed as a more accurate measure of inflation than the better known consumer price index. It tracks a broader range of goods and gives more weight to substitution ‚Äî when consumers buy a cheaper product to substitute for a more expensive one.

Also on Friday, the government said consumer spending rose 0.8% in August. The increase was just half as big if inflation is taken into account.

financialindependence,Canadian FIRE: Considerations for those of us (mostly) North of the 49th parallel,"Hi all, 

&amp;#x200B;

Canadian FIRE question:

Has anyone here found any good write-ups on taking CPP/OAS early or late when planning to retire aggressively earlier than normal? I'm very curious about the ideas around including federal programs in FIRE planning, but more often than not, I see people exclude them from their calculation. 

All of this is just hypothetical discussion points and I don't advocate for either path. I'm not interested in milking the MOST money possible out of the system based on dying at age X. I'm just curious about strategies for FIRE planning and others' thoughts on the topic. 

&amp;#x200B;

Proposed options:

Plan A)

If you assume that you'll work at a maximum pensionable earnings level from 24 to 44 and will draw CPP and OAS as early as possible you may only get \~$15k/yr, or $30k/yr for a couple. Not bad, but maybe less than people would be able to live on comfortably, so they'd need some additional savings to top up the difference. Okay, we can plan for that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Plan B)

If you assume that the same couple will delay their CPP/OAS until 70 they are entitled to \~$27k/yr, or $54k/yr for a couple. That's an income level that people may be able to live on fairly comfortably in their 70s and onwards without any additional income. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thoughts:

Plan A)

The supplemental income you'd receive from CPP/OAS would do a lot of the lifting for your portfolio in the future and it would likely drop a 4% SWR to a 2% (or whatever), so as long as you still had a half decent nest egg after 16 years of withdrawals you'd likely still be fine, with a portfolio well situated to grow significantly for the rest of your life at your now-lower SWR. You'd have more exposure to the markets in old age, but less exposure to possible changes to Canadian retirement program changes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Plan B)

If theoretical people were to work for 20 years then retire at 44 (or whatever age) and plan to self-fund their retirement until 70, then be dependent on government programs for the remainder of their lives at a relatively comfortable level, that would alleviate effectively all sequence of return risks for a 4% rule SWR adherence since you'd only be covering your own costs for only 26 years (not 30) with a huge likelihood that you'd still have lots of the money you started with if not more, and any kind of longevity concerns should be covered by the fact that you've locked in a comfortable living after your 70th birthday regardless of how long you live or what happens to the markets after that. You'd have less exposure to the markets in old age, but more exposure to possible changes to Canadian retirement program changes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Assumptions:

Personally, I don't think there's much of a realistic risk to the future of CPP/OAS. I regularly hear people worry about CPP/OAS in Canada because there's so much attention given to the health of Social Security in America, which is entirely different and not at all related to Canada's system. CPP is not paid out of general revenue like SS, it's funded by us, managed separately from government, and is forward calculated by actuaries every three years. At last check it was reported to be iron-clad looking forward for 75 years at the minimum. It's also being beefed up over the coming decade to be even better. OAS is a different situation, but considering most people depend on it for basic needs in retirement there's a near-zero chance that it could be messed with, politically speaking, considering the population will only continue to get older and therefore wouldn't tolerate having benefits they're counting on being cut. I could be wrong, but I doubt it. I'm inclined to believe the exact opposite will occur over the coming decades and federal retirement benefits will get more generous, not less. It just seems to be the trend lately. 

&amp;#x200B;

Questions for the group:

Am I wrong about any of these ideas in a fundamental way? 

Considering the above, would you rather Plan A) or Plan B)?",finance
personalfinance,"How to use my savings - set up an IRA, contribute more to my 401k, or pay down student loans?","Hey y'all, I've been able to save a good chunk of change during COVID and I'm a bit torn on how I want to allocate my savings. Here's the rundown of my situation:

* I currently have a bit over $29k in student debt across 9 federal loans
* Roughly $21.5k of my loans have an interest rate higher than 4%
* I have funds set aside to make a lump sum payment of $10k at the end of COVID forbearance (toward the highest interest loans ofc)
* I currently have another $10k unallocated in my savings. Still getting my average monthly expenses nailed down since I just moved out last month, but I expect that number to increase by a few grand by the time forbearance ends
* I have an emergency fund with 3mo of income
* My employer has 401k match that I'm already taking full advantage of
* Long story short, I'm also expecting my employer to put $4-5k toward my student loans over the next 2-3 years. The specifics aren't important for Reddit beyond the number
* 23yo, $80k salary, no car, no roommates. Staying on my parents' insurance until I age out, I'm only paying for any expenses not covered by their plan. High-ish COL; tbh its cheaper out here than it is in my hometown lol

My thoughts on the student loans: I'm pretty confident this fall and winter will be one of the best opportunities I have to be aggressive with my loans without sacrificing travel/entertainment plans, since COVID's already done that for me. My goal isn't ""pay down my loans ASAP"" as much as it is ""avalanche my way to lower monthly payments while I ride out the anticipated payments from my employer, and be more aggressive after those dry up.""

My thoughts on the IRA/401K: I'm under the impression that beyond that lump sum loan payment I'm planning to make, my money would be working harder for me in retirement savings than loan repayment. I'm also under the impression that its ideal to have both a 401K and an IRA, but that its better to max out a 401k before maxing out an IRA? I can max out an IRA this year and in future years without difficulty, not confident I'm there yet with my 401k. A traditional IRA seems like a better fit for me than a Roth. I'm very much a novice with managing investments and still learning the ins and outs.

I feel like the best answer is going to be some combination of these three, but I'd really appreciate some feedback on my options here. Thanks y'all!",finance

A rallying cry of the day traders that hang out in Reddit Inc.‚Äôs stock market forums is that only by joining forces can they prosper in an environment inherently hostile to small investors. Recent events suggest their suspicion that the decks are stacked against them is justified ‚Äì which is a terrible look for capitalism.

Daniel Taylor, a professor at the Wharton School, has amassed evidence of widespread insider trading by company executives, Bloomberg Businessweek reported this week. An investigation by the Wall Street Journal found that more than 130 U.S. federal judges failed to recuse themselves from 685 court cases involving companies in which they or their families had investments. And at the Federal Reserve, two policymakers have resigned amid a probe into their personal trading activity.  

Wharton professor Taylor‚Äôs research has shown that corporate insiders consistently dumped holdings before official legal probes hurt their company‚Äôs shares, Businessweek reported. They also increased their buying and selling in the gaps between audit reports being produced for company boards and being made publicly available, and exploited rules governing scheduled trading schedules for profit.

His analysis suggests the existing regulations governing insider trading are inadequate. It also implies that the Securities and Exchange Commission is asleep at the wheel: The watchdog instigated only 33 insider trading cases last year and just 32 in 2019, the fewest in more than two decades, according to Businessweek.

Since 1974, federal law has explicitly prohibited U.S. judges from overseeing cases in which they or their immediate family have a ‚Äúlegal or equitable interest, however small,‚Äù the Journal reported earlier this week. But the newspaper found that in two-thirds of the cases in which judiciary members had a stake, the rulings would have benefited their finances.  

At the U.S. central bank, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and Dallas Fed chief Robert Kaplan both resigned within hours of each other on Monday. Both had revealed questionable investing activity in their annual financial disclosures. And while they said the trades were within the central bank‚Äôs rules, both are being scrutinized further. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking carefully at the trading that was done to make sure that it‚Äôs in compliance with our rules and with the law,‚Äù Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told the Senate Banking Committee.

In light of those embarrassing events in the U.S., you‚Äôd hope that every central bank in the world is currently getting busy reviewing the protocols governing what policy makers are allowed to do with their personal portfolios while in office. You‚Äôd also hope that every central banker in the world is examining their investment activities and tappity-tapping a resignation letter if their pursuit of personal profit is at odds with the probity of their position.

Capitalism is still tarnished by the aftershocks of the global financial crisis, when the risks taken by private capital had to be bailed out by public funds. And the growing prevalence of the fastest-growing companies staying off public markets and funding their expansion instead with private capital keeps them out of the portfolios of retail buyers, further stoking suspicion that the covenant between capitalism and society is asymmetrical and biased against individual investors.

When corporate executives, judges and policy makers line their own pockets by either bending or breaking rules designed to avoid even the appearance of impropriety, they do a disservice to society as a whole. ‚ÄúMost Americans today believe the stock market is rigged, and they‚Äôre right,‚Äù Wharton‚Äôs Taylor told Businessweek.

Sure, public officials have the same right to set aside income for their retirement or to pay school fees or even to buy sport cars or boats. But they can achieve those goals by putting their money into blind trusts or index funds or other financial products that don‚Äôt involve them selecting specific individual stocks of companies.

The money is transferred now and I verified all the banking info. So I see the dollars sitting there, they're listed as ""Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund"".

I'm having trouble navigating Vanguard's user interface, so I need to ask, should I be doing something next? Does money in an IRA need to be invested in, say, Vanguard Total Index Funds? (where I was going to allocate it/most of it; maybe a mix of that, international, and my age in bonds).

But regardless of those choices, *are* those choices I need to make with an IRA? Or is it just supposed to sit there? Sorry for such a dumb question, I'm new to this and all of the beginner info I've read seems to kind of gloss over these details as a given.

**Edit:** Right now it says my money is in short term reserves. I selected change target allocation and then picked a mix of 70% stocks and 30% bonds, but it's still showing 100% in short term reserves.

**Edit 2:** I found where to buy. Now I'm trying to find the best option, between mutual funds and ETFs. Still not 100% sure the difference. I'm trying to follow the advice I see around a few places for Vanguard Index Funds, but I can't really figure out the correct path to buying that. I see a ton of acronyms that are all very similar.

personalfinance,I want to look into refinancing my car but I am so lost and confused... Is it even a good idea?,"So, I purchased a 2011 Honda almost exactly a year ago. The payments are $285 a month for a 54 month long lease with 16.69% interest rate. The amount I financed is $10,800. I'm sure I can get something better. 

I've made every single payment on time for the lease since I've had it, and my credit is waaaayyyyy better now than when I initially purchased the car. I've been offered refinancing through my credit card company, but turns out they won't actually do it due to the age of my car. I also believe the value for my car is now less than when I purchased it and I'm sure that could pose some issues... Kelly Blue Book says it's now worth $8,000 which is a pretty substantial difference.

I just really want to try to get these payments down but I don't know where to begin. I have credit karma and it shows me some offers but how easy is this process? Is it worth it? Will it hurt my credit? How much of a headache will this cause? I would like advice and first hand experiences if possible please and thank you :)",finance

altcoin,This week‚Äôs Micro Watch List,"**About us: CryptoQuestion is an independent platform providing free resources for cryptocurrency investors. From an on-demand Q&amp;A service to online courses, from our weekly** [**Moonshot Monday**](https://cryptoquestion.tech/weekly-podcast/) **podcast to our weekly Staking and Yield Farming Review. Visit us at** [**www.cryptoquestion.tech**](http://www.cryptoquestion.tech/)

It‚Äôs been a rollercoaster week in the crypto market with the week ending 8% up. There was some positive news which provided further evidence that crypto is here to stay. Firstly the Chairman of the Fed, Jerome Powell, told congress he did not intend to ban crypto currency, although he said stablecoins needed greater regulatory oversight. Secondly, the massive recent negativity surrounding China‚Äôs ban on crypto looks to have been overdone as usual.

It is evident that the Chinese crypto enthusiast has no intention of letting the crypto revolution pass him by. It appears as though they have started trading through DEX‚Äôs as witnessed by the surge in trade on Dydx. Finally the Chair of the SEC said that he supported a bitcoin ETF, another positive step forward for the industry. So all in all a positive week.

Moving swiftly onto our Micro Cap Watch List. It was a mixed week with only a couple of big losers and a handful of winners.

The biggest winners were:

Opacity 63% -  [Opacity price, OPCT chart, market cap, and info | CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/opacity) 

Mysterium 17% -  [Mysterium price, MYST chart, market cap, and info | CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/mysterium) 

ICHI 13%

And the losers:

Handshake -22%

Uno Re -21%

We decided not to add or delete any new cryptocurrencies to our list this week.

[Haven](https://cryptoquestion.tech/inside-track/) \- This week we aired a podcast from the privacy coin Haven. Haven is unique among the many privacy coins in that it‚Äôs platform provides a vault for users to convert their token into a stablecoin. This is a major benefit for investors who are generally looking for privacy, a store of value and stability.

Recently, I opened my first credit card with Capital One and was thinking about making a switch from my credit union to Capital One. I currently have a couple savings accounts with them as Capital One has higher interest rates compared to my credit union. I was thinking to make the switch to Capital One because it may be easier for me to pay my credit card bill and make quick and easy transfers from one account to the other as opposed to my credit union to Capital One which takes 2-3 days. 

My question is, is it a good idea to make the switch? I know it‚Äôs subjective but I just wanted to hear your guy‚Äôs opinion!

stocks,$AMZN - Amazon is Building The Greatest Moat Through Its Logistics Network,"# Amazon Investment Thesis - Logistics moat

* Shipping supply issues have impacted businesses globally, and increased shipping costs hurt operating margins for all retailers.
* Carrier companies are the biggest winner due to supply chain constraints, but there is one retailer that has an advantage despite rising shipping costs.
* Amazon, due to it‚Äôs shipping network (doubled in size in the last 2 years), will be able to absorb these costs because they dominate the ‚ÄúLast Mile Delivery‚Äù which other retailers can‚Äôt control.

# Shipping ‚Äì Bottlenecks In the Supply Chain

Container rates and availability are usually built into annual contracts between shippers and the carriers, and these deals normally have strict requirements, such as only nonstop service between ports or a minimum of two sailings a week.

But little by little over the past 18 months the daily rates quoted by carriers and freight agents have soared.\[1\]

Side note: Earlier this year I wrote about $GSL and how they could take advantage of shipping turmoil. Since sharing the idea, GSL's stock price has increased close to 200%. Original writeup

Transportation costs‚Äîtypically a fraction of a finished product‚Äôs price‚Äîare emerging as another supply-chain hurdle, overwhelming some companies already paying more for raw materials and labor.

The fabric and crafts retailer Jo-Ann Stores LLC said it has spent 10 times more than its historical cost in some cases to move products from one point to another. \[2\]

But it‚Äôs not just shipping containers. Everywhere across the supply chain is getting squeezed as truck drivers are in short supply and gasoline is more expensive than many expected. This is a cost you can‚Äôt control if you are a retailer, you are absorbing these costs form the delivery service,

And it‚Äôs not going to be over soon. A lot of retailers and distributors foresee these problems lasting well into 2023. This bodes very well for Amazon, as I will discuss below.

# Amazon‚Äôs Explosive Shipping Network Growth

Let‚Äôs look at what Amazon can control. Mainly their north American distribution network and facilities. Amazon‚Äôs Distribution Network has doubled over the last 2 years \[3\].

We can also see massive growth in the additions of delivery stations. Amazon now has 250 delivery stations, accounting for 13.9% of it‚Äôs physical footprint, which are the last step (last mile) in the e-commerce distribution chain. \[3\]

**Delivery Stations**: Parcel delivery stations are medium-sized cross-docking facilities mostly to sort parcels bound for specific local delivery routes. Since deliveries are primarily within an urban setting, parcels are usually loaded into delivery vans or other specialized urban delivery vehicles (electric vans and even cargo bicycles)

# Why Delivery Stations Are Important

In the past, Amazon was beholden to USPS, UPS, and FedEx for the last mile delivery, but these are not dedicated to Amazon. In the past, when demand surged, Amazon would experience shipping delays. This impacts their reputation since customers don‚Äôt benefit from Prime ‚Äì same day delivery.

Having these delivery stations means that Amazon can bypass USPS, FedEx, and UPS and perform the vital last mile delivery. It is one of the aspects of their operating margin they can control and ensures the optimal Amazon experience.

# Why Amazon Wins

An increase in shipping costs will squeeze operating margins in the coming quarters, but more importantly, it squeezes competitors. Because the competitors can‚Äôt control other aspects of the supply chain (last mile delivery) they won‚Äôt be able to handle the spike in shipping costs.

**To put it bluntly, Amazon is building one of the greatest moats in history through its logistics network.**

Who knows, maybe they will acquire a shipping company?

personalfinance,What method do I use to pay off extra principal on my mortgage?,"Right now, I am paying $200 extra per month on top of my required monthly payment so that I start to pay down principal. I have a low interest rate, but I still want to pay my mortgage off sooner. 

I read advice that it would be better to open some kind of investment account and use the profits from that to pay extra on my mortgage so that it is reoccurring profit rather than $200 of my paycheck each month. Is this sound advice? And how would someone do this? Do I look for stocks with high dividend payouts?

I usually get a bonus with work once a year, so I would have some additional money to open a decent investment account. (FYI I am maxing out my retirement accounts already so that's not a factor to worry about here.)

CryptoCurrency,Gemini Earn Rate Changes: October Update Up Now,"Gemini Earn updates its prices every month. If you are unfamiliar, Gemini Earn is a trusted lending/staking service associated with the Gemini exchange. It offers strong numbers on several coins, such as GUSD, DAI, FIL, and GRT.

* **ALCX**: 6.2% APY - NEW
* **FIL**: 7.0% APY - **UP** from 7.55% APY
* **GRT**: 6.43% APY - UP from 6.42% APY
* **LINK**: 1.35% APY - DOWN from 2.75% APY
* **LUNA**: 4.52% APY - NEW

retirement,What are the state tax implications of the proposed changes to 401k plans,"One of Joe Biden‚Äôs proposals was to change how 410k contributions are taxed. 

Currently, an employee can choose to contribute to their 410k accounts and deduct their contributions from their taxable income (both for federal and state income tax purposes). This is a great deal especially for people who work in a high state-income tax and plan to retire in a low state-income tax. 

One of the president‚Äôs proposal is that employees will not be able to deduct their contributions but the federal government will give a 26% tax credit for their contributions. 

This sounds like anyone whose federal tax bracket is at or less than 22% would not be hurt by the president‚Äôs plan. However, I am worried about the state income tax implications of this new proposal. 

Specifically, if a tax payer pays about 10% state income tax, wouldn‚Äôt this new proposal significantly increase their taxes even when their federal tax bracket is 22%? 

For example, consider a couple in the 22% federal tax bracket and 9% state income tax bracket. A married couple making $110k in OR would be in this situation. 

Now, suppose they contribute $1000 to a 401k. Since their total tax rate is 31%. They save $310 in taxes and add $1000 value to their retirement account by contributing $690.

In the newly proposed plan, if the same couple contributed $690 to their 401k, they would get a $180 additional payment to their 401k account by the federal government (26% of $690). As a result, they would add only $870 value to their retirement account by contributing the same $690. 

This is a loss of $130 value for any $1000 contribution made in the current system. Given that employees can contribute up to $19k to 401k accounts. A middle-class couple might lose about $2500 under the president‚Äôs new plan. 

Does anyone know more about the state income tax implications of this new proposal?",finance

CryptoCurrency,US Regulatory Effects on Stablecoins,"Ok, so we know that the Feds over in the USA aren't planning to ban cryptocurrency and that's really done well for the crypto markets over the last few days.  Powell stated that he IS going after stablecoins though.  

Aren't stablecoins supposed to be an important element of the cryptomarket for most of us?  I'm not in the US, but I have stablecoins locked up to collect interest.  I like the idea the stablecoins might be regulated in a positive way that I know I won't be rug pulled by the stablecoin issuers, but what if the worse happens and stablecoins are no more?

I don't know enough about crypto to figure out what is the next move?  Do I just find a CEX and on-ramp fiat, pick up cryptocurrencies and toss them into interest earning services like I have been with stablecoins?  Are there newbie friendly ones that can derive steady interest return and value similar to stablecoins, or is embracing the rollercoaster ride that is the cryptomarket a reality I should become comfortable with?

personalfinance,Citi Bank Credit Card Fraud - How I eventually got Citi to reimburse my account for fraudulent charges,"I went through hell trying to get Citibank to reimburse my credit card account for fraudulent charges made against my credit card. After reading a ton of reddit posts about this, it seems like Citi is notorious for denying credit card fraud disputes, so I wanted to let you guys know how I was able to get some fraudulent charges reimbursed to my account.

Quick backstory - $1,500+ in fraudulent charges showed up in my Citi Double Cash credit card transaction history on 6/5/2021. I called Citi on 6/6/2021 to report the fraudulent charges. I called the next day because more fraudulent charges showed up and the representative told me the person I spoke to the day before never actually submitted my claim...That representative confirmed they would cancel the credit card and submit the claim, but it would take 1-2 billing cycles to get reimbursed for the charges. Fast-forward almost four months later - I had called Citi's credit card security department roughly 35 times, been hung up on in the middle of the conversation during half of those calls, spent hours on hold/trying to reach the right person, **had multiple fraud disputes rejected by Citi despite providing evidence to support my claims** and was constantly told something that wasn't consistent with what I was told on the previous calls. Eventually (on 10/1/2021, to be exact), the fraudulent charges were finally reimbursed to my account.

**HERE'S HOW I GOT REIMBURSED FOR THE FRAUDULENT CHARGES:**

**1st step (6/6/21):** Called general customer service who usually tried to forward me to the fraud department &gt;&gt; (877) 601-8029

**2nd step:** Called the fraud department. It's really difficult to reach a human at this number, so I would just have the customer service representative (previous phone number) transfer me to a human &gt;&gt; (866) 442-7479

**3rd step (9/22/21):** Because I didn't have any luck with those two numbers and it had been almost 4 months since I started trying to get reimbursed for the fraudulent charges, I tried reaching the CEO (Jane Fraser) by calling the corporate directory and asking for the office of Jane Fraser &gt;&gt; (212) 559-1000

An operator picked up the phone and I asked them to transfer me to the Executive Customer Service department (this is separate from the general customer service line in step 1 - this customer service department opens cases on behalf of customers and investigates internally). They told me to submit my case via email...

**4th Step (9/22/21):** Sent an email to [citieru@citi.com](mailto:citieru@citi.com) explaining what the situation was. They actually followed up a couple days later and said they were investigating the situation.

**5th Step (9/22/21):** Because it had been roughly 4 months after the fraudulent charges took place, I was fed up and filed a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ([https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/)).

**6th Step (9/22/21):** Simultaneously filed a complaint with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ([https://www.helpwithmybank.gov/file-a-complaint/index-file-a-complaint.html](https://www.helpwithmybank.gov/file-a-complaint/index-file-a-complaint.html))

Steps 4, 5, and 6 seemed to do the trick. On 10/1/2021, both Citibank and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau sent me an email essentially telling me they were finally refunding the fraudulent charges.

TL;DR - IF IT TAKES CITIBANK MORE THAN TWO BILLING CYCLES TO REIMBURSE YOU FOR FRAUDULENT CREDIT CARD CHARGES, SEND AN EMAIL TO [CITIERU@CITI.COM](mailto:CITIERU@CITI.COM) AND SUBMIT A COMPLAINT WITH THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU AND WITH THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY. IF YOU DO THAT, YOU'LL LIKELY GET YOUR ACCOUNT REIMBURSED WITHIN ONE WEEK.

I hope that helps someone. Hang in there. Don't lose hope. Don't let Citibank screw you over.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I received a letter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency saying my complaint didn't fall under their direct jurisdiction and that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was the agency that had jurisdiction over this type of stuff, so don't bother filing a complaint with the Comptroller of the Currency.",finance

datascience,I need help with ‚Äúunknown unknowns‚Äù regarding the cloud,"Hi all!

Recently I‚Äôve been especially interested in the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù aspect of data science, by which I loosely mean creating scripts/apps which can communicate with other websites or apps automatically without me having to execute them. I know the description may sound stupid to you, but that‚Äôs precisely my problem: I‚Äôm just lost here and I don‚Äôt even know where to begin learning these things.

For example, as a personal project I‚Äôd like to create a script that automatically scrapes housing data from a certain website and then train a model on it to predict prices. Then, I'd like to schedule the scraper to run every month to download a few data points which will then be fed to the initial model to test how its accuracy holds over time with new data, all done automatically with me getting the final model evaluation results.

To be clear: I‚Äôm not asking for specific help with this project, I just need someone to point me in the right direction for what I should learn in order to achieve this, specifically regarding the automation part (for example I know how to create the model and I can learn web scraping, but how do I connect all these separate parts?).

I hope this is the right subreddit to ask this question.

personalfinance,Leaving the U.S. Federal Government - What do I do with my FERS contributions?,"After 8.5 years of service in the U.S. federal government, I have accepted a job in the private sector. This means I have a decision to make: Do I keep the approximately $25,000 I have contributed to the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) pension plan in there, or do I take a lump sum payout and roll it into my Thrift Savings Plan (TSP)?

A little about myself: I am 34 years old and my salary at the current job is about $144,000 (GS 15). I currently have about $158,500 in my TSP (roughly half traditional, half Roth) and $1,086,000 in other non-retirement investments. I plan to leave my retirement savings in the TSP rather than roll it over into my new company's 401k or an IRA because the TSP's admin fees are so good. My goal is to retire comfortably in my 60s. I would like to return to work in the federal government someday.

# Option 1: Leave Contributions in FERS

If I keep my $25,000 in FERS, I will be eligible for an annuity starting at age 62. The payment will look like this:

(Average of Three Years Highest Government Salary) \* 0.01 \* (Total years of Government Service)

Given my current salary history and 8.5 years of service, this works out to about $11,000 in annuities starting at age 62, or $920 in monthly payments.

Meanwhile, the $25,000 I have in the FERS will continue to grow at an interest rate that is [""the same that is paid for government securities""](https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/fers-information/former-employees/) (around 1.5%), so not great. I can change my mind and take a lump sum payment later, or my wife will receive that lump sum as a death benefit if I die. But if I want to roll the money into my TSP, I think I need to do it now.

# Option 2: Rollover Contributions to TSP

I also have the option to take the $25,000 in FERS and roll it over into my TSP account. 

According to my TSP annual report, when my account balance was at approximately $122,250, I could expect monthly payments of $550 starting at age 63. If that ratio holds, another $25,000 would result in additional monthly payments of about $113.

So, strictly worse than the $920 I would get from the federal annuity. But there's another wrinkle.

If I take the lump sum payout now, I have the option to [buy back into the FERS](https://www.opm.gov/retirement-services/benefits-officers-center/webcast-presentations/civilian-redeposits.pdf) later. if I rejoin the federal government at some point later in my career, for the price of $25,000 + interest, I should be able to restore my 8.5 years' stake in the FERS. 

# Am I understanding this right? And what should I do?

From what I can tell, the FERS annuity is much better, dollar for dollar, than the TSP payout.

However, my money will grow *much* faster in the TSP than it will in the FERS. The 10-year rate of return on the TSP's C Fund is [currently sitting at 16.66%](https://www.tsp.gov/fund-performance/). It may not always be that high, but it should handily beat the interest rate of government securities.

It seems to me that my best option is to take the $25,000 payout and roll it over into TSP. Ideally, I take another job in the federal government sometime in the next 30 years, and at that point I can buy back into the FERS, using some of the money in my non-retirement investments if needed.

Does this make sense? Is there something I'm missing?",finance
personalfinance,Looking for some advice about taking a loan from multiple 401ks when purchasing a home.,"Hello everybody. We recently found out my wife is pregnant with our third child and will soon be moving into a larger house. This allows us to access money from our 401ks that we normally would not be able to. We are already planning on taking a 50k loan from hers but I recently learned I could take a 50k loan from mine as well. For those unfamiliar, there would be no penalty for doing this, the money would not be taxed, and the repayments including the 4.5% interest would go back into our 401ks. 

Here are some additional details:

\- We are both 33 years old with full time jobs. My salary is $100,500 and hers is just over $60,000. 

\- Ever since working full time I have maxed out my 401k. My company matches 50% with no limit in addition to putting in 3% of my salary. My wife puts enough into her 401k to get the employer match which is 10% if she puts in 5%. This works out to about $35,000 going into our 401ks each year which we plan on continuing. We have about $500,000 combined in our 401ks currently.  

\- I receive yearly bonuses on top of my salary. These aren't officially guaranteed but I have received one every year and each one has been larger than the one before. The last one I received was $30,000.   Because of the unknown nature of this bonus we don't budget around it. We generally pay down debt, put the money into a savings account, and invest this.

\- I am able to sell back my vacation days I don't use once a year. I generally sell everything I have remaining at the end of the year instead of rolling them over. This is usually between 10 and 15 which is roughly $3000 after taxes.

\- My wife has a side job managing a soccer league in which she makes $6,000 a year. That's before taxes. 

\- Both of our cars are paid off. We bought them both new in 2017 and they both have 10 year 100k mile warranties. This should prevent any large repair costs anytime soon. We do plan on selling her car and getting something that can fit three car seats. The trade in offer was about $18,000. We will likely purchase something new and under warranty. Reliability is the most important thing for us in that regard which is why we are purchasing new instead of used. We would use cash for whatever the trade in does not cover. It would likely be an additional $30,000.

\- We purchased a house 10 years ago we will be selling. Our realtor estimates we will have $55,000 from the sale after all expenses. 

\- We have about $30,000 cash in savings accounts and another $30,000 invested in a TD Ameritrade account.

\- We currently have about $2,000 in credit card debt. We pay this off every month. 

\- We owe about $25,000 on student loans still. We have not been paying these since they've been paused. It looks like these will be due again soon and we plan to only make the minimum payment as the interest rate is relatively low. Payments on these would be about $450 a month. 

\- We pay for daycare. Right now my wife is working from home and able to watch the kids. My oldest goes to daycare 2 days a week which is $157 a week. It is always possible but it does not look like she will be required to work in the office for the foreseeable future. If all three kids had to go to daycare full time it could cost $600 or more per week. We would like to not have them all back in daycare full time but we would like to have a plan for that possibility just in case. 

\- The house we are purchasing is $407,500. We only plan on putting 5% down. We looked really hard at putting 20% down. However putting the extra $60,000 down would only lower the monthly mortgage payment by $300. It would be $2,200 instead of $2,500. Property taxes are fairly high in the area which is why the extra 15% towards principal isn't a large percent decrease on the mortgage. 

Not counting our savings and other investments we are looking at $55,000 from selling are home and either an additional $50,000 or $100,000 as loans from our 401ks. Down payment and closing costs are looking like $30,000 and possibly another $30,000 for a new car. That would leave us with either $45,000 or $95,000 in cash. 

The question then is would it make sense to take the additional $50,000 loan from my 401k? Although there isn't an immediate need for it this would be our only opportunity to access that money penalty free before retirement. To have that cash liquid just in case. I know it's generally not a great idea to try to access your 401k early but, we would still have 400k between them, we would still be contributing over 30k a year towards them, and the 100k would be paid back into them plus 4.5% interest. 

Here are some downsides I am thinking of. There may something here I am not considering: 

\- Any growth above the 4.5% that would occur if left in the 401k would be missed.

\- Reduced income from paying back the loan. It would be a $370 payment for my wife's since it would be over 15 years. Mine would be $475 a month for 10 years. 

\- Risk from potential investments with that cash. We would not leave all $95,000 in a savings account. My thought was to put $35,000 in a savings account which would put our emergency fund at $65,000. We could then put $60,000 into the TD Ameritrade account. My thought is I could use that capital to sell out of the money cash secured puts and then covered calls if they get assigned. This could generate decent additional income but is obviously more risky than being in a 401k or a savings account. The ability to do that would not be the main reason I take the additional $50,000, the main reason would be for the liquidity. Any investments done would be relatively conservative. 

I apologize for the length of this post. There are a lot of factors at play here. Any advice/insight on the matter is greatly appreciated. Thank you so much.",finance

Market participants continue to closely monitor developments coming out of Washington DC, with Congress managing to avoid a government shutdown by passing a last-minute bill yesterday night.  Right before the midnight deadline, President Biden signed into law a short-term appropriations bill that will keep the government running through at least December 3, successfully avoiding a government shutdown. The Senate and House approved the funding legislation earlier Thursday. The Senate passed it in a 65-35 vote as all 50 Democrats backed it and 15 Republicans joined them. The House passed the bill by a 254-175 margin. Every Democratic representative and 34 Republicans supported it.

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/30/government-shutdown-congress-moves-to-pass-funding-bill.html

Focus will now shift towards debates surrounding the bipartisan infrastructure bill and raising the debt ceiling before mid-October, which is the estimated timeline when the debt ceiling will be hit. Earlier today, President Biden went to the capital to try and salvage plans for the infrastructure bill after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was forced to delay the vote she scheduled today. This is due to disagreements in the party between moderates and more progressive members, particularly with Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, who oppose the size of the infrastructure bill. https://www.reuters.com/world/us/democrats-struggle-reach-deal-congress-bidens-agenda-2021-10-01/

A historic U.S. debt default could occur around Oct. 18, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has estimated, if Congress fails to give the government additional borrowing authority beyond the current statutory limit of $28.4 trillion. The House approved a bill late on Wednesday suspending the debt limit through December 2022. The Senate could vote on it ""as early as next week,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, but Republicans are expected to block it again as they have twice before. This is an evolving situation. In my humble opinion, I think the Republicans are playing political games with the debt ceiling and will pass it last minute, similar to the spending bill to avoid the government shutdown. 

Put simply, a default by the US would be an economic and political disaster that must be avoided. I cannot fathom the government willingly plunging the US into an unprecedented financial crisis for political reasons, though one can never guess the future. According to a report by Moody‚Äôs Analytics, one of the three big along with Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch Group, approximately 6 million jobs would be lost and the unemployment would spike dramatically, US GDP would decline, and there would be an irrevocable stain on the faith and strength of US financial markets. ‚ÄúInternationally, the United States will have for the first time undermined the full faith and credit of its own currency -- a blow to our standing in the world and a boon for our adversaries such as China who are arguing to the world that the US is on the decline‚Äù

The report goes on to say, ‚ÄúGlobal financial markets and the economy would be upended, and even if resolved quickly, Americans would pay for this default for generations, as global investors would rightly believe that the federal government‚Äôs finances have been politicized and that a time may come when they would not be paid what they are owed when owed it. To compensate for this risk, they will demand higher interest rates on the Treasury bonds they purchase. That will exacerbate our daunting long-term fiscal challenges and be a lasting corrosive on the economy, significantly diminishing it.‚Äù

&gt; October may have a bad reputation, but the fourth quarter has mostly been a positive time for stocks.

&gt; Despite worries about central bank tightening, the debt ceiling, Chinese developer Evergrande and Covid-19, many strategists expect stocks to eclipse recent highs after a rocky period in October.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has averaged outsized gains of 3.9% in the fourth quarter and was up four out of every five years since World War II, according to CFRA. The next best quarter is the first, with an average gain of 2.3%. The worst is the third, up just 0.6%.

However, investors will need to hang on tight during the typically tumultuous ride in October, which saw 36% higher volatility when compared with the average for the other 11 months,‚Äù notes CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 eked out a small gain for the third quarter, but was down nearly 5% for the month of September, with a bad ending as the S&amp;P 500 dropped 1.2% on Thursday.
*****
&gt; The indexes kicked off the first trading session in October on a positive note, however. With the S&amp;P 500 adding 1.1% and the Nasdaq closing 0.8% higher on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 482.54 points.

&gt; Bespoke Investment Group analyzed the behavior of the S&amp;P 500 in years when it was up solidly year-to-date heading into the fourth quarter. In those years, the market typically gained in the quarter, but there were weaker than normal returns in October and the quarter itself, when September was a negative month.

&gt; ‚ÄúThe S&amp;P 500 has been down in September 50 times since 1928, and in those years, it has actually averaged a decline of 0.41% in October and a gain of just 0.75% in Q4,‚Äù Bespoke noted. When September‚Äôs performance was positive, the S&amp;P gained a much stronger 1.6% average in October and an average 5% in the fourth quarter, according to the firm.
*****
&gt; Bespoke found that while October is remembered for stock market crashes, like those in 1929 and 1987, the market is usually positive. The Dow, for instance, gained 60% of the time in October over the past 50 years, averaging an increase of 0.5%. It was negative most of the time in September, with an average loss of 0.9%.
*****
&gt; # Jobs, jobs, jobs
&gt; One of the first hurdles markets face in the new quarter is Friday‚Äôs employment report, potentially one of the final triggers for the Federal Reserve‚Äôs decision on when to taper its $120 billion-a-month bond buying program.
*****
&gt; Economists expect about 475,000 jobs were added in September, according to an early consensus figure from FactSet. Just 235,000 payrolls were added in August, about 500,000 less than expected.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe only way I could see them delaying the tapering is if we get a very weak number, something closer to zero,‚Äù said Ethan Harris, head of global economic research at Bank of America. ‚ÄúAnything that looks like 100,000, 200,000, they just go ahead‚Äù with the taper.
*****
&gt; Harris said the biggest concern for the economy remains Covid, though new cases are slowing.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe big question is when does the Covid story start to fade a bit, allowing activity to come back,‚Äù he said. He expects the pandemic will continue to be a big factor in the labor market in September.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWe think fear of getting Covid on the job was a big factor in August and will be a factor in September as well,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBy October, the early hints are people are starting to feel more comfortable and you should get some beginnings of a reacceleration of job growth.‚Äù
*****
&gt; The market got some positive news on that front on Friday with Merck‚Äôs promising data for its Covid antiviral pill.
*****
&gt; # Central banks tightening
&gt; A big event in the fourth quarter could be the beginning of the unwind of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs easy policies.
*****
&gt; The central bank last week signaled it is nearly ready to take that first step away from the policies used during the pandemic to maintain financial market liquidity and help the economy.
*****
&gt; The Fed is widely expected to announce in November that it will start to slow its bond purchases, and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said he expects it to finish by the middle of next year.
*****
&gt; Other central banks around the world are also making the same noises or actually moving to raise interest rates. Bond market pros now expect a trend toward higher interest rates.
*****
&gt; Just in the past week, rates shot higher, with the 10-year Treasury yield rising from about 1.31% while the Fed was meeting Sept. 22 to as high as 1.56% just a week later. On Friday, the yield eased back a bit to just under 1.50%.
*****
&gt; https://i.imgur.com/9dO7jZc.png
*****
&gt; The move toward tapering so far has not had much impact on markets, though strategists say it could if yields shoot higher. The bond buying program, or quantitative easing, was also credited with providing market liquidity, which has been fuel for stock market gains.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe Fed is trying very hard to telegraph what they are doing well in advance and take the shock out of what they‚Äôre doing. Bond yields have gone up a bit but not in a way that‚Äôs troubling for the economy,‚Äù said Harris. ‚ÄúThe real risk from the Fed comes when they start talking about hiking interest rates. ... That‚Äôs a story for next year.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Rising yields would become more risky for stocks if they were to continue to move up rapidly. Tony Crescenzi, PIMCO executive vice president, said he expects the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield to trade in a range of 1.50% to 2% this year.
*****
&gt; Crescenzi said the move higher in yields has to do with more persistent inflation expectations and the Fed‚Äôs persistent move toward less easy policy. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still marching forward with its plan to taper and eventually tighten,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe taper doesn‚Äôt set a date for tightening, but the clock starts ticking once the taper begins.‚Äù
*****
&gt; The jump in rates rattled stocks in the past week, particularly tech stocks. The S&amp;P 500 was lower by 2.2% for the week and the Nasdaq shed 3.2%.
*****
&gt; # Surprising earnings
Earnings have been a big catalyst for the stock market, with huge upside surprises boosting sentiment this year. But some strategists warn that if companies sound too cautious when they report third-quarter profits in the next couple of weeks, that could be a forewarning for the market.
*****
&gt; Julian Emanuel, head of equity and derivative strategy at BTIG, said rising earnings estimates for this year and next year have been a tailwind. ‚ÄúThose in our view have now plateaued and potentially peaked,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf the market perceived they peaked rather than plateaued on a near to medium-term basis, then we have a problem for the stock market.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Investors are also watching the supply chain issues that are disrupting many companies‚Äô ability to get parts and even products. They are already impacting earnings and pressuring margins. Some have already warned about the problem, and more are expected to detail the issues during earnings calls.
*****
&gt; Congress averted a government shutdown, but political feuding is likely to hang over the markets in the fourth quarter. The bigger task facing lawmakers will be to raise the debt ceiling, which could become worrisome for markets if the government reaches the limit before action is taken.
*****
&gt; As the fourth quarter moves ahead, the fate of the proposed $3.5 trillion infrastructure plan, which is opposed by Republicans and some Democrats, remains up in the air. Bank of America‚Äôs Harris said he expects it to be cut back to about $1.5 trillion.
*****
&gt; # Other issues
Chinese property developer Evergrande‚Äôs failure to make its debt payments temporarily spooked the market in September. Its problems are not solved even as investors expect that a financial meltdown will be averted.
*****
&gt; Evergrande‚Äôs progress will remain an important story for the markets in the fourth quarter, as the company struggles under its $300 billion debt burden.

&gt; # Mega Caps Underperforming as Energy Explodes

&gt; In November of last year, we took a look at the performance spread between the equal and market cap weighted versions of the S&amp;P 500. The chart below provides an update through the end of September where positive readings indicate outperformance of the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 and negative readings indicate outperformance of the market cap weighted index. In March 2020, as the market was plunging from the February peak and bottoming towards the end of the month, mega-caps such as Apple (APPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Facebook (FB) significantly outperformed the broader market, resulting in a 5.68 percentage point spread between the return of the equally weighted and market cap weighted S&amp;P 500. Whereas the equal-weighted index declined 18.19% in March 2020, the market cap weighted index dropped 'just' 12.51%. In a reversal of these trends, the equal-weighted index outperformed between the months of September 2020 and March 2021, rallying 30.84% while its market cap weighted counterpart gained 18.14%. Over these months, there was a maximum monthly spread of 3.37 percentage points in favor of the equal-weighted index, which occurred last December. In recent months, mega-caps briefly took back the reins before the trend reversed in September when the equal-weighted index outperformed by 0.82 percentage points.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/10121-Spread.png))**

&gt; With the month of September behind us, the table below lists the 18 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that finished the month up over 10%, and less than a quarter of the stocks in the index (22%) finished the month higher. Overall, the average performance of stocks in the index was a decline of 3.7 percentage points. While short-term performance has been weak, on a YTD basis, 81.42% of S&amp;P 500 stocks are up on the year, and the overall average gain is 18.90%. Of the stocks that have rallied 10%+ in September, more than half are from the Energy sector and another three come from the Financials sector.

&gt; # Q3 Asset Class Performance

&gt; Q3 and the month of September are now in the books, and it was not a great period for US equities. As shown in our asset class performance matrix below, the sole portion of the US equity market that was higher in September was Energy stocks. Every other sector, theme, and major index was lower on the month. As for global equities, performance was more mixed with declines ranging from 11.73% for Brazil (EWZ) to a 3.55% gain for Russia, though, most country ETFs were lower on the month.

&gt; Commodities had a good month particularly in the energy space with crude oil (USO) gaining 9.41% and Natural Gas (UNG) rising an astounding 31.59%. That lifted the total gain in Q3 to 54.13% while it has returned almost 120% year to date; the best performer for both time periods. Precious metals, namely silver (SLV), on the other hand, was hit particularly hard. As for c/ryptos, Ethereum (ETHE) was another top performer YTD and in Q3, but September pared those gains. ETHE fell 13.62% in September while B/itcoin (GBTC) also fell by double-digit percentages.

&gt; # Could There Be An October Crash?

&gt; ‚ÄúOctober: This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks. The others are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August and February.‚Äù Mark Twain

&gt; Well, it was bound to end eventually, but the S&amp;P 500 Index will finish September in the red, ending an incredible seven month win streak. As we noted last month, these long win streaks actually tend to be quite bullish for future returns, with the S&amp;P 500 higher six months later 13 out of 14 times. Yes, stocks were down some in September, but this still bodes well for the near-term.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.30.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Speaking of the near term, here comes October. As Marc Twain explained many years ago, October has long been a source of anxiety for stock investors. ‚ÄúOctober is known for some spectacular crashes and many expect bad things to happen again this year. 1929, 1987, and 2008 all come to mind when we think about this month,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúBut the truth is this month is simply misunderstood, as historically it is about an average month.‚Äù

&gt; As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, since 1950, October ranks as the 7th best month, while the past 10 and 20 years it ranks as the 4th best month. In a post-election year it comes in 5th. So October clearly isn‚Äôt one of the best months of the year, but by no means is it the worst either.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.30.21-Blog-Chart-1-v2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Now, let‚Äôs be very clear though, October is known for volatility. No month has seen more 1% moves (up or down) than October, with some of the largest 1-day moves (both up and down) taking place this month. Heck, the S&amp;P 500 hasn‚Äôt had a 5% pullback all year (the average year sees about three) and the last one was nearly a full year ago, one of the longest such streaks ever. Not to mention the S&amp;P 500 has now gone an incredible 317 trading days in a row above its 200-day moving average, one of the longest streaks ever. What we are getting at is a 5-7% pullback could potentially come at any time given we haven‚Äôt had one in so long.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.30.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Here are some other interesting statistics to think about regarding the S&amp;P 500 in October.
&gt; * It has been 21 years (2000) since October didn‚Äôt close at least up or down 1%. Several percent moves up or down are quite common for this month in other words.
&gt; * For six years in a row October has alternated between higher and lower. Given 2020 it was in the red, it could be time for a bounce in 2021. (More on this below)
&gt; * The last two times the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 15% year-to-date heading into October, stocks gained each time (2013 and 2019).
&gt; * The author‚Äôs birthday is on October 28, one of the historically most bullish days of the year. Coincidence?
&gt; It turns out stocks don‚Äôt like politics much. The S&amp;P 500 performs much better in odd numbered years than even years. Remember, even numbered years have elections and midterms in November. Some pre-election jitters makes sense to us, which could bode well for 2021.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.30.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Don‚Äôt forget the fourth quarter is historically the best for stocks, with the third quarter the worst. Stocks rise 3.8% on average during the fourth quarter, but the past seven times the S&amp;P 500 was up 15% year-to-date heading into the home stretch of the year, the fourth quarter was higher every single time, up a very impressive 5.8%. In other words, should there be any October scares, investors may want to use the weakness as an opportunity to add to core positions.

&gt; # Four Charts That Signal the Reopening Trade May Be Back

&gt; Stocks have come a long way since the S&amp;P 500 bear market low way back on March 23, 2020, but despite the general strength of the bull market we‚Äôve seen two very different types of trades leading markets at different times. They include a ‚Äúwork-from-home‚Äù trade characterized by strength among large caps and growth-style oriented stocks, strong performance by U.S. stocks in particular, and well contained interest rates. At other times, we‚Äôve seen a ‚Äúreopening trade,‚Äù where mid- and small-cap stocks have performed well, cyclically-oriented value-style stocks have led, interest rates have pressed higher, and performance across geographical regions has been more even. For most of the last six months the work-from-home trade has dominated, but we‚Äôre seeing some signs of potential rotation toward a reopening theme once again.

&gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs increasingly looking like the Delta-related surge in COVID-19 cases, while still dangerous, has passed its peak, and there are signals that markets may be anticipating the next stage of economic reopening,‚Äù said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúAfter a mid-summer head fake, we‚Äôre seeing signs that this time the rotation might stick.‚Äù

&gt; It all starts with interest rates. The 10-year Treasury yield started to stabilize in early August, and since then we‚Äôve seen steady movement higher as elevated inflation looks increasingly sticky in the near term, and markets start to anticipate global central bankers slowly winding down extraordinarily supportive monetary policy. The full transition to neutral policy will likely take years, and central banks will remain supportive for some time, but the change in direction does matter. Seeing the 10-year yield move higher despite stock losses on Tuesday may be a telling sign.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.29.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; A higher 10-year Treasury yield has supported financial sector stocks, which are the largest sector in the Russell 1000 Value Index. The breakout in relative strength compared to the August peak may signal a more sustainable change in direction this time.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.29.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; It‚Äôs still too early to call a reversal by value-style stocks overall, but financial sector strength helps. Rising interest rates also tend to increase the value of near-term earnings over less visible long-term earnings growth, which may also give value stocks an edge. While there are some signs of a reversal higher in the value trade, what we‚Äôve seen so far isn‚Äôt persuasive in isolation. But added to the broader market signals, we see potential for further relative strength, particularly for cyclical value sectors.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.29.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The relative strength of small caps looks more robust, breaking out to the upside after treading water for several months. Small caps went through a stretch of extraordinarily strong performance between September 2020 and March 2021, and it‚Äôs not completely surprising that they gave back a good share of those gains after coming so far so fast, but we still think the economic environment is likely to be supportive for small- and mid-caps compared to large.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/9.29.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We‚Äôve been anticipating a rotation back to the reopening trade for some time. If you look at the charts there‚Äôs really been relative stability between the two themes since mid-July, but the last few weeks have provided solid signals of a potential reversal. With the latest surge in COVID-19 cases likely past peak, vaccination rates slowly rising, and economic surprises starting to come back into balance after a series of disappointments, it‚Äôs no surprise to see the shift toward the reopening theme.

&gt; But there are some potential economic negatives that support this trade as well, such as high commodity prices, higher interest rates, and growing risk of stickier inflation. Nevertheless, we think the fundamental backdrop for equities remains positive on the whole, and we continue to recommend modest overweights to equities while leaning into cyclically-oriented value sectors and tilting away from large caps.

stocks,Rising bond yields: what they mean and how to play this,"**TL;DR: Rising bond yields means investors should rotate from growth to value. Avoid ARK ETFs at all costs, they have underperformed for a reason. We have yet to see capitulation.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure you've all seen the headlines over the past week or so about rising bond yields, and I'm honestly surprised that the majority of investors I've talked to don't know how this affects their stock allocations. They read about the rising bond yields and how that hurts growth stocks, but the articles never dive into exactly why this happens. I felt compelled to write this post because I found out my mother put the majority of her 401K into QQQ, ARKK, and ARKG back in July. The recent downwards move in these names has her spooked, and on the phone she mentioned she has no idea why these ETFs (ARKK and ARKG in particular) are going down more than the rest of the market.

&amp;#x200B;

To preface this post, this is not financial advice and I'm not a financial advisor. But I have been investing my own money for the better part of the past two decades and have seen long term success. I've learned a lot from my friends who work in the industry over the years so hopefully I can shed some light on how institutions, the ones driving the market, operate. I commonly rotate my investments based on what I've learned and macroeconomic variables in order to achieve a more optimal strategic positioning in the market.

Now, onto rising bond yields. This site lets you see the yields for notes of various maturities: [https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-bond-yield](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-bond-yield). All of the bond yields have risen this past week, but the one of particular concern is the yield on the 2 YR treasury note. It hasn't been this high since March 2020, and analysts are projecting it will rise even higher.

&amp;#x200B;

This move was fueled by fears of more persistent inflation, the upcoming taper that will begin after the November Fed meeting, and the prospect of rate hikes coming sooner than originally anticipated.  The Fed isn't alone either. Central Banks all around the world have signaled plans to tighten monetary policy: the BoE for example [https://www.ft.com/content/80de9d5d-42c5-47f0-bc86-a46d05291691](https://www.ft.com/content/80de9d5d-42c5-47f0-bc86-a46d05291691), Brazil (except no one really cares about Brazil) [https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banks/monetary-policy/monetary-policy-decisions/7863731/brazil-accelerates-tightening-cycle-with-100bp-rate-hike](https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banks/monetary-policy/monetary-policy-decisions/7863731/brazil-accelerates-tightening-cycle-with-100bp-rate-hike), and countries in the Eurozone [https://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-bonds/update-3-euro-zone-yields-continue-to-climb-after-german-election-idUSL1N2QT0JH](https://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-bonds/update-3-euro-zone-yields-continue-to-climb-after-german-election-idUSL1N2QT0JH).

&amp;#x200B;

Fed officials at the most recent meeting moved up their expectations for a rate hike in 2022 and increased the number of rate hikes expected in 2023 ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/09/22/fed-powell-taper-rate-hike/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/09/22/fed-powell-taper-rate-hike/)). If inflation continues to persist, which is likely due to strong demand-pull and supply-side constraints like the disruptions we're seeing in Southeast Asia due to Covid, then we'll see these rate hike expectations move forward even more. A higher federal funds rate results in higher bond yields.

&amp;#x200B;

The market digested this information from last week and it is now being priced into the market. So why do growth stocks get hammered more than the rest of the market when bond yields rise? Even today, for October 1st, the NASDAQ rose 0.65% while the S&amp;P 500 rose a whopping 1.23%.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason is because of how companies are fundamentally valued. After all, the market isn't a casino, even though it can seem like it at times. Shout out to GME and AMC. So what does a company's stock price really represent?

&amp;#x200B;

Fundamentally, a company's stock price represents the present value of its future cash flows. This valuation method is commonly used in the industry and is known as a discounted cash flow (read [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) if you want to expand on this even more but I'll summarize). Basically, how do you calculate the **present** value of **future** cash flows? You take those future cash flows and you *discount* them by the risk free rate, often represented by bond yields. The reason we do this discounting is because that future cash flow is worth less BECAUSE it happens in the future. That money, if available in the present, could have generated the risk free rate each year.

Let's look at an example to see how discounting works. Let us assume stock A is expected to produce cash flow of $100 in 2022, $200 in 2023, and $500 in 2024 and the risk free rate is 1%.

&amp;#x200B;

We get: Discounted Cash Flow until 2024 = $100/1.01 + $200/(1.01)\^2 + $500/(1.01)\^3 = $780

&amp;#x200B;

But what happens if the risk free rate increases to 2%?

&amp;#x200B;

Then we get: Discounted Cash Flow until 2024 = $100/1.02 + $200/(1.02)\^2 + $500/(1.02)\^3 = $761

&amp;#x200B;

The key takeaway from this is that rising bond yields mean future cash flows will be worth less at present. The reason growth stocks get so hammered on moves in bond yields is because the majority of their cash flow comes in the future, and that's why they can be valued so richly when bond yields are at record lows (like through all of 2020 and the beginning of 2021). Take Nikola, for example, it currently has no free cash flow but it's valued because it promises future free cash flow. Quantumscape, TuSimple, and so many more names fall into this category.

&amp;#x200B;

Growth stocks have fallen out of favor for this reason and is why ARKK, ARKG, and all of the other ARK ETFs have already dropped over 20% from their all time highs. The concentration of growth stocks in the NASDAQ is also the reason for its underperformance this past week.

&amp;#x200B;

Reddit forums always scream, ""don't fight the FED,"" and they're right. For times like these, it's best to rotate out of growth and into value names. The Fed TELLS you what they're going to do and this past Fed meeting was the most hawkish Fed meeting I've listened to in a long time. I'm not claiming that markets will crash, far from it, I'm simply claiming that growth stocks are not where you want to be.

This is going to hit a capitulation point when bond yields rise even more. This Twitter post shows the underperformance of ARKK's investments: [https://twitter.com/TheMarketDog/status/1443154120047828994/photo/2](https://twitter.com/TheMarketDog/status/1443154120047828994/photo/2). The only reason ARK is even alive is because of Tesla, and rising bond yields will eventually catch up to Tesla too, which is currently valued at 400x PE. You might be thinking now is a good time to pick up these names at a discount, but that would be ill-advised. If you're planning to hold for the next decade and through a potential 50-90% drawdown, then go ahead.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a reason Michael Burry has been shorting ARKK ([https://www.yahoo.com/now/ark-innovation-etf-sell-big-210000360.html](https://www.yahoo.com/now/ark-innovation-etf-sell-big-210000360.html)) and one of the largest positions in his fund is a Tesla short ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/michael-burry-of-the-big-short-reveals-a-530-million-bet-against-tesla.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/michael-burry-of-the-big-short-reveals-a-530-million-bet-against-tesla.html)) specifically because he foresees an unfavorable environment for growth stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

If you've been wondering why SPACs have been dying, this is why.

&amp;#x200B;

If you've been wondering why your growth stocks have been dying, this is why.

&amp;#x200B;

If you've been debating whether or not to sell your ARK ETFs, this is why. Cathie Wood is simply a marketing genius who got lucky off moonshot plays in Bitcoin and Tesla, and then leveraged that success to convince the public to drive in-flows into her ARK ETFs over the past years. Those inflows helped propel a bunch of growth names higher, but ARK will eventually be a victim of its own success as outflows force selling into already declining stock prices. This reddit post is from February of 2021 when ARKK died because of, you guessed it, rising bond yields: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lv1sjx/investors\_beware\_arkk\_is\_a\_liquidity\_disaster/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lv1sjx/investors_beware_arkk_is_a_liquidity_disaster/). Looking at the 2 YR yield, this time might be significantly worse. This is why I told my mother to move everything over to $VTI and a selection of value names: $ADNT, $GM, $F, $KRE, $HEES, $HRI, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

The ONLY stock in ARKK with a reasonable PE multiple is COIN. Every other name has a multiple in either the high-flying hundreds, or the stock is simply a money burning piece of shit experiencing slowing growth. GL investors - stay safe out there. If you've been holding ARKK, it's okay to take a loss. When investing, and over the long run, losses are bound to happen. My biggest losses all came from holding onto the hope that my stock would recover, even though I knew deep down it wouldn't.

personalfinance,"Take on GRAD SCHOOL debt, when I already have UNDERGRAD debt? Yay or nay?","EDIT: thanks for all the responses / you've confirmed my deep hunch (fear) that, from a financial view, taking on grad school debt is NOT advisable in my current situation. You've also reminded me why: I really want to pay off my loans, I'm glad I'm exploring non-MFA paths, and the ONLY way I should go would be a straight up FREE RIDE.
thanks again :)
_________________________________________________________________________

Brief overview: I have 68K in undergraduate student loan debt. When I finished my BA in 2012, I only had 53K in debt, but with 10 years of interest, the balance owed is now 68K. MF-er GREW instead of shrinking:

I have been making payments faithfully on an IBR (Income Based Repayment Plan). My monthly payments are low ($50 -ish) because my annual income is shit (23K, and thats working 3 jobs--I live on Long Island.). So the balance grows instead of decreases.

NOW: I really want to enroll in an MFA Photography Program (with the hope of teaching, and also for my own enjoyment), maybe even earn a double masters in photo AND art therapy.

THE DILEMMA: Do I dare take on MORE student loan debt for grad school when I still owe so much on my undergrad? OR, since I'm basically F-ed for life with student loans, should I just go pursue my passion? At a certain point, it all starts to feel like monopoly money anyway...

For background: I'm a married 37 year old. Hubbs and I have fairly separate finances and he's the primary breadwinner. I have ZERO CREDIT CARD DEBT, zero mortage, and we have one car loan. We live on Long Island so never get ahead. Already working in academia, but would earn more after doing an MFA.

personalfinance,Pre-tax deductions not reducing local taxable income - is this double taxation?,"I was looking over my latest pay stub and realized that while my pre-tax deductions  (health care, retirement accounts, pension, etc) reduce my state and federal taxable income, they do not lower my local withholding. For health care, I suppose this just means my city taxes me on this portion of my income even though it never hits my bank account, which seems cruel, but fine. But as far as retirement accounts go, doesn't this amount to double taxation since my contributions and distributions would both be subject to local withholding? I don't see anything on my city government's website that states that they don't tax pensions or retirement withdrawals, and my pension's website says payouts are subject to local taxes. Doesn't this mean I am being taxed twice at the local level? Am I fundamentally misunderstanding something about this scenario?",finance

personalfinance,We need to move to a bigger place but don't have enough for 20% down and are thinking of a 10/10/80 HELOC loan. Does this plan make financial sense?,"We moved to Greenwich, CT and bought a house right before the pandemic hit last year. We planned to live in this house for at least 10 years. Then a few things happened and now we kinda need a bigger place. If the finances don't make sense then we'll make this place work. But if the finances make okay-enough sense then we'd rather buy a bigger house.

Our financial situation:

* Our combined annual income is roughly $320,000 a year
* We both max out our 401k contributions
   * Can adjust this behavior if it makes sense
* We max out our HSA contributions but invest 100% of it as we don't have a lot of medical expenses and the expenses we do have we pay out of pocket 
   * Can adjust this behavior if it makes sense
* We rolled over all of our old 401ks into IRAs
   * Being managed by Fidelity (as a trial run for 1 year)
* We have a car $900 car payment
* We have $47,000 cash sitting in our emergency cash reserve
* We have $80,000 cash ready to be spent/invested
   * In scope for house purchase
* We have a Betterment account with roughly $88,000 that we opened many years ago just to check the platform out
   * We are open to cashing this out for a down payment on a new house
* We have roughly $60,000 in various stocks in Robinhood
   * We don't want to touch this
* The mortgage (including insurance and taxes) for our current place is roughly $2,700
   * If we do buy a new house, then we plan on renting this place out
   * We're very confident we can rent it for $4,500 to $4,900 a month
* We have a rental property in Texas
   * Bought for $165,000
   * Owe like $106,000 on it
   * House is worth roughly $320,000
   * House is rented
   * Income goes into a checking account and mortgage payment comes out of this checking account
   * We consider this a closed loop and don't really factor this income or debt in our decisions
* We don't carry debt forward -- meaning we pay our CC off every month
* We both have good credit (760 and 810)

So for a down payment, we have $80,000 cash and another $80,000 in Betterment.

Houses here are very expensive. Even with $160,000 we don't have enough for 20% down. 

So we're thinking of doing a 10/10/80 loan:

* 10% down
* 10% HELOC loan
* 80% normal loan

Even with the above combination we'd need to cash out some/all of the Betterment for 10% down because all the decent houses are $1,250,000.

I am wondering what others think? 

I mean, if folks say this is just bad and we should wait then we'll push through for another year and then revisit the topic.

But with interest rates so low we're wondering if it would make better sense to buy a house now.

I'm open to any/all thoughts and suggestions.

Forex,Weekend Technical Analysis Trade Ideas (GBPJPY &amp; XAUUSD),"Hi fellas! I have been pretty much a lurker here, with a few comments here and there. This will be my first weekend analysis for the weekend and hopefully not the last. Hopefully this analysis will help anyone out here on this subreddit and hopefully you guys will chip in some ideas too!

* Firstly, I will always look at what DXY is doing and where it might be heading to. As I will be trading XAUUSD. As we can see, DXY has been really **bullish** due to the possible **increasing of the interest rates as early as this November**.
* Secondly, we see that DXY has **broken the high of of 93.800** and its doing a **pullback**. Hopefully we might see some opportunities for Longs around the area it broke out from on the lower timeframe.
* Thirdly, we have seen XAUUSD **corrected it downside move** with the **bad unemployment claim numbers**. Hopefully there would be a short opportunity to **correct the impulse move up to revisit the lows of 1725**.
* Fourth, as we can see that GBPJPY has yet again **failed to break above the area of 152.500** and see a **huge correction of the upside move**, revisiting the **demand area of 149.300**. Bullish biasness is still in and will be looking for **buys above 151.000**.

That's all for now. This is my first post using reddit on my desktop, so I am still getting use to it. IF you guys have any questions for me, I will try my best to answer it or if you have any suggestions or extra inputs, pls be sure to share it with me! Thanks!

solar,Worth it in Eastern Washington,"Recently had a quote from a local company(solgen power) to install solar panels.  

* **System Size** - 12.24kW
* **Estimated Yearly Production** - 17,318 kWh
* **Cost** - $50,279.55
* **Minus** - $13,072.68 for Federal Tax Incentive
* **Financing Option** - 0 Down, 3.99% for 25 Years which comes out to about **$203.53/mo**(assuming I put the tax incentive into the balance owed)
* **Promo Offer** - They would pay my first 12 Payments 

I live in Eastern half of Washington State.  The pro is that we have sun like 300 days a years, but the con is that I currently pay about 7.8 cents for kWh, and I use only about ~1,667 on average a month.  My bill is about $130(average).  So I'm really stuck on the fence here trying to understand what I should do.  My primitive understanding of my situation.


Pros| Cons
---|---
Lots of sunlight year round| Electricity is **CHEAP** here
Basically no electrical bill for a year| Assuming a 30% cost increase of energy over the life of the unit, I'd still only be paying 10.1 cents kWh
It's clean energy| No battery unit, would rely on net metering to credit 1:1
Increases home value| Efficiency decreases over time

Is there anything I'm missing?  

* Any new legislation going into place that ensures the net metering credits remain 1:1?
* Should I be looking for something with a battery?
* Can I use both a battery and net metering?
* Is there any proprietary things I should be looking out for that would limit my ability to upgrade/repair/replace in the future?
* What type of maintenance cost is associated with solar?
* Is it reasonable to expect these panels, in 30 years with regular maintenance and tender loving care, to still make a significant reduction in my electric bill?

I just want to make sure I'm not making an emotional investment.  I know if I could sink the $37k in apple stock today, I'd probably be doing alright in 25 years from now.  I'm also sure that $37k could go into a lot of home improvements that could reduce my electrical consumption(that I plan on doing regardless).",energy

60. A Weiss Crypto analyst calls the smart contract launch an alleged event and also doesn‚Äôt realize we already have NFTS. The Cardano community was quick to correct the analyst.

63. One of Cardano‚Äôs biggest competitors is once again suffering network problems. This time it started out as just being characterized as (more) ‚Äúinstability‚Äù, then they started saying that something had caused the blockchain to ‚Äústart forking‚Äù.

It‚Äôll be interesting to see how well their community tolerates this in the future if it‚Äôs happening with their planned slashing model in effect.

75. After the Senate hearing on Tuesday September 14th, Gary Gensler (SEC Chairman) gave a quote to a crypto publication indicating that custodial lending and possibly even staking platforms might be considered securities.

economy,Fed Chair Powell Says He Has ‚ÄòNo Intention‚Äô of Banning Crypto,,finance
CryptoCurrency,"The ""Sneak"" Bans Cometh: As people focused on U.S. federal infrastructure bill(s) and the potential legal implication of the poison pill ""crypto provision"" the bills (still) contain, it was forgotten that California legislators snuck an anti-crypto bill through - and got it signed into law (AB 1402)","Recently signed into law (AB 1402) - proof: [https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billStatusClient.xhtml?bill\_id=202120220AB1402](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billStatusClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB1402)

 Note [this law applies to](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB1402) **""Owning or operating the infrastructure, electronic or physical, or technology that brings buyers and sellers together,""** or to **""Providing a virtual currency""** or to **""Software development or research and development activities""** (...) in part!  

What exactly did the bill (AB 1402) propose, and what are the basic legal requirements that the legislators desire for it to trigger now that it has become law? Answered here: [https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/njsn5q/californias\_ab\_1402\_is\_an\_anti\_bitcoin\_bill\_we/gz92exn/](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/njsn5q/californias_ab_1402_is_an_anti_bitcoin_bill_we/gz92exn/)

Details of AB 1402 explained from a more philosophical standpoint, and some of the problems it will cause for Californians using virtual currency (as well as becoming an issue for out of state virtual users attempting to engage with Californians using virtual currency):  [https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/njsn5q/californias\_ab\_1402\_is\_an\_anti\_bitcoin\_bill\_we/gzar64d/](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/njsn5q/californias_ab_1402_is_an_anti_bitcoin_bill_we/gzar64d/)

Other problems / ramifications have to do with the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling on the dormant Commerce Clause (as explained below - I argue that this below case makes AB 1402 as passed and signed into law, unconstitutional).

From (relatively) recent U.S. Supreme Court decision (Tennessee Wine and Spirits Retailers Association v. Thomas):

[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/18-96\_5i36.pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/18-96_5i36.pdf)

Note in particular the mention Justice Alito makes about this where he clearly states it's **not** just about wine. Anything that can cross state lines can be given protection -  Currency trade (virtual, cash, or other) between states cannot be turned into a prohibited commercial act by a state, else the law becomes unconstitutional. Quote follows:

""More recently, we observed that our dormant Commerce Clause cases reflect a ‚Äú‚Äòcentral concern of the Framers that was an immediate reason for calling the Constitutional Convention: the conviction that in order to succeed, the new Union would have to **avoid the tendencies toward economic Balkanization that had plagued relations among the Colonies and later among the States** under the Articles of Confederation.‚Äô‚Äù Granholm, 544 U. S., at 472 (quoting Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U. S. 322, 325‚Äì326 (1979)). **In light of this history and our established case law, we reiterate that the Commerce Clause by its own force restricts state protectionism.**""

...""And Granholm never said that its reading of history or its Commerce Clause analysis was limited to discrimination against products or producers. On the contrary, the Court stated that **the Clause prohibits state discrimination against all ‚Äú‚Äòout-of-state economic interests,‚Äô‚Äù** Granholm, 544 U. S., at 472 (emphasis added), and noted that the direct-shipment laws in question ‚Äúcontradict\[ed\]‚Äù dormant Commerce Clause principles **because they ‚Äúde-prive\[d\] citizens of their right to have access to the markets of other States on equal terms.**‚Äù Id., at 473 (emphasis added).""

It is clear that *AB 1402 (2021), recently signed into law in California by Governor Newsom, flies in the face of this U.S. Supreme Court decision and is a flagrant violation of the U.S. Constitution.*   This is sometimes readily solved by ""leaving California"" (and that's certainly part of the solution), but becomes a pain [when California decides it will become an enforcer relating to virtual currency laws, which apparently it has already decided it will do](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200AB1864) (as this no doubt will cause California to ultimately attempt to act against people outside of the State). This ""enforcement"" role actually was a change done in 2020, when the California Legislature subtly renamed its ‚ÄúDepartment of Business Oversight‚Äù into the ‚ÄúDepartment of Financial Protection and Innovation,‚Äù and designated it as an entity authorized to prosecute violators of virtual currency laws, following the passage of AB 1864 in 2020.

CryptoCurrency,IMF warns of global risks from unregulated cryptocurrency boom. (Super FUD),"&gt;Greater financial instability, fraud and funding of terrorism likely unless governments toughen supervision, fund says

International Monetary Fund (IMF)

Tougher regulation is needed to prevent the rapid growth in¬†cryptocurrencies¬†leading to financial instability, defrauding of consumers and the funding of terrorism, the International Monetary Fund has said.

The Washington-based IMF said the 10-fold increase in the market value of crypto assets ‚Äì digital or virtual currencies ‚Äì to more than $2tn since early 2020 required more active and collaborative supervision by governments.

In a chapter from its forthcoming Global Financial Stability Report, the IMF said many of the new cryptocurrencies lacked robust governance and¬†risk practices.

Dimitris Drakopoulos, Fabio Natalucci and Evan Papageorgiou, authors of the chapter, said in a blog that crypto exchanges had faced significant disruptions during periods of market turbulence. ‚ÄúThere are also several high-profile cases of hacking-related thefts of customer funds. So far, these incidents have not had a significant impact on financial stability. However, as crypto assets become more mainstream, their importance in terms of potential implications for the wider economy is set to increase,‚Äù they said.

The blog noted the substantial risks to consumers from inadequate disclosure and oversight, given that some currencies were ‚Äúlikely created solely for speculation purposes or even outright fraud. The (pseudo) anonymity of crypto assets also creates data gaps for regulators and can open unwanted doors for money laundering, as well as terrorist financing.‚Äù

The IMF also highlighted potential problems with the four-fold increase in the supply of stablecoins ‚Äì cryptocurrencies that aim to peg their value, usually against the US dollar ‚Äì to $120bn (¬£88bn) during 2021.

The blog said: ‚ÄúGiven the composition of their reserves, some stablecoins could be subject to runs, with knock-on effects to the financial system. The runs could be driven by investor concerns about the quality of their reserves or the speed at which reserves can be liquidated to meet potential redemptions.‚Äù

Last month, China¬†made transactions in cryptocurrencies illegal, but the IMF said emerging and developing countries appeared to be leading the way with their use. This risked damaging the ability of central banks to effectively implement monetary policy and potentially created financial stability risks, it added.

‚ÄúAs a first step, regulators and supervisors need to be able to monitor rapid developments in the crypto ecosystem and the risks they create by swiftly tackling data gaps. The global nature of crypto assets means that policymakers should enhance cross-border coordination to minimise the risks of regulatory arbitrage and ensure effective supervision and enforcement,‚Äù the IMF said.

CryptoCurrency,"Will Bitcoin hit $100,000 by the end of 2021? Ultra-Bullish Chicky Nuggy Discusses.","Bitcoin could hit fresh all-time highs of $100,000 by the end of 2021 due to five key important factors driving momentum, predicts the CEO of this Reddit account.

The ultra-bullish prediction from Chicky Nuggy CEO and all round great guy comes after a strong end to the week in the crypto sector, with the world‚Äôs largest digital currency gaining almost 10.8% on Friday evening over the previous 24 hours.

On Saturday morning the price was almost $47,800.

Mr Nuggy says: ‚ÄúLast month, I noted in the media that we can expect the price of Bitcoin to hit, or even surpass, its mid-April all-time high of $65,000 by the end of 2021.

‚ÄúI now think that this is too conservative.  I‚Äôm confident that if the current momentum in prices continues, we could see the Bitcoin price hit to-date unknown highs of $100,000.  

‚ÄúEven though Bitcoin‚Äôs place in the global financial system is already assured, this would be a truly landmark moment.‚Äù

The Nugget lover believes there are five key drivers of the momentum fuelling the surge in the Bitcoin price.

‚ÄúFirst, the Federal Reserve ‚Äì the world‚Äôs de facto central bank ‚Äì has come out this week and said that the U.S.- the world‚Äôs largest economy - does not intend to ban cryptocurrencies.  

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs likely that other digital currencies will have greater regulatory oversight, which also is likely to positively shore-up the sector for the longer-term, but Bitcoin might be seen as a separate case by the authorities due, in part, to its digital gold-like status,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúSecond, there is sustained and growing interest from institutional investors including Wall Street giants and major payments companies, who bring with them their capital, expertise and reputational influence.

‚ÄúThird, the increasing number of mega influencers such as Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey and Cathie Wood who have a clear message: crypto is the inevitable future of money.‚Äù

He continues: ‚ÄúFourth, the technicals support the prediction.  History teaches us that the year that follows a Bitcoin halving, values rise significantly. Following the 2012 and 2016 halvings, prices rose by 55 times and 15 times, respectively, thereby suggesting that a move to $100,000 could be on the cards after the 2020 event.

Time for an ad break - drop a üêî for a moon or award. (I HAVE NOW RAN OUT OF COINS SORRY)

‚ÄúAnd fifth, cryptocurrencies, of which Bitcoin is the most dominant, have already changed the way the world handles money, makes transactions, does business, and manages assets. Investors appreciate the inherent value of digital, borderless, global currencies for trade and commerce purposes in increasingly digitalised economies in which businesses operate in more than one jurisdiction.

‚ÄúThis will only grow as mass global adoption moves ahead.  

‚ÄúFor example, El Salvador last month became the world‚Äôs first sovereign nation to officially buy Bitcoin and to make the cryptocurrency legal tender ‚Äì and there is no way it will be the last.‚Äù

Mr Chicky N goes on to say that the momentum created by Bitcoin, the market leader, will have the effect of putting other major digital assets including Ethereum and Cardano on a significant upward trajectory.

He concludes: ‚ÄúBitcoin has stormed back after a mini-dip.  There‚Äôs little reason to believe it won‚Äôt continue its current upswing and significantly beat previous all-time highs.‚Äù",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Paying off the rest of student loan strategy,"I had an idea for paying off the rest of my student loans and wanted to see if it was valid - it‚Äôs often that the loopholes I think of are not possible due to certain laws or mechanisms. Or math. 

I have about $1800 left on my student loans which I have not paid since March due to the deferred payments and I was holding out to see if the Biden administration would make good on their word to cancel $10k of student debt per person (leave your politics at the door please). Of course that hasn‚Äôt happened up to this point and loans are becoming due again in January. 

I was reading that as of 2019 student loan payments, up to $10k, can count as qualified 529 plan expenses. I am already planning on starting a 529 for my newborn, but I‚Äôm wondering if I should stuff $1800 in a new account now with me as the beneficiary which can grow tax free for a few months before I have to start making payments again ($151 monthly). 

Once payments become due I can just make a qualified expense each month while the account balance has the opportunity to grow. It doesn‚Äôt really reduce how much I end up paying, but I might be able to leave a couple hundred dollars in there all said and done for my baby. Then once my loan is paid off I can switch the beneficiary designation to her, right? Aside from the market risk of investment assets going down, is there any drawback to this? I‚Äôm not worried about having the $1800 tied up for a year as we have plenty of savings to cover and in a real emergency we have access to other funds.

**Edit**: so it turns out while this works federally, withdrawals for student loan payments are subject to income tax and a 2.5% penalty in California, so any small gains I might make would be wiped out by state taxes anyway.",finance
personalfinance,Make higher student loan payments or contribute to 401k?,"I had a career change a few years ago so Im 40 and I still have a lot of student loans (200K). I make about 180K a year (150K annually + 30K bonus). My student loan payment on a 15 year plan is 1150 but I make 2000 monthly payments. Interest rate is 3.64% and I contribute 5% to my 401K which is what my employer matches. In addition, I save about 1000 a month which I‚Äôve been putting in crypto. I‚Äôve accumulated about 100K in my 401K and 10K in crypto and other savings. Since my interest rate on the student loan is 3.64%, should I continue to make the 2K student loan payment or should I only make the minimum payment of 1150 and contribute the 850 to 401K? If the former, at what interest rate would it make sense to do the latter?

My current interest rate is low: 3.25% and the mortgage runs until 2055. My mortgage payment is $1,177 and my rent for where I live now is $1400.

I owe back taxes in the amount of $25k (federal lien). I have CC debt in the amount of $10k. I am thinking of refinancing for \~$50k. My credit is only okay (690). I have a high usage rate (61%), but otherwise no bad marks. I relied on credit cards because I've been in law school these past three years, so I don't intend to repeat any bad behavior.

solana,Long read from a finance boy - When will it all go tits up - and how do you value growth (ie: Solana),"It's 9PM in Switzerland on a Saturday night and my whole family is asleep. I've gone wine tasting all afternoon and can't find the energy to do something productive so I'll try to improve your day by sharing some basic knowledge:

The basis of valuing a company:

1. When you buy a company, you buy a share in a future stream of its cash flows. In other words: you pay to receive the company's profits to infinity and you discount those infinite profits back to today to put a value on this stream of cash flows.
2. The simplest way to think of the discount rate to ""discount"" the profit, is to think of the opportunity cost of your money invested somewhere else but in the company in question. One key element of this discount rate is the ""risk free"" rate you get on US government bonds.
3. The market focuses on the 10 year interest rate for US government bonds as its proxy. When this rate goes up, the value of the company by simple math goes down. (Profit / Discount rate) = Value of company.
4. Now, I mentioned we look at profits to infinity, but the further the profit, the less that profit matters. For the less math inclined = a dollar of cash today is worth more than a dollar of cash in 100 years cause you dead. For the ones who like math: Value of company = profit year 1 / (1 + discount rate)\^1 + profit year n / (1 + discount rate)\^n to infinity
5. Why tech and growth gets toast when the discount rate increases? Because if we look at old value stocks (such as oil companies), we know their profits are large in the near term but their future is less sexy and profits not as much of an important driver in the future let's say 10+ years - investors focus on their dividend and current profit more than future growth. So investors focus on the near term and discount the near term.On the other hand, growth companies (tech sector), sometimes are not even profitable and what investors invest for are the profits expected in let's say 10 year+. As a result this makes the discount rate a HUGE part of the valuation. IN SHORT: an increase in the discount rate makes a MUCH bigger difference to a growth company than for a value company. (Try this in excel for yourself, and you'll see the huge impact this makes).

Where will Solana Go?

1. Now why did markets get beaten down over the last few weeks and Solana in particular loosing +33% from the top - because every single time Powell speaks he gives us hints at how he is thinking about the economy and as a result ""when"" he will potentially increase rates. The market trades 10 year bonds, and as a result the market prices (correctly or not) what Powell and the Fed will do in the future, which is why he might not directly touch the rates, but the market will react and move the 10 year bond rate. What is important to know is that the rate is not just controlled by Powell, but the Fed is guided and if there is let's say a huge amount of inflation - he would be forced to raise rates to contain this inflation. In other words, no one knows - but everyone makes assumptions as to what the future will look like and uses that to value companies.
2. WHY THE HECK DO I CARE ABOUT THIS STUFF? GIMME SOLANA TO THE MOON! Hold on one minute. We are going to get there, but I have a few more things to say.
3. I view Solana like a growth stock, I am an early adopter (only put scrap in the projects so not a seven figure moon boy unfortunately). I saw Solana and its capability, read about the project and was convinced (especially by the team). I am not so interested in what can be built on it, I am interested in buying a share in it like a real company, there is a real cash flow that can be translated in dollar from its wide adoption. Holding tokens bring you concrete dollars in your pockets (staking etc...). At the time Solana was really just an interesting alt coin, and there was clearly no money coming out of it in the immediate term. Today, I am taking a large bet like all of you, because the coin is in its infancy, like Microsoft or Amazon in the nineties - it was just ideas but no one knew where it would take us.
4. This brings me to: no one can accurately value a growth stock because no one will know what the real cash flows will be like for Solana in ten years. Exactly like Amazon back then. This means just one thing: Either you believe in the project and hold, or GTFO and sell. In the short term, there are general market moves and the ten year yield has an impact on all growth sectors and will sway us down and back up - but in the long term the profit part of the equation is the most important one and no one has any idea what it will be for Solana.
5. There are further catalysts for Cryptos and Solana. The fed tapering in November that will undoubtedly start, that means the Fed will slow down its money printing. By how much? No one knows. But with less money chasing all assets we could see a gap of air and small corrections. Again, no one knows what the Fed is capable of - for now Japan is about to restart its printer and Europe seem to never want to stop said printer. So it's a bit cocky of me to just say we should expect a correction in November, because... Repeat after me: no one knows, no matter by how much people try to bullshit you with their analysis.
6. Final point. If you have read this far. The ten year rate affects the market and growth stocks (cryptos) like Solana. The Fed tapering could affect the market as well. Government crack downs. The health of Anatoly (who I hope is getting plenty of sleep, works out, and eats well) because we need his leadership at this stage in the project. You are buying an extremely early stage asset that could very well be the leader amongst all cryptos with use that we can't even think of. Or you could be buying a start up and it could fail like many startups tend to. Bottom line: if you are buying for a quick buck, no one knows where the market will be so just go bet it on red at the casino and save yourself the hassle of losing money over an extended period of time. If you believe in the project, who the fuck cares what it's going to be doing tomorrow? We care about the cash flows in year 10+ because, it's a growth stock... \_OVER AND OUT\_

I just asked her and she can only afford about $250 per month paying down the card.

She could give me $250 this month, but next month the credit card company (American Express) would still require another $200 minimum payment so.. she couldn‚Äôt pay me and her next months bill. 


I could loan her $1,000 or $1,500 right now, but due to my own upcoming expenses I can‚Äôt pay off the whole thing. 



Is there a way my $1,000 or so can help this situation now while still getting reimbursed?

cybersecurity,Do Private Cyber Companies in California Drug Test?,"I'm beginning the interview process with a small-ish privately owned cybersecurity company in California.

... it's not bitcoin fundamentals or national/worldwide ban(s). It's the possible eternal ignorance of mankind which unsettles me for the future outlook of bitcoin.

I found to bitcoin in the end of december 2020. first bought on the 25th of december. went in heavy directly. no DCA stuff. eventhough this seems pretty wise. Had a lot of fomo. Found out that this was a good decision. lost some while trading on bybit. fuck that shit. stopped trading after i lost around a good piece of my portfolio cake. but never lost hope it the whole thing. kept educating me about bitcoin. never felt for the altcoin seduction. it got bloody in the crash. but never lost hope. even not in july where i was partly down \~10 % - felt pretty fucked up - imagening the fact that, if never started trading i could have sold at 200% during my first (part)bullrun. but hey, i think i got the message. in math we trust. bought again at 45k in the crash. had no fiat to buy the bottom of the crash at 30k. but i bougt again in may at 45k and again a few days ago at 41k, after selling my remaining stocks. 

Reading all your stories and listening to people like michael saylor (i know...bitcoin doesnt need anyone) ...but never the less... this all made me pretty calm in my inner self concerning all the smoke and flashlights/FUD around BTC. - Still can't believe i eventhough i am irresponibly long on BTC for my league - all in.

to come back to my point...

i have some smart friends. but none of them seem interested in bitcoin. doesnt matter how much i preach them. Bitcoin, its faith and its possible rise seems to be a much too fantastic theme to be true...no one seems to believe it. OR they think its to late XD

I think ignorance of the people. the easyness to get fed by mass media - not using the own brain....thats the real threat to Bitcoin and Mankind. Isnt it?

bonds,Now is a good time to learn about fixed income investing.,"We are going to see rate rises globally over the next year, and now is a good time to learn about fixed income IMO. 

You don't want to be trying to understand how it works and forming a strategy while it's all happening. 

I think it's become fairly clear by now that inflation isn't transient, or confined to supply bottle-neck situations. The sort of prices rises we are now seeing are broad rises across most measured goods and services. It's not 'just oil' or 'base effects'. Producer prices are rocketing, wholesale prices are rising, import costs *and* export costs are up in many cases. Labour prices are up. And this is happening globally, in all countries that have easy monetary conditions.

The Fed, and other central banks, will respond to this. If they don't, then runaway inflation is a real danger. And the longer they wait to respond, the more they will have to eventually increase rates, and the more endemic and problematic the inflation will become. Because once people and businesses expect inflation, it becomes self-fulfilling. And it's very dangerous to allow that expectation to set in, because un-setting it requires some brutality.

When rates increase, what will happen is current bonds will begin to increase in yield and decrease in price. You would want to be short on these, but you have to be careful because if you are short when the dividends are paid, you have to pay them. And these dividends will be increasing notably on short-dated maturities as there are no longer maturities to smooth the fund out. So consider using several ETFs and moving between them to avoid dividends, assuming the transaction fees aren't prohibitive.

The unknown quantity here is how much and how quickly the Fed will increase rates, and what effect will that have on inflation. I expect they will tread lightly, but if we see numbers like 7-8% inflation, they really might have to hit the brakes. One of the main problems with inflation-targeting monetary policy is there is a lag time of around a year before rate rises start to take effect. So if you let it get to 7-8%, then inching rates up by 25 points will do nothing. You'd need to shock the market with something like a 100pt hikes. Obviously this is something to be avoided if possible, but at some point it must be done, because once the inflation becomes endemic then it will not go away on it's own. And it would not be pleasant to live under. People associate inflation with asset price increases, but once rates start rising, it won't be like that. Assets will almost certainly be losing value in real terms and very possibly in nominal terms too.

There isn't going to be an easy way to define when you should start exiting your short, but it should be somewhere around when rates are at their half-way point to their eventual peak. 

And as you exit the short (which would ideally be done in increasing increments), you want to go long. Now what we are doing is locking in some future income at good rates. Depending on the evolving economic situation, you may also look to go long on certain corporate bonds here, pick a portfolio if you feel proficient, and secure some ridiculous rates for the next decade or two.

None of this would be easy to time, but it at least gives you a broad idea of what you could be trying to do if we have a raising rates scenario.",finance

But on another note; the FED is gearing up for a stong regulatory framework to go after exchanges and stablecoins.   


"" Washington regulators are now preparing to unleash a torrent of rules aimed at bringing crypto to heel. ""  


"" Powell indicated he wants to impose federal standards on stablecoins. His comments came as details began to leak about a key Biden administration report expected to recommend that regulators develop bank-like rules for stablecoins.""

"" Top regulators fear stablecoins could invite a sort of bank run if the reserves backing them aren‚Äôt sufficiently large or liquid to meet a sudden demand for redemptions. ""  


"" The President‚Äôs Working Group on Financial Markets  **is nearly done with recommendations for regulating the assets**. A report ‚Äî final drafts of which have circulated to relevant agencies ‚Äî **is set to suggest imposing rules derived from banking regulations on stablecoin issuers**. That could involve demanding the companies to secure a new type of charter, which would require Congress to create one. ""  


""The group also will propose the possibility of a review of stablecoins. **If that panel finds that the assets could grow to pose a risk to the stability of the financial system, the Fed would be tasked with developing rules to contain the threat. ""**  


"" The public probably won‚Äôt see the report until after the Fed publishes a separate paper exploring whether the U.S. government should issue its own digital currency.

NFT,What Happens to the Animation or Image for an NFT if the Cloud Hosting Service Disappears?,"Most NFTs, far as I know, link to a cloud host to host the images and supply an IPFS gateway. 

Was wondering what happens to an NFT if:

*  The cloud hosting for the NFT's image or animation disappears because the cloud host goes out of business or the creator of the NFT dies and stops paying for hosting of the image? The Nonfungible tokens can not be updated right? So you are stuck with a URL to a dead cloud host in your NFT forever.
* An NFT creator stops paying their cloud host and the NFT image drops down into a free tier of cloud hosting on that host and it will no longer supply enough bandwidth to support a an NFT being displayed in a public online gallery or in a virtual world etc.
* A free tier of cloud hosting is chosen by the NFT creator from the very start and then an owner of an NFT runs out of bandwidth from visitors to their NFT when they put it some where where it gets traffic.

Are there better solutions out there than cloud businesses charging a monthly fee, like say some kind of community driven cloud or community driven peer to peer cloud?

Is self-blochain hosted SVG image files stuffed into the metadata of the NFT actually viable. How does one get a URL path to such a thing so it can be displayed in an img tag.

personalfinance,Traditional IRAs tax strategy -- am I understanding this correctly?,"Tonight I was trying to wrap my mind around the different tax vehicles and how they operate (particularly Traditional IRAs) when I had a realization. Would appreciate any help validating or correcting me on my understanding here!

**Roth 401k**

* Employee sponsored. I pay taxes on money as I receive it from work. The money going into my Roth 401k is not tax-deductible, but in retirement I can pull out growth tax-free. I feel like I hear people say you also pull out contributions tax free, but this seems backwards to me since I already paid taxes on my contributions the year I made the money. (e.g. I put $10k in from the $50k I made this year. All $50k is subject to tax at then end of the year)

**Roth IRA**

* Not employee sponsored, has income limits. If under those income limits, it operates very similar to the Roth 401k (e.g. I put $5k in from the $50k I made this year. All $50k is subject to tax at then end of the year).

**Traditional 401k**

* Employee sponsored. I can put pre-tax money into this account up to a limit. The idea here is essentially deferring all tax liability until I pull the money out in retirement, at which point I will be taxed, but hopefully in a low(er) income bracket. (e.g I put $10k in from the $50k I made this year. Only $40k is subject to tax at the end of the year)

**Traditional IRA**

* I can contribute pre-tax money to a traditional IRA given I meet the income requirements. This money is tax-deferred come end of year. However...

...*here's where I think I made my big realization*. For the longest time I've been confused at how these operated because people phrase these vehicles as pre-tax. To me that seemed incorrect because you put money into these accounts from money you receive from paychecks that have already had taxes taken out! It's not like the Traditional 401k where your employer handles the pre-tax deduction for you. But then I remembered that when you fill out your W-2 it's on you to tell the IRS what your taxable income will be, so if you're smart about it and know you'll contribute $5k to your Traditional IRA that year, you can drop your taxable income on your W-2 down by that much, effectively never having that $5k taxed on your paychecks. Is that correct? For example, if I see $300 dollars going to federal/state taxes on each paycheck, that number could have easily been $200 or $400 depending on how I filled out my W-2. Any difference or miscalculation renders you in a situation where you're either owing money to the IRS or receiving a tax refund. Is the ability to forecast your own taxable income the reason people say a Traditional IRA is ""pre-tax"" vehicle? Either way it seems that the money comes back to you because you either never paid tax on it to begin with or because you'll get it on your refund at the end of the year.",finance

Bitcoin,"Unpopular opinion: Collateralized loans will move BTC from retail to institutions, who will get even richer.","LTV of loans of 50% (or other %) make it so you can only ever get half (or a partial) of the BTC you loaned out back. 
 
Meaning, many people plan on buying more BTC with the loan money, and while in theory it seems like it will work, it will just end up enriching institutions.
 
The reason is this: *The only thing anyone  does with your lent Bitcoin is sell/short it.* That's it, there is no other use case for lenders wanting your BTC.

When loaning bitcoin you are essentially selling half of your coin into the market, putting downward pressure on it. Maybe some shorts gets rekt, and they pay the coin back, but gess what? The institutions loan out your coins to be sold *again*. As long as your coins are loaned, they are adding to sell pressure.

Why will institutions get richer? Because if even only a percentage of people have bought bitcoin with their collateral, and the price is able to be dropped, folks will be liquidating their bitcoin they bought with the loan to pay it back, adding to sell pressure already in the market. Sure some may have other sources of funds to top up the loan but this is an exception, rather than the rule.

If the price keeps dropping, this is where the institutions lick their lips as they watch our LTV dip below 50%. The loan is now under collateralized, either making us give them *even more* BTC to cover the gap, which they they then of course short, or we liquidate our BTC collateral to cover the loan, giving our coins to the institutions, one way or another.

Volatility needs to be much lower, and market cap needs to be much higher for this to work in our favor. But guess what? By the time this happens, institutions will be lending *us* bitcoin which we will hold dearly, because we hope it beats inflation and the loan interest rate. And by us I mean only those who can afford to post the collateral for bitcoin.

TLDR;
They wont have to court you for your coins, you will give them up willingly for a fiat loan. Price drops will be engineered to call your loans. Much later they will loan BTC back to you, and then you will hodl it. Don't lend out your BTC, you will miss it.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,"NFT play Axie infinity (AXS) launches staking service with huge annual interest, share price rises 70%","Yesterday, the team behind Axie Infinity announced that they had launched a new strike service. This is not just any strike service, as according to Axie infinity, annual interest rates of around 385% are possible!

https://preview.redd.it/0k4avcv4a8r71.png?width=607&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c9ce74a09ec7610cb5daa8e7073fba6c8e69b1ea

Fairly quickly, some $1.17 billion was already tied up by investors in Axie Infinity's strike contract. Important to note is the fact that as more people participate in the strike contact, the annual interest rates get lower. By now, this rate stands at 226%. Still not bad.

AXS is also the ""governance token"" of Axie Infinity. That is, by owning AXS you can vote on future updates and governance of the platform. This makes staking even more interesting, because this way through staking you also get a say in the project.",cryptocurrency

**Market Overview**

September has been a pretty negative month with the overall market seeing its value decline by 7%. The fear and greed index slipped back into extreme fear and now sits at fear. However there are reasons to be positive. Firstly the Chairman of the Fed, Jerome Powell, told congress he did not intend to ban crypto currency, although he said stablecoins needed greater regulatory oversight. Secondly, the massive recent negativity surrounding China‚Äôs ban on crypto looks to have been overdone as usual. It is evident that the Chinese crypto enthusiast has no intention of letting the crypto revolution pass him by. It appears as though they have started trading through DEX‚Äôs as witnessed by the surge in trade on Dydx. Finally the Chair of the SEC said that he supported a bitcoin ETF, another positive step forward for the industry. So all in all a positive week.

**Trending**

**Regulators target DeFi**

The SEC is investigating Uniswap Labs, the organization behind the leading DEX Uniswap. It is early days yet but is a sign of things to come. That news was followed by the announcement that New Jersey had served a cease and desist order on Celsius, a leading yield farming platform which advertises, ‚Äòearn 17% yield on your crypto‚Äô. Alabama and Texas are also looking at doing the same. Both Celsius and Uniswap rolled out the same statement that they are willing to work with regulators. Finally, Coinbase was told in no uncertain terms that if they continued with their plans to launch a lending platform the SEC would sue. Whilst Coinbase continued to deny that lending represented a regulated activity, they had no choice but to shelve or bin their proposals.

Check out our [Staking and Yield Farming Review](https://medium.com/the-capital/weekly-staking-and-yield-farming-review-23rd-september-2021-6904585050c4) which sets out our thinking on these regulatory actions and what strategy investors should follow.

**The UK‚Äôs Post Office enters crypto**

Yes you heard it right! The Post Office announced that its app can be used to connect to a decentralized exchange called Swarm Markets, from there vouchers can be purchased that are redeemable for crypto. British politicians were up in arms about the announcement. The fully diluted market cap of Swarm is a modest $70 million, could be worth a closer look assuming the unhappy politicians don‚Äôt get their way.

**That old chestnut - China**

The recent stumble in the crypto market was blamed on China‚Äôs now outright ban of crypto no doubt to protect it‚Äôs digital yuan which it is rolling out. This should be no surprise. China has been tough on crypto for some time, the only surprise is this didn't happen sooner. Crypto will do just fine without China.

**Binance again**

Every month there is never any shortage of negative stories to write about when it comes to Binance‚Äôs trials and tribulations. This month saw the announcement that both the IRS and the DOJ are investigating. It is reported that this is for market manipulation and insider trading. Binance also announced it was withdrawing from yet another market, Singapore. We do hope that investors who use Binance‚Äôs central wallet have started to move their crypto into their own wallet.

**Robinhood and PayPal**

Robinhood announced that they were rolling out a crypto wallet with transfer features allowing customers to store crypto and move in and out of their apps. The market considers Robinhood a serious threat to Coinbase‚Äôs business with this move. Meanwhile back in the grey and damp UK PayPal announced they were introducing crypto trading services through their PayPal accounts. Of course there is a limited selection of coins available including the Bitcoin fork Bitcoin Cash valued at a ridiculous $10 billion.

**Cardano introducing its own stablecoin**

September saw the launch of the much anticipated and long overdue smart contract functionality on the Cardano blockchain. Named the Djed, it is an algorithmic stablecoin as compared to one backed by fiat. Its new stable coin is expected to make transaction costs on the Cardano network cheaper and more predictable. Its announcement comes at a time when US regulators are considering regulating or banning stablecoins.

**Finally‚Ä¶**

There is talk that the SEC is investigating Tether, the leading stablecoin player. This shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise to anyone following the shenanigans at Tether over their total lack of transparency since inception. There have been multiple reports of investigations into breaching banking and security laws.

CryptoCurrency,"Monero is so completely private, the IRS has a $625,000 cash bounty out for anyone that can crack it","If you really value privacy, you may want to be holding some Monero (XMR). This token allows for completely private transactions, so much so that the federal government's IRS is convinced people are avoiding taxes with it and has issued a cash bounty of $625,000 for anyone that can hack the token to reveal any information on who uses it. So far, no one has claimed the prize. Other government agencies are also convinced that other illegal activities are being carried out with the token due to its anonynous nature.

personalfinance,"Recent college grad with a lot of debt, unsure of how to proceed.","Hello everyone,
I am a recent college grad and have just accepted a job offer as an electrical engineer (with an A.S.) for $56,000 with a raise to $60,000 after 3 months, and a review after 6 months for another raise. I start next week. If I understand correctly, the company offers a 25% 401k match with no limit. I will not be eligible for this until February 2022. My current debts are as follows


Foo | Bar | text
---|---|----
Debt | Current Balance | Interest Rate
Credit Card | 561 | 11.88
CC | 660 | 3.99

SL (Private) | 30060 | 8.37
SL (Private) | 14890 | 8.75
Total | 79614 | 7.44

I am a bit disappointed with myself for taking on so much debt, but I have a mental disability and I could not successfully go to school and work at the same time. I started school as an adult learner at 26 and got no assistance from either of my parents. Currently I am living at home with a parent expense free and I own my car outright. I have about $800 in my checking account and $7000 in a Roth IRA from before school. I will be required to start making payments on my private loans in December although they are accruing interest until then, and my fed loans are not due until February I believe. Without getting too personal, my parent and I are both alcoholics, I am 2.5 years in recovery, but they are still in active addiction. This makes it difficult to live with them, but it seems like the smartest thing to do right now. I want to own my own home, and plan on buying a multifamily property for my first house. My questions are, should I be saving for retirement at all right now with so much high interest debt, should I even be thinking about saving for a house at this point, and when I become eligible for the company match how should i balance taking advantage of the match with my own personal savings goals? I have made a budget and have been studying the prime directive flow chart so I understand that my debt should take priority, but I am 29 now and don't want to put myself in a position where I have no retirement savings as I approach middle age. Any advice or guidance would be much appreciated.",finance

personalfinance,"Parents are out $20,000 and their SSN in a gift card scam. The scammer may call them back next week for more money - is there anything they can do to catch them?","For more context, my parents were blindsided in a typical but very elaborate gift card scam that made them believe top-ranking government officials were asking for money to bring a case against a terrorist using my parents' identity. My parents paid them through withdrawing money from their bank and purchasing gift cards.

They are sure all that money is gone but are also worried because the scammers were recording them for 9 hours a day on the phone and also got all of the personal data (SSN, Driver's License no., etc.)

The people on the phone still think my parents believe in the scam at this point and said they may call back on Monday or later in the week to give updates on the case (probably to try and get more money). Is there anything they can do at this point to try and get information on the scammers or trace the line? The scammers are using a fake number and fake caller ID, but is there any way to see their true number?

Note: They have already filed a report with the local police department but haven't received a lot of help otherwise there.

EDIT: Lots of comments wondering about how they were able to get scammed. I wish I could go into all the detail but it would take an hour. There were a lot of red flags but even the PD said they hadn't seen anything this elaborate. They had an entire team of officials claiming to be people who were verifiable via the internet and my mom said she wouldn't talk to them until she got some kind of confirmation of who they were and they immediately received a call from the local police department telling them to cooperate. They were very blindsided by not realizing how caller Names and ID's could be spoofed this well. Scammers also tried to never really use the word ""gift card"" they kept trying to say it was some kind of way to transfer money to the government without alerting dangerous people. Parents also are in total acceptance now that they missed many big things and are very ashamed of how it could have happened.",finance

personalfinance,How to invest with untaxed or unearned income?,"Hello, I am a 25 y/o who just separated from the military. I am a full-time student and receive roughly $3300/month tax free from the VA. I also receive around 11k in refunded grants from my school per semester (22k/ year). This is guaranteed for this year but I am unsure if I will receive as much in the following years. I currently have 6k in an emergency fund. I also only have about 2k in my TSP (military/federal retirement). 

I have about 15k in student loans at 4% from before I joined the military, roughly $4000 in an auto loan at 8%, and $0 credit card debt. 

I plan to pay off my car first and then build up my emergency fund to about $12k which is 6 months of all my expenses.

I am trying to figure out what to do with my money from here? There is a possibility I can have my student loans forgiven if my disability percentage is increased (it probably should be). 

I was thinking of opening and meeting the 6k threshold for a Roth IRA but I would only qualify for this year. The next few years all my income will be tax free or unearned. 

Should I open an IRA this year and then open a regular  account the next year? 
 
What are the options out there for my situation? The usual advice I see is to meet an employer match for 401k and then max IRA, but after this year I won't qualify for either.

My current credit limit is $1500. Throughout the month I make my purchases and build up my utilization to about 20-23%, $300-350, just making food and gas purchases I would make otherwise. My cycle ends on the 23rd, so on the 23rd I pay my balance and full and continue on. This is my only credit card or loan of any kind. So far I have a 707 credit score, which seems to be good, but I really wanna build it as high as I can before I graduate college.

I work fulltime alongside school during the school year and summer and have help from my parents so I've managed to avoid any student debt up to this point. I'm struggling to maintain my workload with my class schedule this semester, and generally want to enjoy my last year, but I can't afford to quit my job and still pay for next tuition/rent through May.

I've also been told that having a mix of credit is a good thing for your credit score, but I'm not sure if this applies.

My questions:

1.) How am I doing? Is there a bottom threshold on credit utilization, like would 5% being a good thing or should I keep it 10+%?

2.) Should I get a student loan? It would be the federal unsub loan, repayment starts 6 months after graduation but interest builds now.

3.) Can I use my credit score to leverage for a better student loan, and how do I do this/what does a better deal on student loans look like?",finance

Career goal is being a cop then working a federal job after a few years of experience, will have better income soon. The academy I'm going into soon pays applicants for attending as well.

I'm torn between completely paying off my debt and staying in this hole, using all the money to support me moving out and being in debt for a long time, or putting half towards debt and seeing what I can afford to move out with for the rest.

Take home pay after taxes, insurance and 401k (5%, company matches) is $3470. Graduated with 14.5k in federal student loans and since having this job I have been putting aside $2600 a month for student loans. I will have saved enough to pay off my loans by the first week of December. I also plan to have an extra 8k saved up by the end of December.

‚Ä¢$4.5k at 0% until Feb. 2022. I have $1.5k set aside that is not my emergency fund for this. 

‚Ä¢$12k at 0% until Nov. 2022. 


I also have $27k in federal student loans at 6.2-7.2%. I do not qualify for any forgiveness programs.

I am making $185k/year with $25k bonus that is pretty much guaranteed. I max out my 401k and have done so for since 24. (I‚Äôm in my early 30s.)

I have $50k in investments (not part of 401k), but would like to refrain from cashing that out if possible.

I understand the priority with paying off credit card debt, but would it be better to pay off student loans first before saving for a down payment? Should I cash out my investments to pay off student loans and to fund my down payment? 

I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt have any debt and should have enough saved for a down payment by now and I‚Äôm a little overwhelmed. I will be the first to admit that I am not good at budgeting. What usually happens is I come up with an overly ambitious budget, so I end up feeling really anxious the whole month and if I even go a little bit over in the dining budget, I end up just disregarding the whole thing. 

Any help with prioritizing student loans vs. saving for down payment or budgeting would be really appreciated.

stocks,Thoughts on buying KO (Coke) with Pepsi earnings coming up?,"Last earnings report, Pepsi had a spectacular earnings, and KO went up along because it was widely thought KO's earning would reflect what Pepsi had. Pepsi's earnings is this Tuesday pre market, and I was thinking about picking up KO on Monday as a short term play (a few months), but can evolve into a long term play depending on how things turn out. I have two main reasons:

1. I think the earnings will beat again. More and more people are starting to go out not only in the United States, but also around the world. Restaurants have more people, movies have more people, travel, and many more.
2. KO can pass inflation costs down to consumers. With high inflation uncertainty, at worst case, KO can just increase the price, and consumers will pay the price of inflation, and earnings will probably continue to increase. People may start parking their money into stocks that can make consumers front the inflation cost, so this would be good for KO

Though one concern I have about a short term play is how hard are the supply chain issues hitting KO (if at all). The Pepsi earnings may have supply chain issues, which may rattle investors for KO alike. Though if this is the case, I think I'll just change my strategy to long, as I think it will be a ""safer"" stock to hold throughout the upcoming year, two, or three with inflation and Fed tapering / increasing rates.

What are your thoughts? Any other points that I should think about?

Edit: Forgot to mention why I'm buying KO instead of Pepsi outright, think KO has been hit harder than Pepsi in the recent weeks, so I think it is oversold.",finance

My mortgage company sent me papers for the Covid mortgage modification program which, if I agree to the terms will change my mortgage from 30yr fixed 4.2% interest to 30yr fixed 2.8%, but reset the maturity date from 2039 to 2051. My mortgage would then be considered current and the money I've saved since January could continue earning (so far 14% avg for the year). I'm looking for advice on whether it would be better to accept the loan modification or pay the mortgage come December and then try to refinance next year. I've been interested in doing a cash out refinance to do an addition, but if I do the loan modification I wouldnt need to refi anyway. I'm a little worried if I dont accept it I risk not getting a better interest rate than 2.8%, however I was advised that accepting the ALM will negatively affect my credit (I currently have average credit). The monthly payment also drops from $1800 to $1300, which will also free up more money to invest each month...
What is the best option, and has anyone else encountered the ALM plan? I'm curious if theres anything I should be researching about it before considering the modification? There doesnt seem to be any penalties other than maturity date extension and credit score drop...

investing,Stock/Funds/ETF Gains: Unrealized vs Realized vs Compound [Question],"I am trying to better understand what are the best approaches to formulate several investment accounts that focus separately on short, medium, long, and retirement terms. The retirement I'm ok with as my 401k and Roth would operate with standard mutual fund principles. I am also fully aware of the concept of Dollar Cost Averaging.

What I'm trying to decipher in my head is understanding the link between the power of Compound Interest in combination to the above investment terms. I already understand the relation of compounding in the scope of dividends. You get the dividends and they get automatically reinvested, perfect. But my question here is related to stocks, mutual funds, and ETFs. I will lay out how I understand them (ignoring the concepts of dividends altogether, so let's assume none of them disburse any dividends).

Stocks: You buy at one price. The stock goes up in price accounting for your unrealized gains. You must sell your stock (at profit) to now have realized gains. Then you have to reinvest your entire investment amount, which is initial investment + realized profit, to achieve the concept of Compounding. I just don't think this seems very reasonable for a non-professional investor, am I correct in that opinion?

Mutual Funds: You buy at the current price of the fund. The fund is actively managed and buys and sells stocks as necessary. Each time it sells a stock at profit it creates a realized gain. That gain is disbursed automatically and acts as your Compounding interest. My question is does this happen regularly or sporadically? Meaning are you actually realizing a true Compounding effect here or not really?

ETFs: They are mutual funds that act like stocks. I read some places that they will auto-reinvest any dividends they disburse but I don't know how. And since they are not actively traded then holding any ETF for the long term will not create any Compounding effect, unless you play them as stocks like stated above. Am I wrong here too?

Conclusion...Gains in the market whether stocks, funds, or ETF, are always referred to as Annualized Returns. What I'm trying to grasp my head around are whether general Gains in the market are indicative of ""Simple Interest"" or ""Compound Interest""? And being that Compound Interest is so powerful from a long term perspective, should I just stop thinking about Compounding altogether (assuming I'm not looking specifically for dividend yielding investments ATM) while I'm making these decisions? I keep running calculators seeing how an investment would grow depending on variables and of course it asks what the annual interest rate is; but some ask for compounding rate and some don't. So I don't really know which I should be looking at.

Note...I am looking to invest an initial amount of roughly $5-$20k spread over 3-4 accounts for different time frames, and injecting about $2k per month (total, not each). Just so you understand that I'm not talking amounts in the hundreds of thousands here. But being that my funds are relatively limited and I don't want to make the wrong decisions, I realized that I'm getting a bit stuck in Analysis Paralysis. So I come to you fine people. TIA

Bonus Question: Are ETF prices set by the changes in supply/demand from traders like stocks are, or are they set by the index that they track? Meaning, can the index signify that the ETF should be at $50, but investor sentiment crash the ETF down to $0, like they could with a stock? Or make it skyrocket like GME? Meaning are things like technical or price action analysis what investors use to determine the price or is the price actually linked to the underlying securities and investors just ride the wave up and down?",finance
personalfinance,Fixed Income ETFs or Mutual Funds in a High Interest Environment ?,"Hello, 

I have a portfolio that is worth around 600k that was being managed by an investment advisor at TD.

 As inflation continues to rise, I could no longer afford the 1.8 MER%  and decided to transfer my ETFs and stocks to a self directed account at Questrade. I have some Fixed Income Series F mutual funds that cannot be transferred, as they can only be held at TD. These mutual funds have an MER of around 0.5% to 0.9%, so the total annual cost of owning them in the Investment Advisor account is around 2.3% to 2.7% or 1290 dollars annually.  If I sell them now, I will not be incurring neither a loss or a gain.   


I am thinking of investing this money in a Questrade Portfolio. The MER is only 0.35% which seems very favourable for long term holding. The Fixed Income ETFs are the following for the balanced portfolio:

* ISHARES CORE CANADIAN UNIVERSE BOND INDEX ETF - Fixed income 3.80% 
* ISHARES CORE CANADIAN SHORT TERM BOND INDEX ETF - Fixed income 31.30%
* SPDR BLOOMBERG BARCLAYS HIGH YIELD BOND ETF - Fixed income 3.90%

My advisor recommended that I do not invest in Fixed Income ETFs for the following reasons: 

1) The Fixed Income environment for the next few years is going to be highly volatile as Interest rates will progressively rise.

2) An actively managed fund and not a passive index fund is needed, if one is going to hold Fixed Income in a high interest environment.

3) He emphasized that I would lose money if I invested in Fixed Income ETFs. 

My questions are the following: 

1) Do you agree with the Investment Advisor's assessment? Do actively managed fixed income funds outperform passive fixed income ETFs in a high interest environment? is this an attempt to retain my business or is this sound advice?

2) Should I keep the Fixed Income mutual funds with TD despite the high MER (2.3% to 2.7%) or are the Fixed income ETFs that I outlined above an adequate alternative?

3) From my understanding Questrade Portfolios are actively managed to an extent. If the Fixed Income ETFs in their portfolios were not performing, I would assume that they would re-balance the portfolio or replace them with other ETFs. Is this a fair assumption? 

3) Does anyone have any insight into Questrade Portfolios? Do you guys recommend them? If so, why? If not, why?

4) Unrelated to the post, but how do you guys recommend that i hedge against inflation? 

Thank you for your help.",finance

personalfinance,Question about investing in Downtown Toronto,"How in the world it makes sense to invest in a Condo in Downtown Toronto as an investment property?

**These are the details:**

**Studio - 540k**

**1 Bed  - 690k**

**2 Bed  - 870k**

**3 Bed  - 1.2M**

**Closing is in 2025 and only 15% deposit till 2023.**

These are the selling points:

1. LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION - close to Union Station.
2. Downtown Toronto will be like NY city in future so these prices are actually bargain.
3. Project will finish in 2025 and has an assignment clause so realtor is saying that it is sure shot profit.
4. Realtor has just one answer to most of my questions - Dynamics of DT Toronto are different than whole GTA or Ontario in general. So, it will appreciate for sure.

My concerns:

1. Interest rates will go up in future and it would really be hard to make sense to close it and keep it if there is no other option.
2. Government will step in and increase capital gain taxes to discourage buyers from taking profit from real estate and help people to have roof who really need it.
3. Real estate is already in bubble and the prices might come down by 2025 and we will be losing money on the deal. 

I understand that people who invest in real estate for profits are actually the reason for the real estate high prices but please provide insight into pros and cons. Would really appreciate inputs. THANKS.

**If not Downtown Toronto then what?  Any long term project only since i can invest 40-50 k every year if closing is around 2025**",finance

Bitcoin,Michael Saylor's arbitrage plan: borrow against your btc.... what's next?,"1. Michael Saylor has advocated that you should buy BTC with all your money.  If you need money to pay rent, you borrow against your BTC. As long as BTC appreciation rate is higher than the interest rate, you can continue borrow money the next year, using the new borrowed money to pay the loan from preceding year and continue this practice indefinitely. 
2. I think the benefit of this is you don't pay tax and you can use the money for living. But I want to know the second half of the story.  
3. Assuming BTC does appreciate forever at a rate higher than the interest rate as Michael hypothesized(that's a big if).   
**Now my question is** when I die, I could have something like 500k dollars worthy of BTC as my assets and 400K dollars worthy of debt.   
If I want to give the BTC to my child after my death, what about the debt? Will my child also take over the debt? Will the bank subtract my debt from BTC and only give my child the rest (capital gain tax involved?)? If I put the BTC in a trust, will there be any difference? 
4. I am too lazy to figure out the US tax codes etc. And I know anything you say is not a financial or legal advice.

Bitcoin,Countries adopting BTC as legal tender are committing suicide.,"Why are you all so happy about this move of El Salvador and others? 

I acknowledge BTC as revolutionary genius invention and I'm sure blockchain will change our world to  better. But legal tender?

Inflationary monetary policy discourages money hoarding and encourages spending and more importantly investments. BTC is deflationary and therefore encourages its hoarding.

Now what happens if spending/investment is discouraged by adopting BTC as legal tender? No investments by companies means not improving efficiency of the production process and its technology. No progression to automation in production means people will be stuck with their boring monotonous job instead of learning something new or be released from salary slavery altogether (universal income when automation is ubiquitous and taxed for example). What I see future hold for these countries is factories falling apart producing the same things for decades. No technology improvements at all. Salary slavery never ending.

One plus would be people being able to save money and maybe retire at some point. And probably products made to last which would benefit our planet. Remittances cheaper of course. All these good effects could be attained and better by issuing CBDC on a public blockchain. You could issue deflationary currency for the people and inflationary for businesses for example (or currency with expiration). Or build in incentives for sustainability... Many other things which would benefit everybody and the planet. CBDCs would of course require very good privacy provisions otherwise it would unleash horrible Orwellian dystopia.

I am by no means expert on monetary policy and I have no formal econ education, but this LEGAL TENDER thing seems to be quite scary, don't you think?

personalfinance,First time home buyer: timing,"Maybe looking for a house soon.  Currently live with a sibling, praying her very cheap rent. But need to move on with my life.

Looking at small homes in south bend, Indiana--a relatively low cost of living city. But the houses are older 1920's-40's in the city, and I'll be looking at those since, as a single guy with really no prospects for a family, I shouldn't be too worried about things like number of bedrooms and bathrooms. My search is up-to $120k, but I've seen some that I could deal with in the $80k range.  Income is $57k/yr, but I have really bad imposter syndrome and plan for a life at $40k. Just in case everything falls apart for me.

Anyways, that's a tangent.  Im getting advice from people like ""wait 6-12 months for prices to drop."" I think a lot of it is concern that my sister doesn't actually want me to leave, as she's got some anxiety issues I think (the fallout of which is why I need to move on).  

My thought is that I'd want to worry more about interest rates which are low now, vs prices which may dip in the future.  Knowing that, really, timing the market is stupid, what would be the wiser thing to do?

Also, I may be stuck waiting 6 months anyways, given I only currently have about $4,000 right now allocated to put into this anyways.  I need to save a lot more as a first time buyer, right?",finance
worldnews,Ethereum Creator Went Into Crypto After His WoW Character Got Nerfed,,cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,I like my bank,"I love cryptocurrencies, I love bitcoin, I believe it's revolutionary and will eventually make the world better. And I've been investing in cryptocurrencies since 2017.

At the same time I still enjoy the services that my bank offers me. I have a free account and the stock fund it offered me made 20 % in less than 2 years using basically a DCA strategy (part of my salary goes into the stocks every month). Not as impressive as what crypto would have earn me but it's low risk. I've never had any problem with my bank and I trust them with my money.

Why do I feel the need to say this? I feel like a substantial part of this sub has a very unhealthy view of the banks and the financial industry. Constructive criticism is one thing but most of what I see here is far from constructive. Comments like ""banks are just a legal Ponzi scheme"" and ""f\*\*k banks"" are under any post that mentions banks in any way. Delusional conspiracies about how global events like Evergrande's debt crisis are actually a plots to manipulate crypto markets get hundreds of upvotes.

Another thing I see all the time: comparing negative or zero or very small interest rates in banks with the cryptocurrency staking rewards. That's comparing two different things: zero interest rate is usually on money that is in the main account and that you spend in your daily life, staking means your assets are locked, usually for a longer period, and you can't spend them. If you are unhappy with zero interest rate, just don't keep much money in your main bank account and invest them (not necessarily in crypto). The rule of thumb is you shouldn't have more than 6 times your monthly paycheck in your main bank account and if you are a younger person you need even less. Majority of banks offer investment options directly and there are many services that specialise in it.

Finally, some facts. Three countries where the largest proportion of citizens have any experience with crypto are Nigeria, Vietnam, and Philippines (source: [https://www.statista.com/chart/18345/crypto-currency-adoption/](https://www.statista.com/chart/18345/crypto-currency-adoption/) ).  In general, the cryptocurrency use is much higher in less developed countries in Africa, South-East Asia, Latin America than in the most developed countries like USA, Japan or countries in Europe. (Higher in the sense of how many people use it, not how much people own.) Why is that? One of the main reasons is the lack of financial infrastructure in the less developed countries. Zero interest rate doesn't sound that bad when you imagine not having a bank account, not owning a credit card, and not being able to send money anywhere. Crypto solves this in these countries.

If you are living in a first world country and you feel like your bank is exploiting you somehow, chances are it's your fault. If people spend as much time researching cryptocurrencies as they spend learning about about finances, mortgages, or interest rates, I am no longer surprised so many people fall for scams in the crypto sphere.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Government to stable private sector - is it worth it?,"The deets:

43rs old. 6.5 years of very stable top security IT job with federal pay at GS13 step 5. 14 in is the works. At current location, pay is roughly 104k a year, with the standard guvvie pension, TSP, and 6 hrs/pp annual leave earning. Currently have 205 hours of leave and 180 sick leave hours banked up.

New job is not a contract job, but rather direct hire with a large vender (very large, probably as stable as the current job), allows me to work in the same federal building location as I am now, yet work from home 50% - 75%.  I'm a single dad, this is huge for me. Can't do that in my current position very much.

Starting salary is $125k, with 12k paid yearly for security clearance and 8-10% annual bonus. RSUs have been used as negotiable factors as well with some employees, with one year vesting. Total compensation is near $150k.

I have a good enough resume that I could probably head back into the federal workforce and still get my high 3 and 20 years of service before planned retirement at 62. Then again, I could make much more in the private sector and put way more into my 401k than I can right now, and retire early. 

The pension and FEHB (retirement medical benefits) have me in limbo - these are tough to lose.

I have spoken directly with others that are in this same role with said company and they are super happy. Rarely work 40 hours and work from the beach, even. Most have 10+ years in the position and absolutely love the freedom and autonomy. Just have to have cell phone handy. Travel is minimal.

TLDR; potential 40%-50% raise in going to private sector over federal service, with up to 75% working from home. Possible chance of returning to federal service after 5-6 years to get federal retirement. Worth it, even if temporary?",finance

personalfinance,US I Bonds seem to be pretty at a pretty good rate this 6 month period and are looking better for next. I'm curious if I happen to be missing something,"I've never bought I Bonds before so not sure if I'm missing something important. But this seems like a decent deal. 

The current composite rate is at 3.54% for 6 months. They would need to be purchased before the end of October to get that rate. That is when the new rate kicks in.

The new rate is looking like it will be over 6% for the next 6 month period. Obviously that is subject to change and if Kiosaki is right, it just might ;) But it is probably not going to go to zero. Even if it does you still get an annual adjusted rate of about 1.77% based on the 3.54% from the first half. Still better than any bank I have seen recently.

It's my understanding that you have to hold them for a year. Over the next 4 years you can turn them in but you lose 3 months interest. The interest rate will never go below zero even if inflation is negative. So the worst case is you lose a half a percent that you would have gotten in a bank. Maybe a bit more if rates start to go up.  They are also not taxable at the state level.

Am I missing anything important?
One thing I can think of is it doesn't seem to be compounding interest. I wouldn't call that terribly important but does seem worth noting.

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open a bit lower this morning as investors and traders anticipate new economic data. Later this week we'll get to see the September jobs report, and many analysts are split regarding expectations. If we see decelerating job growth, we may have reached the ""maximum employment level"" that the Fed has been talking about. Combine that with the inflation concerns, and we should see a change in economic policy in the near future. We should also be seeing some fresh earnings data, and this should give us some guidance with regards to potential supply chain issues looking forward. Some of the mega caps are still showing weakness around support levels, and we could see more red in the market if they continue to sell off. The debt ceiling issue has still not been taken care of; I expect it to be raised before the deadline, but it's definitely worth monitoring the situation.

SPY is trading a bit over 433 and could test the SMA(100) as resistance around \~433.68. If we can hold up over that level, we could see some strength and a green day. If we fail to get over that level, we could see weakness and test 430 as support once again. DIA is trading a bit over 342, and we could see more weakness if we fail to get back over the 343 level. QQQ¬†is trading just under 359 and looks like it could test the SMA(100) as support at \~357.26. If we can hold up above that level, we could see strength. If we breakdown, things will be looking bearish and we could even retrace towards the SMA(200) down by 340 in the near future. Gold and silver are down a bit this morning. Crude oil is up once again, continuing its recent strength. The strength could continue, especially if we see more issues with supply chain. B\*\*coin is currently trading around 47,700 after failing to break out over the weekend. I'll be watching for any catalysts, as the Fed began discussions regarding a central bank cryptocurrency. Cr\*\*to-related stocks are mixed in premarket trading. Chinese stocks are showing weakness this morning, with BABA set to make another 52-week low. Airlines and cruise stocks are up in premarket, and look to continue the recent strength after (seemingly) breaking out of their downtrends.¬†

politics,"Discussion Thread: Congress continues to negotiate over the BIF, Infrastructure Reconciliation, and Debt Ceiling","Last week, Congress attempted to consider several major bills that are part of President Biden's agenda, and which have major consequences on the US economy. Of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Package (aka the ""BIF""), the Infrastructure Reconciliation bill, the debt ceiling and the budget, Congress was only able to pass a 6-week Continuing Resolution to fund government operations until December 3.

The BIF and Infrastructure Reconciliation bills are the two major parts of President Biden's infrastructure agenda (described more in detail in the [previous thread](&lt;https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/pyqmtq/discussion_thread_congress_votes_on_debt_ceiling/https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/pyqmtq/discussion_thread_congress_votes_on_debt_ceiling/))&gt;, and face uncertain futures as moderate Democrats in the Senate and more left wing Democrats in the House continue to disagree on spending levels and funding sources. The House progressive caucus is demanding that the Reconciliation bill pass the Senate first before the BIF is voted through the House, while Senate Democrats, particularly Sens. Manchin of West Virginia and Sinema of Arizona, insist on lower spending figures than were originally envisioned at the start of the reconciliation process. The original Reconciliation bill called for $3.5 trillion in new spending over 10 years, whereas Manchin has insisted on a spending package worth a considerably lower [$1.5 trillion](&lt;https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/30/politics/manchin-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal-vote-negotiations/index.html&gt;) over the same time frame.

The debt ceiling also continues to be an ongoing unresolved issue that could have enormous effects on the US economy if not promptly voted on by the October 18th deadline set by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who indicated that the federal government would run out of money at that time. Republicans insist that Democrats be responsible for passing any debt ceiling on strictly a partisan basis using the Reconciliation process. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer attempted last week to have the debt ceiling suspended by a simple majority vote, but this vote was defeated after Republican Senators filibustered. Should the debt ceiling fail to be promptly addressed, the impact on the US economy and international finance could be enormous, as US guarantees on treasury bonds have been a cornerstone in financial markets.

Please discuss these bills here. If the need arises, we may also have standalone megathreads to discuss any developments in the legislative process.

Naturally, I would eventually like to use the money to buy something sentimental but until then I would like to save it. The interest rate on savings is terrible right now and government premium bonds (NS&amp;I because I live in the UK) are generally considered awful (lottery prize draw  with the prize being 1% of investment instead of fixed interest).

Recently, I've been looking at investing in stocks (unrelated). While I've been testing the waters with a small amount of money, I've noticed that bond ETFs are a thing. I've considered investing in them but I'm still a bit confused about a few things. 

1. I've noticed that, like any other stock, the price of each ""stock"" in a bond ETF rises and falls. Is that linked to the actual return of the bond itself? From what I've gathered, it just reflects the market's interest in the portfolio (aspects like the weighted maturity of the ETF, the interest rate etc.).
2. If I was to put my ¬£500 in a bond ETF (assuming nothing happens to the portfolio itself), would I receive a fixed return? I assume that interest rates would affect the return like they would affect anything else?

I would hope to use the money to invest. On the other hand, due to the nature of the inheritance, I would be upset to see a substantial portion of it go up in smoke (say, if I were to invest it in volatile stocks).

economy,Why the Chinese crisis will not happen,"The Western economists in general do not understand how planned economy works. And this is the case not only with totalitarian countries like China, but also with democracies like Japan and South Korea. Economic crises happen when there is huge difference between the demand and the supply. In economies without central planning such crises are chaotic and they often work as creative destruction. So the crisis simply wipes the issue, that caused the economic disbalance, usually some kind of debt, and in the process destroys private businesses and people's lives. But then the economy starts to grow again, often even faster. In the planned economy the state tames the crisis. The supply and the demand are not issues, as the entire system is managed like a big corporation with many branches. The problem is, that the debt stays and keeps growing, nothing is wiped. In a long term that may cause the only disbalance that can destroy the planned economy - outflow of capital. As this is a process the state cannot manage. For example that was the cause for the last economic crisis in USSR, that let to creation of the Russian Federation, and ended with the moratorium on payments of foreign debt in 1998. Is there such a danger for China with its huge trade surplus and constantly positive balance of payments? The answer is no. The Chinese economic problems are still internal, so manageable by the state.",finance

It has also developed and secured its handy suite of scalable solutions that unlimited projects are relying on.

Idle, a leading yield aggregator, plans to expand the suite of Polygon with new assets, and has set a plan to bring its allocation strategies on MATIC to let both integrators and individuals access optimized yields in a cheap and fast way. 

Polygon deployment will be adding a more simplified onboarding experience for new players into this ecosystem. On the other hand, deployment of Idle strategies will be bringing a superior gateway to automatically and algorithmically interact with multiple yield protocols and optimize the interest rate.

Imagine it this way, automated rebalance events can be executed more often, optimizing allocations with a higher frequency than the Ethereum strategies at the cost of a fraction of a dollar. How about that?

To me? I see it will be the best Yield strategy to let users and integrators save time, and gas fees, pursuing the best interest rate with no effort.

And believe me guys, the rewards are many and I‚Äôm gonna give you a little taste just to know how amazing it would be. For instance, Idle and Polygon would reward any B2B integration partner that implements Idle‚Äôs allocation strategies as part of their Polygon underlying yield infrastructure with a $650,000 MATIC incentivization program. 

Also, an additional $50,000 in IDLE will be allocated to foster native Polygon projects using Idle and finalize new implementations.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Take out equity from the house to invest with?,"I am currently in the process of refinancing my house and we have locked in a 2.25% interest rate (2.259% APR). This also puts me in a position where I have the option to cash out $75-$100k of equity for that low of an interest rate. And we could afford the difference in the monthly payment.

What I am considering is the idea of taking out that \~$100k at 2.25% and investing it in the market for 30 years at 6-8%. The interest in the house would be tax deductible as well which calculates into the effective profit margin. But I'm not an experienced investor so I don't know how much that calculates into it. And I can't decide just how good of an idea this is.

On paper the profit potential makes perfect sense. But reality is far from perfect, and my mind is even less perfect than that. So I am crowdsourcing my thinking process and asking you to give me your opinion. Especially if you have experience with this, please share.",finance
personalfinance,Refinancing my Auto Loan,"Hello Personal Finance, 

I have lurked a bit on this sub but am mostly new and trying to get control of my personal finances. I am 26 years old with a 598 Credit Score that I am dying to improve. 

One thing I was curious about is when I should refinance my car. I currently have a loan with a 10.59% Interest Rate and $14,714 Principal on the loan. 

This loan isn't with who I currently bank with. At the time I had to go with whoever would take me. It's no surprise that the payments are god awful. So I was curious, as far as Refinancing goes, should I go in an attempt to get a refinance with my personal bank or should I be trying to improve my credit before even negotiating that. 

I apologize if these are simple questions, I just really want to learn and get a good grasp on my finances and hopefully ask some follow up questions in the comments. Thanks guys.",finance

I recently bought a 2bd 2br condo this June to start a family. (Now my baby boy is 50 days old :D)

&amp;#x200B;

I think my condo is perfect for right now at least.. it's got attached garage to the unit, decent size for family of 3, and super convenient location. (Just wish it was in safer/nicer neighborhood.)

&amp;#x200B;

I know in fact.. that I will definitely be moving to a bigger single family house in a better, safer location as my baby boy grows. I was planning to do that in 2-3 years.

&amp;#x200B;

But My concern is that government is printing way way too much dollars and the dollar value is going down so hard.

I strongly believe that it's what driving the stock/crypto market &amp; real estate market to skyrocket.

personalfinance,Received inheritance and not clear on taxes.,"Location; USA, MASSACHUSETTS 

Hi personal finance, I need help in figuring out if I will owe taxes on money recieved.

My grandmother passed away late into 2019 and left my mother as executor of the estate. My grandmother had put money away in an account for college when I was young -- I knew the existence of the account but had never seen the actual figures or amount. I never asked my mom about it because I didn't want to assume I was entitled to any of it after she passed.

Fast forward to mid 2021 and I ended up receiving a check for $40,000. The check was in my parents name written to myself and I was told it was from the school savings account and that it was inheritance from my grandmother. 

Would this be considered an inheritance or is this a gift because the check was in my parents name? If this is taxed would I be taxed federally or at the state level? I do not know type of account this money was originally in at this point in time. I can try and figure it out if it's important.

CryptoCurrency,"The Pandora Papers proved the game is rigged against Crypto, yet we are winning because Crypto is becoming a necessity.","There are politicians, bankers and world leaders named in the Pandora Papers. In the Panama Papers, the leaker was subsequently killed after a few days. These politicians are doing everything possible to keep the status quo running. They run shadow offshore accounts to traffic billions of dollars worth of money every year. Yet these same people don't want the average person to have the same anonymity and the same control to their own individual wealth.

They go to great lengths to make sure that the average person has a terrible knowledge of Crypto. The media is running a propaganda campaign against Crypto being funded by the same corrupt people that are experts for money laundering. Fiat has been a disaster for the people and a blessing for the corrupt elite. They know this and they want to slow the adoption of Crypto by as much as possible.

Even then, Crypto has continued to surpass all expectations. You have a country of a billion people completely banning Crypto, while the worlds largest economy sues one of the largest Crypto exchanges to save bankers from higher interest rates. Yet despite all this, Crypto continues to rise and rise each year. While the stock market kept trending down, Crypto is still trending up.

This isn't for a reason. Crypto is a necessity for the people. Especially in authoritarian countries controlled entirely by the elite and by bankers, Crypto is the only escape. Even after the Panama Papers were leaked, almost nothing was done against the big offenders. The Pandora Papers are just another example of how the elite will continue to plunder the common people through means of propaganda and assassination.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Financing fell through &amp; the dealership sold the car before refunding my down payment,"I arrived at a dealership with a pre approved loan at a 2.99% rate with a cosigner.

They mentioned to me that they could approve me by myself at a 4.9% rate. So it just seemed like a better option to me.I plan on paying off the car as soon as I'm able to so I put 8.5k as a down payment.

A week later they contacted me telling me that financing fell through so i needed to add my cosigner to my application which already didn't seem like a good deal. I told them that I wanted to sign the paperwork with my original offer since the interest rate was lower. They insisted that If I already the cosigner everything was going to work out &amp; me living 5 hours aways from it. I decided to just go ahead and add my cosigner because I didn't want to request a time off before giving my employer a decent amount of time in between.

A week later I get contacted by the same dealership as it still didn't go through so I returned the car 16hrs after the noticed on Sep 29. When I dropped off the car they told me that since I didn't put that many miles that I didn't have to pay any fees for the time period that I had it. My cosigner wasn't able to be there with me to resign documents with my original pre approval until Oct 3rd and since the won't let me esign documents. I told the dealership that I had the day off &amp; was going to drive there on that day. Oct 2nd I texted the sales person to make sure the car was still available &amp; the time that I was going to arrived at. They told me that the car was already reserved for a different guest.

personalfinance,"Shopping for bank/CU first time in forever, could use advice.","I have a few questions, and I hope this fits here. I've always enjoyed reading this subreddit over the years. I'll try to start with my questions, so y'all don't have to dig through too many anecdotes.

I moved far away from my current credit union. I have loved that I have zero fees through them, but their savings account interest rate is low (0.1%), and the move has me thinking about putting my money closer to home. However I haven't ""shopped"" for a bank/credit union in about 10 years, so wanted to spit ball with some folks here that may be more knowledgeable than myself.

Out of the five places I've cold called today, only one had zero fees (bank1). Two of them had ways to reduce the monthly fee (from about $12/mo down to $5/mo) (bank 2&amp;3). And two only offered ""$0 fee"" if I keep a minimum balance in checking(CU 1&amp;2). I hate keeping large balances in checking, and they would not consider a savings account balance as an alternate way to waive the checking account fee.

Obviously the bank with zero fees caught my attention, but it also makes me wary. It is 100% online banking (not a credit union), and I'm not savvy enough to know if this is a safe thing, or a gimmick. How do I even ensure it's a safe place to put my money? Like what kinds of accreditations or questions should I ask? This option also claims to have a very high interest rate (0.9%!!! Seriously, I double checked. Not 0.09%.). Which leads to another question: what even is a ""Tax Free Savings Account"", and what are its pros or cons? Maybe that's not a high interest rate, but it seemed like it to me. Another reason I'm checking in 

Thank you for taking the time to read and respond. Obviously I will continue researching and educating myself online, but it helps to have other people weigh in, so I even know what other questions to ask / avenues to research, if that makes sense.",finance
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, Oct 4, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 4, 2021**

After an encouraging day last Friday, the stock market sank once again as market participants continue to closely monitor developments out of Washington and wait for upcoming economic and earnings data to gauge concerns over supply chain disruptions and inflation. Tech stocks once again came under pressure as the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield continues to rise. The Nasdaq (QQQ) close the day 2.1% lower, which means the tech-heavy index is now roughly 8% below its previous all-time high. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 1.29% lower, the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.92%, and the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 0.91%.

We‚Äôve seen previous episodes of rising rates, both earlier this year as well as when the Fed first announced intentions to begin tapering quantitative easing in the not too distant future. Each of these episodes caused a hiccup but didn‚Äôt derail the broader bull market. According to Edward Jones, yields went from below 1% to 1.75% during the first three months of this year, a period that included pullbacks in the S&amp;P 500 of 3.7% for four days and 4.2% for 12 days. However, during that entire three-month stretch in which rates were rising, the stock market rose more than 7%.  In this current spate, 10-year rates have jumped from 1.30% on September 15 to as high as 1.54% last week, reflecting a renewed concern over inflation pressures and reduced Fed stimulus expectations

Stocks are struggling to regain their footing after the September selloff, given that many of the concerns that sparked last month‚Äôs drop remain. Congressional lawmakers have yet to come to an agreement on a solution to raise the debt limit to prevent a potential government default sometime mid-October. Failure to do so would be catastrophic for the US economy.  As a reminder, Congress successfully averted a government shutdown last week. The House approved a bill late on Wednesday suspending the debt limit through December 2022. The Senate could vote on it as early as this week Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, but Republicans are expected to block it again as they have twice before. This is an evolving situation. In my humble opinion, I think the Republicans are playing political games with the debt ceiling and will pass it last minute, similar to the spending bill to avoid the government shutdown. 

Put simply, a default by the US would be an economic and political disaster that must be avoided. I cannot fathom the government willingly plunging the US into an unprecedented financial crisis for political reasons, though one can never guess the future. According to a report by Moody‚Äôs Analytics, one of the three big along with Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch Group, approximately 6 million jobs would be lost and the unemployment would spike dramatically, US GDP would decline, and there would be an irrevocable stain on the faith and strength of US financial markets. ‚ÄúInternationally, the United States will have for the first time undermined the full faith and credit of its own currency -- a blow to our standing in the world and a boon for our adversaries such as China who are arguing to the world that the US is on the decline‚Äù

The report goes on to say, ‚ÄúGlobal financial markets and the economy would be upended, and even if resolved quickly, Americans would pay for this default for generations, as global investors would rightly believe that the federal government‚Äôs finances have been politicized and that a time may come when they would not be paid what they are owed when owed it. To compensate for this risk, they will demand higher interest rates on the Treasury bonds they purchase. That will exacerbate our daunting long-term fiscal challenges and be a lasting corrosive on the economy, significantly diminishing it.‚Äù

Looking ahead, the September Jobs Report will be released later this week. Market participantsd are hoping to see payroll gains accelerate after a shockingly disappointing August report, which shoed just 235,000 new payrolls gains verses more than 700,000 expected. Consensus economists anticipate that 475,000 payrolls returned in September, and that the unemployment rate fell to 5.1%, or the lowest since March 2020.

**Highlights**

* Facebook (FB) underperformed the market after major outages and disruptions of service were reported across the company‚Äôs suite of products. 
* Amazon (AMZN) is suffering its worst streak of underperformance in roughly two years and has turned negative year-to-date.
* GlobalFoundries, which was created by the divestiture of the manufacturing arm of AMD reportedly filed for a US IPO.  
* Tesla (TSLA) unexpectedly topped estimates for third-quarter deliveries, despite the global semiconductor shortage that is affecting all automakers. Comparatively, Ford (F) deliveries were down 27.4% in the third quarter. While one can‚Äôt make direct comparisons due to scale differences, still very impressive to see Tesla (TSLA) successfully navigate the shortage.
* A group of Tesla investors filed a court filing to argue that Elon Musk to repay the company $9.4 billion for the benefits he received after Tesla bought SolarCity, which Musk partly owned. 
* Factory orders were up 1.2% in August month-on-month, [according to Commerce Department data ](https://www.census.gov/manufacturing/m3/prel/pdf/s-i-o.pdf)on Monday. This came in faster than the 1.0% rise expected, according to Bloomberg consensus data, and represented a fourth consecutive monthly advance.
* Qualcomm (QCOM) and investment partnership firm SSW Partners announced an agreement to purchase automobile technology company Veoneer (VNE) Monday morning for $37 a share, which values the company at $4.5 billion",finance

To whom it may concern,

My name is XXXX.  I have been following the Game Stop saga since XXX and have become increasingly concerned about the manipulation, the fragility, and the inequality in our capital markets.  I write to you as a member of the House Financial Service Committee to ask you to please look more into this.  The jurisdiction of your committee includes:
&amp;nbsp;

Clause 1(h) of rule X of the Rules of the House of Representatives for the 113th Congress sets forth the jurisdiction of the Committee on Financial Services as follows ‚Äì

(1) Banks and banking, including deposit insurance and Federal monetary policy.

(2) Economic stabilization, defense production, renegotiation, and control of the price of commodities, rents, and services.

(5) International finance.

(7) Money and credit, including currency and the issuance of notes and redemption thereof; gold and silver, including the coinage thereof; valuation and revaluation of the dollar.

(9) Securities and exchanges.

&amp;nbsp;

My belief is that there is tremendous fraud and manipulation occurring in the highest levels of our financial sector.  If I, and many others are correct, this exposes US capital market participants to asymmetrical risks that may threaten the US and potentially the world economy.  With the second release of the Panama Papers, I think it is time to delve into the workings and corruption of our own financial sector, and I rely on you to hold criminality and corruption to account.  The health, stability, and reputation of our capital markets is at stake, and I urge you to take urgent action to address these issues.  

&amp;nbsp;
    
I implore you to speak with Susanne Trimbath PhD of sptadvisors.com, Dave Lauer at Urvin Finance, and Wes Christian at christianlevinelaw.com.  These are professionals that have given their free time to help many of us understand what is going on.  I am positive that their patriotism will motivate them to speak to you.  I look forward to seeing the results of further investigations and hearings, and holding those that seek to deceive the the government and it's people responsible for their crimes.  The rule of law depends on equal application of justice.  If  crime can be remedied by a fine, it's just a cost of doing business. 

&amp;nbsp;

Thank you for your time, and God bless America.  

&amp;nbsp;

Sincerely,
XXXXXXXXXX

CryptoCurrency,I've read the proposed bill regarding crypto in Brazil and it is NOT what you think,"As most of you may have read here or elsewhere, there are some rumors that Brazil wants to make crypto legal\* or, even more spectacularly, legal tender.

However, that is not what the bill proposed in 2015 says.

In case you want to look it up, it is the PL 2303/2015 and you can read it [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20201022101353/https://www.camara.leg.br/proposicoesWeb/prop_mostrarintegra?codteor=1358969&amp;filename=PL+2303/2015).

The legal aspect of it is very short (a single page) and it only changes the wording on previous legislation to include crypto.

1. For instance, proposed Article 1 alters Article 9 of law 12865/2013 to include cryptocurrencies and air miles as categories to be regulated by Brazil's Central Bank (our FED) according to the National Monetary Council (CMN).
2. Proposed Article 2, includes a new paragraph in article 11 of law 9613/1998 (which created COAF, the Brazilian public agency responsible for investigating financial crimes) listing oversight of cryptocurrency transactions as one of its new responsibilities.
3. Proposed Article 3, which extends to cryptocurrency users, the protections, guarantees and obligations found in the existing Consumer's Defense Code (Law 8078/1990).
4. Proposed Article 4 just says that these changes should be effective as soon as enacted.

So those are the proposed laws and they are not very exciting. All that it does it attribute responsibilities to different public agencies regarding the regulation and supervision of cryptocurrencies. Nothing else.

# So, where do the rumors of legal tender spring from?

They come from the author of the bill himself, congressman Aureo Ribeiro who, in interviews, mentioned the intention of creating a text that recognizes crypto as a payment method, that would enable people ""to buy a house or a McDonald's with it"". That is not in the bill he proposed and is only a fanciful flight of imagination at the moment.

The President of the Central Bank, Roberto Campos Neto, already said that, first they intend to regulate it as an investment and then, in the future to think of ways to regulate it as means of payment. But, currently, the proposition is to regulate it as an investment type.

In fact, to be quite honest, the most interesting part of the bill is not so much its proposed changes in law, but the justifications congressman Ribeiro used for it. It mostly paints a rather bleak picture of Crypto as an enabler of fraud and financial crimes, citing reports from the European Union ([this one](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/virtualcurrencyschemes201210en.pdf) and [this one](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/virtualcurrencyschemesen.pdf)) to back his claims, and urging the necessity to regulate it. It mentions, for instance, things like:

* ‚Äú\[cryptocurrencies\] are currently not regulated and are not closely supervised or overseen by any public authority, even though participation in these schemes exposes users to credit, liquidity, operational and legal risks‚Äù;
* ‚Äú\[cryptocurrencies\] could represent a challenge for public authorities, given the legal uncertainty surrounding these schemes, as they can be used by criminals, fraudsters and money launderers to perform their illegal activities‚Äù;
* ‚Äú\[cryptocurrencies\] could have a negative impact on the reputation of central banks, assuming the use of such systems grows considerably and in the event that an incident attracts press coverage, since the public may perceive the incident as being caused, in part, by a central bank not doing its job properly;‚Äù

In short, it doesn't really paint crypto as good to be cherished, but implies it more as threat to consumers and the national economy.

# TL;DR

In all, it is neither bullish, nor bearish news. Since the proposed bill only assigns different regulatory and supervision powers to different agencies, there is no real indication of what these regulations will look like. However, it MOST CERTAINLY does not mean that a bill proposing crypto as legal tender is in the works in Brazil. It could happen in the future, but no concrete plans, nor political will, exists for that in the moment.

My monthly payment would go from around $2000 to $1800.  By not paying mortgage for 2 months, i'd have some extra cash on hand.  

If I wait another year, I can get PMI removed for free.  But then I don't get 2 months of skipping mortgage.  I have 1 broker telling me to re-fi and another broker telling me the other guy's a crook.  

The way I see it, the $4400 i'm paying to refi is so small compared to how long the loan will live that I'll barely noticed the $4400.  My main goals are security and to reduce overhead in my life.  I'd rather immediately have a lower monthly payment, so I am inclined to go with the refi.  I know that with the refi I am paying more in the long run, but it seems to align best with my goals.  

Thank you for your input.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Do debt ceilings even matter? Cryptocurrency is going to ruin bond markets and bankrupt governments for reasons you probably haven't thought about,"Read the bold lines for a tldr summary. 

**1) Defi is already safer than traditional finance.**

Eventually the greater market will become familiar with and comfortable with cryptocurrency. The instability of crypto coin prices is unsettling, but the stability of decentralized finance applications is astounding. Lending and borrowing dapps are designed to handle asset price fluctuations that would wreck many traditional institutions.

Buggy smart contracts do represent risks that are significant but are less than any comparison to the billions of dollars of grifts that uniquely plague traditional financial institutions. Further, defi investments can increasingly be insured against smart contract hacking risks (Nexus, InsurAce, Unslashed etc).

**2) In a short amount of time, the market will mature and the complete superiority of stable coin investments will be proven and accepted by the majority of investors.** 

The advent of stablecoins has opened up the crypto investment opportunity space to those who have no interest in high risk speculative moonshots. Automated Market Makers and Algorithmic Stable coins are two examples of utilizing computer code to introduce decentralization that invents entirely new products which rely on market mechanics to produce value more efficiently, by programming stability and removing the middleman that extracts and wastes value. Algorithmic stable coins and their stabilizer coins (like UST and Luna), are the more efficient, digital replacement for government fiat currencies and their central banks (like USD and the federal reserve). 

**3) The value of a stable coin overlaps with and greatly surpasses the value of a bond, and stable coins are going to steal market share from bond investors and drive interest rates up faster than central banks can control**

For example, UST has a fundamentally sound money market that reliably produces fixed staking rewards around 20% APR. The cost to insure a UST investment against smart contract and depegging risks is less than 6.2%/yr. UST therefore has a low risk, non-custodial return rate of over 13.8%. That is about 4% higher than the average stock market return- without the wild instability of actual yearly returns (which were 21% in 2017, but -4% in 2018). Stable coins are better than stock market returns, with bond level predictability. 

**4) The consequence of crypto attracting capital away from bond markets is much more consequential than stealing capital from stock markets**

As governments print money, markets heat up due to investors knowing their cash must be spent on investments to be protected from inflation. Crypto has become an outlet for investors questioning the risk/reward of a historically high priced stock market and seeing similar levels of risk with higher reward potential in some cryptocurrency projects. The consequence of this, in a narrow analysis, is a healthy lowering of demand for stocks and a precarious increase in speculative demand for crypto. The entire crypto market cap is currently $2.2 trillion. The entire stock market is $92 trillion. 

A comparative analysis for cooling bond markets will be revolutionary and could be catastrophic. Lower yields are already less desirable during periods of high inflation. And quite importantly, bonds serve a very different economic function than stocks. Bonds are issued to directly fund organizations, and they must be paid back. A massive decrease in demand will force bond issuers to offer higher interest rates. The main advantage bonds have is that they offer stable returns with lower risk. This is especially true for powerful governments, which essentially have the low risk market cornered because, unlike other corporations, governments have legal monopoly on perpetual tax revenue streams to service their debt. 

This has real world, non-speculative implications. Corporate bonds and higher risk government bonds will be the first to feel the impact of stable coins, as they will find fewer buyers of their debt, unless they increase the interest rates they will pay for that debt. The problem here is that the interest rates currently needed to compete with stablecoin returns would amount to cripplingly high interest, that will materially reduce the ability to continue issuing debt. 

**5) The wealthiest governments will no longer be able to rely on bonds to fund their budget shortfalls, because they will not be able to make their interest payments at higher rates**

Lower risk government debts will eventually follow the same fate. In a society where everyone is comfortable with crypto, government debts will not be considered lower risk investments. Governments will find fewer and fewer buyers of their debt. Contrary to popular belief, central banks cannot indefinitely buy up their own debt. Attempting to do so will require increasing the money supply, pushing people away from central currencies, and exasperating the cause of the problem by pushing up interest rates relative to their debased currency. At some point the lack of demand will overwhelm them, and they will have to cede to higher market rates relative to their inflationary currency. 

And contrary to popular belief government debt levels are not arbitrary. Relatively small increases in the size/cost of debt can make that debt impossible to pay. 

For example the US paid about $525 billion last year in interest on about $28 Trillion of debt in 2020. Technically, most of this payment is principal returned to bond holders, not interest. But because the US debt principal never decreases faster than it increases, principal is never paid down and can effectively be ignored as canceling itself out to roughly estimate the average interest rate, 525B/28T= 1.9% per year. **At 1.9%, this $525 Billion payment equaled 15.5% of all federal tax revenues that were collected for the year. 15% of taxes were used to pay the debt, and the debt principal was not reduced.**

Let's assume the US debt principal does not grow any further. A 12.2% interest rate is the theoretical rate at which collapse would be unavoidable. At 12%, the $28 trillion debt would create an interest payment that exceeds all federal tax revenues. That would leave no money to run any government programs, and no one would be willing to buy any further debt. Realistically, the US government would default much sooner than that level of insolvency. 

Here's a more realistic example: 
**If the US government were forced to sell debt at 5% to compete with other investments, that would cost $1.4 Trillion dollars per year, or 41% of all tax revenues. 41% of all taxes collected would have to be used to pay the debt interest. That would not even leave enough money to pay for social security and Medicare. The US government would have no discretionary spending or funding for the most basic government operations. The US government would choose to default on their interest payment.**

Ultimately, bond issuers will themselves have to turn to defi solutions to efficiently borrow money. The end result will be governments paying real, non-manipulated rates for debt, and probably the result will be that governments are forced to raise taxes and take on less debt. 

Will this be an abrupt and catastrophic transition? I doubt it. But it could be. Whatever happens will dramatically change the way governments are funded. Gone will be the days of governments having a monopoly on low risk investments. Gone will be their ability to spend money without people being able to calculate the cost, and deflating currency to create backdoor funding.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Mortgage Refi - ""retail cost"" vs ""discounting the option""","I thought I was pretty savvy on Mortgages and Refis but this was a little confusing to me. 

I asked the broker running my refi how a discount promotion was applied to my refi. He stated that the discount was applied to the points on the application, so I'm guessing that was used to get the interest rate down some. He then stated that the ""retail cost was much higher"" and that ""they discounted the option down to what my offer was."" 

What I don't understand is what the retail cost might be? Is that a refi without any points attached?

Final numbers were:  2.25% for 30 year, .25 points purchased, somewhere around $3800 for all the fees/costs.",finance

CryptoCurrency,What is the difference between APY and APR?,"This troubled me at first when I got into crypto and I hope this post will be useful for those who are unaware of the difference between APY and APR. 

They are both used in Yield Farming programs and in various DeFi protocols. Thus, it is extremely important to know the difference between them. Yes, both of them are regarding the returns you receive for staking/providing liquidity. 

APY: Annual Percentage Yield, this is the annual rate of return that takes into account the effect of compound interest.  

APR: Annual Percentage Rate, this is the actual rate of the annual return, which **does not take into account compound interest.** 

**Calculation** 

r  = the interest rate of the year and N = interest period

APY = (1+r)\^n - 1

APR = r (the interest rate of the year) x N  (interest period)

It is better to use APY to calculate your returns, whereas APR is more commonly used in lending. 

It can get confusing, and there have been times that I have disregarded which one was being used and thus",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Need advice with sudden car purchase,"Hi everyone,

So, I have a Nissan Sentra - 2014 (no payments left) and the AC went out. Got it valued from Carvana.-Without getting the AC fixed, $4500-After getting the AC Fixed, $6200

I got the car inspected from Nissan and they said the AC Condenser needs to be changed and could cost me $1200 and up.

Looking at the figures, I thought maybe it is time to get a new car. I have been looking at a Nissan Rouge which is about 30k. I make around 50k a year.-Is purchasing the car around black friday worth it? Do dealerships have good offers?-How much down payment should I put down? I am thinking 5k, but I can go up if need be. I am hoping to pay off this car in 3 years.-Is there another more budget friendly car in the same circle of a Nissan Rouge?-What all do I need to keep in mind in regards to interest rate and all that?

Appreciate all your help. I will be buying it in Missouri btw.

Thank you!

Edit: Grammar  


Update: Thanks for the all the comments. It def helped my nagging brain cell asking me to not get a new car. I have decided to stick with this one for now. I'll try to get it fixed and take some roadtrips!",finance

60. A Weiss Crypto analyst calls the smart contract launch an alleged event and also doesn‚Äôt realize we already have NFTS. The Cardano community was quick to correct the analyst.

63. One of Cardano‚Äôs biggest competitors is once again suffering network problems. This time it started out as just being characterized as (more) ‚Äúinstability‚Äù, then they started saying that something had caused the blockchain to ‚Äústart forking‚Äù.

It‚Äôll be interesting to see how well their community tolerates this in the future if it‚Äôs happening with their planned slashing model in effect.

75. After the Senate hearing on Tuesday September 14th, Gary Gensler (SEC Chairman) gave a quote to a crypto publication indicating that custodial lending and possibly even staking platforms might be considered securities.

CryptoCurrency,The United States of Evergrande,"Economists of r/cryptocurrency. I beseech thee for thy knowledge. What effect would the U.S. defaulting on their debt have on the crypto markets? 

For those that are not aware. The U.S. is running out of money to pay their debt. Their proposed solution? Raise the debt ceiling so they can borrow more to pay off older debt. Based on a statement by Janet Yellen, the treasury secretary of U.S., they could run out of funds around 18th October 2021. 

Moody's claim that such a default could lead to a 4% decline in economic activities, loss of 6 millions jobs (9% unemployment rate) and a wiping of 15 trillion in stocks value. Oh and a rise in loan interest rate.

CryptoCurrency,Crypto Taxation in Brazil (Good for Saving),"If you barely speak english, then scroll down for the full portuguese version:
Initial Alert: all the information contained herein come from my own research and may be subject to legislative changes (however, as it concerns Income Tax, any rate change can only be applied next fiscal yer, due to the fundamental taxation principles).

Brief Analysis of the Tax Regime for Cryptocurrencies in Brazil

Changed at the beginning of 2021, the new Brazilian income tax program (IRS) now has 3 codes for filling in the return (formerly the provision should be made in the ""99-others"" tab)
a) 81 ‚Äì Bitcoin cryptoactive (BTC); 
b) 82 ‚Äì Other cryptoactives, of the digital currency type (altcoins, such as Ether); and 
c) 89 ‚Äì Other cryptoactives (not considered digital currencies, but classified as security tokens).


What is the applicable rate for the taxation of Income Tax on cryptoactives?
Here comes the good news! As it has not yet been regulated, crypto-actives are included in the category of financial assets that up to R$ 34,999.00 are tax free!
Oh, a detail: the amount of R$ 34,999.00 that does not generate income tax is considered in a MONTHLY basis. Thus, if Jhon Doe buys 10,000 in some cryptocurrency and decides to sell it at the end of the same month with a 100% profit, he must declare the amount of 20,000.00 obtained from the sale, but he will not have to pay income tax on such value. Remembering that the declaration on the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies must be made monthly to the Receita Federal (brazilian IRS).


Who is required to declare ownership of cryptocurrencies in Brazil?
For the current tax year, all taxpayers must declare that, after 12/31/2020, they had cryptocurrencies or cryptoactive assets whose acquisition values ‚Äã‚Äãwere greater than R$5,000. Here a little caution is needed, as there are legal diplomas saying that the declaration of income is required for:
1) anyone who has more than 30 thousand reais in foreign stock exchanges
2) whoever has more than 5,000 PER CRYPTOACTIVE (cryptocurrency or tokens).
My reason for putting as a general rule ""acquisition of values ‚Äã‚Äãgreater than BRL 5,000"" is more logical than legal: every transaction of BRL 5,000 or more is declared by the Bank (and such information is common knowledge both by Bacen and the Receita Federal). Thus, as there will be no collection of income tax as long as the amount does not exceed R$34,999 (as explained above), the most logical thing is to ratify with the RF what has already been ""ratted out"" by the bank in the transaction of R$5,000 or more, mainly because there will be no duty to pay income tax in such a case. This is a safe way to avoid future administrative measures (e.g.:""malha fina"", which is a call to explain the gains or incorretly declared growth in one's wealth)

PORTUGUESE VERSION:
Alerta Inicial: todas as informa√ß√µes aqui contidas adv√©m de pesquisa pr√≥pria e podem estar sujeitas a modifica√ß√µes legislativas (entretanto, como se trata de Imposto de Renda, qualquer modifica√ß√£o de al√≠quota s√≥ poder√° ser cobrada a partir do ano vindouro, devido ao princ√≠pio fundamental da anterioridade de exerc√≠cio financeiro).

Breve An√°lise sobre regime tribut√°rio das criptomoedas no Brasil

Mudado no in√≠cio de 2021, o novo programa de declara√ß√£o do IR (IRS) brasileiro agora conta com 3 c√≥digos para preenchimento da declara√ß√£o (antigamente a presta√ß√£o deveria ser feita na aba ""99-outros"")
a) 81 ‚Äì Criptoativo Bitcoin (BTC); 
b) 82 ‚Äì Outros criptoativos, do tipo moeda digital (altcoins, como Ether); e 
c) 89 ‚Äì Demais criptoativos (n√£o considerados moedas digitais, mas classificados como security tokens).


Qual a al√≠quota aplic√°vel na tributa√ß√£o do Imposto de Renda de criptoativos?
Aqui √© que vem a melhor not√≠cia! Por n√£o ter sido ainda regulamentado, os criptoativos entram na categoria de ativos financeiros que at√© R$ 34.999,00 N√ÉO SE PAGA IMPOSTO ALGUM. 
Ah, um detalhe: o montante de R$ 34.999,00 que n√£o gera pagamento de imposto de renda √© POR M√äS. Assim, caso Pedrinho compre 10 mil em alguma criptomoeda e decida vend√™-la no final do mesmo m√™s com um lucro de 100%, dever√° declarar o montante de 20.000,00 obtido com a venda, mas n√£o ter√° de pagar imposto de renda sobre tal valor. Lembrando que a declara√ß√£o sobre compra e venda de criptomoedas deve ser feita mensalmente.


Quem √© obrigado a declarar a propriedade de criptomoedas no Brasil?
Para o corrente exerc√≠cio tribut√°rio, devem declarar todos os contribuintes que, ap√≥s 31/12/2020, tinham criptomoedas ou criptoativos cujos valores de aquisi√ß√£o foram superiores a R$ 5 mil. Aqui √© preciso um pouco de cautela, pois h√° diplomas legais falando que √© exig√≠vel a declara√ß√£o para:
1) quem tiver acima de 30 mil reais em corretoras de valores estrangeiras;
2) quem tiver acima de 5 mil POR CRIPTOATIVO (cripomoeda ou tokens).
Minha raz√£o para colocar como regra geral ""aquisi√ß√£o de valores superior a R$ 5 mil"" √© mais de l√≥gica: toda e qualquer transa√ß√£o de R$ 5 mil ou mais √© declarada do Banco (e tal informa√ß√£o √© de conhecimento comum tanto do Bacen quanto da Receita). Assim, como n√£o vai haver qualquer cobran√ßa de imposto de renda desde que o valor n√£o ultrapasse R$ 34.999 (explico acima, o mais l√≥gico √© ratificar com a RF o que j√° foi ""dedurado"" pelo banco na transa√ß√£o de R$ 5 mil ou mais, principalmente porque n√£o haver√° nenhum dever de pagar imposto de renda em tal caso. Ir com o valor mais baixo - j√° que n√£o implica em dever de pagar imposto - √© a forma mais segura de evitar futuros problemas com a Receita Federal.

personalfinance,Would like some help and suggestions for loan and investment,"Hello r/personalfinace, I‚Äôm a 
21y/o m who lives in Germany and has quite recently lost his job do to my work going bankrupt. 
I haven‚Äôt been the best in finances and wasn‚Äôt prepared for the loss of my work, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking here for some financial help to better afford my already low lifestyle and making myself more FI so something like a bankrupt workplace won‚Äôt duck me over (don‚Äôt know if I can swear here) again‚Ä¶
I recently, well today actually found this subreddit and would like some suggestions to what my next few moves would/ could be to help me out of this small endeavor I‚Äôm in. 
I‚Äôm in no way into any serious debt ( the only times I borrowed money is from friends and family which I have always payed back) and have never taken a loan in my life, but the problem is that I am broke now. And what is being offered to me is a fast way to get a loan of up to 7,5k ‚Ç¨, with a low interest rate( can tell you later in the comments how much it really is but don‚Äôt have an actual answer rn sorry) With that money I would like to save about 500‚Ç¨ as my spending for till I found a new job and then take the rest to invest into a high interest rate investment stock with a high dividend rate. 
I‚Äôm really new to this and haven‚Äôt really gotten a lot into all of that or warped my head to it as I still don‚Äôt really quite understand how this actually works( maybe I‚Äôm just too dumb, and asking really dumb question rn) but I really wanna learn and get my life straight as I now have the time to do so (had a 9-5 where the boss wanted me to stay in longer, wasn‚Äôt allowed to have anything other to do than the job and I had a 2 hours commute there and back on good days) 
So My actual question would be should I commit into borrowing a loan from a bank or otherwise, and using it invest in a high interest rate stock or not do that because of my financial situation? And if so where do I even start?

Thanks for any help or suggestions written here I will be also reading other threats and posts on this subreddit and would take this down if I happen to infringe on any rules in the post.",finance

personalfinance,Selling my wife's house in a community property state - am I a seller?,"My wife bought a house in Louisiana in 2014, and we were married in 2019. Last month we moved out of Louisiana to a state that is not community property.

We are selling the house, and our realtor says that I am one of the sellers and must sign the paperwork. I am hoping for a sanity check on this, since I'm not on any of the house's existing paperwork (mortgage, deed, etc.). Am I a seller of this house?

Additionally, we are in the market to buy a new house in our new state. Our plan was to put the next house in my name so that this time I would qualify for the federal first time homebuyer tax credit. If I am a seller of our Louisiana house, but I've never bought a home, will that impact my eligibility?

personalfinance,Student loan refinancing: how will it impact my eligibility for a mortgage?,"I'm in the process of saving for the down payment/closing costs on a home. Assuming the housing market doesn't get any *worse*, I expect to be ready to buy some time in the next 6-12 months.

I have some non-federally held student loans I'm considering refinancing, as the interest rates are awful. Like, 7% awful. Based on what I'm reading, given my income (just over $100k), I should be able to get that somewhere between 3-4% upon refinancing.

There are a bunch of variables at play here, and I want to know if this is a risky move or not, considering how soon I hope to buy a home.

Factors that are on my mind:

1. A refinancer will have to run a hard credit pull. I know this is a minor ding to my credit score, but it's still worth considering.

2. This is a major financial move--I have roughly $35k I'd be refinancing. I have to imagine that the refinancing process would be something my mortgage lender would take into consideration, but I have no idea how big a factor this is.

3. Obviously a positive: if I can get my interest rate down considerably, my debt-to-income ratio will improve.

Should I refinance now? Should I wait until after I have a house? How would refinancing my student debt less than a year from applying for a mortgage impact the application?",finance

CryptoCurrency,Federal Reserve Board announces the Reserve Banks will adopt a new message format for the Fedwire¬Æ Funds Service and invites public comment on proposal to expedite adoption,"Below is the press release from the federal reserve: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20211004a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20211004a.htm)  


  


"" The Federal Reserve Board on Monday announced that the Federal Reserve Banks will adopt the ISO¬Æ 20022 message format for the Fedwire¬Æ Funds Service. The change will allow for enhanced efficiency of both domestic and cross-border payments, and a richer set of payment data that may help banks and other entities comply with sanctions and anti-money laundering requirements.

The Board also invited public comment on a revised plan for migrating the Fedwire Funds Service to the new message format. Specifically, the Board is proposing that the Reserve Banks adopt the new message format on a single day, rather than in three separate phases as previously proposed.

The Fedwire Funds Service is a real-time gross settlement system owned and operated by the Federal Reserve Banks. It enables businesses and financial institutions to transfer funds quickly and securely.

The ISO 20022 format was developed by the International Organization for Standardization, which is an independent, non-governmental organization that publishes standards for a broad range of industries. ""  


In short it sounds like the fed is getting ready to launch its ""real time settlement"" system.  With crypto and blockchain making more and more of a splash on mainstream media, this sure seems like they are moving closer to announcing moving their systems to a blockchain and using crypto assets.

bonds,Questions About Mortgage REITs,"Not sure if I should post at r/REITs or r/bonds, but figured this is more about mortgage bonds than equity reits so I'm posting here.  I am trying to get a better understanding of mortgage reits. For example, we'll use AGNC, which holds mostly GSE (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, etc) mortgage bonds.

1. If mortgage rates go up, how does it affect AGNC? On the one hand, I can see that it will get higher interest rate income on its new mortgage bond purchases and less prepayment, but on the other hand, the current mortgage bonds it holds would drop in value, therefore book value will drop and economic return will drop
2. How do rates affect its TBA positions? They are basically shorts bonds? Then if mortgage rates go down, mortgage bonds go up then AGNC's TBA position will be down?
3. How do mREITs like AGNC hedge interest risk?
4. How does the company get funding by borrowing through the repo market? Isn't the repo market for short-term? While MBS are very long term?

bigdata,Thoughts on the data PM?,"In our experience at Secoda working with many data teams, we've seen most data teams do not have the tools they need to succeed. For growing organizations, the data function is usually an afterthought. The first data hire is brought on before raising a Series A and is expected to manage the workload that comes afterward with little to no support. This means that this first data hire usually spends all of their time answering other people‚Äôs questions. These teams tend to be overworked and are likely to remain a reactive function for the foreseeable future.

This is because most data teams are understaffed and misunderstood. Instead of reacting to employee data requests, working with data requires the data team to treat employees as their customers and their data as the product.

An organization's data product is its collection of all of its data knowledge, along with the resources used for accessing, creating, and analyzing that data. Making the data product more self comprehensive, accessible, trustworthy, accurate, and secure should be the goal of the data team and the data team.¬†

Additionally, the data PM should help direct resources towards the highest leverage areas of the business. When products are built with everyone in mind, they usually don‚Äôt accomplish what they need to for any specific subset of users. Data PMs should think about their data products the same way. Building data products for specific levels of technical capabilities and specific¬†*persona‚Äôs*¬†of data consumers should be the goal of the data PM.¬†

We believe that over the next three to five years, the product-management role continuing to evolve toward a deeper focus on data as a product. Data product managers of the future will work with the data team to produce high-quality data products that can help drive self-service across the organization.¬†

To communicate data with the rest of the organization, data PM's might choose to implement tools like dbt, Looker, and Secoda. As we continue to help data PMs for the organization share their knowledge, we hope to be able to offer a greater depth of assistance and support to all employees trying to use data to make decisions. Data interactions are becoming increasingly complex, and Secoda hopes to simplify the interaction with data for every employee.

personalfinance,Refinancing a mortgage,"I found a few recent and relevant questions, but I had some specifics I'm hoping will help me and others -  

From a previous post my interest rate on my mortgage (5%) is higher than it should be.  My credit rating was good when I did switch to our local credit union (almost bit on Rocket Mortgage) and at that time we put money back into the house to update some carpet/floors.   

Credit has gotten better since then, I can only get my FICOs, not sure where to get the ""real"" scores (yes reports, but those never show scores?) but even if it's lower than FICO, it would be around 750.  I did my loan through my credit union, they sourced Freddie Mac and I'm asking them what they can do, but should I just ditch them and look elsewhere? Based on earlier threads it seems 3% wouldn't be crazy far off.    

What about costs out of pocket or fees?  Someone suggested Costco Mortgage services and I see 2.99 to 3.125 on a bunch with a lender fee of $250 (that's just a sunken cost?) .. not sure what else to expect.  Will we have to get an appraisal?  

To be honest one of the reasons I didn't go with Rocket was their appraiser came in from the other side of our state, left a kid in the car while breezing through and came in a lot lower than I'd have expect. Our local credit union had a local agency and he was much closer to what I'd seen from houses in the area at that time. But if we're not doing an equity loan, is that something I can avoid dealing with?  

I think this is why I avoid doing these things, but I'm not sure why as this will save me in the long run.",finance

CryptoCurrency,No More Stablecoin FUD,"Let's nip this one in the bud. 

News ""broke"" recently that the SEC is investigating Circle, the creator of the stablecoin USDC. The facts are the SEC started this back in July. Circle says they are ""cooperating fully"" with the investigation.

For more see: [https://decrypt.co/82629/usdc-stablecoin-issuer-circle-cooperating-with-sec-investigation](https://decrypt.co/82629/usdc-stablecoin-issuer-circle-cooperating-with-sec-investigation) 

When the SEC and the Fed Chair both say something has to be done about stablecoins, rest assured regulations are coming. And if Washington acts, other major economies around the world will likely follow suit. 

None of this is bad news. 

One example ‚Äî so many people seem concerned about Tether's underlying assets, and yet major global exchanges make USDT one of their major trading pairs. No one should want Tether to fail. It would wreak havoc with markets, delegitimize the entire crypto market, and investors would lose tons of money.

How does Tether not fail? By being required, through regulations, to clean up their balance sheet and make sure they can survive a run on the ""virtual bank"" if markets turn sour.

USDC falling into the sights of the SEC is just the latest march by Washington towards stricter rules. Others will also likely end up being investigated and paying some kind of fine.

I'd rather pay down the higher interest card, but I've been wondering if credit bureaus penalize high utilization on \*individual\* cards, or if they just take into account the overall utilization.

2. I can pay that same amount on card 2, which has a higher interest rate (20%), to bring it from 30% to 0%.

I received a letter on 9/24 (dated 9/15) from my original loan company (Prime Lending) that my loan was being sold to Mr. Cooper on 10/1. I sent that letter to my new lender and they said they would take care of this on their end. 

My new lender instructed me not to make my October payment as it was included in the payoff total for whatever day my refi funds next week. But, Prime Lending confirmed payoff to new lender yesterday before the final disclosures were issued, not Mr Cooper. 

I have not received any information from Mr Cooper on how to log in and pay my loan, which is incredibly annoying considering I would have made the October Payment last week under normal circumstances. 

I have two concerns here: 

1.  Who do I bug about my escrow balance from old mortgage? I have to imagine Mr. Cooper wouldn‚Äôt have done an analysis yet since they just bought the loan but since I refinanced they won‚Äôt have a loan anyway. 

2. My lender insisted that the payoff was going to Prime Lending, I asked multiple times about this and had a manager confirm this is correct.

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, October 5, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, October 5, 2021**

Volatility in the stock market continues, with the three major indexes, particularly the Nasdaq (QQQ), reversing hard after suffering one of its worst days all year, with Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) leading the charge. Market participants continue to closely monitor developments out of Washington and wait for upcoming economic and earnings data to gauge concerns over supply chain disruptions and inflation. Tech stocks once again came under pressure as the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield continues to rise. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 1.04% higher, the Nasdaq closed 1.35% higher and the Dow Jones (DIA) closing 0.92% higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, underperformed, closing just 0.35% higher.

We‚Äôve seen previous episodes of rising rates, both earlier this year as well as when the Fed first announced intentions to begin tapering quantitative easing in the not too distant future. Each of these episodes caused a hiccup but didn‚Äôt derail the broader bull market. According to Edward Jones, yields went from below 1% to 1.75% during the first three months of this year, a period that included pullbacks in the S&amp;P 500 of 3.7% for four days and 4.2% for 12 days. However, during that entire three-month stretch in which rates were rising, the stock market rose more than 7%.  In this current spate, 10-year rates have jumped from 1.30% on September 15 to as high as 1.54% last week, reflecting a renewed concern over inflation pressures and reduced Fed stimulus expectations

Stocks are struggling to regain their footing after the September selloff, given that many of the concerns that sparked last month‚Äôs drop remain. Congressional lawmakers have yet to come to an agreement on a solution to raise the debt limit to prevent a potential government default sometime mid-October. Failure to do so would be catastrophic for the US economy.  As a reminder, Congress successfully averted a government shutdown last week. The House approved a bill late on Wednesday suspending the debt limit through December 2022. The Senate could vote on it as early as this week Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, but Republicans are expected to block it again as they have twice before. This is an evolving situation. In my humble opinion, I think the Republicans are playing political games with the debt ceiling and will pass it last minute, similar to the spending bill to avoid the government shutdown.

Looking ahead, the September Jobs Report will be released later this week. Market participants are hoping to see payroll gains accelerate after a shockingly disappointing August report, which shoed just 235,000 new payrolls gains versus more than 700,000 expected. Consensus economists anticipate that 475,000 payrolls returned in September, and that the unemployment rate fell to 5.1% or the lowest since March 2020.

(1)to acquire and hold bitcoin, which we view as a store of value, supported by a robust and public open-sourcearchitecture, that is untethered to sovereign monetary policy and can therefore serve as a hedge against inflation and 

(2) to grow our enterprise analytics software business to promote our vision of Intelligence 
Everywhere. ""

**TLDR**:BNB token is a native token of Binance with a utility function. The hyperdeflationary monetary policy is incentivises users to hold the token. Paired with other mechanisms like staking as validator, PE-ratio, 31 other use-cases and more, they add to the value-add of BNB token. This turns into monetary valuation for the token.

# General Conclusion

Exchange tokens are all the hype right now. There are at least 300 exchanges tokens on CMC. **Exchange tokens** mainly hold the **utility function**, and the other functions could include similarity to cash.Tokens **capture value generated from within the ecosystem**. The token also makes up the incentive mechanism, so it is part of the economics that we will uncover.The top exchange token in the space currently, is **Binance**. So in this episode, we will dive into understanding Binance's **BNB token**.

# 1. Market Design of BNB Token

Main objective of BNB (at least for now): **utility token for discounted trading fees**. *This objective might change in the future, but this is the objective now.*Secondary Objectives

* holding it as a store of value due to its deflationary feature
* trading it with other crypto tokens as a medium of exchange
* spend it on other goods like in-store purchases
* donate to charity

All in all, there are over 31 use-cases of BNB token.On the business side, Binance can tap into their network to establish partnerships like what Libra is doing.On the user side, Binance uses the deflationary feature and many use-cases to attract users.

# 2. Token Monetary Policy and Valuation

*Max supply: 200m tokens || Distribution: 50% ICO, 40% team, 10% investors***Monetary policy:**

* Hyper deflationary structure, similar to a share buyback
* Current status of the monetary policy: 10% of tokens are burned

**Valuation:**

* Price-earning ratio suggests it is undervalued
* But exchange tokens are like frequent flyer miles. Its valuation is conditional on Binance's success. The PE ratio might be undervalued today, but there should be other factors and metrics to consider when valuing the token, more than from just an independent price-point level.
* As much as deflationary mechanism increases value, this is not a guarantee. Burning token is only affecting the supply side.

# 3. BNB Incentive Mechanism

Financial incentive is one of the pillars in token design. On Binance, each trade incurs a standard fee of 0.1%. Traders can use BNB to pay for trading fees and get a discount.Using BNB token to pay for trading is also not too costly for the exchange. Sure, it is diluting one of their revenue stream, but the **value is going back to their early adopters**. Since it is their token that they created from thin air, there is not much to lose for allowing a discount in trading fees with BNB tokens.BNB also uses **staking mechanism** as an incentive.

&gt;Think of it like a subscription model. I subscribe to the newsletter by locking up EconomicsDesign tokens. It is frozen and cannot be touched. I am not losing out, in fact, it gives me access to all the items of Economics Design.

**April 2020 update**: Binance blockchain is moving to staking-based consensus mechanism and to also run smart contracts. Gas fees will be paid in BNB. Validators will collect the gas fees from transactions. Validators have to stake BNB before becoming a validator.

# What Does this Mean

At the end of the day, is this a good mechanism? Sure, it exists to serve the objective and purpose of the BNB's role in Binance's ecosystem. But is it the best system in the world? It is hard to say because deflationary assets have other issues and it might not be suitable for your use-case.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Mortgage Loan Question - Spouse Stops Working during/after Application,"So my spouse and I have completed a mortgage loan application that includes our work history, w-2s, pay stubs, etc. However, *after* we completed/signed the loan application paperwork, my spouse's job will terminate very soon. (The grant that pays this position is finished.) This job change will occur very soon, and definitely before closing. 

Is this something we should convey to the lender, or is it up to the lender to find this out on their own? 

Also, how might this change affect our interest rate? 

A few quick details: 

* We are already designated at a favorable interest rate.
* Our credit scores are both very good.
* My income alone puts us right about at the average US median income. 
* My spouse's job will likely close out before the loan gets to underwriting

Lastly -- in a situation like this, would it be better for me to apply for a mortgage separately from my spouse? 

**Thank you** in advance for any insight.",finance

48. Only 5 more days to Alonzo (as of Sept. 7)!
49. Despite all the negative posting about Cardano smart contracts on eUTxO, it ironically looks like some in the ETH community are actually trying to build ETH L2 on UTXO. [https://twitter.com/matiwinnetou/status/1434570158853529606](https://twitter.com/matiwinnetou/status/1434570158853529606)

52. Charles releases a new video on the Alonzo Update Proposal (on Aug. 7) being submitted so that we can go live on the 12th. He also gives some hints as to his thoughts on the short-term planning of some ‚Äúflavor of the week‚Äù blockchains vs. the long term planning of Cardano. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhujKbMpTEA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhujKbMpTEA)
53. Weiss Crypto lays down yet another very positive thread about Cardano. They acknowledge that they can‚Äôt see the future of Cardano, but they vehemently reject a lot of the anti-hype.

54. Coinbase reveals they received a Wells Notice from the SEC on their crypto loan product. This is relevant for Cardano loan projects.

56. Messari has updated its ‚ÄúInitial Token Distribution‚Äù chart to include a previously missing project and Cardano is still among the very best in the Gen 3 space in terms of broad public coin ownership. [https://twitter.com/CryptoIRELAND1/status/1435708439951552513](https://twitter.com/CryptoIRELAND1/status/1435708439951552513)

60. A Weiss Crypto analyst calls the smart contract launch an alleged event and also doesn‚Äôt realize we already have NFTS. The Cardano community was quick to correct the analyst. Weiss was then also quick to apologize. [https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436369016545857566](https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436369016545857566) [https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436402039085576193](https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436402039085576193)

63. One of Cardano‚Äôs biggest competitors is once again suffering network problems. This time it started out as just being characterized as (more) ‚Äúinstability‚Äù, then they started saying that something had caused the blockchain to ‚Äústart forking‚Äù. This followed their September 2 ‚Äúinstability‚Äù and ‚Äúperformance degradation‚Äù event. It‚Äôll be interesting to see how well their community tolerates this in the future if it‚Äôs happening with their planned slashing model in effect.

69. Now one of Cardano‚Äôs most highly visible critics is implying that the Cardano community has something in common with anti-vaxxers. Unfortunately for him, it was one of his pet blockchains that was down a few days ago while Cardano just kept healthily trucking right along. [https://twitter.com/spudiot1/status/1438402783040790532](https://twitter.com/spudiot1/status/1438402783040790532)

72. Smaug gives us a rundown of how many actual Plutus scripts (19)are running on mainnet vs. timelock scripts (21k) as of Sept 17 and explains simple definitions for both.

74. Now the TX and NJ state securities regulators are after Celsius for crypto loans (BlockFi already got this treatment). Cardano loan projects should probably take note.

75. After the Senate hearing on Tuesday September 14th, Gary Gensler (SEC Chairman) gave a quote to a crypto publication indicating that custodial lending and possibly even staking platforms might be considered securities. This is very relevant for Cardano since it has non-custodial staking whereas many of its competitors have the kind of custodial staking that Gensler may have been contemplating. [https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/117675/crypto-lending-staking-custody-gensler-sec](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/117675/crypto-lending-staking-custody-gensler-sec)

personalfinance,how to use debt/loans to your advantage?,"I have never considered using a loan or getting in debt because I do not like the idea of being a penny in debt, so since I can afford things I just flat out buy them. however, sometimes that means I have to wait for things. 

The only thing I can think of is if I got an interest rate that was lower than either inflation (which I doubt will happen as I believe inflation is at around 2%), or if I am somehow able to use a combination of inflation, money from whatever I put the loan into to then pay off the interest, plus paying off the interest manually. maybe those things can add up. 


but entirely I am just not sure if taking out a loan or whatever is a good idea. I have some student loans I could take but I never bothered to because I don't want to be in debt, and I could afford them anyway.",finance

defi,Earn passive income through your NFTs and DeFi tokens,"NFTs and DeFi tokens have opened a whole gateway of blooming opportunities for investors of today. But what happens after you buy an NFT? Does it just sit in your NFT wallet? You are missing out on a lot of chances of earning a good amount of passive income if that is the case.¬†

Don‚Äôt just let your valuable assets sit idle, put them to work for you. Use your financial NFTs and DeFi tokens to supply liquidity in fungible or NFT lending pools (by choosing a lending pool that meets your needs) in exchange for exciting returns and rewards.¬†

Another interesting way to earn attractive returns through your tokens is to reduce the opportunity cost of holding governance or liquidity tokens by supplying them as collateral and earning rewards on short-term loans.

personalfinance,"Starting a federal job, leave current pension in place or roll into TSP?","Been with my current job with the my city for seven years and I am vested in their pension system. Should be starting with a federal job in December so I am wondering, is it worth moving the money from my pension into the federal thrift savings plan? Or is it better to leave it where it's at? Should have about $50K in there now. I have no idea how to calculate what it would pay out if it just sat there as I only know how to calculate it based on years of service, highest compensation and age. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am assuming since I am only 32, and the money wouldn't be growing if left in the pension, I would be much better off transferring it over to the TSP so it can continue to grow. The more I look into this, the more I question, am I even able to rollover a pension fund into the TSP? Sounds like I can only rollover money from traditional 401K, 403B or roth accounts. If this is true, what do I do? Leave the money in the pension as is, or withdraw it and I am assuming, take a huge tax hit on it?

stocks,Should you be worried about the debt ceiling crisis? - Analyzing the historical impact of the Debt Ceiling crisis on the stock market,"Last week‚Äôs news had been dominated by controversy surrounding raising the U.S Debt Ceiling and ramifications of a default by the US Govt. While there is a lot of political grandstanding involved in what should be a regular process, in this week‚Äôs analysis, we are going to leave the politics aside and deep-dive into the debt limit, how it can affect the financial markets, and what happened last time the U.S almost defaulted?  

**What is the Debt Limit and why is it a cause of concern now?**

The debt limit is the total amount of money the U.S Govt is allowed to borrow to meet its existing legal obligations (Social Security, Medicaid, interest on the national debt, etc.). You can think of it as the credit limit available to a country. The debt limit was created in the early 20th century so that the treasury did not need to ask permission each time for it to issue bonds. (Again, exactly like a credit limit where the bank does not care what you use it for as long as it‚Äôs under your limit)

The cause for concern regarding this is that the current U.S national debt stands at $28.43 Trillion and the borrowing cap is set at $28.4 Trillion. Technically the country has hit the debt limit last July and the Treasury has been using extraordinary measures \[1\] to delay the default. It‚Äôs estimated that Treasury will run out of funds sometime between Oct 15th and Nov 4th \[2\] and then will default on its interest payments.

But it‚Äôs not like raising the debt ceiling is an extraordinarily rare event. It has been revised more than 5 times in the last decade and to quote the U.S Treasury

&gt;Since 1960, Congress has acted 78 separate times to permanently raise, temporarily extend, or revise the definition of the debt limit

 

**Historical analysis of the debt ceiling controversies**

It‚Äôs not the first time the debt ceiling has come to the forefront of financial news and we can prepare for the next one by analyzing what happened during the previous debt crises.

I started off thinking I will have to pull all the data manually but Goldman Sachs has done all the heavy lifting [with this report](https://www.gspublishing.com/content/research/en/reports/2021/09/13/370ef44b-91e7-4a4c-9aa4-7996aba05fde.html). Both Bloomberg and Goldman Sachs state that U.S government shutdowns have no meaningful impact on equity returns and the underlying economic conditions were more important to the stock market performance \[3\]. 

Charles Schwab also came to the same conclusion by analyzing the impact of the previous 18 government shutdowns on the S&amp;P 500 and found that the median return over the course of a shutdown was 0.0% and the mean change was -0.6%.

**If it doesn‚Äôt affect markets, why should I care?**

While the govt shutdowns don‚Äôt have any significant impact on the stock market, a prolonged fight over the debt ceiling can cause U.S Govt to default on its interest payments. The only time the U.S was close to defaulting on public debt was in 2011 due to the delay in raising the debt ceiling. This resulted in Standard &amp; Poor‚Äôs downgrading US Credit rating from AAA to AA+ \[4\].

The downgrade and the debt ceiling debacle caused Wall Street to have its worst day since the 2008 financial crisis with the major U.S Stock indexes sinking between 5% and 7%. 

**Black swan event of US Debt Default**

The U.S Govt has never defaulted on its debt till now. But, even a short-term delay in paying off the interest obligations is bound to have a long-term impact on the economy. In the words of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen,

&gt;It would be disastrous for the American economy, for global financial markets, and for millions of families and workers whose financial security would be jeopardized by delayed payments

This is because a delayed payment would certainly affect the U.S Credit rating negatively and the international creditors who generally view the treasury debt as risk-free investments (because it is backed by the U.S Govt) would no longer see it that way. This would in turn make it more expensive for the federal govt to borrow money down the line.

Adding to this, a vast majority of the global financial system uses U.S Dollar as the reserve currency. It is considered as the de facto global currency and is kept by many governments as reserves. The dollar is strong only because of the U.S economy and the safety of the U.S dollar. A default by the U.S will shake investor confidence in the currency and is bound to cause a steep drop in exchange rates and will drive significant capital outflows.

While no one exactly knows what would happen in the case of a prolonged default, Moody‚Äôs Analytics earlier this month predicted that

&gt;in a prolonged default scenario, the U.S. would slide into recession, with the Gross Domestic Product falling by almost 4%. Some six million jobs would be lost, driving the unemployment rate up to 9%. The resulting stock market sell-off would erase $15 trillion in household wealth.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

While I don‚Äôt think the U.S is going to substantially default on its public debts, a sentiment that is shared by other rating and financial agencies. [This report](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2021/09/28/how-worried-should-we-be-if-the-debt-ceiling-isnt-lifted/) from Brookings argues that the treasury would never let the Govt default on its debt payments and would most likely issue new debt and then use that to pay off the old one, all the while staying under the limit.

The last few times a similar issue came up, the congress was able to reach a compromise in the nick of time. But cutting the deal too close to the deadline might spook investors and force the rating agencies to downgrade the debt quality. Both of these, at least in the short term would adversely affect the market. While you should not be extremely concerned about a U.S debt default, it's a good idea to hedge your portfolio against the expected volatility by having a small amount of long-dated puts.

One of the benefits I was thinking about that I haven't seen mentioned here is that less resources are required to maintain the national currency; the central bank does not need to worry about tracking and managing inflation or printing new money etc...

It takes pressure off of the government as well, no need to worry that an incompetent government will put in place bad monetary policy and mess up their currency.

CryptoCurrency,Federal Judge Grants XRP Holders Permission To Assist Court in SEC‚Äôs Ripple Suit,"Posted the article, saving you a click. 


A federal judge has ruled on a motion by XRP holders who want to intervene in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs (SEC) case against Ripple.

U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres says that while the XRP holders cannot intervene in the case, she will allow them to act as ‚Äúamici curiae‚Äù in the SEC‚Äôs action against Ripple Labs Inc.

Amici Curiae‚Äù means ‚Äúfriend of the court,‚Äù according to¬†Cornell Law School. Amici curiae can submit documents known as amicus briefs on issues relevant to the case as long as the court approves the briefs in advance.

The SEC filed its¬†lawsuit¬†against Ripple Labs Inc. in late December 2020, declaring that XRP is a security and accusing the San Francisco payments company of selling the crypto asset without proper authorization.

In April, lawyer John Deaton and five other XRP holders, referred to as ‚Äúmovants‚Äù in the case documents, filed a motion to intervene on the case ‚Äúon behalf of all similarly situated XRP Holders.‚Äù

Deaton and others argued that the SEC‚Äôs claim leads to the conclusion that ‚Äúevery individual in the world who is selling XRP would be committing a violation,‚Äù according to¬†Judge Torres. Deaton¬†referred¬†to this claim as ‚Äúabsurd.‚Äù

The movants also argued that their interests are not being properly represented by either party in the case.

The SEC argued that the movants are statutorily barred from intervention as defendants. Ripple countered that the XRP holders aren‚Äôt statutorily barred from intervention, but also argued that the movants should have limited participation as either ‚Äòamici-plus‚Äô or limited intervenors to not delay the case.

Stuart Alderoty, Ripple‚Äôs general counsel, says Judge Torres‚Äôs ruling is a positive development.
XRP holders have always said that the SEC‚Äôs lawsuit is a direct attack on them. Now it's official. The Court‚Äôs ruling permits John Deaton to share his ‚Äúmeaningful perspective‚Äù to help the Court ‚Äúreach a proper decision.‚Äù Yet another important (and positive) development.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Why you should buy Crypto.com before the bullrun starts,"# What is Crypto.com

Crypto.com is a cryptocurrency bank that is developing a full blockchain ecosystem that includes a wide range of goods with distinct value. Crypto.com, founded in 2016, now serves over 10 million consumers through the world's fastest growing crypto app, the Crypto.com Visa Card ‚Äî the world's largest crypto card program ‚Äî the Crypto.com Exchange, and the Crypto.com DeFi Wallet. Crypto.com NFT, which was recently founded, is the top platform for collecting and trading NFTs expertly picked from the fields of art, design, entertainment, and sports. As a result, Crypto.com gives users with everything they need to engage successfully in the decentralized market.

Crypto.com aims to drive bitcoin adoption to new heights. Currently, prospective investors may find that entering the crypto market is a perplexing process that necessitates interaction with many platforms and new technologies. All of these acts can be aggravating for new users who are unfamiliar with the blockchain industry.

Furthermore, billions of people worldwide lack access to fundamental financial tools such as checking accounts. Crypto.com offers a more efficient and accessible alternative to the existing quo for these individuals. When asked about the platform's overarching ambitions, Kris Marszalek, Co-Founder and CEO of Crypto.com, stated: *‚ÄúWe believe it‚Äôs your basic human right to control your money, data, and identity,‚Äù*

CRO Tokens are the Crypto.com ecosystem's utility token. The Crypto.com Chain was designed to create a network of cryptocurrency projects and to enable retailers to accept cryptocurrency as a method of payment. The Crypto.com Chain is a high-performance native blockchain technology that will enable transactions between cryptocurrency users and merchants accepting cryptocurrency easy, cost-effective, and secure. This is the token used to access platform services, receive bonuses, pay fees, and initiate trades. In particular, these ERC-20 compliant coins provide unrivaled interoperability in the industry. You can, for example, keep your CRO tokens in any ERC20-compliant wallet. This option is in addition to the possibility to use Crypto.com's dedicated multi-currency wallet.

# Sponsorship

Crypto.com spends a tons on advertising and recently, it has partnered with Fnatic where the Crypto.com logo will appear on the collarbone of Fnatic squad shirts as part of the collaboration. Fnatic will also provide fans with a variety of perks and money-can't-buy experiences for Crypto.com consumers who purchase its items. In the near future, new digital items, such as special Fnatic non-fungible tokens (NFTs), will be released. Fnatic will also offer financial literacy and crypto education chances for people who are new to cryptocurrencies and NFTs in order to help fans better comprehend cryptocurrency and future-proof their decisions.

Additionally, Crypto.com announced a multi-year partnership with Paris Saint-Germain (PSG). Paris Saint-Germain has recently constructed one of the most powerful football squads in history. The addition of world-class players Lionel Messi, Sergio Ramos, Gianluigi Donnarumma, Georginio Wijnaldum, Achraf Hakimi, and Nuno Mendes to an already great group has increased the club's international appeal to new heights. It was an obvious next step to collaborate with Crypto.com, a leader in the crypto sector. The company has over 10 million users globally and is ranked as a top-ten finance app in both the App Store and Google Play. Crypto.com, in addition to developing the world's fastest growing crypto platform, also provides the world's most popular crypto card, which is available in over 30 countries.

Crypto.com has lead the industry in sports collaborations, most notably announcing global alliances with the UFC, Formula 1¬Æ, and Lega Serie A. Earlier this year, Crypto.com became the first cryptocurrency platform to collaborate with an F1 club, as well as the first to collaborate with an NHL franchise.

# A one-stop convenient shop

Crypto.com is more akin to a crypto bank than a cryptocurrency exchange or brokerage. You may, indeed, buy and sell cryptocurrencies on the exchange. You can also exchange them with other DeFi wallet users. Furthermore, you can spend your cryptocurrency with a prepaid Visa card. You can be paid in cryptocurrency, deposit your cash into an interest-bearing account, and ‚Äì in some countries ‚Äì obtain a cryptocurrency loan.

# Cards with Attractive Cashback

Five prepaid Visa Cards are available at Crypto.com. They can be used anyplace Visa is accepted, but you must top them up before you can spend money.

The more CRO you stake, as with its other products, the bigger the benefits. The top-tier Obsidian card earns 8% cash back (more precisely, crypto back) and comes with a slew of added benefits. To qualify, you must stake 5,000,000 CRO. If you don't have a lot of cash, the no-risk Midnight Blue card gives you 1% back on purchases. With the Ruby Steel card, you'll get 2% return on a 5,000 CRO stake (about $750). There is no annual cost, and depending on the card, you will receive a certain number of free ATM withdrawals and foreign transactions per month.

# Earn Interest with Crypto.com

Crypto.com is more than just a website where you can buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Account-holders can also earn significant interest rates. The lowest interest rates on Crypto.com are higher than the finest high-yield savings accounts. The greatest interest rate you can receive is 14 percent, but you'd have to keep a lot of cash in CRO to qualify, much like with the Visa card bonuses.

Your interest rate is determined by how long you leave money, the currency in which you save, and the quantity of CRO you have risked. You can raise your interest rate if you do the following:

* Invest more than 50,000 CRO. You can receive much more if you bet 500,000 CRO, which may be out of reach for many investors. It is deposited for a three-month duration. Although flexible and one-month durations are available, three-month terms receive the best rates.
* Purchase a stablecoin. Stablecoins are coins that are linked to fiat currencies or commodities. You could, for example, invest in a stablecoin that is tethered to the US dollar. You'll earn more interest, but your coin's value is unlikely to rise in the same way that a standard cryptocurrency would.

# Supercharger

In September 2020, Crypto.com debuted Supercharger on its exchange. UniSwap was the first project to debut on Supercharger, with a $500,000 USD budget. Their most recent Supercharger event is Axie Infinity.

Supercharger is a straightforward, adaptable, and safe liquidity mining platform for the most popular cryptocurrency projects, including UniSwap, Polkadot, and Bitcoin. Users are rewarded with tokens for placing CRO tokens into the Supercharger pool. Any confirmed Crypto.com Exchange user who has any CRO to deposit is able to participate!

It is a great way to diversify your crypto portfolio without any hassle!

# THIS IS THE CATALYST

Cronos Mainnet will officially deploy on **October 19, 2021.**

Cronos is powered by Ethermint, a platform that enables the quick migration of applications and smart contracts between Ethereum (ETH) and EVM-compatible chains. According to the statement, Cronos' base settlement currency will be CRO, which is the native digital currency of the Crypto.org Chain.

The Inter Blockchain Communications (IBC) protocol, according to the statement, ‚Äúenables interoperability and bridging to the Crypto.org Chain ‚Äì a completely decentralized, open-source, energy-efficient public chain with high speed and extremely low fees.‚Äù It also ‚Äúallows interoperability with other IBC-enabled chains (for example, Cosmos Hub).‚Äù

personalfinance,Should I buy a new (used) car now or fix my old one?,"Hello! I‚Äôve been a longtime lurker here and finally decided to see if I could get some advice on this situation. 

I (27F) have had a 2003 Honda Civic for about seven years now. But recently I‚Äôve had to do some repairs on it, although they haven‚Äôt been too expensive since my mechanic is a family friend. Probably spent ~$700 in the past three years on it. Not bad at all. 

Now I feel I‚Äôm in a good place financially and am wondering if I should buy a new-ish car before a huge problem happens with this one. I‚Äôve gotten mixed advice from different people. Anywhere from ‚ÄúOh just buy it, you deserve it!‚Äù To ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing really wrong with your civic and it‚Äôs cheap to fix and maintain.‚Äù So here I am asking for some unbiased input from people who aren‚Äôt my friends/family. 

My income: 2,868 per month after taxes, health insurance, auto/home ins deduction etc. 
My total estimated expenses right now add up to about $1,255. That include my half of our mortgage payment. 
I have a little over $20,000 in savings. Little over $5,000 in checking account. 
No investment accounts besides my work 403B account yet, still trying to figure all that out. 

So, I found a 2018 Honda Clarity plug in hybrid for 22k with only 30k miles on it. The salesman actually lowered the price to $20,049 total after taxes and fees, I‚Äôm guessing because the car has been in their lot for months. I really do love it. 

I‚Äôm thinking of doing a $10,000 which would mean $250/month for 60 months with 5.99% APR. However, I‚Äôm hoping that interest rate may end up lower since my credit score is 767. 

With that $250 added to my monthly expenses, it looks like I‚Äôd still be able to put away a good chunk of my pay into savings still. And after the down payment I would still have 6 months of expenses in my savings. 

The tricky part was figuring out my auto insurance because it‚Äôs taken out of my paycheck. I get a discount going through my employer and bundling. But basically I would only see a $750 increase in my yearly premium if I bought this car (I called to get an estimate recently).

All of this, along with the fact that my company is giving us a 4% raise next year, and 3% bonus check for Christmas, makes me think I could do this. 

Also, a day after I wrote this draft, the brakes on my civic gave out at an intersection so that was great. It‚Äôll be $300 to replace a valve. So now I really have to decide whether I want to get it back from my mechanic or just have him buy it off me for $1500. 

Any advice is appreciated!",finance

personalfinance,Is refinancing in my situation worth it?,"We're looking to refinance our home to get a little lower monthly payment and also knock the interest down.

This sounds great but it would increase our total loan amount to $65k.

CryptoCurrency,FOMO is a MOFO,"Received a text from a family member this morning asking if they should buy more SHIB. 

And while I never give financial advice, I did tell this person that I personally would never buy something that is already pumping.

They said that they saw on a few of the Facebook pages they follow that it‚Äôs going to keep pumping because Elon Musk tweeted about it and a whale bought a bunch. 

*Cringe*

So I will tell all newbies who may be browsing through the sub right now the same thing I said to this family member:

The time to buy was over the last few weeks when the price was moving sideways. No serious whales are buying right now. They are either waiting for their opportunity to dump all of their coins or they already have. 

And in order for them to be able to dump all of their coins, there has to be a rush of buyers. A rush of buyers usually comes in after heavy shilling on social media (oftentimes from the whales themselves and oftentimes straight lies) or a news release. 

In the end, buyers are left holding worthless meme coins while whales are looking for their next move‚Äînot giving two fucks about a DOGE, or a SHIB, or a SAFEDOGMOONELONROCKETASS. This is how the game works. 

And even after explaining all of this to the family member, FOMO still got the best of him. Sometimes we humans need to learn the hard way, I guess.

Bitcoin,Buying and HODLing BTC based only on market sentiment (Chads only),"https://preview.redd.it/b9qz2apoeur71.png?width=1130&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a0729af676dbbf652b0b1aeb9ffdcb18ff2adfe

The top graph (Feb 2018 is as far as it went back) is based on 'market sentiment', meaning: sentiment is high when prices are volatile, high trading volumes, alt coins are making big moves (Bitcoin dominance is low), lots of news coverage etc. When sentiment is high(&gt;75%) you don't do shit. You don't sell, you don't buy, you HODL. You just sit on your giant balls of steel.

On the other hand, when sentiment is low(&lt;30%) you better have saved up a FAT stack of cash (because you were not FOMOing when market sentiment was high) and you BUY.

The other graph is BTC price in USD.

&amp;#x200B;

This method might seem crude/simple and that's because IT IS this simple.

I see a lot of Technical Analysis posts/video's and granted although sometimes a good argument is made, lots of mediocre/borderline shitty advice is given as well. My main issue with a lot of TA is that it doesn't take classic investor traps into account (fear/greed) and is often based on hindsight.

Investing is, for a large part, not 'big brain' stuff.

Just take a look at the macro strategy of Buffett for example: when sentiment is high, he just waits and when prices inevitably adjust (market sentiment declines) he has saved up a lot of $ and buys at a good price.

This is, very simply said, what this old fart has done for 75 yrs (Patience + logic instead of fear/greed).

It's about having your emotions (greed/fear) under control and having a long-term mindset. Stoicism comes to mind.

Granted these graphs are kinda scuffed &amp; lacking detail, that's 1)Because I want even the thickest of heads to get this and 2)it isn't necessary because of how simple this really is.

&amp;#x200B;

These graphs demonstrate my point wonderfully:

When sentiment is low: buy

When sentiment is high: patience.

&amp;#x200B;

What inevitable happens when you try to both buy low &amp; sell high is that you end up selling right at the beginning of a giant bull run (in this case December 2020) and you miss out on the fattest gains.

If, like me, you plan on keeping your BTC for at least another 10 yrs because you believe it's one, if not the, best performing asset at the moment; you don't sell and you buy more when market sentiment is low. (Notice I don't say when prices are low. A 'low' price is relative, 10k per BTC seems cheap now but it wasn't 2 years ago. In contrast, a market sentiment of 25 was low 2 years ago and it's low now.)

Understand that your mind is trying to sabotage your success. People that try to buy low &amp; sell high usually end up doing the exact opposite because of fear/greed.

That's why you don't play that game. You buy and you wait. Then you buy some more and wait some more. 

This also gives you great peace of mind because you are not trying to 'time the market'. You don't plan on selling any, hence you don't care when prices are going up/down/sideways. 

Just occasionally check to see if market sentiment is low, in which case you buy. 

&amp;#x200B;

This approach requires a different mindset and it takes some getting used to but trust me the mental peace &amp; long-term gains are very worth it.

&amp;#x200B;

Another suggestion: 

This approach is also great in combination with cost averaging. 

Meaning: every month you have $500 to put into BTC. Instead of putting all $500 in, you put in $250 regardless of market sentiment

and save the other $250 for when market sentiment is very low. By the time market sentiment drops below 30% you have saved up say $1500 and buy a large chunk in one go.

This approach is great because it offers additional protection against your FOMOing mind that would otherwise go crazy when prices are rising and you're not buying anything making it seems as if you are losing out on a lot of gains. In addition, when prices inevitably go down again, you have saved up some funds to buy at a good price.",cryptocurrency

So. We use our experts to time the market for the inevitable crash we know is coming. My sources predict that the value of the coin will drop to $50M for 5 mins on the 39th of July 2024. We then buy the dip and hodl for 82 weeks and **BOOM**. Bull run back to $1T.

I telepathically communicated with the mods and they agree I will hold all the funds in escrow in my coinbase account till then.

CryptoCurrency,How to actually DYOR about DeFi and where to begin,"There was a post about how you can't really DYOR and determine if a crypto asset has actual value or utility and I intended to post a comment there but it got longer ans I thought it was better to just post this. The world of DeFi is pretty much endless and there are new projects popping up every day, but I've noticed that most people are quite DeFi illiterate, even about the basics. If you are a degen yield chaser zoomer bridging to a new chain every week and always chasing the next liquidity incentive program, shitcoin farm or flavor of the week chain, this isn't for you. This is for the people stuck in 2017, and people holding AAVE on their CEX account with 0 on chain transactions.


Many people can't actually research and understand protocols because they don't understand where it fits in the puzzle. Before you can do your own research you should learn about the current DeFi landscape such as dominant money markets on different L1s, different DEXes and the niches they fill, liquidity incentive programs, different yield aggregators and DEX aggregators, insurance protocols, synthetics, collateralized debt positions, liquidity pools and other DeFi primitives . Learn about them and then go and actually use them. See what the UX is like. The same goes for NFT platforms or different L1s, nothing teaches you about crypto and DeFi faster than actually using it. Otherwise you won't have a clue about what a particular protocol or L1 brings to the table. For example, if you aren't familiar with Compound, AAVE, Maker and other money market / synthetic stable platforms, you shouldn't expect to understand the value proposition behind Liquity's interest rate or the efficiency of its liquidation mechanism. Just understanding what you're investing in isn't enough anymore. You should thoroughly understand the current crypto landscape and compare your investment in relation to competitors that are trying to fill a similar niche. I see hundreds of posts and comments shilling scalable and inexpensive L1's because ""it's very scalable and solves the trilemma"" without actually having a single on chain transaction using that particular L1 or any of the dApps in its ecosystem. Don't invest in something you don't use unless it's Bitcoin, because honestly who the fuck actually makes more than a handful of Bitcoin transactions a year? But it's still Bitcoin.


Just to make it clear, this is not a guide explaining the current DeFi landscape, it's a guide about how to go about researching it and it should serve as a starting point for your research. Go and actually learn about these, read blog posts, watch videos, read whitepapers or even better, use them.


If you're looking for a place to start, first of all, you should probably learn about bluechip DeFi protocols on Ethereum. These are:


Uniswap: The most dominant decentralised exchange on Ethereum. V2 had the standard constant product Automated Market Maker that was forked a million times and subjected to vampire attacks on Eth and other EVM compstible chains. V3 has a novel approach to AMM's (that has once again been replicated by other protocols), where liquidity is concentrated on a limited range set by the user and swap fees are structured in different tiers. V3 is much more capitally efficient for LPs and also more efficient for the users.

Curve: Another decentralised exchange. Capitally efficient liquidity pools for different assets pegged to the same asset or different derivatives of the same underlying asset, allowing LPs exposure to yield bearing pools without impermanent loss. Examples are swaps between different stablecoins, synthetic tokens and base tokens, liquid staked ETH and regular old ETH. They also have new pools for volatile assets such as the atricrypto pool. Also very multi chain friendly, they have already expanded to multiple EVM compatible side chains including Polygon, Fantom and Avalanche as well as ETH L2's such as Arbitrum. This is also true for a couple other platforms. AAVE and Sushiswap are also famously multi chain friendly with AAVE having recently launched on Avalanche in addition to Polygon. Sushiswap is on every EVM compatible side chain under the sun but support Sushi incentives only on a couple of them.

Sushiswap: Yet another decentralised exchange. It started as a fork of Uniswap V2 with a vampire attack prior to the launch of UNI token. After some troubled times, it has now become one of the multi chain DeFi bluechips. Sushi team works faster than almost any other DeFi team I've seen. Sushi is no longer just an AMM, they also do isolated lending on borrowing via money markets (Kashi), flash loans, an IDO launchpad and they have an upcoming AMM (Trident) which caters to different niches filled by Uniswap V3 (concentrated liquidity), Curve (stable asset swaps) and Balancer (customizable multi asset pools). 

Balancer: Also a DEX. Liquidity pools with a custom number of assets and a custom ratio between them. It opens new avenues for LPs who are looking to diversify their DeFi holdings while also functioning as a standard AMM.

Note: You don't have to use these protocols individually, there are DEX aggregators like Paraswap and 1Inch that pool liquidity from all these different sources and automatically route your orders through the liquidity pools with the best price, ensuring you buy low and sell high.

Compound: A money market and the protocol that kicked off DeFi summer and yield farming as we know it. Also nototiously suffered from a bug very recently that allowed millions of dollars worth of COMP tokens to be minted and distributed essentially for free. You can lend crypto assets to earn interest and borrow against your crypto via collateralized debt positions, achieving greater capital efficiency on holdings.

AAVE: Another money market like Compound where you can borrow and lend crypto. Currently winning the multi chain money market race IMO. There are also differences with the allowed collateral, collateral ratio at which liquidation occurs, differences in UX, etc. 

MakerDAO: Issuer of DAI, which is a synthetic stable asset minted using other cryptoassets as collateral, and pegged to the U.S. Dollar. It used to be a much more decentralized option, but since USDC became available as collateral, more than 60% of the collateral used to mint DAI has become USDC, which is a custodial, centralized stablecoin issued by Circle. That means an existential threat to USDC is an existential threat to DAI and thus Maker. However unlikely that is, it's still additional risk introduced by a centralized system on top of the smart contract risk posed naturally by DeFi.

Yearn: ""The yield engine of DeFi"". Is managing different collateralized debt positions, claiming liquidity incentive rewards and reinvesting them, chasing higher yields and optimizing debt ratios, LP positions too much of a hassle or too expensive? Yearn is a yield optimizers envisioned to address these concerns without spending gas. It invests the asset you deposit and automatically harvests, compounds and if necessary switches strategies if a higher yield is possible and takes a cut of the profits. This happens in the background without the need for user intervention. Convex is another notable competitor whose TVL has skyrocketed recently, they can also be considered one of the dominant yield aggregators on Ethereum. Both have a highly intertwined and symbiotic relationship with Curve and they both create a lot of the demand for CRV due to its staking mechanisn and they also provide a lot of the TVL for Curve. The yields aren't as degen as other yield aggregators on side chains and alternative L1s, but it's a battle tested protocol running on a battle tested network, offering much better yields than CeFi.

Synthetix: Like it says on the tin, synthetics. Synthetic stocks, crypto assets, commodities, minted using the platform's native token as collateral.

Maybe Bancor? as it has decent value proposition in limiting IL exposure.


Remember that a successful protocol's token doesn't necessarily make a good investment. The native tokens of the dApps mentioned above have vastly different tokenomics, revenue models and rights for holders. For example, UNI is purely a governance token. The only way to price it is speculatively and it depends on how much speculative premium the market is willing to pay for governance rights. The token's price performance doesn't necessarily have to correlate with the success of the protocol. But SUSHI, for example, when staked as xSUSHI, entitles holders to part of the revenue generated by Sushi AMM pools and other Sushi products along with the LPs themselves. The token is also distributed as an incentive to liquidity providers. This means that the market automatically prices the token with the revenue / volume generated by the protocol as staking APY increases if Sushiswap volume increases relative to token price. If the trading volume of the DEX goes up, it naturally drags the price of the token up. Assets like CRV have even fancier tokenomics and staking mechanisms which involve different voting escrow periods for staked tokens and differing liquidity reward multipliers for different amounts of CRV staked. You should always keep these in mind when considering native tokens of protocols as investments.


This list is by no means a complete one but understanding how each of these dApps work will give you a basic understanding of DeFi primitives and how newer protocols and L1s ""fit in"". There are also more innovative products that don't fit in under the above protocols. There are insurance protocols, tokenized real world assets, tokenized future yield and self repaying loans and a million other applications people haven't even thought of yet. Most of these applications leverage DeFi composability and are a good example of ""money legos"" that DeFi brings to the table.


If you want to understand the ecosystems of different L1s, go to defillama.com, and sort protocols by TVL while filtering for different L1s. Explore them, try then out and follow the narrative. Follow where the liquidity is flowing.

Read whitepapers, understand the tokenomics. Twitter posts or Telegram groups aren't actual sources but they can lead you in the right direction. Certain Discord ervers do contain a lot of insightful discussions and research. This sub is probably one of the worst sources of ""alpha"". It's fine to shoot the shit but don't actually take advice from Reddit. People who know what they're talking about very rarely make Reddit posts on this sub about it, though certain niche subreddits may be helpful. Discord servers of even small projects are usually decently active and most devs I've spoken to are surprisingly responsive. Talk to the devs and ask questions directly to them if possible and make sure you understand where a particular asset derives its value from. Don't be afraid to dive into the nitty gritty of it and get technical. Is it a pure governance token, does it have cashflow rights, is there something funkier going on? These are important considerations. Audits aren't everything but they're nice to have.

Also, as a side note if you're planning on using DeFi on cheaper EVM compatible chains (because ETH can obviously be prohibitively expensive for smaller holders). I highly recommend Anyswap as a cross chain bridge for stablecoins and ETH. It's a decent way to quickly move your liquidity around without too many steps and too many fees between side chains and ETH L2s. Xpollinate, Celer C bridge, etc. fulfil a similar purpose so you might want to shop around.",cryptocurrency
vet,Reoccurring diarrhea in young dog- please help...,"Background- 2 1/2 yr old great Pyr mix. Adopted over a year ago. Was full of parasites, worms, infections, etc. when I got him but he was healthy within a few weeks. Daily walks, crated when alone, constant supervision, not table fed. Currently eating Hills Science highly digestible with bone broth, pumpkin, and fortiflora (boiled chicken when sick.) Have seen issues decrease since this change but they are still present. Drinks filtered water, eats little to no treats, doesn‚Äôt have access to trash or foreign objects lying around. He is happy, high energy, and very playful. 

He has always has a sensitive tummy and occasional diarrhea, but over this year it has become increasingly more frequent. Now there is almost a weekly occurrence. These episodes will last a few days and then he returns to normal until sometime the next week. The incidents previously involved blood, but not since I changed his diet (over 2 weeks ago). It begins with food refusal, then crying to go out, explosive diarrhea with repeated trips outside, restlessness, more diarrhea, etc. He is visibly uncomfortable and I hate seeing him like this. Sometimes he wakes up in the middle of the night with an episode as well. These do of course effect his energy level occasionally but sometimes he acts completely normal. 

I‚Äôve seen multiple vets and they don‚Äôt really seem concerned. The blood in the stool was very concerning so I took him back in. Bloodwork and fecal were normal. When they did an x ray, there appeared to be stuffing in his stomach potentially from a toy which the vet believed was causing these issues. They flushed it out and he was ok for a few weeks but now we‚Äôre back to normal. He no longer has access to stuffed toys. Metronidazole was prescribed long term until he began having what they called a ‚Äúneurological reaction‚Äù and took him off of it. Didn‚Äôt seem to help much anyways. 

I‚Äôm desperate to help him. We‚Äôve overcome so many behavioral issues and gone through so much training to improve his quality of life and now this- it‚Äôs heartbreaking to watch. He is my sole focus in life and doesn‚Äôt deserve to live like this. I‚Äôll try anything- raw diets, grain free, maybe an allergy test, another vet, anything. All suggestions are much appreciated and I‚Äôm happy to give more information at request. I‚Äôve been tracking his health daily over the last 16 days. Thanks in advance.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Contacted by mortgage company to lower my interest rate for free?,"For about a month or two I've been getting called by a local looking number that leaves a message about my mortgage. No real information about it, just a need to talk type thing. I saved it as a contact just to be sure it was always the same number (looking up the number on google didn't reveal anything, ie not tied to a company). I ended up answering the call today and it's from Freedom Mortgage, who took over my prior mortgage company Roundpoint (which in turn took over my mortgage from Quicken about a year or two ago) wanting to cut my mortgage rate from 3.375 to 2.75. They say it can be done with no costs.

Super suspicious, but decide to play it out till they ask for anything particularly personal. They ask to confirm my last 4 SSN and then they confirm a few details like address, etc (they reading to me, not me giving to them). They say they want to do a credit check to verify I'll get the lower rate and otherwise confirm company, pay, a bunch fo yes/no on other properties/loans. I don't have any so not too suspicious here and I don't really care about giving out a rough estimate of my pay and company. Also I just went through a cash out refi about a year ago, so this all seemed pertinent information.

They need about 30 min to verify and will call me back. They do and send me link to a document center (solex . com which research says is okay). And the full loan documentation is there, including my full SSN which I never gave them, my current mortgage info (monthyl payments, remaining balance, etc) which I never gave them, yadda yadda.

So, they had my loan info, my email (I never gave it to them, but they did confirm before sending the link to the document center, which came from what looks like a valid email : FreedomMortgage @ freedommortgageloans . com), and my SSN. Which all sounds legitimate. However, the phone number they called from, (which I did call back to verify it wasn't spoofed and got an answer from someone but they knew my name right away) as well as a secondary number to his personal line I couldn't verify via a google search. And overall, why would a mortgage company reach out just to lower my rates with no costs?! And even if legitimate, the change in rate looks to save me \~$100/month. Is it worth it?",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, Oct 6, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, October 6, 2021**

Stocks opened the session lower, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) falling as much as 1.2% early before turning positive in yet another volatile session after a report that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said his party would approve an extension of the government debt ceiling until at least December. Market participants collectively gave a massive sigh of relief now that we aren‚Äôt staring down the barrel of a default. You can never count on Congress in the US, but I did say I thought it was very unlikely that the Senate was going to let the American economy implode by choice. In my humble opinion, I think the worse is behind us and look forward to buying up the first -5% and -8%  dip in the SPY and Nasdaq (QQQ) all year, though I do expect some choppiness moving forward. 

In recent weeks, market participants have been anxiously monitoring developments out of Washington DC, as Congressional lawmakers debated raising the debt ceiling and avoiding an absolute catastrophe if the US were to default on its debt, something that has never (and hopefully will never) happen. Put bluntly, a debt default would plunge the economy into a long-lasting recession, GDP growth would slide and millions would lose their jobs. According to a report by Moody‚Äôs Analytics, one of the three big along with Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch Group, approximately 6 million jobs would be lost and the unemployment would spike dramatically, US GDP would decline, and there would be an irrevocable stain on the faith and strength of US financial markets. ‚ÄúInternationally, the United States will have for the first time undermined the full faith and credit of its own currency -- a blow to our standing in the world and a boon for our adversaries such as China who are arguing to the world that the US is on the decline‚Äù

The report goes on to say, ‚ÄúGlobal financial markets and the economy would be upended, and even if resolved quickly, Americans would pay for this default for generations, as global investors would rightly believe that the federal government‚Äôs finances have been politicized and that a time may come when they would not be paid what they are owed when owed it. To compensate for this risk, they will demand higher interest rates on the Treasury bonds they purchase. That will exacerbate our daunting long-term fiscal challenges and be a lasting corrosive on the economy, significantly diminishing it.‚Äù

Moreover, despite valid concerns surrounding inflation, recent economic data has been very upbeat recently, a sign that despite there being many obstacles remaining, the US economy continues to recover from the pandemic-induced recession. Durable goods, retail sales, and purchasing managers index-tracking activity across US manufacturing have all recently topped expectations. However, prices for those goods remain elevated compared to earlier periods due to ongoing supply-chain disruptions, shortages in key materials, and recently, rolling blackouts in China that have forced the closure of crucial factories ahead of the busiest shopping season of the year.

investing,Why not leverage your S&amp;P 500 holdings?,"Hello all! It occurred to me the other day that when people take out mortgages to buy houses, they're effectively buying into the residential real estate market on margin. So, if the S&amp;P beats the housing market (in the long term, on average), why not buy into the S&amp;P 500 through either a leveraged index fund or on margin (if you can get a good interest rate)?

On the other hand, Buffett is against this kind of strategy, but I couldn't find why. Of course, I'm advocating for a long-term buy-and-hold strategy, and not speculatively buying and selling in short terms, which is usually what people use leveraged strategies for. Perhaps my logic is flawed? If so, kindly let me know. Thank you!

**Edit: Perhaps this isn't clear in my post, but the purpose of the post is asking about the comparison of paying a mortgage to buying into the S&amp;P 500 on margin.

personalfinance,Worth Extending 15 year to 40 year for end of Forbearance?,"I have been trying to do the math on this but I'm having a hard time determining what would make the most sense. I currently have a 15 year mortgage, that has 6 years remaining. I have been in forbearance for 18 months so I need to either accept a loan modification or add the previous forbearance as a balloon payment to the end of the mortgage.

If I went with the 40 year loan modification, then they would keep the interest rate the same as my current 15 year rate, which is 3%. 

There is basically $30,000 owed for the balloon payment and $70,000 Outstanding Principal. 

If I took the 40 year loan modification then they would roll the outstanding principal and unpaid escrow into the new principal balance owed over 40 years (making the new balance something like $85,000). If I was able to pay the difference between the old monthly payment and the new 40 year payment, then it would take an additional 3 years. So I'm basically looking at it like if I took the loan modification and paid the extra amount each month, then it would be similar to having the $30,000 balloon payment rolled into 3 years and an additional $3,500 interest (which will come out to around 7.5% interest or so).

If I kept the loan as-is and had the 6 years remaining and instead paid extra to chip away at the $30,000 balloon payment, does anyone know how that typically works (i.e. do the pre-payments go towards the regular principal first or the $30,000 balloon amount)?

I know this is very subjective, but I was curious if anyone sees anything I'm missing and in your opinion what makes the most sense if it was you? 

Also at 3% interest, it may not even make sense to pay the extra payments and just let it go for 40 years. 

Thanks for any pointers/tips in advance.",finance
personalfinance,Major News -- Many more people are now eligible for US Public Service Loan Forgiveness,"The Biden administration is temporarily relaxing the stringent rules on who is eligible for US Public Service Loan Forgiveness, a program that was created to write off federal student loans for people working in public service. People who make 10 years worth of payments while working in a qualifying public service job (e.g. government, military, many nonprofits) will be eligible for relief regardless of the federal loan type of repayment plan type. 22,000 people will become immediately eligible under these new rules, and an extra 27,000 could become eligible if they get their payments certified.

As someone who has warned people in the past of this program's notoriously low approval rate (well under 10% of applications are accepted), this is a boost to people working in public service jobs. I'd still be wary of basing your financial plans around PSLF, but this is a step in the right direction. However, note these changes only apply through October 2022, as the administration wants to create a more permanent resolution through legislation.

personalfinance,How to classify interest rate on debt?,"Hey Everyone,

So long story short, my girlfriend and I racked up a good amount of credit card debt over the summer. I am going through the r/finance flowchart but am confused about the boxes asking if you have any high (or medium or low) interest debt. It gives 10% as a bench mark for high, 4-5% for moderate, etc.

When paying off debts do I go by APR or monthly interest rate? If APR, I would go harder at the debt but if its by monthly rate not so much. I ask because I am debating stopping retirement account contributions to tackle this. Any help or insight is appreciated.

Extra money pretty much goes to eating out but it's something I am working on. How should I tackle my debt especially since I am expecting a pay cut in 2 months?

MachineLearning,[P]Looking for datasets with both structured data and images for new model proof of concept.,"I recently worked on a project where I was predicting the likelihood of a car accident at intersections. The dataset contained information about that intersection (number of legs, speed limits, demographical data) as well as GPS coordinates. I fed the GPS coordinates into the Google Maps API to get images of each intersection. So the each row of the dataset contained a list of features, a response variable (number of crashes over 10 years) and the path of the associated image. 

To process this I built a new model that is able to process the features and images separately, and then combine them to predict a the number of crashes. I wasn't able to get good results on that dataset given my time constraints and the project ended up just using XGBoost. After the project I made a generic implementation of my model for all to use. 

Before I release it, I would like to validate it on some other datasets to prove it works. I've not been able to find any suitable datasets that have both images and structured features. If you can recommend some, I'll be able to test the model and then I can release it publicly.

personalfinance,"Advice for loan repayment, please..","Good evening all,

First post here on Reddit, but I would like some advice based on my current situation. Here's a bulleted list so you're not reading a whole a\*s paragraph:

* I'm about to be 22 in 11 days (if that matters at all)
* 69K in private student loan debt (8k in federal) - loan repayment starts in December of next year; did not finish school due to personal reasons. Private loan is at 6.99% interest rate. Federal is at 6.24%.
* Making 10k a month (after-tax)
* Expenses: (300 for car - insurance and monthly payment), haircuts ($35 every two weeks), rent (none - live with mother), cell phone (100).
* 7K left to pay on car.
* **I want to be debt free ASAP!!** I really had strong intentions on moving out of my mother's house next summer (to get out of my current environment) and trading in my car as well (it's not the worst, but rather on the unreliable side to some degree - looking for more fuel efficient and reliable car), but now I am having some second thoughts/priority shifts. Debt is something I would rather not carry while having an apartment (esp in a city downtown - as you can imagine bc of amenities and location, rent would be higher) and a higher car payment.

So here's what I'm thinking:

* In order to pay off my student loans in a year (the biggest one - private - because that's the one I'm most worried about - 8k is not my biggest concern), I would have to shell out \*at least\* 6k a month. I would be done in exactly ***one year***.

This sounds absolutely amazing and I honestly would swallow my pride to make this happen, but I'm coming to Reddit for some personal advice on whether that's a good idea or am I taking on too much? Is it unnecessary to shell out that much money?  I think it's worth it bc I hate debt and want to elevate my life.

personalfinance,"21, and about to graduate college and get married.","Hello PF! I'm currently in my last semester of college, and have approximately $3,000 in federal student loans. Credit cards are paid off, but I have &lt;$10,000 in savings due to only working part time during school. In January I will start working at a big bank here in NC making 85k a year.

We plan on moving to wherever she gets accepted into dental school, and my main question would be to how to prepare financially for that.

In terms of employer benefits, I plan on maxing out whatever 401k matching they offer.  What are some pointers or advice that I should focus on the most?

datascience,What I've learned two months into a new DS job...,"I'm a civil engineer PhD that really wanted to study math but for various reasons didn't. And I did two very short postdocs (9 months in total) after the PhD using ML. I then landed a data science  job with the federal government. I am a newbie data scientist and really don't feel comfortable calling myself that anyway. 

**The good**

In my nearly two months on the job, I have learned: 

1) how pipelines work, specifically the targets package in R. To make for reproducibility and shorter run times on projects that branch (basically using a split-apply-combine approach that doesn't rerun the same code when nothing has changed).

2) a little bit on the tidyverse. People love that here and I'm used to writing in base R. At least now I know what people are doing although it's going to be hard switching to writing piped operations myself.

3) how to use containers, specifically docker. Useful for when you want code to not break down the road when packages and software get updated. Wish I had used this earlier. I guess if you code in python and manage your environments with anaconda you don't need this (?) 

4) how to run code and I/O data from a remote machine (high performance computer). And how to spin up a container with a .slurm script on the remote that opens up Rstudio. This way you can work as you normally would on your local. Really grateful for this.

5) a little bit more on git for version control. The part that I had missing was working collaboratively on branches, making pull requests, and managing conflicts-things I didn't  really need to learn since all my previous projects had been solo ventures (gradschool and post grad work). 

In the months to come, I will also have to learn how to correctly deliver data and project outputs on gitlab, Amazon s3 buckets, science base, etc. I will probably take a python course to be able to read other people's code at the very least. Also, object oriented programming is on the wish list of things to learn. 

**The bad**

Lots of acronyms floating around in discussions that make me lose the thread. The discussions seem really fast-paced and I can't keep up. Some of it is probably because these discussions are not relevant to me, but I still have to listen and follow in case they are. Sometimes words are used interchangeably to refer to the same thing, which makes it hard to keep up too. 

Reading other people's code is difficult. But I have to say, my coworkers are rock stars and have very well-documented clean code. They are also generous with explaining what is happening and why with the code that they have written. 

**The ugly**

I'm not sure if I can be of any help to projects since there are so many capable people around. Battling feelings of inadequacy and trying my best to catch up. 

Almost half my time has been bogged down  in administrative type stuff. Very little project work has happened so far. I find this very tedious. 

Lots of time spent on video and audio which is tiring. I feel very ""watched"" on video as it's hard to know who is looking where. Also difficult to time when to jump into or change a conversation. I miss the separation of work and life. 

That's all folks. Thanks for reading.

36. Another signpost for Cardano DeFi projects. Gary Gensler (SEC Head) tells the Financial Times that in his view DeFi platforms have ‚Äúa fair amount of centralisation‚Äù and ‚Äú\[i\]t‚Äôs a misnomer to say they are just software they put out in the web...‚Äù [https://www.ft.com/content/fb126d79-2e60-4002-8aba-b08887fca609](https://www.ft.com/content/fb126d79-2e60-4002-8aba-b08887fca609)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhujKbMpTEA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhujKbMpTEA)
53. Weiss Crypto lays down yet another very positive thread about Cardano. They acknowledge that they can‚Äôt see the future of Cardano, but they vehemently reject a lot of the anti-hype.

60. A Weiss Crypto analyst calls the smart contract launch an alleged event and also doesn‚Äôt realize we already have NFTS. The Cardano community was quick to correct the analyst. Weiss was then also quick to apologize.

63. One of Cardano‚Äôs biggest competitors is once again suffering network problems. This time it started out as just being characterized as (more) ‚Äúinstability‚Äù, then they started saying that something had caused the blockchain to ‚Äústart forking‚Äù. This followed their September 2 ‚Äúinstability‚Äù and ‚Äúperformance degradation‚Äù event. It‚Äôll be interesting to see how well their community tolerates this in the future if it‚Äôs happening with their planned slashing model in effect.

69. Now one of Cardano‚Äôs most highly visible critics is implying that the Cardano community has something in common with anti-vaxxers. Unfortunately for him, it was one of his pet blockchains that was down a few days ago while Cardano just kept healthily trucking right along.

75. After the Senate hearing on Tuesday September 14th, Gary Gensler (SEC Chairman) gave a quote to a crypto publication indicating that custodial lending and possibly even staking platforms might be considered securities.

CryptoCurrency,US FDIC Said to Be Studying Deposit Insurance for Stablecoins,"The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), a key U.S. banking regulator, is studying whether certain¬†stablecoins¬†might be eligible for its coverage, five people familiar with the agency‚Äôs thinking said.

The discussions are preliminary, and it‚Äôs not clear what the timetable would be for making any policy decisions or how such changes would be communicated.

The agency is trying to analyze what so-called¬†pass-through FDIC insurance¬†might look like for the reserves that stablecoin issuers hold at banks, the sources said. Such coverage would insure holders of the tokens against losses up to $250,000 if the bank holding the collateral were to fail.

The FDIC is also looking at what regular, direct deposit insurance might look like for banks that want to issue stablecoins, people familiar with the discussions said.

‚ÄúThis is all part of a process by which they are trying to bring stablecoins into the banking system in a responsible manner,‚Äù one insider said. ‚ÄúIt depends on what‚Äôs backing the stablecoins. If it‚Äôs backed by reserves at the Fed[eral Reserve] for cash then I think you just make the argument that it‚Äôs a deposit. If it‚Äôs backed by Treasurys, I think you‚Äôll have a hard time treating it as a deposit.‚Äù

The discussions come amid a broader debate in the U.S. about potential stablecoin regulation. This week the Wall Street Journal¬†reported¬†(and CoinDesk¬†confirmed) that the Biden administration would subject stablecoin issuers to bank-like regulations. Circle, issuer of USDC, the second-largest stablecoin, has¬†disclosed¬†that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sent an investigative subpoena to the company in July.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are designed to trade at parity with government currencies, typically the U.S. dollar. The most popular kinds are backed by traditional financial assets such as cash in a bank or commercial paper, and are supposed to be redeemable 1-to-1 for cash on demand. The two largest stablecoins, Tether‚Äôs¬†USDT¬†and to a lesser degree¬†USDC, have come under¬†scrutiny¬†recently over¬†questions about their backing.

According to two other people familiar with cryptocurrency banking issues, stablecoin issuers don‚Äôt have the same kind of access to pass-through FDIC insurance that crypto exchanges have when they‚Äôre banking in the U.S. Exchanges can gain omnibus accounts where the funds that belong to each of their clients are insured up to $250,000 each but issuers of stablecoins don‚Äôt get these same kinds of protections.

‚ÄúThe FDIC is probably looking at whether stablecoins can count as deposits or whether someone‚Äôs ownership of a stablecoin is a deposit at the stablecoin issuer,‚Äù said Todd Phillips, a former FDIC lawyer who is now the director of financial regulation and corporate governance at the Center for American Progress, a Washington think tank.

The coverage could present challenges for issuers. Typically, these companies identify customers when they deposit cash for stablecoins or redeem the tokens for cash. But since stablecoins run on open, public blockchain networks (usually Ethereum), theoretically anyone with a crypto wallet that hasn‚Äôt been blacklisted can receive stablecoins from and send them to other wallets.

‚ÄúOne thing to remember is that each person has insurance of only up to $250,000,‚Äù said Phillips. ‚ÄúSo, the stablecoin issuer would need to keep track of who is the current holder of their stablecoin, and how many they own.‚Äù

Whatever the FDIC insures has to not compromise the rest of the agency‚Äôs mission, he said.

‚ÄúThe FDIC basically has one overriding mission which is to ensure the safety of the Deposit Insurance Fund, the DIF,‚Äù Phillips said. ‚ÄúIf the FDIC were to insure a stablecoin, that insurance would come out of the DIF and the FDIC will want to be very sure that they are on legal footing and that whatever they do doesn‚Äôt risk the DIF.‚Äù

If the FDIC went ahead and provided deposit insurance for stablecoins, it would apply only if a bank that was banking a stablecoin issuer or that was issuing a stablecoin itself went into receivership. Even in this scenario, it‚Äôs rare that FDIC insurance would enter into the picture because the agency generally takes a failed bank‚Äôs assets and deposits and¬†sells them to a healthy bank.

How the agency proceeds could potentially help protect consumers, Phillips added.

‚ÄúThe FDIC has strict rules as to which institutions may call themselves FDIC-insured or use the FDIC logo for advertising,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúJust as how the FDIC‚Äôs logo on a bank‚Äôs website allows savers to be confident that the bank is a safe, insurance of particular stablecoins and permission to use the FDIC logo would provide clarity about which stablecoins, up to the insurance limit, will not lose value.‚Äù

It‚Äôs likely that the agency will ask for public comment from the industry before any actual policy change is taken, Phillips said.

‚ÄúI also imagine there are conversations going on between the four FDIC directors, since you need a majority of them to approve a new regulation,‚Äù he said.

CryptoCurrency,"As a small hobby, I made a subreddit where I personally look at 600 crypto news articles daily and post the most interesting ones","I recently became interested in crypto news, but in a different way than just being spoon-fed content that the internet thinks I want to see. There's so much going on in the industry, and in my opinion it goes much deeper than 'crypto went up/down today' or 'xyz famous company interested in crypto.'

I wanted to know what I was missing out on so I started browsing over 600 crypto news articles per day. There are so many that never goes further than price action, or speculation of why something happened or what may happen in the future. However, there are stories out there that have substance and are truly interesting to me. It just takes effort to find it sometimes. For example, a really interesting crypto story might be on page 9 of a specific google keyword and no one would ever see it.

I figured that other people may appreciate my curations, so I set up a small subreddit that only I can post in. I make one post per day of the interesting stories, no fluff, no guff, no TA. Usually about 10-20 articles per post, daily. The subreddit has 3 glorious members as of now. Maybe after this post it will have 7 and that's cool with me.

The subreddit is called SimplyCryptoNews. If you think this is a dumb idea that's ok, I will keep doing it anyway

This is the only announcement I ever made about this, and I don't intend to promote it (it's just a little hobby for my enjoyment)",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,"I made an exchange on PancakeSwap for BNB, but it's showing a $0 total after the swap...? Did I do something wrong?","So back in September I put ten bucks into that stupid WIFEDOGE coin as a laugh to see what would happen and I only had about $2.50 left today as it's done nothing but drop (which I was pretty sure would be the case).

So, I went into Trust Wallet, opened Pancake Swap, and selected Wifedoge, selected conversion to BNB, then it made me click ""enable wifedoge"" which gave me a summary screen and I had to click ""approve"" as if I was processing a transaction, even though this wasn't the final step. It even generated a BSCScan entry which confused me as I had *not* actually clicked the submit button yet and didn't think I had processed anything. 

After doing this, it then gave me the option to click on the ""submit"" button, so I clicked this and exchanged my wifedoge for BNB...however it is indicating a $0.00 balance for BNB after the swap!

It says the network fee was only $0.10 so I should have still had a couple bucks left over. Does anyone know if I did something wrong?

I can share the BSCScan link here if that helps but I wasn't sure if that could pose security risks (I know bots scan these pages for personal info).",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Announcement from Moonwolf devs and pr team!,"First of all: AHHHOOOUU üê∫üê∫

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/07/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-thursday-oct-7.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Dow set to jump as optimism builds for a debt celling deal

&gt; * Dow futures rose 300 points Thursday as Democratic senators signaled they were receptive to a debt ceiling offer from Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell that would allow an emergency increase into December. Optimism about a possible deal swung Wall Street from sharp early Wednesday losses to modest gains at the close for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq. All three benchmarks were tracking Thursday for three-session winning streaks after October started off with sharp back-and-forth losses and gains.

*****

&gt; # 2. Bond yields steady ahead of jobs data Thursday and Friday

&gt; * The 10-year Treasury yield was steady Thursday and remained above 1.5% ahead of the Labor Department‚Äôs weekly look at initial jobless claims. Economists expect first-time filings for unemployment benefits of 345,000 for the week ended Oct. 2. That would represent a decline from the prior week‚Äôs 362,000 new claims. The government issues its September employment report Friday. ADP‚Äôs look at private sector hiring trends last month, released Wednesday, came in stronger than expected.

*****

&gt; # 3. McConnell wants to give Dems time to act alone on debt ceiling

&gt; * McConnell late Wednesday said his debt ceiling offer would give Democrats time to use their majorities on Capitol Hill to craft a bill to raise the borrowing limit on their own without Republican votes. The deadline to take action on the debt limit and avoid a U.S. credit default is Oct. 18. If Democrats accept McConnell‚Äôs offer, lawmakers will again face pressing deadlines to fund the government and raise the debt limit before heading home for the holidays.

*****

&gt; # 4. Biden to tout Covid vaccine mandates for large companies

&gt; * President Joe Biden on Thursday is set to visit Chicago to meet with United Airlines‚Äô CEO and local Democratic leaders as he touts his decision to impose Covid vaccine mandates on employees of large firms. Biden last month ordered all federal workers and contractors to be vaccinated, with few exceptions. For private employers with 100 or more workers, he proposed requiring employees to be vaccinated or tested weekly.

personalfinance,Enroll in Dependent Care Spending Account or take Child and Depdendent Care Tax Credit?,"With open enrollment coming up and having just enrolled my daughter in daycare, I need to figure out if I want to enroll in my employers Dependent Care Spending Account (DCSA), or just plan on taking the dependent care tax credit, as I understand you cannot do both.

I have been trying to track all the changes to these two benefits in 2021, but do we have any idea what they will look like for 2022? Are they reverting to 2020 amounts or continuing with 2021?

Some specifics that might help with the decision.

In NJ, so as far as I'm aware I don't get state tax relief from the DCSA, but would still get federal, social security (SS), and medicare.

Wife and I file jointly, with an AGI of roughly $140k. 

Our eligible childcare expenses from daycare are $11.5k.

My attempt at the math for the DCSA:  
Assume 22% tax bracket, and 7.65% tax rate for SS and medicare: ~30% tax rate  

If contributing the 2020 limit of $5k to DCSA then savings are $1,500  
If contributing the 2021 limit of $10,500 to DCSA then savings are $3,150  

For The tax credit:  
for 2021 changes I think? we'd fall at roughly 42.5% of expenses covered, based on our 140k AGI being $15k over the 125k phase out.   
If we claim the max of $8k, then savings are $3,400.  

Under the old tax credit, we'd only be able to claim $3,000 at 20%, for a savings of only $600. 

This is all terribly confusing, and took me a while to try and piece together. Can anyone check me on these details and provide insight into which option I should be targeting for 2022?

EDIT: 

~~I just realized that although you aren't allowed to ""double dip"", since our expenses are higher than either of the maximum claimable amounts for both of these programs, I should be eligible to claim both, correct?~~

~~Assume I contribute $10,500 to a DCSA, I would still be able to claim an additional $1000 of expenses on the tax credit, correct?~~",finance
stocks,"U.S. jobless claims sink 38,000 to 326,000 in sign of improving labor market","The numbers: Some 326,000 people who recently lost their jobs applied for unemployment benefits in early October, marking the first decline in a month and pointing to further improvement in the U.S. labor market. New jobless claims paid traditionally by the states fell by 38,000 in the seven days ended Oct. 2 from 364,000 in the prior week, the government said Thursday. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had estimated new claims would drop to a seasonally adjusted 345,000. 

Before the most recent decline, new applications for jobless benefits had risen three weeks in a row, raising questions about whether the delta variant had forced more businesses to lay off workers. Yet most of the increase took place in California and suggested the problems were not widespread. The rest of the states have largely seen applications for unemployment benefits flatten out or decline over the past month.

The number of people already collecting state jobless benefits, meanwhile, dropped by 98,000 to a seasonally adjusted 2.71 million. These so-called continuing claims are near a pandemic low. Altogether, some 4.17 million people were reportedly receiving jobless benefits through eight separate state or federal programs as of Sept. 18. That‚Äôs down sharply from 11.3 million at the start of the month, mostly because of the end of temporary federal program to help the unemployed.

The critical U.S. employment report for September that comes out on Friday could shed light on whether more people are returning to the labor force. Wall Street economists predict job creation will more than doubled to around 500,000 from just 235,000 new jobs created in August.

personalfinance,Take advantage of a $7500 tax credit when you only owe $5000,"I'll receive a $7500 federal tax credit this year for buying a qualifying EV/hybrid vehicle, but I'm estimating that I will only owe approximately $5k in federal taxes due to being a student for the first half of the year which reduced my total income.  Are there any worthwhile actions I can take to increase my federal taxes to take full advantage of the tax credit? For example, I think withdrawing money from certain long-term savings accounts (like IRAs) would add to my federal taxes, but I don't need any of the money that I have in those accounts right now.  Just trying to find out whether there's anything I should be taking advantage of while I have the opportunity.",finance
personalfinance,Getting out from under student loan + buying house,"I have a $34,000 private student loan and $23,000 federal student loan. I make $2300 net a month and my husband makes $3800 net. He has no debt (last year we cut some corners and paid off his $6000 in credit card debt) and owns his car outright. I also have no CC debt, but my loans + car cost me $900 + $600 (w insurance).

I found a per diem job that will potentially bring in $1800 more per month net (for 24 hours of work), but it‚Äôs overnight and will overlap with my full time job. Husband is very uneasy about me taking it because my current job has excellent benefits and he doesn‚Äôt want me to risk it. We‚Äôve saved $15,000 ($19,000 come December) and my loan will be $30,000 at the end of the year. If I take that job, we could pay another $6400 off and only owe $4000 come January. That‚Äôs really exciting to me, since I‚Äôve been laboring under the weight of this debt for five years (it was originally a $52,000 loan‚ÄîI had several psychotic breaks during college and bounced around a lot accumulating debt and not getting help; woe is me).

On top of our disagreement about me taking the job, I think it would be smarter to pay off the entire $34k loan, *then* save for a down payment for a house. My husband is antsy where we live (admittedly it‚Äôs an old very cramped house with no counters in the kitchen, making cooking kind of miserable) and he wants to use our savings to buy a house instead. We live in an apartment beneath my grandpa and admittedly, it is a ticking clock. When he passes away (he‚Äôs 89) we will be evicted so his daughters (one is my mom) can sell the house. 

So I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I‚Äôll likely take the second job, but I‚Äôm on the fence about shaking off the loan vs. amassing a big down payment for a house just in case something happens and we‚Äôre evicted. With four cats we don‚Äôt have many other housing options so it‚Äôs a fair concern. But I think it‚Äôs extremely risky to buy a house with our current debt to income ratio.",finance

[https://www.navyfederal.org/loans-cards/mortgage/calculators/mortgage-payment-calculator.html](https://www.navyfederal.org/loans-cards/mortgage/calculators/mortgage-payment-calculator.html)  


I have been using this calculator to try to budget myself. I make $73K a year and have no other debt. According to another calculator that is based off of my income it says I could make up to $1800 monthly and be fine. I am aiming for around $1500 monthly. There are just so many unknowns to me when it comes to homes. I don't know how much I can save on tax deductions or if there are any expenses I am unaware of. 

I assume since the interest rate is so low and it is VA that there is little reason for me to put down a large down payment? I am maxing out my IRA yearly right now and doing 10% into my 401K plus $200 into my HSA a month. Should I consider the house payments as part of my investment? I have tens of thousands of dollars in cash as well so I have an emergency fund but I want to invest more of that after I move into a house.

The houses I am looking at is in a growing area but they are larger than what I would need but I wouldn't be opposed to renting out a room but I don't think I would have to.

My family is in the area and my work is remote so moving isn't an issue.

I need some advice. My SO and I want to purchase a house in Feb 2022. We are both on 60k dollar salaries (120 combined) that is without bonuses and commission. My SO receives a hefty bonus in December each year it was 12k last year and is expected to be higher (maybe 15k.) I just started a new position where I will roughly average $1500 to $3000 in commission each month (confirmed by my manager.) I have about 12k saved up in my bank and she has little to no savings. Both have good credit scores 740+

Now for the bad part: 

I have 20k in federal student loans at a 4.5 % interest rate. I also just purchased a vehicle for $7500 dollars but the best rate I could get was 10% because I was unemployed at the time. I needed the car to get to work, but the position just went fully remote.

Now for the goal: 

Our plan is to try to save 23k dollars by the end of January for a down payment . We are currently living rent free in my parents place and do not have to pay utilities besides WiFi. Myself and her have zero credit card debt. The only debts are my student loans and both of our cars. We have budgeted to save $3250 a month for four months (after all debts and expenses are paid off each month.) We plan on using 10k of her bonus and the extra $13k we save over the next four months ($3250 x 4) for a grand total of $23k. 

My question is:

Do you think this is a good idea? Should I not be concerned about buying a house in the current financial situation I am in? Should I use some of my saved up money to pay off the car or get it refinanced? Should I just worry about paying off my student loans?

investing,Some Thoughts on Long-Term Macro Trends,"1.

2. If interest rates go up, stocks and real estate are going to flatline or decline.
3. The fed will raise interest rates if inflation stays above 2%.
4. The fed (and a lot of commentators and economists) believe current inflation levels are transitory.

Seems to me that everything is riding on the prediction that inflation will decline from current levels relatively quickly.  If it doesn't, the fed will raise interest rates, and real estate and equities investments will suffer.

Agreed share ratio: 
Xilinx x1 = 1,7234x AMD

https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/upndown/viz/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio_16114624177710/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio

**My thoughts:** 

Xilinx is currently valued higher than the share ratio by 16%. The ratio has been in the 10-15% area since the merger announcement. This means that by purchasing Xilinx shares at 158$, you‚Äôre essentially buying AMD at a discount. **($91,72 vs $106,45 /ea share)** 

#Possible outcomes:

- AMD drops in value until the price is equal AMD*1,7234 = Xilinx stock value

- Xilinx rises until its value is Xilinx/1,7234 = AMD stock value

- Market crash. Both stocks fall in value, but AMD will have a greater negative than Xilinx

- Merger is rejected. 

- If the merger agreement is terminated under other specified circumstances, including the failure to receive certain required regulatory approvals, AMD may be required to pay Xilinx a termination fee of $1.0 billion. If the merger agreement is terminated under other specified circumstances, including if the AMD board of directors changes its recommendation, AMD may be required to pay Xilinx a termination fee of $1.5 billion. (Copied from the SEC doc.)

- AMD drops? Xilinx drops? Idk how this‚Äôll play out. 

-	Both Stocks rise in value. Xilinx more than AMD. 


 
 


**Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. Most of my portfolio consists of Xilinx shares. I sold my AMD shares at 114$ as I figured the only way forward was for the ratio to even out.** 


Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including, among others, general market and economic conditions, changes in AMD‚Äôs or Xilinx‚Äôs respective businesses, operations and prospects, the uncertainty as to the extent of the duration, scope and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, market assessments of the likelihood that the merger will be completed, interest rates, general market, industry and economic conditions and other factors generally affecting the respective prices of AMD and Xilinx common stock, federal, state and local legislation, governmental regulation and legal developments in the industry segments in which AMD and Xilinx operate, and the timing of the merger and receipt of required regulatory approvals.",finance

Today I spent several hours searching around on foruns, social medias and websites to understand more how this SHIB pump came to happen. Here is what I found out.

\* It was NOT just Elon Musk's tweets

The first clue to the reasons behind the episode came when users discovered, through a service on Twitter that monitors the activity of whales (investors with large capital in a certain asset) that someone had bought 6 trillion units of the cryptocurrency, valued in the US $43.8 million as of September 30th. 

 Shortly thereafter, Tesla CEO (TSLA34), Elon Musk, posted a photo of a Shiba Inu dog on Twitter, in what would have been a ‚Äúbuy signal‚Äù followed by the community and served as a catalyst for the bull movement.  The purchase itself did not affect the price immediately, but it did become very profitable after Musk released the image. The 6 trillion SHIB has yielded the mysterious investor so far a profit of more than $150 million. 

\* Burned SHIBS 

In addition to following the whale, the members of the ‚ÄúShib Army‚Äù(how the group of SHIB HODLers call themselves) seem to have been aiming for the expectation of a greater shortage of the currency. On one hand, the charity Crypto Covid India, which fights the pandemic in India, announced the liquidation of all 50 trillion of SHIB donated by Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum, in May ‚Äì meaning less pressure to sell.  On the other hand, users bet on the token burning system, which automatically withdraws units of currency from circulation at each transaction. Thus, the demand for the asset itself may have created a cycle that fed back and boosted the rally of recent days. 

\* Shytoshi Kusama's announcement

On Tuesday (5), one of the SHIB project's leaders announced that Shiba Inu will gain its own collection of cryptoart in the form of non-fungible tokens (NFT). With NFT being a HOT TOPIC right now it could have potentially brought in some NFT artists and their followers.

personalfinance,"Higher monthly payment with lower APR, or Higher APR with lower monthly? Thinking about trading in our vehicle.","The goal is to adjust our (wife and my) budget and pay down debt by freeing up funds anywhere possible.  Not sure how this situation should be played out.

We thought about trading in our truck (financed, 22k remaining 5.7%; paying $525/month; the unofficial kbb ""trade-in"" value sits at 30k) for another lower-cost vehicle to free up some money? We no longer need the utility of a truck and want to possibly finance a smaller vehicle. 

If we do finance, my best guess for the numbers would be something like: 15-20k at 10-12%, 60 months (?) ...


So how should this balancing act work out? Do we keep what we have...low interest rate with higher monthly, or do we trade for a lower monthly payment but at a higher interest?


On one hand I have:

 $525/mo, 5.7%

22k remaining, maturity date Sept 2025.


On the other hand:
(mock scenario) Original 20k loan becomes 12k because of ""trade-in"" value.  So...   

12k 12% 60 months, payments would be around $275


That'll ""free up"" $250/mo to be allocated elsewhere.

CryptoCurrency,What is Ethereum 2.0 and Why Does It Matter? The long-planned upgrade to the Ethereum network aims to solve problems with the network‚Äôs scalability and security,"*What Is Ethereum 2.0?*

let‚Äôs take a look at where it is headed. Ethereum 2.0, which is synonymous with Eth2 and Serenity, is a major upgrade of the blockchain network. While it was not the first upgrade, it is the one that is designed to catapult Ethereum to¬†total-value-locked (TVL) balloon
It is a massive undertaking among the developers that will not happen overnight. Instead, Ethereum 2.0 is unfolding in a series of steps, the first of which occurred in the year 2020 with Phase 0, otherwise known as the Beacon Chain.

The Beacon Chain is an implementation of PoS that runs alongside the PoW network and is being battle-tested first. In August 2021, Ethereum completed a hard fork dubbed London, which introduced greater stability to gas fees on the Ethereum network and presented a deflationary model to the protocol‚Äôs monetary policy. With every phase comes new functionality and enhanced performance that will ultimately lead to the destination of Ethereum 2.0, a PoS network.

*What Are the Benefits of Ethereum 2.0?*

Ethereum 2.0 will deliver a host of key benefits that are likely to attract even more developers to the network. The three key improvements include:

*Greater scalability*: Ethereum must be able to support thousands of transactions per second (TPS) for applications built on the network with greater speed and cheaper fees. The one-two punch of sharding and a PoS algorithm is expected to create greater scale thanks to the addition of more nodes, resulting in higher TPS without using more electricity.

*Greater security*: Ethereum must be as secure as possible to thwart attacks so that users including institutions will feel comfortable using it. The aforementioned Beacon Chain is designed to help with network security.

*Greater sustainability:* A lesser carbon footprint has become a major theme in the cryptocurrency industry. The PoW consensus algorithm consumes a great deal of energy. Ethereum 2.0 will be better for the environment as there will be no more mining involved. According to Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin, whose vision for Ethereum is outlined in the below graphic, Ethereum‚Äôs energy consumption¬†will be diminished¬†‚Äúby a factor of more than 1,000‚Äù with PoS.

Certainly an exciting year ahead for Eth Hodlers.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Will Crypto Face a Dot Com Bubble?,"So I was watching a video on Metaverse  while on my other screen seeing how the market did today. Something interesting the video mention is how during the dot com bubble websites were selling for millions, but there was nothing there other than a name.

IDK if the millions is correct, but looking into it this isn't far from the truth.

From [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dotcom-bubble.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dotcom-bubble.asp)

&gt;The 1990s was a period of rapid technological advancement in many areas. But it was the commercialization of the Internet that led to the greatest expansion of capital growth the country ever saw. Although high-tech standard-bearers, such as Intel, Cisco, and Oracle, were driving organic growth in the technology sector, it was upstart dotcom companies that fueled the stock market surge that began in 1995.  
&gt;  
&gt;The bubble that formed over the next five years was fed by cheap money, easy capital, market overconfidence, and pure speculation. Venture capitalists anxious to find the next big score freely invested in any company with a ‚Äú.com‚Äù after its name. Valuations were based on earnings and profits that would not occur for several years if the business model actually worked, and investors were all too willing to overlook traditional fundamentals.  
&gt;  
&gt;Companies that had yet to generate revenue, profits, and, in some cases, a finished product, went to market with IPOs that saw their stock prices triple and quadruple in one day, creating a feeding frenzy for investors.  
&gt;  
&gt;The Nasdaq index peaked on March 10, 2000, at 5048‚Äînearly double over the prior year. Several of the leading high-tech companies, such as Dell and Cisco, placed huge sell orders on their stocks when the market peaked, sparking panic selling among investors. Within a few weeks, the stock market lost 10% of its value.2  
&gt;  
&gt;As investment capital began to dry up, so did the lifeblood of cash-strapped dotcom companies. Dotcom companies that reached market capitalizations in the hundreds of millions of dollars became worthless within a matter of months. By the end of 2001, a majority of publicly-traded dotcom companies folded, and trillions of dollars of investment capital evaporated.

The big thing I want to point out from this is

""The bubble that formed over the next five years was fed by cheap money, easy capital, market overconfidence, and pure speculation. **Venture capitalists anxious to find the next big score freely invested in any company with a ‚Äú.com‚Äù after its name. Valuations were based on earnings and profits that would not occur for several years if the business model actually worked,** and investors were all too willing to overlook traditional fundamentals.""

And

""Companies that had yet to generate revenue, profits, and, in some cases, a finished product, went to market with IPOs that saw their stock prices triple and quadruple in one day""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have to say there is strong similarities as what is going on now in crypto. While the unfinished or no product doesn't bug me as much. And while I don't think we are near this. I do wonder, and I am going to look more into the burst to see if there was some indicators that we can use here in the crypto market.

(One of my thoughts on this btw is maybe we have a dot com bubble each bull run. And this actually might be a good thing in the long run.)

Bitcoin,What are the key factors behind Bitcoin's recovery?,"On October 2, U.S. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said he did not think the Fed needed to raise interest rates until 2024. After the news came out, the market stored easing policy expectations, sentiment positive under the short term rise in bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition U.S. banking giant JPMorgan Chase also provided a comprehensive overview of some of the key reasons behind bitcoin's recent rally. JPMorgan noted that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell made it clear that the Fed has no plans to crack down on cryptocurrencies, which is considered to be the main factor behind the recent price spike. It should be noted that after the news that the Development and Reform Commission and the Central Bank issued a series of notices to regulate mining and virtual currency trading speculation, the market speculation faded and the crypto market as a whole sank.

&amp;#x200B;

However, experts in the crypto field are more worried about the regulation in the U.S. than in China, and Meltem Demirors, chief strategy officer of CoinShares, pointed out in an interview that the bigger risk is that U.S. regulators follow China's example. And at the same time, U.S. regulators have stepped up their focus on the crypto sector. Gary Gensler, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, has been calling for regulation of the crypto market, and the SEC has been working overtime to develop a set of rules to do just that. Others, including Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, have also expressed concern about the space.

&amp;#x200B;

And with Powell making it clear that the Fed has no plans to crack down on cryptocurrencies, crypto market concerns have seen a huge upturn. In addition, Gary Gensler, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, also said that his agency has neither the authority nor the intention to ban digital assets during the hearing.

&amp;#x200B;

Notably, JPMorgan also believes that the rapid adoption of lightning networks has also driven the rally. Largely due to El Salvador and Twitter, this has led to a significant increase in the adoption of the Tier 2 payments track.

&amp;#x200B;

Previous news shows that Twitter has integrated Bitcoin through the Lightning Network, enabling Bitcoin tipping payments for iOS users. The tip feature will rely entirely on third-party payment services, such as the Strike app, and the latest news on October 8 shows that Twitter's ""Tip"" feature is now available to all IOS users, who can find the ""Tip"" option on their profile page. Users can find the ""Tip"" option on their profile page (the default status is ""off"") to activate it.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, news on October 7 revealed that Open Bank Project, API3, Qredo &amp; Sovryn and Banco Hipotecario have formed an alliance to facilitate the process of bitcoinization in El Salvador.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, investors' concerns about inflation have resurfaced. gold stabilized on Oct. 4 news as the dollar and U.S. Treasury yields rose slightly, with higher-than-expected U.S. inflation data and strong manufacturing activity. Meanwhile, bitcoin is gradually replacing gold as a hedge against inflation, reigniting interest in using bitcoin as an inflation hedge. galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz also predicts that bitcoin's market cap will surpass that of gold within a few years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Notably, the latest news shows that the SEC has approved the Volt Crypto Industry Revolution and Technology ETF, which gives investors easy access to companies that hold large amounts of bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

In addition,, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz recently predicted that bitcoin will rise again by the end of 2021. He claims that the horse that turns near the finish line tends to win.

How are we different from the big guys running Wall Street? Selling shit stocks to the Average Joe because he can. I thought Crypto meant something bigger, making money sure but also a revolutionary technology that could change the human civilization as we know it.

Every so often some other sub that has nothing to do with Crypto will discuss it, and I would get frustrated to see a general theme like ""crypto is just a bunch of imaginary coins"".

I know it's not true because there are tons of great projects out there which get dwarfed by the amount of meme coins.

Bitcoin,BITCOIN IS POWER!,"Hi all,

I got into Bitcoin around April of this year. I listened the Robert Breedlove on Lex Fridman's show and he sparked my interest in the subject matter. Now, I am  no one who is just looking for a way to make quick money. Rather than that I was deeply intrigued by his Philosophy and the Austrian Economic Theory behind Bitcoin. I always had slogans like ""Big Banks are evil"" and ""They steal our wealth"" in the back of my mind but I never followed up on these claims. That was until said interview. I went on this very sub-reddit and asked Bitcoiners to point me towards something where I can start to learn about the flaws and fallacies in our economy and our financial system. I was referred to the Hidden Secrets of Money Series with Mike Maloney and Saifedean Ammous The Bitcoin Standard. After that I followed the links, the signs, the mentions, the recommendations, the references, the suggestions and I went down A DEEP RABBIT HOLE!!!

I am humble enough to know that I still know nothing at all... but one thing I have taken away from this is that people who are not familiar with Bitcoin must not underestimate the NON-FINANCIAL POSITIVE EFFECT a Bitcoin Deep Dive can have on you as an individual. I feel like my laser eyes are slowly starting to glow and they burnt the veil of bullshit mainstream propaganda right off my face. Bitcoin has led me to Mises, Rothbart, Taleb, Hayek and many more. I have an entire shelf on my reading list, and which each book I feel more empowered. Bitcoin has done this. Thus, the thing I am preaching now to friends and family is the following:

CryptoCurrency,A great way to learn about tokens and a bit of fun,"So I'm sure you have all thought about making your own crypto at least once, well I went through making one for absolutely nothing just a bit of my time (while at my desk at work as its been a slow week). So I used \[TokenJenny\]([https://tokenjenny.one/](https://tokenjenny.one/)) to create the token but firstly I need some Harmony to pay the gas fee, so I jumped on \[Crypto Rolyale\]([https://cryptoroyale.one](https://cryptoroyale.one)) a great fun game similar to the old .io games like slither. now here you can earn ROY for playing and then use \[Viper swap\]([https://viper.exchange/#/swap](https://viper.exchange/#/swap)) to turn that ROY into ONE, you can send it out as one but you get so much less than if you send out ROY and then trade it. 

So next I minted a Token called killawasp KWP and sent it too my wallet then I added the rest of my one to a liquidity pool to be able to trade that token. I sent 1Million back to the contract address and used my second MetaMask account to start buying small amounts. I then spent the next few hours on and off playing crypto royal till I got over 100 ROY sent that out for around 5 ONE added a little extra to the liquidity pool and the used the rest to start buying in increments of .01 ONE which for the first trade brought about 40 KWP but in the last trade I got 0.9 proving I am adding value to my coin I thought I would test this further and went to sell 10 low and behold I was now getting 0.1 for 10 KWP crazy bearing in mind 100 when first minted didn't even get me that much. Its not going to make me rich especially as I sell the price will decline slowly but I can only sell up to 160 KWP (due to the small amount in liquidity). I'm well chuffed I found a fun game to earn small amounts and through this am able to mint and add value to my own coin just for fun and to learn how buying and selling will fluctuate a coin is great. plus if a actually spent all day selling 1 KWP at a time for my 8-9 million I'm sure in the end I would have made enough to make it very worth while but that will take a looooooong time lol. Have fun experimenting I've made 2 more coins and crossed them by making liquidity pools of all of these and one is with USDC, again everything from free funds made on crypto royal (in one week I have earnt about 400 ROY which right now is 15.9 ONE all used to give my Shitcoin value.

CryptoCurrency,The Challenges of Regulating Cryptocurrency,"Source: https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/the-challenges-of-regulating-cryptocurrency

On September 14th, the new chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, appeared before the Senate Banking Committee to talk about how his agency planned to handle the financial markets during his term. He praised the American financial system, discussed the future of corporate bonds, and ruminated on how the rules of the stock market might be modified to make it more efficient. Soon, he turned to cryptocurrency markets, which are notoriously volatile, and adopted a darker tone. ‚ÄúFrankly, as I‚Äôve said before, I think it‚Äôs more like the Wild West,‚Äù Gensler said. On another occasion, he had described cryptocurrency investments as ‚Äúrife with fraud, scams, and abuse.‚Äù

Gensler‚Äôs comments came after several years of a fraught relationship between the agency he now heads and the market for digital coins, tokens, and virtual currencies such as¬†bitcoin, which are created using cryptography, and many of which reside on giant, decentralized electronic ledgers that use blockchain technology. The S.E.C. has so far failed to keep up as thousands of tokens and digital currencies have been introduced, and new companies and platforms have emerged to help store and trade them. The lack of regulations over this burgeoning area has created an opening for widespread fraud; in May the¬†Federal Trade Commission¬†reported that consumers lost more than eighty million dollars on cryptocurrency-investment scams between October, 2020, and March, 2021, more than ten times the amount lost during the same period in the prior year. (Two million of it was lost to scammers impersonating¬†Elon Musk.) Gensler now faces the challenge of clarifying how the nascent market will be regulated in the future. The stakes are also high for the crypto industry: until it becomes a part of the regulated economy, it will be associated with a notion of criminality.

Gensler, who is sixty-three, has a long history in government and on Wall Street‚Äîa common r√©sum√© for officials selected for important economic posts. He spent eighteen years at Goldman Sachs, where he worked as a mergers-and-acquisitions banker and became one of the firm‚Äôs youngest partners, at age thirty. He was nominated by President Bill Clinton to be an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury. In 2009, President¬†Barack Obama¬†named Gensler to be the chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulates the derivatives markets. After leaving the C.F.T.C., in 2014, Gensler worked as a professor at M.I.T.‚Äôs Sloan School of Management. During his time there, much of his teaching focussed on cryptocurrency. His first class, ‚ÄúBlockchain and Money,‚Äù covered the development of blockchain and its potential uses.

One of the biggest questions facing the industry is whether tokens‚Äîwhich are tradable assets that may serve as the units which denominate cryptocurrencies but can also represent other things of value‚Äîqualify as securities; if so, they would be subject to securities laws and regulations. And if they aren‚Äôt securities, what are they? The answer to that question would help determine which other agency might have oversight of them. To many in the field, the messages coming from the S.E.C. in the past few years have been confusing.

One securities lawyer I spoke with, Nick Morgan, who is a partner at Paul Hastings, recalled that, around 2017, as a frenzy of initial coin offerings‚Äîa fund-raising strategy for cryptocurrency that resembles an I.P.O.‚Äîwas in full swing, a client came to his law firm wanting to know what the S.E.C. thought about I.C.O.s, and whether the agency considered digital coins to be under its purview. Morgan said, jokingly, that his first question was, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs an I.C.O.?‚Äù He quickly learned that there was little S.E.C. guidance available. ‚ÄúWhat would be useful for everyone to know is, what are the characteristics of a digital asset that is¬†not¬†a security? It would be useful to draw that line,‚Äù Morgan said. ‚ÄúI was a little hopeful, given Gensler‚Äôs technical background, that he might be the person to say, ‚ÄòHere is the boundary of the S.E.C.‚Äôs jurisdiction, and if you designed a token this way, that would be outside our jurisdiction.‚Äô¬†‚Äù But, he added, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to happen.‚Äù

During a speech in early August, at the Aspen Security Forum, Gensler offered some thoughts on the matter. ‚ÄúThose tokens being offered, many of them are offered and sold as security,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs actually a lot of clarity on this front.‚Äù Gensler then reaffirmed a statement made by his predecessor, Jay Clayton, at a Senate hearing: ‚ÄúTo the extent that digital assets like I.C.O.s are securities‚Äîand I believe every I.C.O. I‚Äôve seen is a security‚Äîwe have jurisdiction and our federal securities laws apply.‚Äù But some may still feel that the details remain fuzzy.

One way to understand what the S.E.C. thinks about a particular matter is to look at the enforcement cases it brings, which help define what activities violate securities laws. Last December, the S.E.C. filed a lawsuit against Ripple, a cryptocurrency company, alleging that it had conducted an ‚Äúunregistered securities offering‚Äù by raising $1.3 billion through sales of a token called XRP. According to the agency‚Äôs complaint, XRP is a security, and the company should have registered its offering and sale to the public with the S.E.C. Ripple argues that XRP is a currency, which would make it subject to different laws and regulations overseen by different agencies‚Äîsuch as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which are both part of the Treasury Department. Ripple has taken to Twitter to defend itself, in addition to making its arguments in court. Part of its strategy seems to involve trying to embarrass the S.E.C. over the agency‚Äôs apparent contradictions surrounding cryptocurrencies. In 2018, an S.E.C. official named William Hinman told an audience at a conference that, based on his understanding, one of the best-known cryptocurrencies, ether, was not a security and shouldn‚Äôt be regulated like one. The trading price of ether went up in the coming hours, and actors in the cryptocurrency world seized on the comments, which they interpreted to mean that many other cryptocurrencies were likely not securities, either. Ripple has argued in court that XRP should be treated the same way as ether. It has also urged that some of the S.E.C.‚Äôs internal documents pertaining to what is, or is not, a security should be handed over as part of the case in order to be used in the company‚Äôs defense.

More recently, the S.E.C. has expressed interest in the workings of Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, where people can buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Coinbase went public earlier this year, and in June it announced plans for a product it called Lend, which would have enabled owners of cryptocurrencies to loan them out and be paid interest on the loans. On September 7th, Coinbase announced in a blog post that the S.E.C. had threatened to sue the company over Lend, alleging, the post said, that the offering involved a security. According to the company, its executives had been ‚Äú‚Äã‚Äãproactively engaging‚Äù with the S.E.C. for six months, to clarify the legal standing of its projects, but it ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt get much of a response.‚Äù It also said that the S.E.C. had so far refused to clarify whether it considered the act of lending cryptocurrency a security, or whether the cryptocurrency itself was the security, and any other aspects of its reasoning. (The S.E.C. said that it could not comment on issues involving specific companies.) On September 17th,¬†Coinbase announced¬†that it was cancelling the Lend program.

While the agency takes its time setting clear rules, the industry is left continuing to guess.

On the other hand, all these do not give a 100% guarantee of further growth. Many find the situation a bit confusing and are considering the possibility of a more stable income.

**Market Outlook:**

Stocks are looking to open a bit higher this morning, albeit somewhat mixed. We should be getting more jobs data today, and so far, the data has been encouraging and shows signs of recovery. Worth noting that with the job market recovering nicely, we could see the Fed stepping in to begin the taper process. I'm expecting this to happen in the near future, we'll see if the market has an immediate reaction, or if this has been priced in. The debt ceiling is no longer an issue for now, and we saw some strength in the market yesterday as a result. We'll see if that strength continues, or if it was just a bounce on the way down. The indices closed higher, but they also gave back most of their intraday gains.

We are seeing some volatility in premarket, which tells me today could be volatile as well. Just be cautious and remember to trade mechanically. SPY is currently trading a bit over 439. After breaking through 440 in yesterday's trading, it closed below that level, right around the SMA(20). We should test that level (\~438.74) as support/resistance this morning. I'm optimistic the strength will continue, as the mega caps showed strength in an attempt to break out of the recent weakness (minus FB). If the mega caps decide to roll back over, we could see more weakness. DIA is trading a bit under 348. If we see more strength today, we should test the 350 resistance. If we see weakness, we could test 346 as support. QQQ¬†is trading a bit over 364, and it could see resistance around the 365 level. Still hovering between SMA(20) and SMA(9) at the moment. Gold is up a bit this morning, while silver is down. Crude oil is trading slightly higher, looking to continue the recent strength. B\*\*coin is currently trading around 54,900. I'll be looking for it to hold up over the 53,500 level, although we could see some consolidation after the recent strength, as we are hitting some resistance levels. Cr\*\*to-related stocks are up in premarket trading. Airlines and cruise stocks saw some weakness yesterday, but they appear to be maintaining the new uptrend.

Remember to use proper risk management, by making sure you size appropriately for your account and have a plan for every trade you enter (both for taking profits and cutting losses). Happy trading everyone :)",finance
CryptoCurrency,Attempts at crypto before Bitcoin!,"Attempts at Crypto before Bitcoin!

When bitcoin was developed in 2009, it launched a new generation of digital currencies. Bitcoin differs from many of is predecessors in its decentralized status and its development of blockchain technology. However, it's difficult to imagine the creation of bitcoin, let alone the hundreds of other digital currencies which have since launched, without the earlier attempts at cryptocurrencies and electronic cash in the decades before bitcoin was launched. Here are some examples of these attempts.

Attempts in the Netherlands
According to a report in Bitcoin Magazine, one of the earliest attempts at creating a cryptocurrency actually predates bitcoin's creation by about 20 years. Petrol stations in the Netherlands were suffering from nighttime thefts. Rather than post guards and risk their safety, a group of developers attempted to link money to newly-designed smartcards. Truck drivers who needed to access the stations would carry these cards instead of cash, and the stations would not have paper money lying around. This may have been the earliest example of electronic cash, which has links to digital currencies as we know them today.

Blinded Cash
Around the same time, or perhaps even earlier, American cryptographer David Chaum experimented with a different form of electronic cash. He conceptualized a token currency which could be transferred between individuals both safely and privately; again, the similarities to modern day cryptocurrencies are striking. Chaum developed a so-called ""blinding formula"" to be used to encrypt information passed between individuals. ""Blinded cash"" could thus be safely transferred between individuals, bearing a signature of authenticity and the ability to be modified without traceability. Chaum founded DigiCash to put his concept into practice several years later. Although DigiCash went bankrupt in 1998, the concepts the company put forward as well as some of its formulas and  Encryption  tools played an important role in the development of later digital currencies.

Web-Based Money
In the 1990s, a number of startups made efforts at furthering the goals of DigiCash. Of these, perhaps the company with the greatest lasting impact on the broader financial world was PayPal. PayPal Revolutionized person to person payments online. It allowed individuals to quickly and securely transfer money via web browser. By connecting itself to the eBay community, PayPal secured a dedicated userbase which allowed it to grow and thrive. It remains a major payments service today. PayPal also inspired its imitators, including companies which attempted to provide a means for trading gold via web browser. One of the more successful of these operations was called e-gold, which offered individuals online credit in exchange for physical gold and other precious metals. This company ran into issues with various types of scams, however, and was eventually shut down by the federal government in 2005.

B-Money
In 1998, developer Wei Dai proposed an ""anonymous, distributed electronic cash system"" called B-money. Dai suggested two different protocols, including one which required a broadcast channel that was both synchronous and unjammable. Ultimately, B-money was never successful, and indeed, it was quite different from bitcoin in many ways. Nonetheless, it was also an attempt at an anonymous, private, and secure electronic cash system. In the B-money system, digital pseudonyms would be used in order to transfer currency through a decentralized network. The system even included a means for contract enforcement in-network as well, without the use of a third party. Although Wei Dai proposed a whitepaper for B-money, it was ultimately unable to garner enough attention for a successful launch. Still, Satoshi referenced elements of B-money in his bitcoin whitepaper roughly a decade later, so the impact of B-money on the current digital currency craze is undeniable.

Bit Gold
Not to be confused with the contemporary gold-based exchange of a similar name, Bit Gold was another electronic currency system which dates back to the same period as B-money. Proposed by Nick Szabo, Bit Gold came with its own proof-of-work system that in some ways is mirrored by today's bitcoin mining process. Through this procedure, solutions were compiled cryptographically and then published for the public in much the same way a modern blockchain would function.

Perhaps the most revolutionary aspect of the Bit Gold concept, however, had to do with its movement away from centralized status. Bit Gold aimed to avoid reliance on centralized currency distributors and authorities. Szabo's aim was for Bit Gold to reflect the properties of real gold, thereby enabling users to eliminate the middleman entirely. Bit Gold, like B-money, was ultimately unsuccessful. However, it too provided inspiration for a large group of digital currencies which would enter the market a decade or more after its introduction.

Hashcash
Developed in the mid-1990s, Hashcash was one of the most successful pre-bitcoin digital currencies, according to The Merkle. Hashcash was designed for a number of purposes, including minimizing email spam and preventing¬†DDos attacks, Hashcash opened up a wide array of possibilities which would only¬†be realized nearly two decades later. Hashcash used a proof-of-work algorithm to aid¬†the generation and distribution of new coins, much like many contemporary cryptocurrencies. Indeed, Hashcash also ran into many of the same problems as today's cryptocurrencies today; in 1997, facing an increased processing power need, Hashcash eventually became less and less effective. In spite of the fact that it eventually fizzled out, Hashcash saw a large degree of interest in its heyday. Many of the elements of the Hashcash system worked their way into bitcoin's development as well

stocks,High in Cannabis,"Full Disclosure: While my portfolio is diversified, I have around 5 digits of it in U.S. cannabis stocks. This post is not written to pump cannabis market, frankly I don‚Äôt give a fuck if you invest or not - this post is written so that I can share the knowledge I learned in the cannabis industry. Invest at your own discretion, and don‚Äôt cry if you lose or win.

We all remember 2018, a meme year when everyone and everything was in cannabis stocks, tilray was pumping just like any other Canadian cannabis stock - too bad this was all a pump and dump and everything crashed harder than a Japanese kamikaze did in 1944. 

Let‚Äôs fast forward to 2021 -  EV/ EBITDA multiples for cannabis stocks Are at historic lows - cannabis shares are down on average 40% since their peak. In the world of finance, 95% of companies get valued by their EV/EBITDA multiple, ( enterprise value / ebitda - if you want to read more on this investopedia is your best friend) 

Anyway, U.S. has THE best cannabis stocks in the world, growing at 100% Y/Y and overall having positive cash flows (ex. GTI, Trulieve) 

Let me tell you one thing, as of now Cannabis stocks are trading at very low multiples compared to their growth ~10-15x, EV/EBITDA 2021 and 5-10x EBITDA 2022. If you compare it to Uber or DoorDash or snowflake which are trading with at 100+ multiple and growing way slower. **I don‚Äôt believe in a lot of things, but I can bet my left nut that cannabis stocks are currently undervalued based on the growth they are having **

If you don‚Äôt trust me - fine. Look at any fast growing company on the NYSE or NASDAQ and compare their multiples to cannabis stock. I can guarantee cannabis stock will be trading at a lower multiple than counterparts when you account for revenue and EBITDA growth rate. 

Now that we covered multiple expansion, let me talk about management and growth opportunities. 

Two things I want to cover:

Management teams: go on any large cannabis website be it GTI, Curaleaf, Cresco, trulieve or any other and you will find that at least 50% of management will be made up of finance legends from Goldman or any other respected bank - they know their shit when it comes to growing the business, and the fact that they or on these teams should tell you a lot. If it doesn‚Äôt, look at the companies the my sold and what **multiples** they sold them at. Also, many of these team members were actively managing portfolios that yielded insane returns. 
Growth: Cannabis is bound to be legalized, and even if it isn‚Äôt, there is plenty of opportunity for state growth. Every year there are more states legalizing some form of cannabis sale, which opens up a new market for these companies to enter. Sooner or later federal legalization will come - this will lead to more growth ops and revenue expansion. I don‚Äôt want to dwell too deep into this topic because M&amp;A markets are very complex and expansion leads to consolidation at attractive multiples - this is a topic for another discussion. 

You are probably thinking by now, ‚Äúwhy the fuck are these cannabis stocks not trading at high multiples now?‚Äù
Here are me three reason which I truly believe in:
1. Equity and debt available in the markets: cannabis stock are not legal in the U.S. federally which means they can not be officially listed on stock exchanges like NYSE and NASDAQ therefore they do not have access to cheap equity and are not able to grow easily. Same with debt - historically these cannabis companies where getting their debt at ~13% with a lot of restrictive covenants and warrants simply because large banks like JP Morgan were not comfortable with lending to cannabis companies and crossing the grey lines 
2. Cannabis is not federally legalized yet, which leads to multiples expansion problems but the main being investor confidence. No one wants to pay a high multiple on a business that is currently illegal and that is simple as that. 
3. U.S. cannabis stocks not listed on major exchanges. This is a bigger problem than many people realize - a large demographic that would likely invest in cannabis is millennial investors which just so happen to use Robinhood and WeBull -  these platforms do not allows Over The Counter (‚ÄúOTC‚Äù) trading, which locks out retail investors. How many people are willing to open a fidelity or thinkorswim account just to buy some cannabis? Less than 1% if I had to estimate. 

Moral of the story is that when cannabis becomes legal on the federal level or at least a SAFE banking act is enacted, multiples will stay low until they explode. Federal legalization will be the ultimate driver of multiple explanation. While now democrats are busy passing debt legislation what easier route can they take to grow their approvals by a few percent than legalizing cannabis? Reminder: Bidens approvals rating dipped to 42-44% based on most recent polls. 

Thesis: **cannabis companies now are not able to access debt or equity financing like normal companies can, driving the multiples way below industry averages especially when accounted for growth**

End of story - as I said before, I give zero fucks if you invest in this market - but I personally think this is a truly fantastic opportunity that lets me or you buy in for cheap. As somewhat of an insider in the industry I think cannabis has way more room for growth and what anyone sees right now is a tip of the iceberg.",finance
personalfinance,Mortgage refinance sanity check,"I'm refinancing the $280,500 remaining on my mortgage. Currently at 4.0% for a conventional 30 year mortgage. House is conservatively valued at 400k currently. Mortgage is my only debt, the monthly payments are not a challenge, and barring a massive life change I plan to stay in the house for 20-30 years. 

Refinancing will get me down to an interest rate anywhere from 2.125-3% based on term(30yr vs 20yr)and using points. I can run the numbers for each option but I want to make sure I'm understanding the crux of what should drive my decision. 

My Dave Ramsey instincts tell me to:
* Shorten the loan term to get the lowest interest rate
* Pay closing costs up front to avoid paying interest on that amount. 
* Don't cash out any equity to keep my total loan amount low

BUT with interest rates being where they are I believe the more advantageous thinking would be:
* Keep the 30 year term, still get an improved interest rate and invest the savings from a lower monthly payment
* Roll the closing costs into the loan amount and invest that cash instead
* Cash out equity and invest it (don't know if I have the risk tolerance for this but it's still a logical option)

Assuming disciplined investing, is it really just a calculation of how much I can save on¬†my mortgage vs how much money investing the savings would make me in the same amount of time?

**Will the Federal Reserve Launch a Digital Dollar? Here's What We Know**

by Tor Constantino | Published on Oct. 8, 2021

*The Fed is planning to release a discussion paper soon that could shape the future of currency and payments in the U.S. and globally.*

For decades the U.S. dollar has been the undisputed global reserve currency, but that could change. Since 2014, China has been quietly working on its own Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), which is a suped up, e-version of its homegrown yuan. And this year, the People's Bank of China launched a real-world beta test of its CBDC in more than 30 major cities to iron out any bugs. In June, it even held a lottery to give out digital wallets with 200 yuan (about $31) to 200,000 citizens to jumpstart adoption.

Over the past few years, several other countries have run small test launches of CBDCs too, including the e-krona in Sweden and the e-peso in Uruguay. Other countries currently exploring their own CBDC projects include France, Korea, Russia, Canada, Brazil, and South Africa. However, nothing has reached the scale of China's CBDC rollout.

A U.S. Treasury Department advisor, who spoke who spoke exclusively to me on condition of anonymity, says China's CBDC aspirations are an attempt to become the world's future digital currency. ""We now know China's CBDC is far less 'progressive' than initially anticipated,"" the source explains. ""Instead of a new CBDC, it's more of a digitized yuan. We're pretty sure China's aim with the ECNY (digital yuan) is to attack the dollar's status as a global reserve currency but don't know how effective a job it'll do in its present state.""

**What China's launch means for a U.S. digital dollar**

U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was not worried either during a Sept. 22 press conference when he was asked if he had any concerns about China's head start in this global digital currency race. ""I think it's important that we get to a place where we can make an informed decision about this and do so expeditiously,"" Powell said. ""I don't think we're behind. It's more important to do this right than to do it fast. We are the world's reserve currency. And I think we're in a good place to make that analysis and make that decision.""

Powell went on to say that the Fed is working on a paper that will inform the decision on launching a U.S. CBDC, which could be ready in the next few weeks. ""We do intend to publish a discussion paper soon that will be the basis for a period of public engagement,"" Powell said. He added that ""The ultimate test \[that\] will apply when assessing a central bank digital currency and other digital innovations is, are there clear and tangible benefits that outweigh any costs and risks?""

Supporters of a fed-backed digital dollar say those benefits include cheaper and faster financial transactions and speedier distribution of federal funds such as Social Security benefits or aid such as stimulus checks. According to the FDIC's 2019 How America Banks survey, there are about 7.1 million unbanked households in America. So the digital dollar could also be a way to boost economic equality for these folks, too -- most of whom have mobile devices, which would be a primary CBDC access tool.

However, critics note that some of the so-called strengths of CBDCs are also primary weaknesses. CBDCs are not crypto-coded, so they're not anonymous, and they will likely originate on a government-run blockchain. The movement of digital dollars would be trackable, so while it would help curb funding of terrorists and eliminate money laundering, government workers would have explicit details on every transaction you make.

Potentially, U.S. state and federal tax agencies could track taxable transactions and secure automatic payments at their discretion without advance notice. Also, depending on which political party is in power, the government could conceivably politicize CBDC payments such as by blocking payments to charities or religious organizations -- or blocking CBDC use for certain goods such as birth control or bullets.

**What's next for a U.S. CBDC?**

Despite these challenges, if the U.S. launches its own CBDC, it has several advantages over anything currently available or in the works. Not only is the U.S. dollar the reigning global reserve currency, but its cash value has universal cache among countries and individuals, which would help the use of its CBDC. And if the U.S. wanted to drive quick adoption of its e-dollars, it might decide to issue foreign aid only in U.S. CBDC. A power play such as that could guarantee worldwide uptake since the United States provides aid to more than 200 countries globally, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.

It's difficult to say with certainty if and when a U.S. CBDC could be launched, but it's even more difficult to imagine the world's largest economy and global reserve currency on the CBDC sidelines.

""Regarding the Fed,"" said the anonymous Treasury source, ""they've been conducting a study and are set to release some research into the feasibility of either a U.S. CBDC or a digitized dollar, but I'm personally bullish on a U.S. CBDC within the 18-to-24 month timeframe.""

Whatever the future holds for a U.S. CBDC, it will be interesting to see what happens next, and what impact it has on the cryptocurrency world as a whole.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Selling company stock options, need advice","Hey personalfinance,

13k credit card
8k medical debt (care credit. No interest for 2 years)
Mortgage (2 years old), 195k

Credit card is high on the list due to high interest rates. We've considered paying off the car in full, or paying down a large chunk to prepare for refinancing for a lower payment 

We would also like to set aside at least some money for a honeymoon, and some to invest.

Additionally we are planning to move to Florida. Zillow says our home now is worth about 295k, which I doubt but would be awesome, as that would give us another 60k cash if it actually sold for that.

I believe we are going to try and rent for our first 6 months in FL, and then apply for a mortgage jointly. 

I'm looking for advice of different ways we could smartly use this money. Paying down high interest debt is at the top of our list. 

If you were in our scenario, which debts would you pay off, and what other considerations would you have.

personalfinance,Looking for pointers on what to research/ask my CPA related to mortgage and taxes.,"I am looking for some guidance that I can bring to my CPA or otherwise research that will help me figure out my best option. I recognize this is a long and somewhat complex question, so any research pointers or questions I can prepare for my CPA are helpful. This is a scenario that involves my mom's finances:

* **My mom wants to retire in Colorado . She has the land, but needs to build a house, and it's going to cost her about $600-700k.**
   * She is retired, and her only income is investment properties and social security. Her net monthly income, not including incidental expenses, is about $5400. Her total asset and property market value is roughly $2.2m, and she holds $521k in debt, so a net value of about $1.67m *not* including capital gains taxes.
* She will sell two houses for about $300k, and she has another $50k for it. For the **remaining $350k** we are looking at different options of borrowing and selling. After talking to banks, she thinks that she won't be able to borrow more than $200k without selling another property or drastically increasing her rents to make her balance sheet more appealing.
* **One option to raise funds would be that she sells off more property.**
   * The benefits to this approach as I can see them:
      * She can use the proceeds to finance most of the balance, and whatever is left could be covered in a personal / construction loan.
      * A benefit to me is that I don't have to be involved in this.
   * The downsides to this approach as I see them:
      * She will pay capital gains taxes on these properties, we think, AND lose an appreciating asset that generates passive income. Most of the houses are not paid off, so she would probably have to pay off the debt and taxes on them, in addition to losing regular monthly income. Also it will mean that she is holding less debt during an inflationary period, which seems bad.
* **Another option to raise funds would be that I co-guarantee or otherwise assume part of a construction loan.**
   * I am a relatively high wage earner $175k base salary with bonuses that put me at a TC of up to $220k. I have about $160k in a diverse stock portfolio, with another $50k in roths and IRAs. I am holding some IPO stock (won't sell for a while) that is worth about $1.1m
   * The benefits to this approach as I can see them:
      * My theory would be that if I took on part or all of the loan, I could claim the taxes and interest as deductions on my highly-taxed income.
      * I should be able to get a better interest rate than my mom. I have never owned a home so I think I could be eligible for some first-time homebuyer rates/credits.
      * I like the idea of holding debt during an inflationary time. ¬†It also should keep my credit high.
      * This would help my mom out
   * The downsides of this approach as I see them:
      * **One concern I have is that eventually I will want to own my own property - perhaps sooner rather than later.** ¬†
* **Here are the caveats, unknowns and concerns overall**:
   * This is property I will inherit eventually tax-free (well, we think so). I don't think there is any benefit for me to own a slice of it now via tenancy in common since I won't be making any rental income on it.
   * I'm not actually sure if the tax deductions on the construction/mortgage loan are really that substantial for me since I would then have to itemize. My only other itemization would probably be a home office deduction (about 10% of the sq feet in my $3k/mo apartment, $300).
      * It seems like they would be especially not effective if she paid me actual 'rent' to cover the cost of the mortgage.
      * Instead, it seems like the better way to handle this would be for her to gift me her portion of the mortgage, either out of the $15k annual exclusion or the lifetime exclusion. My understanding is that this is legal and relatively common, and that if we do this then the deduction against my on-paper income could be helpful.
   * I am wondering if there could be any odd benefits we aren‚Äôt aware of if we create a holding company (LLC, s-corp or something) together that would take on the loan. ¬†So far that seems like a worse option since business mortgage rates seem higher than personal rates.
   * I am also wondering about more off-the-wall ideas like having her deed one or more of her properties to me and then me gifting her the market value of the property (less mortgage cost) as part of *my*¬†lifetime gift exclusion as a way to avoid capital gains. ¬†Is that legal, or is the IRS going to just consider that a shady sale?
* **Ultimately we‚Äôre going to do what we need to do to get her this property, so I just want to understand the most optimal way for me to do it so that I‚Äôm not put in a corner for my own mortgage possibilities, and maybe so that I can help her while getting a tax deduction**.

So I know this is quite long, but any general suggestions or pointers are very appreciated.  Thanks.",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, October 8, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, October 8, 2021**

Stocks closed the day modestly in the red but capped off the first week of October in the green as market participants digested the Labor Department‚Äôs September Job Report. The move to the upside earlier in the week came after Senate came to an agreement to raise the debt ceiling into early December, helping avoid a catastrophic government default. The S&amp;amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.18% lower but the week 1.12% higher, the Nasdaq (QQQ) closed the day 0.5% lower but the week 0.69% higher, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed the day even and the week 1.41% higher.

After the first negative month all year, the move higher in equities came after the Senate came to an agreement to raise the debt ceiling until early December, preventing a catastrophic government default that would‚Äôve taken place around Oct 18. On Thursday, the chamber voted to raise the debt limit by $480 billion. 

With concerns over a government default dissipating, market participants turned their attention to the latest monthly jobs report from the Labor market, which showed the second consecutive month of payroll gains greatly lagging behind estimates. Non-farm payrolls rose by only 194,000 in September versus the 500,000 expected. The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 4.8%, though this positive development came alongside a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate to 61.6%, versus 61.7% in August. And the size of the civilian labor force actually contracted in September, with the gap between the size of the labor force in February 2020 and last month topping 3 million. 

Though employers added just 194,000 jobs in September, the economy has now regained half of the jobs deficit it faced in December, compared with pre-pandemic employment levels. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last month that he'd only need to see a ""decent"" September U.S. jobs report to be ready to begin to taper in November. It is very likely the tapering of quantitative easing will be announced this month and commence in November. 

Friday's jobs report stood in stark contrast to other, stronger-than-expected data on the state of the labor market in the U.S. New weekly jobless claims came in at their second-lowest since March 2020. Here are the numbers 

* **Initial unemployment claims:** 326,000 vs. 348,000 expected and an upwardly revised 364,000 during prior week
* **Continuing claims:** 2.714 million vs. 2.766 million expected and an upwardly revised 2.811 million during prior week 

**Highlights**

* The[ Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said Friday that it reached a deal ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-minimum-corporate-tax-rate-162842722.html)among 136 countries to ensure major companies pay a minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. ""The landmark deal, agreed by 136 countries and jurisdictions representing more than 90% of global GDP, will also reallocate more than USD 125 billion of profits from around 100 of the world‚Äôs largest and most profitable MNEs to countries worldwide, ensuring that these firms pay a fair share of tax wherever they operate and generate profits,"" the OECD said in a statement

personalfinance,How do I proceed with my car loan?,"So here's the rub, and apologies for any weird format, I am using mobile. 
     I shot myself in the foot about 3 years ago. I went to one of those sketchy car dealerships that accepts all credits and only sells used cars. Well to say I was naive isnt even close. I was an utter moron. I let them sell me a 2016 dodge dart for around 17k with a 23% interest rate. Yup. You read that right. A car that's only worth about 7k in great condition for 17 with three zeroes following it, and a 23% interest rate from a used car dealership.  Might even be closer to 27 but not interested in pulling.the details right now. Knowing what I know now I can only imagine that salesman was laughing in the office after i left. 
         So fast forward to today I still owe 10k on this vehicle and maintaining the $474 monthly payment has been a struggle. Not to mention the full coverage insurance you have to carry on a financed car. However I am about to be recieving the first chunk of a rather large settlement, I should have the check before halloween is what I have been told. I am wondering if the financial gurus here can tell me.my best course of action. Obviously I want to be rid of this debt and start putting the monthly bill towards my own savings. How should I go about this? The payoff quote is around what I'll be recieving in my 1st payment. Do I just pay this off ASAP? I'm not fond of the car but I still need a vehicle to commute for work so I dont think selling it 3rd party is a good idea because I'll have to buy another car if I go that route.

personalfinance,Approval for Private Student Loans with a ‚ÄúFair‚Äù Credit Score in the middle of a semester?,"I‚Äôm pretty naive with finances. I started a grad program (for PA school) in late August. I moved from California to Nebraska and had practically no experience looking for housing/apartments because I commuted during undergrad and continued to live at home after graduating while working. I didn‚Äôt want to visit Nebraska to apartment hunt because of the travel costs, so I didn‚Äôt shop around as much as I should‚Äôve and I ended up with a lease to an apartment that‚Äôs probably over the budget for my loans. I chose it because of proximity to campus and availability around the time I wanted to move in. 

So I maxed out on my federal loans including GradPlus, and I thought this apartment would work because it is cheaper than similar apartments in California (big mistake to compare I suppose). I‚Äôm pretty sure the estimated cost of room &amp; board as calculated by my school was lower than my rent so my maxed federal loans are less than I need for rent and other things. I also assumed that I would be able to get Food Stamps/SNAP benefits considering I won‚Äôt be making any money as a full time student and my friend told me a lot of other med students/PA students used food stamps through their schooling. It‚Äôs probably different with every state, but I ended up getting rejected because of I wasn‚Äôt a part of work study/I‚Äôm not working? Is that accurate in the state of the Nebraska? Or do the interviewers actively try to keep people from getting approved for Food Stamps? (If someone knows better, let me know). My program does not want students to work because of the rigor of the courses, which is typical for PA programs. 

I have a large enough line of credit (between all my cards) to sustain me between my loan disbursements, but the hit I‚Äôve taken to my credit score has me so anxious. And I‚Äôve had to make so many large purchases for moving and like buying medical equipment, plus I do have to make car payments. I have mostly used my credit card for everything because I don‚Äôt want to accidentally get overdrawn from the automatic payments I have set up for like my auto loan and car insurance or whatever else. 

It doesn‚Äôt feel sustainable to me in the long run, so I was wondering about private student loans which I definitely should‚Äôve considered beforehand. What are my odds with approval? My credit has been dropped to fair because of my credit card utilization. I‚Äôm also nervous about adding another hard inquiry because I‚Äôve had quite a few because of the loans and a new credit I applied for before moving to help with that. Does potential income for the degree/career I‚Äôm pursuing factor into approval? I‚Äôd really appreciate advice and guidance, like I said I‚Äôm very much clueless when it comes to finances.

Hi Reddit, 
I am looking to get some input on my transportation situation in an uncertain economy. What is better: to buy a beater (~1000 USD) and risk breakdowns or minor inconveniences OR buy something more expensive (max ~10,000 USD) but have more transportation security.

Before the pandemic I was in the service industry and I LOVED it. I am an educated person, but I fell into it after I came home from college and needed a job. It was shortly after the market downturn in 2008 and despite my best efforts, I was not getting any of the jobs I was applying for. So, dejected after a rough bout of interviews, I walked into a somewhat decent restaurant and applied for a position as a server. I started the next day and fell in love with it. It was fast paced, stimulating, challenging, I didn't have to take work home with me, and I was good at it so I was able to make a decent living (anywhere between 20-40 USD per hour). It is NOT what I thought I'd be doing but I enjoyed it....I remained in the service industry and every couple years I would  try to get on at a nicer restaurant. This worked for me until the pandemic hit. Between the lockdowns, restaurant closures, loss of experienced staff, and mask mandates, the service/restaurant industry is now an anemic ghostly shell of its former embodiment. It is no longer fun or profitable as the public health scare and political climate has made patrons to these establishments forgetful of even the simplest manners that we teach to young toddlers and restaurant are so sorely understaffed that employees have to work 2-3 times as hard to make half as much in tips....


Sorry to digress, but basically I am living on my savings while I figure out what to do with my life. What price point for a vehicle will bring me the best value if I need to get the most from my current assets?

Its insanely infuriating to see how crypto policy is being formed. They are coming up with crypto policy designed by people with zero skin in the game.

The article reports that :

\&gt; One challenge the White House has had in crafting its plans is that it lacks a senior staffer with deep expertise in crypto who can focus on the issue, one person familiar with the policy work said. Tim Wu, a special assistant to the president for technology and competition policy has knowledge in the area, but is recused from working on crypto because of his personal holdings

This makes no sense whatsoever. Anyone who really understands crypto will end up owning it.  

If you want to form crypto policy, you need to hear from actual people with skin in the game, who use crypto. Not a bunch of psuedos who have never used crypto but claim they are experts. Like that one tart from UK, Frances Coppola who pretends to be an expert, but didnt even know what a wallet was. She claimed an offline wallet cant receive coins.

They want to form crypto policy without discussing it with anyone from crypto.

personalfinance,Should I pay off my private student loans?,"So I‚Äôm in need of some financial advice. I owe money in student loans (duh?). A good chunk of it is federal, but I also took out a gnarly Sallie Mae loan as a freshman which was a p crappy idea. I haven‚Äôt taken out any private loans since that so that‚Äôs basically all I have. I‚Äôm also lucky to have paid off my car and any other bills I would be paying are taken care of by my dad. 
Long story short, I have enough money saved up to outright pay off my Sallie Mae loan and I‚Äôm thinking of doing it because I‚Äôll still end up with about $2,000 left after doing that. Should I do it? I‚Äôd be dumping $20k thatI have saved up but I‚Äôm just thinking of how much money I would be saving because it has an 11% interest rate and the amount I owe has been STEEPLY increasing since I took out the loan.

My savings would basically be depleted, and I WILL STILL have to start paying for the federal loans once I graduate. But god willing the job I get once I graduate will pay me enough to keep up with those loans. 

What would you guys do? Would paying off the loan kill my credit score? Do you think I should just hang on to the money I saved for a down payment in a home? Like put it away and don‚Äôt touch it until It‚Äôs time to start house-hunting? I don‚Äôt know what to do. I had always intended to use this money for student loans, but outright paying off a loan wasn‚Äôt really a thought until now.",finance

The proposed directive would charge federal agencies to study and offer recommendations on relevant areas of crypto -- touching on financial regulation, economic innovation and national security, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing plans that are still under consideration. 

The initiative will also aim to coordinate agencies‚Äô work on digital currencies throughout the executive branch, the people said. The plan would push departments that have given scant attention to crypto to focus on it. Officials have also considered appointing a White House crypto czar to act as a point person on the issue, one person said.

The White House declined to comment on the crypto initiative.

The draft directive is part of an effort by the White House to craft a sweeping strategy for digital tokens, which have become a growing concern for regulators as they‚Äôve become wildly popular with average Americans.

CryptoCurrency,The Future Of Real Estate And Asset Tokenization,"The real estate market is huge (200-250 trillion $ market) and I believe the future of real estate and asset tokenization will be huge in the upcoming years and here is why:


Real estate owners perspective:
Let‚Äôs take a 1 Million $ apartment example. You might suddenly see an opportunity to invest in a company, you decide to get married and go on a honeymoon, you see a very cheap house for sale on the market, Bitcoin is in a bear market and you want to buy some, etc.  
If all you had was that 1 Building, you could not take part in those opportunities unless you sell the full building. In regards to real estate, yes, you could mortgage the building and borrow money from the bank, but then you would be in debt, owing to the bank money and have to pay it back with interest.  
I am sure you‚Äôre seeing it coming, but the other solution would be to list your building, have it split into mini tokens, and only sell the amount you need. This is what the sentence: get liquidity out of an illiquid asset actually means.  
Before listing your building, a licensed broker-dealer will appraise the value of your building to give it an evaluation of 1 Million $. It is all regulated and done through joint Ventures and Partnerships.  
Let‚Äôs say you need 100 000 $ right away, then you could sell 100 shares of your building and keep the other 900 shares worth 900 000 $.  
This also means the Owner would not have to find one big buyer, he now has a pool of thousands (or millions eventually) of potential buyers. Is it easier to sell one big pie or 10 pieces of a pie?  


So why would someone want to buy small portions of big assets?


There are at least 2 reasons why you would want to buy the token of an asset:  

- Re-sell it after it has appreciated in value.

- Gain passive income if that asset is generating revenue  
	
You would own a portion of an asset for the same reason you would own shares in the stock market. Your goal is for it to go up in value over time and then re-sell it. As we all know, the Real Estate market keeps climbing up. A building worth 1 Million $ 10 years ago might now be worth 2 Million $. It‚Äôs very high returns, but you need money to make money, 1 Million $ ain‚Äôt cheap.  
What happens if you do not have enough money to buy a large asset like this then? 
Real estate tokenization would be the solution to this.
Reselling it is not all though, assets listed could be revenue-generating assets and by owning a share of it you would be entitled to receive those as well.  
In the case of an apartment building, it collects rent every year and although there are some management fees to it (taxes, Janitor, Plumber, etc.), profits left would be distributed pro-rata to the shareholders.  
This is huge since it now means doors are opened for small investors to own something else than bonds and stocks, they can be in the same real estate game as the rich folks, which has a higher yield.  
Keep in mind that in some cases, you might only be lending your money to the owner in exchange for a portion of the collected rent and interest rate.

Recently I lost my job and was able to file for Chapter 7 which discharged around 50K in loans I had. 

The above is my current monthly expenses and debts that were either not discharged or money my father lent me so I didn't end up on the street. I currently have a roommate which is why the rent is so cheap, and it includes utilities. 

I'm set to get a seasonal position at a local wholesale company for $16 an hour, 25 hours a week but that is set to ramp up higher to 40+ hours a week sooner than later as the holiday season approaches. At that point, my post-tax monthly income will increase to around 2000 a month.

**Considerations**:

I can't get rid of my gym membership. I go five times weekly to maintain physical conditioning in my back due to prior injuries, and they have specific equipment to target lower back muscles that you can't find at most conventional gyms. 

The Pro Sports Tickets were something I bought when I had more income at my previous job. I owe another 6 months' worth of payments at which point the contract ends. All those tickets except for a handful are listed to sell. Unless my financial situation vastly changes I do not intend to renew.

My current savings in my checking amount to $900 dollars from a 401K I liquidated after pre-paying the taxes on it. 

I am one month behind with the student loan from Sallie Mae. I'll get current with them in the next week or two, as soon I get my first check from my new job, so while they are delinquent, they shouldn't default. 

My goals are to become debt-free and strengthen my financial position so I can grow some savings and I don't have to survive on ramen noodles more than two nights out of the week.

I‚Äôm trying to be proactive and minimize my taxes for next year. As a thought experiment, I created a hypothetical situation involving a couple (married, filing jointly) with a combined income of $135,000 who end up paying $0 in federal income taxes and less than $500 in state income taxes.

Spouse 1 has a 401k at work, and spouse 2 has both a 403b and a 457 at work. Both also max out their Traditional IRA as well as their HSA. Am I missing something? Is this situation possible? 

I used this year‚Äôs tax brackets and contribution limits. I also assumed the couple has a low cost of living and can comfortably live off of what remains after deducting taxes and retirement contributions (in this case, $46,515 left over to live off of). 

Also, is there a way to minimize FICA taxes? It seems social security and Medicare are untouchable and are not affected by retirement contributions.

You are a bitcoin user - and you are trying to determine where and how to incorporate for your new bitcoin based business (or maybe just to set up a corporate / business exchange account).  What do you do?  Where do you go?  There have been a lot of changes recently and there are more on the horizon.  The purpose of this post is to try and see if there is a pathway that can help you reduce and simplify the process for those who are interested specifically in finding a pathway to incorporation that makes sense for you.  (It's also got a ""where do we go from here"" at the end that covers purely technological solutions unrelated to legal incorporation.)

**Why?**

\- Asset protection and legal liability issues

\- Protection from censorship due to activities of increasingly hostile regimes

\- Redundancy of your system protections to ensure that you do not end up subject to malicious hacking and critical losses

**what does this post cover?**

1. The recent  OECD/G20 ""Framework on BEPS,"" by around 140 countries,
2. The remaining ability of cryptocurrency users to migrate assets to different jurisdictions, effectively without tax,
3. the importance of developing technological systems to counter increasingly hostile state actions from different parts of the globe.

&amp;#x200B;

1. In the first part, the recent OECD/G20 ""Framework on BEPS"" by around 140 countries basically means that many countries have signed onto a global minimum tax.  For some countries this really means nothing because they had already that minimum (of 15% or more), but for other countries they didn't, and now will be implementing 15%.  This then means that there are a more limited range of countries that are in fact zero tax, which I cover here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/q4k8y5/jurisdictional\_arbitrage\_is\_alive\_and\_well/](https://www.reddit.com/r/economy/comments/q4k8y5/jurisdictional_arbitrage_is_alive_and_well/)

**Current countries** [that do not have general corporate income tax](https://taxfoundation.org/publications/corporate-tax-rates-around-the-world/) and are not part of the 140 country [OECD/G20 Framework on BEPS](https://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/) (Note: The below list does not include countries which signed onto the OECD/G20 framework but retained low or no-tax zones in special areas of those countries. Such countries, like Georgia, or El Salvador (which has no capital gains tax on bitcoin, and is developing an area at the base of Vulcan Conchagua with no corporate tax, no sales tax, and no payroll tax), are not described below as this below list is intended only to describe completely no-tax countries that are not part of the OECD framework.) Essentially - these below countries are global winners, as people send assets away from the most hostile jurisdictions ([source](https://incorporations.io/)):

\- [Cayman Islands](https://incorporations.io/cayman-islands) (LLC or Exempted) (Note: Heightened scrutiny has been placed on Cayman Islands over the past year.)

\- Saint Barthelemy

\- Tokelau

\- Vanuatu (IC) -- (Note: Vanuatu has a [citizenship by investment program](https://www.globalcitizensolutions.com/vanuatu-citizenship-by-investment/) which historically has accepted bitcoin, since around 2017. [Some non-FATCA banks](http://non-fatca-banks.com/vu.html) may still be a possibility there. However, US persons looking for domestic financial accounts may wish to bank in Wyoming.

**I mentioned Wyoming above, because it is the state with the most favorable treatment for crypto users in the USA.  But it doesn't avoid the federal problems, unless your crypto is in an IRA or 401k.  However, there are more federal problems on the horizon that might cause further problems even for those of us who have been safely sitting with assets legally parked in the IRA.  Why?  Well, a variety of reasons, but please do yourself a favor and read this post for sure if you are a U.S. person:**   [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pqm1ba/new\_us\_crypto\_regulation\_far\_more\_invasive\_than/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pqm1ba/new_us_crypto_regulation_far_more_invasive_than/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

\- Wallis and Futuna

&amp;#x200B;

2) In this second part, I will explain here what it means to ""choose your jurisdiction"" for your assets in this day and age via incorporation.   When a person incorporates somewhere, they effectively are choosing their jurisdiction for any business bank account - or any other form of account, or address, [even if you wish to assign cryptocurrency XPUB or YPUB](https://help.coinpanda.io/en/articles/5512014-how-to-export-xpub-ypub-zpub-addresses-from-hd-wallets) (for example), that corresponds to that incorporated entity (LLC or other), as part of the business account.  But completely apart from this, it's important to realize that while there was an individual or individuals who created the corporation, **if the corporate entity itself (and the paperwork or online filings pertaining to it) are used to open an exchange account (corporate / business account) or financial account elsewhere,** ***the client (of the exchange or financial institution) is not the individual, but rather the corporate person which is represented by an entity in the jurisdiction where that entity was incorporated (the client is the corporate person)!***

There is nothing unlawful about using a corporation (such as a Vanuatu corp - for example) to open an exchange account somewhere.  **The corporate entity - the Vanuatu corp - then becomes the client of the exchange, and the legal jurisdiction that is operative is Vanuatu - not the place where the director / originator of the corp resides.  (This is also true of Wyoming LLCs or of any other corp formation anywhere else in the world, but I used Vanuatu here to drill the point home, because anyone in the world can establish a zero tax corporate setup if they want to.)** That assumes, of course, that it's a wholly new corporate entity unconnected to a corp in some high-tax area (for example, if some corp in Germany wanted to later have its directors and the German corporation incorporate in the Cayman Islands, this wouldn't be a good strategy because it's already linked back to the German company).  I've also commented on special considerations for people in California, USA who are looking for legal options to move their assets away from California-incorporated financial institutions after [AB 1402 was signed into law in California](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pzqc3t/the_sneak_bans_cometh_as_people_focused_on_us/) \- for those of you who fall into that category, [link here for some particular things you may need to consider](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/ntmzwu/there_are_potentially_huge_us_tax_and_reporting/h0u1gq7/). For those of you who live anywhere in the USA, [I also recommend you read Dan Held's post on crypto IRAs, here](https://www.theheldreport.com/p/how-to-pay-0-taxes-on-your-bitcoin). If choosing that route, a traditional IRA does offer a simple pathway to zero tax accumulation - assuming Congress doesn't screw that up, too, [which it could in the future as I point out here](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/q41zkn/comment/hfwf1f9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), so be forewarned, *everything has a risk*.

Special notes for Californians:

* Exemptions from California Law:
* Without excluding other activities that may not be considered to be transacting intrastate business in (California) within the meaning of California law, activities of a foreign limited liability company¬†that do not constitute transacting intrastate business¬†in (California) include (but are not limited to): (...) *Maintaining accounts in financial institutions.  (That is to say, if you have an corporate / business exchange or financial account which is established from, for example, a Wyoming LLC, IRA LLC of some sort, or Vanuatu corp (as some examples), or other corps outside of California, then the accounts in the financial institution(s) such as your exchange account which correspond to the LLC / corp, are not considered to be ""transacting intrastate business in California.""*

**So you understand, it doesn't matter if you are in Germany, or California, or wherever. If you incorporate in Vanuatu (as an example), and didn't start with an incorporation in some other more restrictive jurisdiction, there's no ""top up tax"" that Germany or any other country can apply.** The jurisdictions I mentioned above are in fact not part of the 140 country OECD/G20 Framework on BEPS, and don't have general income tax (Vanuatu, to my knowledge, does not even have a hard-line income tax treaty with the United States, though it does have a certain amount of FATCA banks inside the country -  Vanuatu has signed tax information exchange agreements with Australia, Denmark, the Faroe Islands, Finland, France, Greenland, Grenada, Iceland, Ireland, Korea (Republic of), New Zealand, Norway, San Marino and Sweden.  Along with other offshore jurisdictions, and in response to OECD and FATF pressure, Vanuatu has taken measures to control money laundering.  Vanuatu does not have an embassy in Washington, DC, but has a mission to the United Nations in New York.)

3) In this third and final part of this post, I'll reiterate what I've said before.  **We really as a community need to focus on the technological solution**.  States / jurisdictions are becoming more desperate, their grasp on reality and monetary systems (and everything for that matter) is weakening - not strengthening.  So - legal solutions such as those I mentioned in points one and two above are helpful, but we really need to refocus and redouble the technological.  The ""why"" is the same as mentioned above:  - Asset protection and legal liability issues, Protection from censorship due to activities of increasingly hostile regimes, and Redundancy of system protections to ensure that you do not end up subject to malicious hacking and critical losses.  Basically, enhancing protection of people around the globe.  Did I also mention, basic privacy protections?  That's another.

Areas where we need to improve / do better:

\- Considering where we can support open source developers who are pushing the envelope, no matter where they are in the world

\- More systems (no matter what they are, exchanges, wallets, whatever) incorporating multisignature and making it dead simple for people to utilize in the UI/UX.  [Example of some multisignature services that have been around](https://multisigtools.com/multisignature/easy-and-secure-multisignature-setups/).

\- Transitioning to [blockchain services that rely in part or wholly on Low Earth Orbit based systems](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/paixdr/blockchain_in_space_whats_going_on_4_years_after/) (departure from earth based / terrene jurisdictions)

\- Performing further development of decentralized exchange interfaces, systems, or markets (akin to Bisq / Bisq DAO, OpenBazaar / HavenPrivacy (deprecated/discontinued), or similar) - I really enjoyed thee\_wolf's design (if he's reading)

\- DeFi being translated to mobile apps allowing people to create multiple listings similar to eBay (and at their option spin up drop shipping services)

\- Interoperability everywhere: [Cross-chain atomic swaps](https://articles.whalesheaven.com/what-are-cross-chain-atomic-swaps/) on more or most wallets as a standard

\- Lightning (L2) option everywhere in-wallet where bitcoin is an option

These technological options will certainly help the progress of crypto, moving it further into the hands of more mobile users across the globe and will reduce the likelihood that a growing number of users can be hindered from its use by increasingly hostile governments.

I got my first part time job in September (getting paid minimum wage of $13), and began looking into how to make the most out of my money. Compound interest seemed to be popular advice for teenagers, so I tried to plug my information into this calculator: [https://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/compound-interest-calculator](https://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/compound-interest-calculator)

&amp;#x200B;

According to the [results](https://imgur.com/a/WZxwh5Y) (less blurry picture without graph [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/zs62YKV)), I would only have made around 6,000 dollars off of interest by the time I hope to retire in 44 years. For reference, I use Capitol One and put my APY of 0.30 when it asked for my estimated interest rate.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted to verify if these results were correct. If so, are there any better ways that I could use my money?

personalfinance,How to fix the financial mess I‚Äôve gotten myself into,"So, my finances have been in a sorry state essentially from the time I was old enough to have my own finances. I was never taught anything about how to manage money, and quickly got into a lot of debt. This started at the age of 18. I have been ignoring the worsening situation ever since. I am now 20 And would like to fix my situation, but I don‚Äôt even know where to start. Here is what has happened so far: 

- $76 worth of credit card debt, account was closed by creditor. Haven‚Äôt been sent to collections on it as far as I know.
- $5000 private student loan, creditkarma says it was charged off as bad debt. I assume this means I‚Äôll be hearing from collection at some point, but it has been almost a year so I‚Äôm starting to wonder.
- $3750 federal student loan, currently in good standing. 

-$7000 past due to the university, I‚Äôve been making payments as I can. Contacted them this week to see if I can do a payment plan, but it‚Äôs been a while so they probably will send me to collections. 

My income is under $20,000 per year, I do work full time. I don‚Äôt know if I should file for bankruptcy at this point or get a debt consolidation loan, or if there are other options that would be better. I made a lot of dumb choices that I regret, and I‚Äôd like to turn that around, but at this point I feel like I‚Äôve dug the hole too deep. Any advice would be appreciated.

Edit: I‚Äôd like to add that the employment I currently have is pretty much the best I can get in my area at the moment. I didn‚Äôt finish college, so my job options are a bit limited.",finance
financialindependence,Is leveraged investing in ETFs recommended?,"Hello,

I am in my mid 30s in Canada and thinking of leveraged investing. Specifically, plan is to borrow $100k from bank using line of credit at interest rate of 2.2% (able to get this rate as I am a physician) and invest in a well diversified ETF of 80%stocks and 20% bonds such as Ishares AOA which is expected to give returns of 7-10% per year in long term. I can afford the $2200 per year of interest charges. Have no problem with buy and hold strategy, so will continue to hold the ETF during the downturns. Would you recommend this strategy and is this a good way to generate wealth and reach financial independence sooner? I am still learning about this strategy and I am starting to prefer this over real estate investing as it's much less work and hands-off. Real estate has given returns of 15-30% in canada over last decade but it's much more work. Thanks for reading.",finance
personalfinance,What to do with inherited money?,"A close friend passed and left me a lot of money. $63k to be exact. I'm not exactly sure what I should do. Some background, I own a home, Mortgage is $2500 a month. I have a $28k debt consolidation loan out which is charging me ~$15%, monthly payments are $900. I have a car loan out, ~$35k @2.5% payments are 600. I don't have an emergency fund saved up yet. I am investing  at my job (fed employee, so TSP) I'll be maxing out starting next year. All other CCs are paid and I have no other debt. Wife on the other hand has student loans. 

So, I'm first going to immediately pay off the debt consolidation loan, 15% is too much. What should I do with the remaining. I can pay off the car, which would give me the opportunity to be essential debt free, with the exception of my wife's school loans, and give me additional passive income of $1500 a month. I can keep the remainder of the money, after paying the debt loan as my emergency fund and use the additional $900 a month to throw at the principal and pay the car down faster... I can go on, but I just don't know what's the most logical from a PF standpoint.

49. One of Cardano‚Äôs biggest competitors is once again suffering network problems. This time it started out as just being characterized as (more) ‚Äúinstability‚Äù, then they started saying that something had caused the blockchain to ‚Äústart forking‚Äù. This followed their September 2 ‚Äúinstability‚Äù and ‚Äúperformance degradation‚Äù event. It‚Äôll be interesting to see how well their community tolerates this in the future if it‚Äôs happening with their planned slashing model in effect.

61. After the Senate hearing on Tuesday September 14th, Gary Gensler (SEC Chairman) gave a quote to a crypto publication indicating that custodial lending and possibly even staking platforms might be considered securities.

CryptoCurrency,"The Ribbon VC gaming fiasco and expose shows why traditional financial systems must move to transparent blockchains, instead of opaque databases.","Ribbon Finance TL DR: A VC tried to game the protocol, made away with millions... but got caught via blockchain analysis done by the community members. To save their face, the VC returned all the funds the siphoned off via unethical practices. 

What is amazing is that the whole incident starting from the investigation to expose to return of funds and apology letter took just 12 hours or less. No months of investigation, no months of trial and jury shit. 

The implications of this are huge. It shows that blockchain systems are inherently transparent when compared with TradFi systems. For example, its being alleged that hedge funds are naked shorting companies on Nasdaq, but even though its illegal, its hard to find proof because most of the information is not available to the public. Retail investigators are showing evidence of manipulation in OI, showing evidence that the number of shares shorted is greater than the total shares issued by the company.. but without access to transactional information, it is impossible to find out who is doing these trades.

However on a blockchain, every transaction is an immutable public record. All it takes is couple of people going through the blockchain to identify suspicious transactions. 

If people could see transactional information, such as who is naked shorting stocks, it would blow the door wide open and bring transparency to the capital markets. 

In Traditional markets, the SEC has often said they are understaffed when it comes to preventing manipulation by large hedge funds and institutions. The public doesnt have any real evidence to show the hedge funds are manipulating markets, because the transactions are hidden under layers of secrecy provided by banks, brokers, exchanges and even offshore entities. It is virtually impossible for a retail user to find evidence of manipulation and fraud, because it is so well concealed away from public eyes. People have to rely on the SEC and other agencies to find evidence, and prosecute wrong doings. 

If all the transactions were stored as a public record, it will become easy for people to find evidence of large players manipulating markets in their favor. One of the SEC's stated goals is to promote transparency in financial and capital markets. There is no better way to do this, than to implement all capital markets via a transparent blockchain system.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,"$30,000~ in debt after college. Went for REPAYE plan. Received letter from Fedloan claiming that based off my family's income, my monthly payment is $0.00. How do I handle this?","Like I said above, I went to college for five years and racked up $30,000 or so in student debt. Never had to take out private loans, my family was in a lower income bracket that could maximize on FAFSA and grant money. Here are the details:

* Figuring out repayment has been a little daunting, but I decided to go for REPAYE because I wanted to take the avalanche method on and pay off as soon as I'm able. I do not like having any debt on my name whatsoever, and would rather make the minimum payments while biding my time for the big payoff.


* I recieved a packet from them on 10/7 listing all my loans and their interest rates, which vary from 2.75% to 5.05%. ~$22,000 in Subsidized Loans, ~$8,000 in Unsubsidized Loans, all federal.

This also included a chart that looks like so:

**Repayment Plan Details**: REVISED PAY AS YOU EARN


Number of Payments | Payment Amount | Payment Start Date
---|---|----
12 | $0.00 | 12/23/2021
120 | $325.92 | 12/23/2022

* I don't recall ever signing up for a forbearance on the loans, so this seems a little odd that I suddenly have an additional year's head start to pay these off. Knowing the federal moratorium on student loan interest ends in January, it conflicts a bit with what I've come to know about the situation so far. Unsure whether or not the two are related.


* I recieved a second letter that same day, reiterating that income documentation and family size were used to determine this sum, that I'd have a monthly payment of $0.00, as well as these lines here:

 * ""Your new monthly payment amount is effective for all payments due between 12/23/2021 and 12/01/2022.""

 * ""Since you are currently on a deferment or forbearance, you are not due to make your first IDR payment on 12/23/2021. 
You are not responsible to make payments until your deferment or forbearance ends. If you can make your monthly 
payments towards forgiveness now, contact us.""

At this point I don't exactly know what's going on. My questions are as follows:

1. Did my loan officer set this up for me based on my income, or is this based off of the current student loan moratorium? 

1. When the moratorium ends in January, will interest begin to capitalize on these loans again, across all of 2022, even if the monthly payments are marked at $0.00? 

1. Is it possible I'm really going to be insulated from monthly payments for the whole year, or am I getting my hopes up?

CryptoCurrency,Describing crypto is layman's terms,"So I was trying to tell me friend who knows nothing about crypto about it and realized I don't think I have a good way of describing it to the every day person. Can you guys give me some feedback on how I'm describing it to him?

**Blockchain:** Basically allows for full transparency transactions by giving an ID number to every transaction. 

**Defi:** decentralized finance; basically the opposite of the us fed. whereas they control inflation, print money supply, etc., in defi there is no one governing body and and the global market controls price fluctuations

**Crypto**: compared to stocks where you're supporting a company, crypto coins are kind of like software/applications that you support. unlike stocks you don't need to buy a whole unit of a coin in order to invest. you can also pull your money out at any time and the market never closes

personalfinance,Cash out refi vs. HELOC,"Curious to hear thoughts on this. 

My home is valued at $1.3 - $1.5m. I owe $650k. I was going to pull a HELOC and buy a value add investment property, and then pay back the HELOC before two years with a cash out refi on the new property's ARV (after repair value).

Bank wants to charge me $3k do full appraisal and will cap HELOC at $250k.

Why WOULDN'T I just so a cash out refi and pull out $390k? My payment goes up on the existing property roughly $1700 but it will become a rental anyway and even when this this, will cash flow some (not as much based on the current payment and mortgage balance). 

Am I missing something? What am I not seeing here? I know closing costs are higher on a cash out refi AND the new interest rate will be higher than current (which is 2.5% fixed).

I don't NEED the full $390k but that's alot of equity to have sitting and not able to full access. But a HELOC would keep my existing payment low.

personalfinance,Debt Consolidation: Worth it or Expensive Gimmick?,"So my husband and I are in deep shit with our credit card debt.

It's not solely his fault, but this is just the catalyst that pushed us over the edge of now not being able to afford our bills each month.

Is debt consolidation even worth it? According to NerdWallet, our combined debt and interest is $14,073.61 at 17.22%.  Throughout all this, my credit score has taken a complete nosedive and I just don't know if we'll be able to get an APR that makes it save us any money!

gaming,What a tough but rewarding game.,"Hey guys and gals i wanted to share this with you. i know it's a long post and i'm sorry if it's not the normal for this subreddit but i really just thought that you all may enjoy it.  


This is a sunrise in a game called the long dark. This game if you aren't aware is survival. It's not zombie survival as is common but pure on you versus nature survival with the occasional wolf pack thrown in (and a bear but that's besides the point) but at heart it's all about finding ways to survive in sub 0C weather usually hovering around -13C or so marooned in some northen Canada woods. You have to find food water clothing heat and find ways to sleep without freezing to death or being eaten or just falling down a breaking a bone or something like that all while contending with not so high stamina and weight limits that affect the above mentioned stats.    


You have to understand that this isn't the type of game i play. I do a wide variety of games but never pure me versus nature and what a adjustment period it was. Thankfully the idea of rationing out water and food isn't something to understand. I'm playing on the story mode which is the easiest of them and even without being attacked i'm having issues just surviving each night. I think i'm ready but the game laughs at me and throws a curveball at me.     


This picture was taken after a night full of heavy windstorms -20C low food while dealing with low stamina and exhastion and not being able to see more than a few feet in front of me because of how damned dark it can get. I spent the night running looking at my map every minute making sure i didn't get lost while praying that my guy didn't pass out from the exhaustion. I just barely made it to a roofed area with a stove to warm up and to cook food on. So close like i could barely see a thin sliver on the sleep bar. It was the single most stressful experience of my life much higher than being stalked by a bear or wolves or any other style game. Fuck that bear by the way. I won't spoil why but that bear can go fuck off to the deepest pit of hell.   


After spending the night stabilizing i step out and see this. I can't describe the feeling i had. It's like the game knew what i just went through and wanted to treat me and what a treat it was. In all my life of gaming (29 years) i've never felt something like that. I never knew i could enjoy a video game sunset so much. It's a sense of accomplishment like no other.  I just started story 3 and i can honestly say i'm excited to see what the game will throw at me. After surviving that night i honestly think i'm ready. If you haven't played this and even have the slighest interest in surviving with your own wits you really need to.   i hope you enjoyed my little ramble. Like i said i have no idea why i wanted to type this just.. felt like sharing.

So I am about to go to grad school soon, and the price tag will run me between 70k and 110k, depending on the program. (Still trying to decide). Obviously I would need to take out loans. My question is this; I have one credit card and my credit score is solid at about 750. I know that I need more lines of credit, but I also know that opening a new card will TEMPORARILY lower my score due to the average age of my credit accounts dropping from about 4 years to 2 (at least I think it‚Äôs 2 based on my math), which would be a detriment to my credit score. Would it be wise to open a new card prior to my loans or to wait until I get them? I would be applying federal before private obviously. Thanks for the Advice!",finance

personalfinance,Opportunity Cost vs Paying Student Loan Off,"Hi all, been in love with this community. Is my math and thought process wrong?  

I have a student loan of 100k at 3.05% with Laurel Road 30 year Fixed. I keep 20k cash in their checking to keep the interest rate at 3.05%  for minimum payments.  

So I really have a opportunity cost of 80k.

Over 30 years with a average inflation rate of 2.5% from 2021 -&gt; 2051 assumptively $1.00 in 2021 might equal $2.00 in 2051 at the end of my 30 year fixed. With this is mind it will completely destroy my student loan. Plus my minimum monthly payments also eroding principle. 

Opportunity Cost of 80k at a conservative 5% return yearly over 30 years is $345,755.39.

With this in mind and within this model does it make sense for me to never pay off my student loan? or is my thought process or math wrong ? I understand this is assumptive of inflation rate and return rates.

investing,Servicing the debt in the raising interest rates scenario,"In recent years there‚Äôs been a change in the way investors, economists and officials think about public borrowing. They‚Äôve become less interested in the debt‚Äôs size, and more focused on what it costs. With occasional hops and bounces, [30 years treasury yields](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ETYX?p=%5ETYX) have been on a pretty steady decline since 1985, which makes borrowing ever-cheaper. 

Treasury secretary Yellen said that even though the amount of debt relative to the economy has risen, the interest burden - the amount the Treasury pays to service its debt - has not, due to lower interest rates.

[If it were possible to take interest rates into negative territory I would be voting for that.](https://www.azquotes.com/quote/711345) \- Janet Yellen, ""Why Gold Is Unstoppable"" by Doug French, [www.caseyresearch.com](https://www.caseyresearch.com). March 19, 2014.

On the other hand, Michael Burry is betting that interest rates are about to go up.

Let's assume FED raises interest rates, that brings up the question: How are we gonna service the debt if borrowing costs get increasingly more expensive? It seems like a debt death spiral - the more expensive borrowing is, the more debt you need to take to service it.

CryptoCurrency,Idea for how our crypto ways make a more secure gov voting,"So basically with a cold wallet like a Ledger you can get coins all day long into your wallet. But to move them out, accept contracts, or almost anything else you need the hardware wallet in hand. And on hardware wallets like the ledger you must do given things to accept. So it isn't enough to just have it plug in. You have to hit buttons and review what you're OK.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my idea. 

1. The gov could issue free hardware wallets to its citizens. This wallet only works with the gov system. Each wallet obviously has a unique ID and just like now you can look up anything on the given chain. Which means you can verify if your vote is like it should be.
   1. Since the gov is issuing them out. They can keep track of what address is for what person. So if a problem happens then they can easily fix it. Also because wallet addresses are random. You don't have to worry about someone doing something to you based on how you voted.
   2. If there is something in play like you can't vote because you broke some rule. Then the gov could block your wallet from the vote. And if this is federally controlled. Places like the USA giving you officially moved voting in multiple states illegally will be impossible and you can only vote in your new state. If you haven't officially moved then it's the old state. But it is how the law is written now anyways and it protects the system from people voting in multiple states.
2. You can vote at home giving you have an internet connection or at a location like now. If you vote from home then the hardware wallet could even have something preloaded which takes you automatically to the site. 
   1. During the vote the thing can be on the computer screen and the hardware wallet will run through each choice with you and you have to approve it 1 by 1. Or you just run through the entire thing on the hardware wallet and approve it 1 by 1. IMO having it on the screen and running confirming each choice 1 by 1 on the wallet is the better way to go. (similar to how you accept contracts on a wallet today)
   2. If the person can't vote due to disability, no access to the net, or whatever. Same thing can happen now and a special gov wallet could be used to allow those people to vote. But there should be extra measures so no funny business is happening.
   3. Chances are a location would be the smartest thing since you can do an ID check, but since many places don't have this now .......
3. Other than anything that has to be mailed in due to 2 2, results should be instant.

Now if something goes wrong like someone wants to change their vote what should happen giving it is within the current/future rules is since your ID matches with you. You need to simply vote again and it will overwrite your vote.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Explanation on why if interest rates are low, taking out a loan for car is better if you invest difference?","Hello,

I have heard this idea thrown around in the sub. But I‚Äôm not sure I fully understand it. 


I think the idea is this. Let‚Äôs say you are going to buy a new car. Assumption 1. 
Assumption 2, S&amp;P 500 will grow at 7%. 
Assumption 3, your new car loan is 2% APR.
These are not outlandish assumptions. 

I have heard it thrown around that you are better off taking out the car loan and investing the difference in the s and p 500. 


But I‚Äôm not too sure I follow? Or maybe the i am not remembering the situation.

Like let‚Äôs I have 1K leftover each month after expenses and such. Now, let‚Äôs say I want to buy a 25K car. Monthly payments at 3% will run you at 449 leaving you with 551 each month and you can invest the difference. 

But if you just save instead for 5 years 416 you can buy the car in cash and you can vest 584 each month instead of 551. 


Can anyone explain how this better leverage of debt works to someone still new to this world?

personalfinance,Cash out refinance and options after? (Virginia),"Hello everyone, thanks in advance for any and all help, I truly appreciate it and need some advice on a couple things.

First half:

Situation is, my father wants to take out a cash out refinance on a townhouse bought 6 years ago bought for 165k and now priced around 250-270k with an interest rate of 4.25% about 140k left on mortgage.. 

He makes 60k, credit score 790-94, about 10-15k roughly in savings down know exactly. 
He wants to cash out on 25-30k on the refinance and the mortgage company we currently have said it‚Äôs doable w increase of mortgage to 176k, 3.25-3.75% interest, 30 years, and decrease of 130$ on mortgage payment. We haven‚Äôt priced around because he is a TPS recipient and are worried ab lenders being skeptical. So we thought let‚Äôs just stay w the people that we already do business.

Is this a good deal? I‚Äôm not too worried about this as we want to do this for sure he wants to spend it on some home improvements and to start his business. He wants to rent it out to family members and get a single family home.

Second Part:

He worries that getting a second mortgage is not possible on his own and he said it‚Äôs possible for me and him to do so together. We thought about me being the main signer and him being the co-signer. He‚Äôs 46, I‚Äôm a soon to be 21 community college student, 730 credit score and 2 year history. Just recently started work full time and will be making about 28k. 350$ on credit cards, 5k in savings, and about 4k in stocks and crypto. 

Would like to go for something 350-399k home. I live w my parents and I plan to stay for a good while as I will be helping him start and operate his business. He will be paying te majority of the mortgage as he does now.

Is this possible and something that could be done? How should we go about doing something of that sort? If so, how long can we do this after the refinance?

Feel free to ask any further questions I‚Äôll be active as much as I can. TIA",finance

personalfinance,Is a 529 still advantageous if any of your planned beneficiaries don‚Äôt end up having qualified expenses? (MA),"Hi everyone,

Was looking into starting up a 529 for my child (MA UFUND 529). I did read that any withdrawal for non-qualified expenses is subject to federal income tax and 10% penalty.

Assuming I or anyone else I would assign as the beneficiary did not have qualified expenses for the 529, would I have been better off just investing in a traditional investment account not subject to those penalties? Admittedly I have not yet at the moment done a deep dive into the math of it all.

46. A Weiss Crypto analyst calls the smart contract launch an alleged event and also doesn‚Äôt realize we already have NFTS. The Cardano community was quick to correct the analyst.

49. One of Cardano‚Äôs biggest competitors is once again suffering network problems. This time it started out as just being characterized as (more) ‚Äúinstability‚Äù, then they started saying that something had caused the blockchain to ‚Äústart forking‚Äù.

It‚Äôll be interesting to see how well their community tolerates this in the future if it‚Äôs happening with their planned slashing model in effect.

55. Now one of Cardano‚Äôs most highly visible critics is implying that the Cardano community has something in common with anti-vaxxers.

61. After the Senate hearing on Tuesday September 14th, Gary Gensler (SEC Chairman) gave a quote to a crypto publication indicating that custodial lending and possibly even staking platforms might be considered securities.

personalfinance,Advice Needed - What to do with nest egg,"Hi all.. I'm overwhelmed as to what to do with a large amount of cash I have saved. I've been normally keeping it in Ally Bank and getting about 0.05% interest, but I also have a Fidelity account and I'm thinking to move it into their cash management fund. However, I want something as risk free as a savings account to put it in. I am older so I just want something that will make a better interest rate than a savings account, but won't move down really. I'm already contributing to a 401k at work, up to the max matching amount. \~6%

I've been looking at say SPRXX, but I am really confused about the ""expense ratios"". I.e. this fund is in treasury bonds, but it looks like it has a 0.01% gain over a year, but it also has a net expense ratio of 0.25%.

&amp;#x200B;

Does that mean if I put my money in that, not only would I be making less than Ally Bank at 0.05%, but I'll be losing money after the net expense ratio? I.e. 0.01% - 0.25% = 0.24% loss

I just want to do the right thing with my nest egg and put it somewhere safe but still liquid! For this money I just want it to be for emergency fund. I have other money in 401k's and other funds to make $$.

personalfinance,Best way to buy a new car with plenty of cash on hand (details included)?,"My wife and I will be moving from a city center (where we only need one car, which is fully paid off) to an area where we will need two cars. We are looking to buy a new car once we move. We are looking at cars with a price range of 35-45K. Combined incomes will be \~230K/year (pre-tax). We will be very happy to put down \~20K for a new car, but depending on how long we wait to buy, we could potentially buy the car in cash (we are expecting to have \~35-40K cash on hand within the next 6-12 months).

With all of this in mind, what is the best way to buy a new car? If we can, should we buy it in cash? If we can get a really low interest rate with financing (I am assuming low is 0-1.9%), should we take advantage of the low interest rate and only put 15-20K down? If we could get 0% interest rate on a special financing, should we put even less money down? Any other tips or advice for buying a new car?

FYI, we are not ones to want to get a new car every couple of years. If we buy a new car, we will plan to keep it at least 7 years, so we want something that is new and has nice features that will make for a comfortable drive for many years to come. I currently own a 2014 mitsubishi outlander sport that was purchased in 2014 (only about 43,000 miles, so it is still in pretty good shape).

CryptoCurrency,Over 60% of crypto investors borrow money to fund investments! Over 70% 18-24 year olds are using credit for crypto... 3% are even RE-MORTGAGING THEIR HOMES! Dear lord do not do this...,"A large number of investors actually borrowed money or used existing credit facilities to purchase cryptocurrencies rather than using income and/or savings. ¬†

Overall, more than two thirds (64%) of those who have invested in cryptos, used one or more credit facilities to do so. ¬†

Overall, more than two thirds (64%) of those who have invested in cryptos, used one or more credit facilities to do so.

Percentage of crypto investors who used one or more credit facilities to fund purchase, by age

18 - 24: 70%25 - 34: 64%35 - 44: 68.9%45 - 54: 62.5%55 - 64: 45%65+: 25%

As the data shows, those aged between 18 and 24 were the age group most likely to use borrowed funds to make their investment, with a significant drop of borrowers in the two highest age groups.

What type of credit facilities have people used to fund cryptocurrency investments?

When we break down what kinds of credit facilities people have used to purchase cryptocurrencies, over a third (35.5%) made their investment using a credit card. Almost a fifth (19.3%) funded the purchase out of their overdraft.

Credit card: 35.5%Overdraft: 19.3%Personal loan: 14.6%Secured loan: 9%Payday loan: 7.6%Re-mortgage: 3.3%

&amp;#x200B;

Although cryptos, and specifically Bitcoin, have seen people make thousands or even millions in profit; they are incredibly volatile and can see investors losing massive percentages of what they put in very quickly.

It‚Äôs concerning that so many people have turned to borrowed funds to purchase cryptocurrencies as they are incredibly volatile and offer no guarantees that the money invested will be returned. So, if people are spending money that they don‚Äôt have, and losing it, this could cause some serious financial challenges later down the line.

The biggest concern is whether people will have the ability to pay the money back. With a very strong possibility of losing the money for good, people may be left severely out of pocket and racking up interest on their credit cards and overdrafts. Also, some credit card providers will view this type of transaction as a cash advance, meaning a cash advance fee and higher interest rate will be applied.

So, if you are thinking of making an investment into cryptocurrencies, you should only invest an amount of money that you can afford to lose and it should be funded through income and/or savings rather than a credit facility.

Borrowing money to invest in cryptos can become a very vicious cycle that‚Äôs difficult to break. Once you start losing money, it can be very tempting to invest more to make the money back; especially if you don‚Äôt have other means of paying the money back.

The interest rate is about is about 6-7% on them (not sure if it matters why but I think it is because they are graduate school loans).  

I currently make 190k/year before taxes so I am in a decent position to pay this off. With the student loan interest being frozen, I haven‚Äôt been making any payments because they aren‚Äôt due yet and I‚Äôm not accruing interest.

However, I have been working for about a year at my previously salary of 175k, and instead of doing anything with the money I just have saved up close to six figures.

The situation is stressing me out which is partially why I haven‚Äôt done anything even tho I know it‚Äôs a waste to do nothing with money.

I basically just would like to know if there‚Äôs a general consensus about the proper allocation of income to debt and investments for someone like me with immense student loan debt and with my income.

(PAYWALL)

From the Article:

Recent revelations and scrutiny from Congress over Facebook's(FB) role in society  could lead to major lawsuits against the social-media giant, according to new  research that drew comparisons with litigation faced by Big Tobacco or Purdue  Pharma. 

Facebook (FB) has been  under pressure following a series of reports by The Wall Street  Journal that made allegations covering Instagram's impact on teenagers'  mental health, whether its algorithm encouraged social discord, and how it  moderates elites. 

A company whistleblower who leaked internal documents to the Journal also  testified before Congress last week, as lawmakers turned their  attention to the renewed public debate over Facebook's(FB) prominent role in peoples' lives. 

Facebook (FB) co-founder  and CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week said that ""many of the claims  don't make any sense,"" pushing back against allegations that arose in the  Journal's reports and the whistleblower's testimony, in a post on social  media. 

Blair Levin, an analyst at London-based technology industry research  group New Street Research, wrote Sunday that "" while we have been  skeptical that past revelations would lead to government action, we think this  time is different and as a result, we think Facebook(FB) may now face a similar challenge from  increased litigation as tobacco, or more recently, OxyContin."" 

Levin served as chief of staff to the chair of the Federal  Communications Commission in the 1990s. 

The analyst said that while the facts and damages are different for Facebook(FB) than those faced by  the tobacco industry or Purdue Pharma -- the maker of opioid medication  OxyContin -- the fundamental legal framework is the same. 

There is a product with problematic consequences for many people, management  knowledge of such, and actions by management ""that not only failed to mitigate  the harm but arguably increased those problematic consequences,"" Levin said. 

In the same way that public outcry against tobacco and opioid makers led to  massive class action and state attorneys general-led lawsuits, Levin said the  recent revelations against Facebook(FB) creates similar incentives to bring  litigation against the company. 

While Facebook(FB) has  faced scrutiny before, there is far more attention on the company this time, in  part because of the role that harms to children plays in the recent allegations,  Levin noted. 

""Discovery is likely to yield even more problematic evidence for Facebook(FB), and the dynamics  create an opportunity for a settlement that would address the issues more  quickly than legislation,"" Levin said. ""We think litigation is likely to be more  damaging to Facebook(FB)  than legislation.""

Qqq has significantly outperformed SPY/VOO in the last 10 years with around 22% each year while the latter returns with around 16%. 

Some believe tech will be still be dominant as they are the future of the world as usual, yet they have too much gains already that some claimed it might slow down in the next 10 years, esp with ‚Äúovervalued valuation‚Äù. While 16% is excellent each year by S and P 500 but didnt perform as well as nasdaq.

Yet some believe we will be seeing taper and higher fed rate soon where the cost of borrowing will be higher, thus less creative or world changing companies might appear, which might hit Nasdaq more than us think. Since S and P track more companies than Nasdaq, will it be a better invesment than qqq in the next 10 year? Especially with higher interest rates benefiting financial sectors like banks. And mid-small cap might be more explosive and game changing since companies like Apple or Microsoft are already very big so might we expect the growth to slow down?

Budget is on thinner margins than I'm used to, but we're still able to have funds to allocate at the end of every month.

I've been using the Prime Directive to guide my family into a more comfortable and safe financial situation. I currently have 1.5 months of living costs socked away in an emergency fund, and a separate smaller fund for home improvements. Major appliances, including the furnace, are new. I got my partner and I cleared of all high-interest debt before we closed so now it's just lower interest expenses, being my car (5%, not worth refinancing after looking into it) and student loans (3.5%, recently refinanced)

With interest rates being so low on savings, does it make sense to prioritize building out that emergency fund more over paying down the car, or even looking into investments? Right now, my ""high yield savings account"" is at .5%. It really just feels like money depreciating, especially since we have about $40k in credit line available (now) and keep those accounts active by putting fixed monthly expenses on them and paying the balance each month.

With our margins being so much lower, I want to make sure I squeeze the utility out of every dollar that comes our way. Is it really worth saving an extra $10k to sit when we both have stable jobs with a decent wage?",finance

My average total monthly housing cost is $400. Recently I got a second roommate, and my housing costs dropped down to about $280/month. However, this new roommate is severely impacting my life in negative ways. I'm looking to move.

There are a few single apartments in undesirable locations. It's fair to assume I will not be moving into a different apartment complex. Also, I currently live in an undesirable location.

Most houses in my desired location are about $2000 in taxes and I assume about $1000 for insurance annually. That's $3000/12 = $250/month. Tack on snow shoveling and cutting grass, regular maintenance, that's about equal to the cost of renting.

Examining my past year's expenses and expenditures from Mint, I net about $36k in savings annually. (This is not an ad for Mint.) I currently have $40k in savings, $40k growing in retirement/investments and a health savings account. Using Excel, my budget to pay off a house in two years if...

1. living alone: $100k house
2. one roommate: $112k house
3. two roommates: $125k house

&gt;As far as the financial value, houses  are long term investments. If you keep buying and selling in short  periods of time, fees and taxes will erase a lot of the profits. Short  term swings in local housing markets even out over time, so you smooth  out the risk the longer you stay.

I can have roommates on a month-to-month lease, and have the house sit on the market at and after two years to wait. Even if it doesn't sell, I could just get another roommate to replace me and have a property management company fix and maintain the house.

&gt;Buying will almost always be better  than renting in most cases - your monthly payment will go further,  you'll build equity vs building someone else's equity, and real estate  is one of the few physical assets that actually appreciate in value over  time.

&gt;Buying pros: mortgage/monthly  payments go into equity which you can get back when you sell the house.  
&gt;  
&gt;Buying  cons: expensive, lots of little costs, responsible for house upkeep,  stuck in the property if the value of the house plummets. More  money/month than what you thing  
&gt;  
&gt;Renting  pros: Management is mostly responsible for the upkeep of the property,  and you pay no property tax. You can move after your lease expires.  Cheaper than a house. Utilities are generally cheaper due to smaller  living space.  
&gt;  
&gt;Renting cons: None of the money goes into equity.

&gt;get rid of the mindset that owning a house is paying yourself while  renting is paying someone else. Building equity is a small part of your  total housing costs as a homeowner. Other costs like mortgage interest,  property taxes, homeowners insurance, and upkeep also permanently  ""leave your pocket.""  
&gt;  
&gt;As a general rule, it's a good idea to buy when  
&gt;  
&gt;(1) You've  got at least 15-20% of the value of the house saved up to cover a \~10%  downpayment, closing costs, and have a large emergency fund to cover the  inevitable costs of things needing to be fixed/replaced in the home.  (Looks like you've still got a way to go to reach this)  
&gt;  
&gt;(2) You  plan to keep the property for at least 5 years. Anything less, and the  one-time costs of buying and selling (realtor commissions, inspection  fees, etc) will more than eat up any equity or savings you've  accumulated. (This may or may not be the case for you)

&gt;Basically, if you plan to move in a few years, then renting makes more  sense.  It is a lot easier to move from an apartment when your lease is  up versus selling a house, which can be subject to fluctuations in the  real-estate market.  As an example, during the real estate bubble, a lot  of ""young professional"" types bought condos and town homes instead of  renting.  Now these people are married with kids, need to move somewhere  bigger, but they can't get rid of their old place because they can't  sell it for what they still owe.  If these people had rented for a few  years, they would be in a better position financially.  (Many people  fell for the mantra ""If you are renting, you are throwing your money  away"", without looking at the long-term implications.)

&gt;  
&gt;\- That 9% stock market return is taxable income (which eats into your  effective return), whereas the mortgage interest is a tax deduction.

Interest rate is currently **2**.625% for the loan I'm pre-approved for. Closing costs from two different banks are estimated to be $1500 and $2500. My pre-approval will expire in a few months.

A friend mentioned taking out a loan for themselves (even though they don't really need it) because interest rates are so low. They are averaging 8% with their investment portfolio.

I also recently discovered rent from tenants/roommates counts as earned income. This can be added to health savings account (HSA) contributions. If the maximum contribution $3600/year or $300/month, my HSA could easily be maximized. I'm not sure on how that works exactly. The income that goes into my bank accounts is already taxed...

Anyway, from all this information, **it seems** like I should buy a house within my budget (including furnace/ roof/ remodeling costs). What are your thoughts?",finance

CryptoCurrency,How the disappointing U.S. unemployment rate could be positive for crypto,"In terms of the economy, most countries are beginning to make a reasonable recovery from the downturn caused by the coronavirus. Until recently, this was also the case in the United States. However, the [latest unemployment figures](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/08/economy/september-jobs-report/index.html) paint a different picture.

&amp;#x200B;

Those figures are namely disappointing and the expected recovery is not forthcoming. A development from which crypto can benefit in the short term. To understand this, we will first discuss the important role of unemployment as an indicator of the economy. Once we get past that, we'll make the link to crypto and the possible positive impact this negative development in the United States could have for the crypto price.

&amp;#x200B;

**Unemployment and the Economy**

Figures related to unemployment are generally seen as an important means of measuring the state of affairs within an economy. How many jobs does the economy currently have? Are more jobs being added or lost? What percentage of the population is currently without a job? These and more questions are regularly compiled in reports to determine the health of the economy in question.

&amp;#x200B;

A positive trend in terms of unemployment is an indication for foreign investors to invest in an economy. After all, a growing job market means that the population has more money to spend, and rising consumption is often good news for businesses.

&amp;#x200B;

In response to an economy and job market that stumbles, countries often reach for the money printer resulting in inflation. We all know that in the United States, people are not shy about doing just that and it is likely that hefty amounts of new dollars will be pumped into the economy in the coming period. At least for now, that seems to be the only possible reaction for America.

&amp;#x200B;

**How will crypto benefit from this?**

If the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed), the country's central bank, decides to boost the economy by printing new dollars, investors will look for alternatives. After all, it is not attractive to hold dollars if the expectation is that large amounts of new money will have to be put into circulation to keep the economy afloat.

&amp;#x200B;

In the search for those alternatives, there is more than a chance that a large amount of investors will end up with crypto. After all, this year crypto has again outperformed virtually every other asset class.  crypto is gaining acceptance in the traditional financial world and institutional players have more and more opportunities to invest in bitcoin.

&amp;#x200B;

In a financial system where we need more and more new money to fill the gaps, an asset like crypto has the potential to become the absolute king. With a set maximum of 21 million units that no one can change, crypto is an attractive alternative to our current money. In light of this, the next few years could be very interesting for crypto.",cryptocurrency

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, October 11, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 11, 2021**

Stocks reversed coursed and ended lower today as investors continue to digest the September Jobs report, ongoing supply-side disruptions and wait for the beginning of earnings season to kick off later this week. The benchmark Treasury yield rose to 1.61%, its highest level since June, which puts pressure on technology stocks, and the price of crude oil continued its staggering rise, with Brent crude topping $84 a barrel, the highest price since 2018. 

In recent weeks, amid elevated global demand and persistent supply-side disruptions, the price of commodities, from oil and natural gas to cotton and coal, has exploded, with many currently at multi-year highs or record levels. A similar dynamic happened earlier in the year with the price of lumber, which eventually come back down to reasonable levels. I expect the price of commodities to recede once again as labor market imbalances are met and supply-side disruptions caused by the pandemic smooth over.

Last week, the Labor Department released its monthly jobs report, which showed non-farm payrolls rose by only 194,000 in September versus the 500,000 expected. The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 4.8%, though this positive development came alongside a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate to 61.6%, versus 61.7% in August. And the size of the civilian labor force actually contracted in September, with the gap between the size of the labor force in February 2020 and last month topping 3 million. 

Though employers added just 194,000 jobs in September, the economy has now regained half of the jobs deficit it faced in December, compared with pre-pandemic employment levels. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last month that he'd only need to see a ""decent"" September U.S. jobs report to be ready to begin to taper in November. It is very likely the tapering of quantitative easing will be announced this month and commence in November. 

Looking ahead, market participants will receive the Bureau of Labor Statistics latest Consumer and Producer price indexes for September. Increases in core consumer prices, excluding food and energy, are expected to remain elevated. David Kostin, Chief US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, said ‚ÄúStagflation' was the most common word in client conversations this week as equity market volatility remained elevated. Stagflation is not our economists' base case expectation, but the weak historical performance of equities in stagflationary environments helps explain why investors are concerned."" As a reminder, stagflation refers to an environment in which economic growth is slow but inflation high. As Kostin said, I do not see this scenario moving forward as expectations for economic growth moving forward remain high. 

Earnings season, which is typically a very volatile time in equity markets, is set to kick off later this week, with big US banks reporting.

personalfinance,I only got one quote for my mortgage‚Ä¶ is it too late?,"First time home buyer and didn‚Äôt do enough research‚Ä¶
I started working with a mortgage lender about 2 months ago. At the time I didn‚Äôt realize I needed to ‚Äúshop around.‚Äù I thought you just qualified for what you qualified for and the interest rate was whatever it was.
At first we were told that we only qualified for an FHA loan so we‚Äôve been trying to buy a house with that the past few weeks, and keep being overlooked due to our loan type. Today I emailed my lender to see if we could qualify for a conventional loan since from what I‚Äôve read, we do qualify for. He emailed back later and said we do and the interest rate he gave is 4.125‚Ä¶ our scores aren‚Äôt great, but not bad. Mid to high 600s. I feel this interest rate is way too high (also our FHA loan was about 3.25). 
I feel like I may have screwed myself by not getting different quotes in the beginning. If I did get prequalified with another lender to see if I can get a better quote, would they do another hard pull and potentially sink my credit score?

UniSwap,What's the Economics Design of AMPL Token??,"We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile)**TLDR**:Ampleforth is fascinating because it has the potential to become the global base money of the future. This is done by having governance in code, and it internalises any currency volatility to produce countercylical pressures with its monetary policy.**Get smart:** This is unlike the current global currency (USD) that we have, so this model has a potential to succeed.**Get smarter:** The problem is arguably how the distribution of tokens are with certain key stakeholders. Could affect token holders in the long-run.

# General Conclusion

Ampleforth is very interesting because it could definitely become a global base currency moving forward. Instead of USD, imagine a currency that is used by everyone in the world to trade. Instead of having the world currency (USD) being tied to the internal politics of US, this new currency is neutral and changes its monetary supply based on the global demand of money.In this episode, we will uncover the design of Ampleforth works, the economic considerations and how it plays a role in the DeFi space.

# 1. What is Ampleforth (AMPL)

* Ampleforth wants to be a token with a stable value.
* **How?** They do this with an automated governance using code, by internalising the price volatility in the secondary market.
* **Explain more?** The code is 2 math functions. (1) It calculates the price difference between the ""ideal price"" USD$1 and the actual exchange rate now (e.g. US$1.15). Then it mints more tokens, so that the price goes back down to US$1. (2) It doesn't do this suddenly, token changes happen over a period of 10 days. We call this supply smoothing.
* **So what's cool about it?** It can be used as collaterals in the DeFi projects. It's also not strictly pegged to a fiat currency (e.g. DAI with USD), so it makes it more independent and useful in the long run. Basically, Ampleforth is the new global currency without central bank.
* **Can I earn money with AMPL?** It is possible. For example, doing arbitrage trading with price differences, because you know that prices will always go back to US$1.

# 2. AMPL vs AAVE, COMP, USD

* You can't compare AMPL with AAVE or COMP.  
* because they have different token functions.
* AMPL has a money function and AAVE or COMP has a utility function. It's like comparing USD with American Airlines miles system. It's similar, but not the same.
* But you **can** compare AMPL with USD.  
* because they both have money functions.
* AMPL has an independent monetary policy while USD clearly does not.
* USD is governed by the central bank (aka FED). It's a bunch of smart people in a room, deciding how much money should be available in the economy, the interest rates, the lending rates, etc.
* AMPL is governed by code instead.
* **Is that good or bad?** It really depends. It's good because economists are always looking for solutions to get an independent neutral money, used by everyone. We call this the Triffin Dilemma. However, because it is **only** governed by code, it's possible to affect the secondary market in a short period, if you have enough tokens to manipulate the code.

# 3. Economics Design of Ampleforth

* **Market Design** 
* To increase network effects and demand for AMPL, there are 2 systems in place  
* increase the use of AMPL as collaterals for DeFi projects
* use of Geyser program for people to stake their tokens
* To reduce insane fluctuation in prices, a supply smoothing function is applied, so the change in token quantity is done over a period of 10 days.
* To become more politically independent and to tap onto the benefits of a digital network, the information (prices, volatility, decision making) is done by oracles and machines.
* **Mechanism Design** 
* Math is used to define the rules of the game, for the system to abide by
* When prices change, it affects the amount of tokens available. This directly affects the number of tokens you have in your wallet.  
* **Get smart:** this is where most people don't understand the system. They think that AMPL is a scam. Because tokens can be removed. See below (5. Valuation of Ampleforth) for further explanation.
* Oracles are used to take in prices (via exchange rates of AMPL) and internalise that information.  
* **How**? It changes the amount of of AMPL supply, in response to the prices.
* If prices are too high: print more AMPL
* If prices are too low: burn some AMPL
* **Token Design** 
* Instead of chartallist money like USD, AMPL is metallist money (aka commodity money, like gold). But we call it synthetic or digital metallist money.  
* Machines (math mentioned in #3) define the monetary policy
* Uses Countercyclical approach (see points above on when it prints or burns AMPL)
* Reduce economic fluctuations (see mechanism design above, on internalising price differences and changing supply, so value of 1 AMPL is about US$1)
* AMPL's value is allowed to fluctuate between ¬±5% of US$1\*  
* this US$1 is pegged to the economic definition of ""Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the 2019 dollar""
* Supply smooth is used so that we prevent supply side inflation (or shocks). So if there is an increase in tokens by 15%, the increase will happen over 10 days. Each day will increase by 1.5% instead.
* It's also interesting because it has low correlation to Crypto-assets price fluctuations.  
* **Get smart**: this is great for being part of the portfolio
* Big VCs own a significant percentage of AMPL tokens that is vest  
* **Get smart**: this can be dangerous when the vesting period is over and they dump it in the market

# 4. Monetary Policy

There are 3 situations in the monetary policy:

&gt;Graphs and explanations are in the video.

* expansionary  
* Prices will remain the same in the long-run
* But supply will increase
* Market cap will increase in the long-run
* contractionary  
* Prices will remain the same in the long-run
* But supply will decrease
* Market cap will decrease in the long-run

Combine all these 3 states together, so you can visualise what the general shape of the supply and price and market cap looks like.

# **William Bernstein The Delusions of Crowds: Why People Go Mad in Groups**

4 Signs of a bubble

1. Everyone around you is talking about it. And you should start worrying when people talking about getting rich in certain areas of the market don&amp;#39;t have a background in finance
2. When people begin to quit their jobs to speculate in the markets
3. When someone exhibits skepticism about the prospects and people don&amp;#39;t just disagree with them, but they do so vehemently. They usually say &amp;quot;You just don&amp;#39;t get it.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;New Era&amp;quot; &amp;quot;It is different this time&amp;quot;
4. When you start to see extreme predictions.

- Human beings intuitively seek out outcomes with very high but very rare payoffs, such as lottery tickets, that on average lose money but tantalize their buyers with the chimera of unimaginable wealth
- Researchers have found that our brains fire not only with reward, but even more intensely with its anticipation.
  - There is nothing so disturbing to one&amp;#39;s well-being and judgement as to see a friend get rich
- When presented with facts and data that contradict our deeply held beliefs, we generally do not reconsider and alter those beliefs appropriately. More often, we avoid contrary facts and data, and when we cannot avoid them, our erroneous assessments will even harden and make us more likely to proselytize them.
- People respond more to narratives than to facts and data. And the more compelling the story, the more it erodes our critical thinking skills
- We have 2 different types of thought process
  - System 1 or &amp;quot;reptilian brain&amp;quot; that is fast moving emotional response
  - System 2 or &amp;quot;evolutionary brain&amp;quot; that is much slower conscious reasoning
    - Our faster emotional machinery leads, and our slower &amp;quot;reason&amp;quot; follows
    - In a state of nature, the advantages of system 1 are obvious (IE - hissing snake at your feet). But in a relatively safe post-industrial world where dangers have a longer time horizon, system 1 dominance often occurs at great costs
- Bank supplied leverage is the fuel that powers modern financial manias and it has brought with it a roller coaster of bubbles and busts
  - Over the last 4 centuries, financial innovation has yielded a dizzying variety of investment vehicles: each, in its turn, was often simply leverage in a slightly different disguise and would prove the tinder that would set alight successive waves of speculative excess
- Bubbles typically end with a seemingly small disturbance, followed by a swift collapse
- Throughout history, property prices have ranged between five and twenty times annual rental values.
- When investors are unhappy with ultra-low interest rates offered on safe assets, they bid up the prices of risk assets with rosier potential income.
  - The allure of the hypnotic new technology (early 1800&amp;#39;s railroads) was amplified, as is almost always the case with bubbles, by falling interest rates, which makes investment capital more plentiful
- Every bubble carry within it the seeds of its own destruction
- When compelling narrative and objective fact collide, the former often survives.
- Human beings suffer from confirmation bias, in which once they have settled on a hypothesis or belief system, pay attention only to data that supports their beliefs and avoid data that contradicts it.
- Hyman Minsky thought bubbles needed 2 conditions
  - Easy credit via low interest rates
  - Advent of new technology
- Investors excited about new technologies, or financial products, etc. begin to pour money into them. Since these assets can also be used as collateral for loans, rising prices mean that speculators can borrow even more to pour into these assets. A self-reinforcing cycle develops. But only on the way up
- Minsky developed the &amp;quot;instability hypothesis&amp;quot; which states that in a safe and stable financial environment, money inevitably migrates away from safe borrowers and toward risky ones. Eventually, things get out of hand, resulting in a blowup, which makes lenders and investors more prudent, and the cycle begins anew. Usually about once per decade
  - Amnesia is implicit in the instability hypothesis. After a crisis, investors shy away from risk. As markets recover and the unpleasant memories fade, participants become more open to risk and the instability cycle begins anew.
  - We all like a good story; in the grip of a bubble, when faced with the unpleasant or difficult calculation, a compelling narrative provides easy escape from the effort of rigorous analysis.
- Abandonment of hardheaded financial calculations in favor of compelling narratives is another factor that precipitates financial manias
  - Rather than attempt the nearly impossible estimation of the value of a stock with high projected future earnings (South Sea in 1720, RCA in 1928, Pets.com in 1999, or Tesla today) investors default back to the simple heuristic: &amp;quot;X is a great company and it is going to change the world, and its worth paying almost any price for it.&amp;quot;
- Humans have a recency bias: If stock prices have been rising for the past several years, they will come to believe that equity levels will continue to do so forever; as prices climb, shares become more attractive, which drives up prices even more. The reverse also happens during bear markets
- John Templeton &amp;quot;The four most expensive words in the English language are &amp;#39;This time it&amp;#39;s different.&amp;#39;&amp;quot;
- Max Winkler observed after the 1920 crash and discovery of the Dividend Discount Model that the market discounted not only the future, but the hereafter as well
- Debt can grow faster than the rest of the economy for so long before they implode
  - This is particularly true of private debt
- During bubbles, people become intoxicated by the pursuit of effortless wealth
- Even if we can&amp;#39;t model bubbles, we know what they look like
- Minsky&amp;#39;s amnesia requirement usually reveals a generational divide during bubbles; only participants old enough to recall the last boom and bust are likely to be skeptical. Their younger and more enthusiastic colleagues will deride them as old fogies
  - Bubbles are the province of young people with short memories
- Market Bubbles require 4 necessary conditions
  - Technological and financial displacement
  - Credit loosening
  - Amnesia of the past
  - Abandonment of time-honored valuation principles
- Under most circumstances, the Federal Reserve cares about 2 things
  - Overall state of the economy (as measured by GDP growth and unemployment)
  - Keeping inflation under control
    - Stock prices are of lesser concern and often wind up a bystander of the other 2 policies
- The Fed primary operates via the federal funds rate (interest rate at which member banks lend to each other overnight)
  - When interest rates on these are high, they attract investors. Which pulls investment from risk assets (stocks) and lowers their prices. The opposite is true
- We are apes who tell stories. When our remote ancestors needed to communicate with each other to survive, they did not do so with syllogisms, numerical data, or mathematics. The primary mode of that communication was and still is narration.
- Humans are narrative animals, no matter how misleading the narrative, if it is compelling enough it will nearly always trump the facts, at least until those facts cause great pain.
  - The more compelling the narrative, the more it erodes are analytical thinking
  - We also mold the facts to fit our preexisting opinion
    - We cling to facts that fit our narrative and ignore those that disconfirm them
    - We intentionally avoid exposing ourselves to contrary data
  - A compelling narrative can spread through a population just like a virus would and can even acquire critical mass
    - As more and more people share the same delusion, the more likely we are to believe in it, and so the more likely those around us will do so as well, a vicious cycle ensues, gaining more and more momentum until they finally smash into the brick wall of reality.",finance

What happens to all other similar borrowers !?

What happens to the system if all of them paid back their loan + interest !?

In case of current fiat system settling loan + interest simply result in monetary inflation, with new money being created. How does the Bitcoin standard work in this scenario as BTC has absolute 21M supply limit!

I want to know how the entire lending eco system work in the BTC Standard. I see there is no way to pay interest payment back in BTC in this eco system. If that is possible then total BTC should go above 21M upper limit just like fiat system which obviously can't happen.  So how we untie this knot!

Correct me if I am wrong. Just looking to pass on useful information and learn of both good and bad experiences.",cryptocurrency

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. dcSpark is unveiling a sidechain project called Milkomeda that will use wrapped ADA and so-called ‚Äúwrapped smart contracts‚Äù. The first sidechain, M1, will be an Ethereum Virtual Machine sidechain. This means Solidity devs can deploy their current smart contract code in M1 and those smart contracts will be accessible to Cardano users. This is ‚Äúthe pond‚Äù. This will be HUGE! Good work dcSpark! You guys are killing it!

22. Another signpost for Cardano DeFi projects. Gary Gensler (SEC Head) tells the Financial Times that in his view DeFi platforms have ‚Äúa fair amount of centralisation‚Äù and ‚Äú\[i\]t‚Äôs a misnomer to say they are just software they put out in the web...‚Äù [https://www.ft.com/content/fb126d79-2e60-4002-8aba-b08887fca609](https://www.ft.com/content/fb126d79-2e60-4002-8aba-b08887fca609)

34. Only 5 more days to Alonzo (as of Sept. 7)!
35. Despite all the negative posting about Cardano smart contracts on eUTxO, it ironically looks like some in the ETH community are actually trying to build ETH L2 on UTXO. [https://twitter.com/matiwinnetou/status/1434570158853529606](https://twitter.com/matiwinnetou/status/1434570158853529606)

He also gives some hints as to his thoughts on the short-term planning of some ‚Äúflavor of the week‚Äù blockchains vs. the long term planning of Cardano. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhujKbMpTEA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhujKbMpTEA)
39. Weiss Crypto lays down yet another very positive thread about Cardano. They acknowledge that they can‚Äôt see the future of Cardano, but they vehemently reject a lot of the anti-hype. [https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1435261343456768005](https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1435261343456768005)

42. Messari has updated its ‚ÄúInitial Token Distribution‚Äù chart to include a previously missing project and Cardano is still among the very best in the Gen 3 space in terms of broad public coin ownership. [https://twitter.com/CryptoIRELAND1/status/1435708439951552513](https://twitter.com/CryptoIRELAND1/status/1435708439951552513)
43. After lots of criticism of Cardano layer 2 possibilities by ETH maximalists, Vitalik has ironically announced that ETH NFTs need to be moved to layer 2. [https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1435413681588736007](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1435413681588736007)

46. A Weiss Crypto analyst calls the smart contract launch an alleged event and also doesn‚Äôt realize we already have NFTS. The Cardano community was quick to correct the analyst. Weiss was then also quick to apologize. [https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436369016545857566](https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436369016545857566) [https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436402039085576193](https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436402039085576193)

49. One of Cardano‚Äôs biggest competitors is once again suffering network problems. This time it started out as just being characterized as (more) ‚Äúinstability‚Äù, then they started saying that something had caused the blockchain to ‚Äústart forking‚Äù. This followed their September 2 ‚Äúinstability‚Äù and ‚Äúperformance degradation‚Äù event. It‚Äôll be interesting to see how well their community tolerates this in the future if it‚Äôs happening with their planned slashing model in effect. [https://twitter.com/SolanaStatus/status/1437856638279487493](https://twitter.com/SolanaStatus/status/1437856638279487493) [https://twitter.com/SolanaStatus/status/1437757547235131396](https://twitter.com/SolanaStatus/status/1437757547235131396) [https://twitter.com/SolanaStatus/status/1433429598230876173](https://twitter.com/SolanaStatus/status/1433429598230876173)

54. It looks like we‚Äôll get some news about further collaboration with Baia‚Äôs Wine of Georgia at the Cardano Summit. [https://twitter.com/ThornhillPublic/status/1438157239982956545](https://twitter.com/ThornhillPublic/status/1438157239982956545)
55. Now one of Cardano‚Äôs most highly visible critics is implying that the Cardano community has something in common with anti-vaxxers. Unfortunately for him, it was one of his pet blockchains that was down a few days ago while Cardano just kept healthily trucking right along. [https://twitter.com/spudiot1/status/1438402783040790532](https://twitter.com/spudiot1/status/1438402783040790532)
56. Cardano is still crushing it in terms of daily transaction volume. [https://twitter.com/Eilert/status/1438521555638644746](https://twitter.com/Eilert/status/1438521555638644746)

58. Smaug gives us a rundown of how many actual Plutus scripts (19)are running on mainnet vs. timelock scripts (21k) as of Sept 17 and explains simple definitions for both. But, he also mentions down below how many Plutus scripts (213) are reportedly running on ‚Äúthe main testnet‚Äù not counting ‚Äúother Alonzo testnets‚Äù. [https://twitter.com/SmaugPool/status/1438816898234343432](https://twitter.com/SmaugPool/status/1438816898234343432)

60. Now the TX and NJ state securities regulators are after Celsius for crypto loans (BlockFi already got this treatment). Cardano loan projects should probably take note.

61. After the Senate hearing on Tuesday September 14th, Gary Gensler (SEC Chairman) gave a quote to a crypto publication indicating that custodial lending and possibly even staking platforms might be considered securities. This is very relevant for Cardano since it has non-custodial staking whereas many of its competitors have the kind of custodial staking that Gensler may have been contemplating. [https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/117675/crypto-lending-staking-custody-gensler-sec](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/117675/crypto-lending-staking-custody-gensler-sec)

CryptoCurrency,Switzerland initiated a vote to add bitcoin to the federal constitution as a reserve currency,"2B4CH, a Swiss non-profit think tank that helps governments research cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, has launched an initiative that could make Bitcoin one of the country's reserve assets.

On Friday, the association announced plans to launch a federal initiative to collect 100,000 signatures for the introduction of bitcoin into article 99, paragraph 3, of the Swiss federal constitution.

The initiative, in particular, proposes to add bitcoin to the list of assets of the central bank of Switzerland. If changed, the constitutional article will read as follows:

‚ÄúThe Swiss National Bank must create sufficient foreign exchange reserves from its revenues; some of these reserves will be held in gold and bitcoins. ""

If the vote goes well, the Swiss National Bank or SNB will need to learn how to add bitcoin to their reserves.

‚ÄúThis addition to the constitution will affect the people of Switzerland in the same way that Silicon Valley and the London Stock Exchange have benefited the people of their countries,‚Äù said Yves Bennaim, founder and chairman of 2B4CH.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Purchasing car - finance or cash?,"Hey everyone,

Normally this wouldn‚Äôt be a question i‚Äôd ask but my wife and i are planning to move for my work. As part of that, we‚Äôll be selling our current house and looking for a new one. With that (specifically mortgage interest rate) in mind, would it be prudent of us to purchase a new car with cash so we don‚Äôt hit our debt to income ratio? 

The car would be 35-40k

New house would likely be in the 600-700k range with at least 20% down (may go higher to reduce monthly payment)

Combined annual income ~280k

Aside from our current 550k mortgage we have no other debts. 

i‚Äôd like to say we can wait until after the move/closing to buy the new car but transporting a toddler in a tiny Corolla just isn‚Äôt an ideal situation.",finance

personalfinance,How does one recover after ignoring debt for 2 years?,"Hey everyone! Curious if anyone here has navigated a similar situation...

I‚Äôm trying to help out a friend who is working to fix some debt she let go to collections.  She worked with Freedom Debt Relief to consolidate about $25k of credit card debt and paid into that for about 2 years. They knocked out around $10k of the debt.  

But about 18 months ago, she went through a really hard time and stopped paying.  She recognizes she shouldn‚Äôt have done this and is trying to fix it now.  Should she just call Freedom Debt Relief and try to pick up where she left off?  Should she try to get out of her arrangement with them and negotiate directly with the collectors since she now has $15k still in collections? 

I‚Äôve tried to do some research on Freedom Debt Relief but not sure how best to navigate them.  In retrospect she realizes they may not have been a great option, but where does she go from here? 

She also has about $65k in federal student loans and she has not paid anything towards them in 2 years.  She has gone through all the letters she receives from collectors and it doesn‚Äôt appear that anything has gone to court and they haven‚Äôt seized her bank account.  I imagine that could happen in the near future so we‚Äôre trying to figure out the best way to rectify the situation.  

Please be kind, this is someone I really care about that just went through a very hard time.",finance

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/12/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-tuesday-oct-12.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Wall Street looks to avoid a 3-session losing streak

&gt; * U.S. stock futures were steady Tuesday as elevated bond yields and U.S. oil prices dipped. West Texas Intermediate crude was still around seven-year highs above $80 per barrel. The 10-year Treasury yield was trading back to June highs at about 1.6% ahead of the government‚Äôs 10 a.m. ET release of its latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. Economists expect 10.9 million job openings as of the end of August, unchanged from the record level posted at the end of July.

&gt; * On Monday, the Dow continued Friday‚Äôs weakness on much weaker-than-expected September job growth. The 30-stock average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq all fell about 0.7% to start the week on concerns about how surging oil prices might affect the economic recovery from Covid. The Dow was down nearly 3.2% from its Aug. 16 record close. The S&amp;P 500 was off almost 3.9% from its Sept. 2 record close. The Nasdaq was down about 5.8% from its Sept. 7 record close.

*****

&gt; # 2. House to vote on short-term debt ceiling deal

&gt; * The House is set to vote Tuesday to approve a short-term debt ceiling hike, sending the measure to President Joe Biden for his signature. The $480 billion compromise increase will allow the federal government to pay its bills until early December. It cleared the Senate last week in a party-line Democratic vote. The standoff over an Oct. 18 deadline ended when Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell agreed to help pass the short-term increase. But he insists he won‚Äôt do it again. McConnell wants Democrats to use their slim majorities on Capitol Hill to act alone on the debt ceiling through the reconciliation process.

*****

&gt; # 3. Southwest Airlines cancels dozens more flights

&gt; * Southwest Airlines scrapped 87 flights, or about 2% of Tuesday‚Äôs schedule, after cancelling about 2,220 since Saturday. More than half of the cancellations came Sunday, when Southwest wiped out 30% of its daily schedule. In August, the airline reduced its schedule in hopes of fixing operational struggles over the summer that regularly led to dozens of cancellations. There was speculation this weekend‚Äôs disruptions were driven by excessive worker sick calls tied to a Covid vaccine mandate. Southwest said that‚Äôs ‚Äúinaccurate‚Äù and ‚Äúunfounded.‚Äù

*****

&gt; # 4. GOP Texas governor prohibits Covid vaccine mandates

&gt; * Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order prohibiting any entity, including private businesses, from imposing Covid vaccination requirements on employees or customers. ‚ÄúThe COVID-19 vaccine is safe, effective, and our best defense against the virus, but should remain voluntary and never forced,‚Äù Abbott said in a statement. He said in his order that it was prompted by the Biden administration‚Äôs federal vaccine mandate, which the Texas governor called federal overreach.

*****

&gt; # 5. Jamie Dimon says he thinks ‚Äòbitcoin is worthless‚Äô

&gt; * Jamie Dimon is still a bitcoin skeptic. The JPMorgan CEO, at a conference Monday, said the world‚Äôs biggest digital currency has no intrinsic value. ‚ÄúI personally think that bitcoin is worthless,‚Äù Dimon said. ‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt want to be a spokesman for that, I don‚Äôt care. It makes no difference to me. I don‚Äôt think you should smoke cigarettes, either.‚Äù Bitcoin, while lower Tuesday, was still above $57,000, a level not seen since May. It‚Äôs been rallying recently. Bitcoin was up roughly 30% in October. It hit an all-time high near $65,000 in April before sinking below $30,000 this summer.

personalfinance,Car Loan Comparison: 3 YR @ 0.9% VS 5 YR @ 2.9%?,"So I've heard that loans with low interest rates, typically below 3%, are considered ""good loans"" since it is technically free money in the sense that any money you invest that would have otherwise gone towards the purchase will outperform the interest cost.  And I generally agree with that.

I am a bit lost in this case though, as it seems to be about a $1500 difference in total interest paid.  It would be around a $25000 loan for 3 YR @ 0.9% or 5 YR @ 2.9%.

CryptoCurrency,"It's extremely clever, FDIC insurance for Stable coins (Tether)","TLDR: Most banks only keep a very small amount of physical cash on hand, yet they continue to function, because they balance cash out by cash in.  Fractional Reserve Banking.

What do you do with an investment thesis that uses the same idea to buy an asset, with the sole purpose of inflating the value, then slowly cashing out of your position?

If the FDIC insures Stable Coins (even if they‚Äôre not based in the US), then the organizations that issue the coins/tokens, will have to deposit funds with the Treasury. About 3-10% of assets.

Tether has managed to meet redemption requests, with about 3% cash on hand (much like a traditional bank), what happens when the FED captures that asset?

Will Tether be able to meet redemption requests?  Since Tether holds Exchange IOU‚Äôs, the major exchanges will have to meet a (MASSIVE... about the value of their entire enterprise) margin call (Tether turning in IOU‚Äôs for cash‚Ä¶ a run), the exchanges crash and stop trading/transferring coins/tokens out, the entire system crashes.

People will ask ‚Äúhow can you make a foreign firm pay-in????‚Äù  The SWIFT network, the FED can simply decree that Tether is no longer allowed to use the SWIFT network, and no entity on the SWIFT network is allowed to trade with them. No more Dollars, no more Euros, no ability to get Fiat in or out in about 80% of the financial networks in the world‚Ä¶ no ability to SPEND crypto in the Western world.

The financial firms would be forced to sell (I recently had this happen to me in Chinese Equities), and any future profits couldn‚Äôt be recognized in financial reports (so you may make a profit, but you wouldn‚Äôt be able to get credit for it‚Ä¶ or spend it, or borrow against it).

Very clever‚Ä¶

In one fell swoop, the US Government captures most of the value of issued stable coins and regulates them. Naturally‚Ä¶ payment of the deposit can be ‚Äúin kind‚Äù, so the Government can spend the funds (crypto) now and just pay with Treasury paper in the future.

Brilliant! Naturally, the EU and ASEAN countries will wants a piece‚Ä¶ say 20%.

I‚Äôm sure the (new) lawyers/advisors at Tether see this‚Ä¶ and the only way out is financial contributions to campaigns. Form a PAC‚Ä¶ before they are destroyed personally and financially.

‚ÄúI just want to wet my beak‚Äù‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: The US Gov. can ""save the day"" by taking over the exchanges with a cash infusion... and own EVERYTHING (all assets) that the exchanges hold as collateral... including all the coins/tokens.  ""not your keys, not your tokens"".  This is it, this is how the fiat issuers take ownership of crypto.

CryptoCurrency,"Bitcoin records 3x higher average trading volume in October than Apple, Amazon &amp; Microsoft","After experiencing increased volatility in late September, Bitcoin (BTC) appears to be regaining its momentum towards another all-time high. The recent surge in the asset's value reflects the trading volume that is significantly higher than selected traditional finance stocks.¬†

Data compiled between October 1 and October 11, Bitcoin recorded an average daily trading volume of $36.7 billion, dwarfing stocks from the traditional finance sector. During the period, electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla (TSLA)¬† had an average trading volume of $14.64 billion, at least two times less than Bitcoin.

Elsewhere, tech giant Apple (AAPL)¬† recorded an average trading volume of $10.98 billion which is at least three times less than Bitcoin. During the period, Amazon's (AMZN) volume was four times less than Bitcoin at $9.09 billion.¬†

## Bitcoin's volume surges amid price rebound

With Bitcoin recording a significant trading volume, it is worth noting that the cryptocurrency belongs to a different asset class than the stocks. However, this is an indicator that from an investment perspective, Bitcoin competes with the stocks. Compared to stocks like Apple, Bitcoin has almost half the market capitalization.¬†

Notably, Bitcoin's trading volume might be higher than the stocks since the asset is traded on a 24/7 basis without any restrictions. On the other hand, stocks like Apple and Amazon trade only five days a week, exclusive of holidays.

Bitcoin's trading volume has surged in October, reflecting a rebound of buying and selling activity. Bitcoin's price corrected significantly amid an increased [regulatory crackdown](https://finbold.com/crypto-market-wipes-100b-in-minutes-as-china-vows-crackdown-on-crypto-trading/) from jurisdictions like China towards the end of September. Therefore, the trading activity potentially indicates that investors were encouraged after staying on the sidelines in September.¬†

Overall, the cryptocurrency surged by at least 20% in October. Generally, a surge in Bitcoin has historically resulted in fear of missing out (or FOMO), influencing more people to attempt to make quick money. On the flip side, the investors who accumulated the asset during the market lows of September might be selling to cash in. Historically, cryptocurrency trading volume is known to have a spike in the course of extreme price swings, mainly due to speculative traders.¬†

## Why stocks are trailing Bitcoin in trading volume

Elsewhere, the traditional stocks, mainly from15 min went through¬† the tech sector, have experienced an opposite October compared to Bitcoin.¬†

The broader tech sector has been mounting in U.S. financial markets in recent weeks, characterized by volatility. Notably, the stocks had previously served as a haven for investors amid the coronavirus pandemic but plunged over the fear of removing stimulus packages. Furthermore, the trading volume trails Bitcoin due to low investor interest since the stocks are susceptible to [rising interest rates](https://www.reuters.com/business/fed-policymakers-see-upward-march-interest-rates-starting-next-year-2021-09-22/).

At the same time, although the selected stocks remained resilient amid the coronavirus pandemic, their low trading volume compared to Bitcoin might indicate they are still experiencing the overall effects of the health crisis.¬†

The stock market [collapsed](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lizfrazierpeck/2021/02/11/the-coronavirus-crash-of-2020-and-the-investing-lesson-it-taught-us/) at the onset of the health crisis, but stocks from the technology sector gained as their products helped people navigate the crisis. Additionally, the stocks are still struggling despite the economy reopening following the coronavirus vaccine rollout.¬†

MachineLearning,[Discussion] How do neural nets generalize vs overfit ?,"There's an article just published by Quanta magazine addressing the perennial issue of why over-parametized neural nets can generalize vs overfit. The explanation suggested here, if I'm understanding it correctly, is that the effective dimensionality of the parameter space is reduced since neural nets, like support vector machines, may be deriving optimal hyperplane decision boundaries, rather than being able to use all their parameters to define more gerrymandered overfitting boundaries.

[https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-new-link-to-an-old-model-could-crack-the-mystery-of-deep-learning-20211011/](https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-new-link-to-an-old-model-could-crack-the-mystery-of-deep-learning-20211011/)

What frustrates me every time this comes up is that I really don't understand why multi-layer neural nets would NOT be expected to generalize if fed the right type of training data. I guess either there's something wrong with my mental model of what neural nets are doing,  or perhaps my mental model is right in that it predicts the observed behavior of generalization, and similar to this new explanation it's based on what hyperplane decision boundaries are being learnt.

Here's my mental model of what's going on. Please excuse if this all seems obvious, because it does seem obvious!

1. Each layer (or node in more general case) of a neural net can be considered as mapping an input space to an output space (who's dimensions are the number of inputs and outputs respectively).

2. The way each layer performs this input space to output space mapping is by learning hyperplane decision boundaries that carve up the input space into chunks corresponding to the output space.

Not that it's important to this conceptual model, but presumably it's the activation functions that are really defining the position of these decision boundaries, with the layer's weights having learnt to warp/scale the input space coordinates such that the following fixed activation functions can then do their job.

3) The neural net as a whole, just like an individual layer, can be regarded as mapping an input space (samples) to an output space (labels), and does so via a (multi-layer) hierarchy of decision boundaries which carve up the evolving (layer output) feature spaces such that at the output layer each label is defined by a set of decision boundaries which isolate samples having a given label.

4) In the overfitting case (including the extreme case where the training set had random labels uncorrelated to the samples) each label is defined by decision boundaries isolating a chunk of input/feature space containing a single sample, or small set of samples (not all of those with the same label).

5) In the generalization case, the training set needs to have consisted of consistently labelled samples such that the labels correspond to features learnable by the neural net (e.g. hierarchical visual patterns). In this case, if it has learned to generalize, what will have happened is that the decision boundaries will have isolated chunks of input/feature space each containing many samples with the same label. Generalization occurs since unseen samples with the same features will therefore fall into this same chunk of output space - i.e. receive the same label.

6) What makes the difference between overfitting and generalization is mostly the training data - whether the training samples have features in common (that can be learnt by the net in question) that correspond to the given labels, and whether there is sufficient variety of samples (after augmentation) to provide coverage of the features space such that there is no ambiguity in which sets of features correspond to each label.

The key to the ""mystery of generalization"" seems to be that if the above training data conditions are met, then the error feedback encountered during training will be consistent across samples with the same label and will be moving the decision boundaries in a common direction to isolate the region(s) of feature space corresponding to the common label. Therefore, rather than the ""highly gerrymandered"" regions of output space corresponding to the overfitting case, this consistent error feedback will nudge the decision boundaries in a common direction for all samples having the same label-to-feature-set correspondence, leading to a single (or maybe few) large region(s) of feature space having been isolated corresponding to the common label, therefore providing good generalization.

So, what is wrong with the above mental model of what is going on in a neural net to achieve generalization, and if nothing (other than lack of detail) then can we be more specific about what step of this training process is surprising rather than inevitable?

I suppose this explanation could also be cast in terms of optimal decision boundaries, the same as an SVM, since the boundaries are only going to move as far as they need to minimize the errors. Once all samples are correctly predicted the errors will go to zero and the boundaries will stop moving.",technology

# HOW TO BUILD A PORTFOLIO WITH THE CHECKLISTS (6 Steps):

Step 1. Choose the amount to invest *(eg. $10,000)*  
Make sure you've thought about:

* Have a six month emergency cash pile
* Pay off high interest debt first
* Eliminate your worst spending habits
* Think about your time horizon
* Max out your pension contributions

Step 2. Choose your markets *(eg. US - All industries)*

* Industries
* Countries

Step 3. Choose the company size *(eg. Microcap)*

* Nano-cap (&lt;$50M)
* Micro-cap (&lt;$300M)
* Small-cap (&lt;$2B)
* Mid-cap (&lt;$10B)
* Large-cap (&lt;$200B)
* Mega-cap (&gt;$200B)

Step 4. Filter based on the checklists above *(eg. P/S &lt; 1 and Positive 3&amp;6-month Momentum)*

Step 5. Rank the remaining companies by another metric *(eg. Rank by 1-Year Price Momentum)*

Step 6. Pick &amp; purchase stocks from the top of the list *(eg. Purchase top 25 stocks)*

Backtested results: $10,000 invested in 1965 into the strategy above would have grown to $95M today. An 18.1% annual return. The S&amp;P500 would have returned $1M in the same period, an 8.79% return.

personalfinance,Buying your own health insurance?,"Hi there,

My husband and I purchase health insurance through my employer. We pay about $600 a month to cover both of us through a PPO plan with United Healthcare.

Ever since we switched a few months ago, it's been a disaster. My husband is a T1D and his medical devices are simply not covered by UHC. I have received surprise claims for everything from routine bloodwork at my annual exam to $200 for a PCR test (which I thought were federally mandated to be free?)

With open enrollment coming up, I'm hoping to consider other options. Has anyone found an alternative health insurance method NOT through their employer? I assume I can't purchase plans through the ACA since we are eligible for an employer-sponsored plan. (And I'm not convinced those plans would be any better based on what I've heard from those who use them.)",finance

Debts I currently have:

* $17000 in Student Loans (\~3% Average, though it is 0% now) all paid off at current rate early 2026
* $6000 in Car Loan (0% if paid off by Aug 2022, which will be paid off in full at current payment rate)
* $4000 in Care Credit \[Medical\] (0% if paid off by Aug 2023, which will be paid off in full at current payment rate)

I can pay off the Car Loan and Care Credit much much faster, probably by May 2022 - but should I?  I would like a higher credit score, so when I apply for a house loan, I get the best rate.  So that means I needs to eliminate as much debt as possible, and since Care Credit counts as a credit card, my thought is to pay that off ASAP, even though it is 0% until Aug 2023 (all I have to pay is \~200 per month to make that happen).  

Is it crazy not to take advantage of 0% loan and put all extra money into retirement or down payment fund?  Or should I pay off what I can ASAP, so that I can get the best rate for my upcoming house purchase.  The reason I want to leave student loans alone as much as possible as there is a slight potential for some form of federal loan forgiveness. 

Also, right now I just have money for my house down payment in a Savings account (.40%).  Is there somewhere better I should keep that money that isn't too risky?",finance

cybersecurity,Career Advice/Help,"Hey all,

I am looking for career advice from anyone willing to share.  I currently work fulltime in cybersecurity as a state employee and part-time in the reserves.  For my fulltime job, I have only been doing it for about 4+years (recently stepped into a cybersecurity engineer role).  In addition, I went back to a technical school and received 2 Associates (cybersecurity and networking).  Also, I have a few certifications from SANS, SEC +, AWS and attended various training.  I really enjoy building various platforms, tools, automating through scripting, pen-testing, and incident response.  In my fulltime role, I don't get to do some of these things I want to do and end up having to do some of it at night.  My goal is to work on a purple team to do all of these things.  

My questions are: Is working in a private organization better than state/federal?  What are the pros/cons?  Do private organizations allow cybersecurity professionals the ability to use whatever tools they want?  What should I be aware of making the transition?  What type of company should I look for as well as size?  Are companies looking for remote hires (I do not want to move)?  How flexible are they if you don't know everything?  This is a big one for me for a few reasons.  For some projects, I ask a lot of questions to others on the team, spend time researching commands or solutions online, and/or RTFM and ""struggle.""  It is def imposter syndrome at times and with that, I am concerned that if I ask for the same amount of money or more and can't preform, then its ""see ya.""  I really love learning more about this field but I know I will never know it all.

Given all of this, I am potentially looking next year sometime but want to start leaning forward now.  Any mentorship, professional guidance, etc would be greatly appreciated.  I have never truly been outside of the public/federal sector so it is very new to me. 

Thank you all for the help.",technology

For years, under the table shenanigans have gone on because governments have zero capability of measuring it without immense costs.

With crypto, it's going to far worse. Unless the powers that be can find a way to centralize all crypto (which would then create a black market for it as is what happens to everything else that gets regulated), I personally think we're looking a future tax system based purely off of expenses and not income. How are you going to tax gains on someone who purely operates their ""bank account"" with cryptocurrency?

CryptoCurrency,What is everyone‚Äôs sentiment on regulation?,"Many seem to tout regulation, in particular from the US, as a necessary element of crypto‚Äôs journey. However, personally I feel that regulation is the antithesis of what crypto was invented for. Should we not be rejecting ***all*** attempts to regulate such a market? If this technology hopes to be as revolutionary as it set out to be (and I hope it does), shouldn‚Äôt we look for ways to separate from the draconic financial hegemony that currently dominates us?

I personally believe freedom and decentralisation are the fundamental components that we should not abandon as the market grows. Being focused purely on bigger bank balances is a sickness that will inevitably lead us all into the hands of those we seek to destroy.

If we want regulation, it needs to come from the community i.e. active participants in the market. Relying on old doctrine to inform the direction that crypto can go is just a fallacy which will bastardise, hamper and cripple our future. We need to operate outside the purview of these institutions. 

I got into crypto because I was fed up of the status quo, the monotony, same stories of corruption etc. I wonder how many others out there feel the same.

Everyone is so afraid of breaking the law in terms of taxes or regulatory fenceposting - we need to realise most of these laws aren‚Äôt there for our benefit.

* Emergency Fund reached : \~10k
* 20k fed loans outstanding 4.75-5% interest (across 4 loans)
* Reserving $800 per month in a savings account
* $4k saved for student loans so far
* Making company match for trad 401k - will not meet limit this year
* No IRA

**Questions**

1. Is there a point in repayment that it's more worth to switch to min. monthly payments?
2. Should I prioritize away from student loans towards retirement?
3. Do I cut my losses with the Biden admin and refinance to private for a lower interest rate, make min payments and pursue other goals?

stocks,Here's Why the S&amp;P 500 Index Might Remain Volatile This Week,"Despite multiple volatile trading sessions in the last week, the S&amp;P 500 index turned positive to close at 4,370 points on October 8. It fell by 0.6% yesterday and might continue to remain under pressure in the near term. The world‚Äôs most popular index is trading 4% below all-time highs for a multitude of reasons, a few of which are discussed here.

## Inflation and the threat of rising prices

Wall Street and investors are worried about rising prices also known as inflation, that is expected to haunt equity markets in the next few months. In case, inflation gains pace, it might impact consumer demand which in turn will delay economic recovery.

The jobs report for September was released last Friday and average hourly earnings climbed 0.6% month over month and 4.6% year over year. It was the second-fastest pace in the last 14 years. Higher labor costs will force enterprises to increase the prices of goods and services.

Companies such as FedEx and UPS have already increased prices to offset higher costs. Consumer giant Pepsi has also raised prices on its wide portfolio of snacks and drinks and this trend is likely to continue in 2022 as well.¬†¬†

## Oil and inflation

Rising oil prices will also weigh heavily on inflation. Crude oil prices are up 64% in 2021 while natural gas prices have more than doubled since April. Further, coal prices are trading at record highs due to the ongoing energy crisis impacting several countries. Higher energy prices are similar to a tax as it limits the spending power of consumers which is a key driver of economic growth.

In the second quarter of 2021, 224 companies part of the S&amp;P 500 mentioned ‚Äúinflation‚Äù on earnings call which was the highest number on record. This figure is likely to move higher in Q3 earnings call‚Äôs that will kick off this week. Several companies across sectors will point to higher costs and supply chain disruptions in case they report revenue and earnings below estimates.

## Goldman Sachs lowers economic growth forecasts

Leading investment bank Goldman Sachs lowered economic growth target projections for the U.S. this year. It expects the GDP to increase by 5.6% in 2021 and by 4% in 2022 due to a decline in fiscal support and a delayed recovery in consumer spending. Goldman Sachs had earlier estimated GDP growth at 5.7% in 2021 and 4.4% in 2022.

My state (AL) has an org called AHFA and they have first time buyer programs. There is a loan that is 0% down and has no PMI. However, it looks like the interest rate is about 3.75%. I‚Äôve seen where a lot of people are getting around 2.65%. I have the credit score (probably 750ish)  for that, but not the liquid cash for a traditional 80% AMI. 

I know the most fiscally responsible thing would be continue to save until I have more money. But I spiraled pretty hard starting 12 years ago after my divorce, and over the last 3-4 years I‚Äôve made huge strides to improve my life. But after living with my parents (who are awesome) for ten years,  I feel like I might spiral again if I don‚Äôt hurry up and get out. Being 33yo I won‚Äôt even attempt to date while I live at home. It‚Äôs a huge self confidence blow. 

But that‚Äôs neither here nor there, I just want to explore my options and see if I have missed anything. One other interesting note : I drive a little over an hour each way to work.

stocks,"PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday October 12, 2021","Stocks closed slightly on the red, with the three major indexes fluctuating between small gains and losses in another choppy session. Market participants continue to digest elevated commodity prices, the September job report, new upcoming economic data, and earnings season, which is set to kick off later this week.

In recent weeks, amid elevated global demand and persistent supply-side disruptions, the price of commodities, from oil and natural gas to cotton and coal, has exploded, with many currently at multi-year highs or record levels. The broad rise in prices threatens to further pressure corporate margins, with companies already dealing with a host of supply-side disruptions, including port congestion, ongoing power shortages in China, and labor market imbalances. Rising treasury yields also raise the specter of higher borrowing costs, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury hovering at the highest levels since June.

David Bailin, Chief Investment Officer at Citi Private Bank (a subsidiary of Citigroup), said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre definitely freaked out about crude oil prices ... \[and\] about slightly higher interest rates. But we have to put all of this in context. First of all, interest rates have been abnormally low. Energy prices are high due to excessive demand right now and delivery shortages across Europe and now in China ... These things will abate. We think it'll take somewhere between three and nine months for energy supplies and for the shipping issues to abate."" I agree.

Looking ahead, market participants will receive the Bureau of Labor Statistics latest Consumer and Producer price indexes for September. Increases in core consumer prices, excluding food and energy, are expected to remain elevated. David Kostin, Chief US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, said ‚ÄúStagflation' was the most common word in client conversations this week as equity market volatility remained elevated. Stagflation is not our economists' base case expectation, but the weak historical performance of equities in stagflationary environments helps explain why investors are concerned."" As a reminder, stagflation refers to an environment in which economic growth is slow but inflation high. As Kostin said, I do not see this scenario moving forward as expectations for economic growth moving forward remain high. 

Earnings season, which is typically a very volatile time in equity markets, is set to kick off later this week, with big US banks reporting. 

**Highlights**

* The IMF's new forecast is for global economic activity to expand at a 5.9% rate this year, down from the 6.0% pace seen in July. However, the IMF maintained its outlook for 4.9% growth next year. To put this into context, global growth rates in 2019 were 3.2%, so the IMF thinks we are poised for at least another year of nice gains.
* Coinbase (COIN) is launching a marketplace to exchange non-fungible tokens. 
* Twitter (TWTR) on Tuesday rolled out new ad features and revamped the algorithm that decides which ads users see, as part of an effort to lay the groundwork to launch future eCommerce features, the social networking company told Reuters.
* EU antitrust regulators are set to open a full-scale investigation into NVIDIA's (NVDA) $54 bln bid for British chip designer Arm because concessions it offered are not sufficient to address competition concerns, people familiar with the matter said.
* Investment firm Blackstone revealed its plans to invest $1 billion in acquiring music rights and managing catalogs, a move they say will benefit from the rapid growth of online streaming.

ethereum,Crypto101/DeFi101: Why DeFi Is More Than A Ponzi Scam,"We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile)

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**:

DeFi is still in its early stages and it is still risky. There are scams here and there. But we should not use a few black sheep to define the space as a ponzi scam. DeFi will develop further in the future with better testing. And it is clear that its potential will develop very quickly later.

DeFi is innovating fast. We should analyse and exploit the strengths. Scam projects will still emerge. Our continuous education and knowledge will help reduce that.

**Get smart:** DeFi is not exactly a Ponzi Scam, it is still evolving and will have limitations in it.

**Get smarter:** The growth potential of DeFi is huge, we see the traditional financial system, the governance system is very ineffective. Thing resources are under-utilised and expensive. DeFi is trying this problem and if it succeeds it will be revolutionary.

# General Conclusion

Some people claim that DeFi is a scam ponzi because there are a lot of pumps and dumps. Everything on Twitter is shilling all kinds of different projects. Now there are a lot of risks involved, and the projects are not fully audited. So a lot of people are wondering this is a ponzi scam of part of the innovation cycle.

In this article, we will tell why DeFi is more than just a ponzi scam.

We cover 3 things today:

1. Why DeFi feels like Ponzi
2. Why DeFi is not Ponzi
3. Future of DeFi.

When talking about DeFi here, we are referring to the general ecosystem and not a single project, because the ecosystem is doing quite well in general.

Sure, there are some systems around the world with plenty of scams. This includes traditional financial market. But you cannot discredit the entire system because of a few black sheep.

DeFi is a new system and industry. There will be a few scams coming out but you cannot define this for the entire ecosystem, which is doing a lot of good and interesting things.

# DeFi and Ponzi

If you google the keyword ""DeFi and Ponzi"", you can see a lot of articles saying that DeFi is like Ponzi, just another name called, DeFi is basically ICO 2.0 where people are pumping and dumping, whale manipulation, etc.

**What it feels like:** Everything is just memes and a joke. Is this even serious? Why do I have to join? How is this legal and how can people make money? Projects with 100% APY; where does the money come from and why is it valuable? People just swapping or trading tokens together, but it was in a circle, a pyramid scheme.

**What it actually is:** Liquidity Mining (Synthetix) and Yield Farming (Compound) are ways to bootstrap growth and to reward a decentralised community to take ownership of the protocol. High rewards for risk takers in the early days is rationally sound. And when payout for the risk takers happen all at once, it feels like the APY is insanely high.

# Why DeFi is not Ponzi

**1. ¬† Grow the Pie**

Answer the above question briefly: this is not necessarily true. If you look at the distribution of the entire economic value as a pie, a ponzi scam is where you are extracting value every time someone is coming in. This means that the pie doesn't change much, you give your money to someone else to receive new tokens.

DeFi is like the pie, that keeps growing. There are many projects/protocols under construction, such as lending protocol, Dex protocol, portfolio asset management protocol, etc. They're in beta testing in this early stage and they do not try to capitalise on the entire financial market which is a big field.

Each DeFI tries to do well with a specific purpose, they are like small lego blocks, combined together to create various different products. This is composability, the protocols can interact with each other and make the pie grows. Just like in order to make a delicious pie, we have to add more kinds of fillings. This is why it is so interesting and exciting.

On the protocol side, the protocols with all these little ecosystems and applications whose own community can grow by interacting together.

With the platform which is pretty neutral because they are technology, the added value from connecting buyers and sellers. If we look at economics, this is supply and demand, and they only make sense when there is equilibrium and interacting together.

The protocols/applications are trying to build to the playing field, from which suppliers and buyers can come to interact with each other. The more interactions, the more economic value added is created and the pie keeps growing.

**2. ¬† Experimenting with New Business Models**

According to the economics perspective, if you observe the previous business models, it is usually one-sided. Going back to the above example, if I make a cake, you go to a bakery and buy it, there is nothing more I can do like asking a few people to try a new or similar flavour. Supply and demand are still very dependent.

However, when we look back about 10 years ago, a new business model emerged called the platform. We have Amazon, AirBnb, Uber, etc. which provide the technology to connect the two sides of the ecosystem together to transact. This creates a lot of economic value.

Suppose I am an economist, the question is: how to quantify the economic value created? We can then calculate metrics like GDP, because it represents the growth of a platform.

With these values, you can calculate the value-added with all of these transaction fees. But there is a lot of intangible value being created in the ecosystem, which is connecting two sides of the platforms together for easier interaction. By reducing transaction costs, it increases economic value. This is what an economist observes and we are working on it. Specialities focus on the digital economy and how to compute them.

I realised that what we are doing with native tokens is considering how valuable they are to the ecosystem. Tokens can have a lot of utility and represent value. More specifically, these tokens are representing the value of some ecosystem.

That way, we are assigning a monetary policy value to the economies that the system is creating. And we can calculate metrics, like GDP. All of the above gets interesting.

**3. ¬† New P2P Incentive Models**

We are developing new p2p incentive models. One thing about decentralised finance as a whole is the complete elimination of middlemen. Instead of centralised power in one person/place, they are distributed equally to everyone. Now, we have more money to be distributed, instead of sending them to intermediaries. In traditional finance, for example, a public initially listed on a stock exchange must go through banks and pay them an expensive fee, but these are eliminated in decentralised finance, where those companies can list their tokens on dexes, provide liquidity, and lots of other incentives.

This is very interesting. We are phasing out intermediaries that are stealing a lot of money. But the bad thing is we have a lot of money not distributed: how do we allocate them? How do we reward the right types of people?

I would say that these will keep moving forward because we realise that capitalism does not work so much anymore and is not going to be sustainable in the long-term. That makes us look forward to new paradigms of capitalism, like social capitalism kind of thing.

We need to have lots of new p2p incentive models and the best place to test is DeFi which has liquidity farming, yield farming, etc. For these interesting mining and incentive mechanisms, we are trying to try many different incentive mechanisms and create many interesting future mechanisms.

# Future of DeFi

There are two things that we see in DeFi's future:

1. **On-chain Financial Experiments and Mechanisms to be used in TradFi**  
The first thing we are seeing in DeFI right now is that you don't have many transactions in the real world. That goes back to my point of the whole GDP accountability because we are trading nominal value, not much real value transactions since you exit the crypto space and transfer the money to the bank.  
Right now, everything is still within the on-chain sphere. DeFi's future is to allow these experiments and experiences to interact within the off-chain world. Because the off-chain world is very ineffective (like the financial system, the governance system, etc.).  
What we are trying to do now is to run all these little experiments/tests. If it works in on-chain well, we can extend to the off-chain world, creating a bridge to connect the 2 worlds. This is really interesting.
2. **Economic Valuation from Ecosystems**  
Second, we can now more easily calculate the economic values generated from specific individual ecosystems, while also moving them off-chain world and account for them in a much more equitable way. It leads to governance which has better resources/data points to be accounting for all these different changes in the world.

# Conclude

Here is a quick summary of the Ponzi Scam and DeFi and I would say that not all DeFi platforms are Ponzi Scam. One of them could be a scam and you need to check it out carefully. For non-scam projects, they are fun experiences. We need to learn to understand how it works and explore what kind of experiments capital allocation and governance system that could be.

Honestly, I am going to tell you that there is so much economics literature out there, talking about the technical and the academic aspects of all these experiments, but we never really had a chance to explore them. There are a lot of interesting monetary policy mechanisms in academic papers, but we don't really use them. We have a lot of dynamic variables in DeFi space and we can test these experiences.

In fact, in the economics space, a lot of people are experimenting with many different theories on DeFi and if it works which will lead to a huge change and bring DeFi even more powerful. Their users also become part of DeFi's future development. An example of a testnet is the experiments of crypto and crypto itself is the experiments of the off-chain world.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**:

DeFi is still in its early stages and it is still risky. There are scams here and there. But we should not use a few black sheep to define the space as a ponzi scam. DeFi will develop further in the future with better testing. And it is clear that its potential will develop very quickly later.

DeFi is innovating fast. We should analyse and exploit the strengths. Scam projects will still emerge. Our continuous education and knowledge will help reduce that.

**Get smart:** DeFi is not exactly a Ponzi Scam, it is still evolving and will have limitations in it.

**Get smarter:** The growth potential of DeFi is huge, we see the traditional financial system, the governance system is very ineffective. Thing resources are under-utilised and expensive. DeFi is trying this problem and if it succeeds it will be revolutionary.

# General Conclusion

Some people claim that DeFi is a scam ponzi because there are a lot of pumps and dumps. Everything on Twitter is shilling all kinds of different projects. Now there are a lot of risks involved, and the projects are not fully audited. So a lot of people are wondering this is a ponzi scam of part of the innovation cycle.

In this article, we will tell why DeFi is more than just a ponzi scam.

We cover 3 things today:

1. Why DeFi feels like Ponzi
2. Why DeFi is not Ponzi
3. Future of DeFi.

When talking about DeFi here, we are referring to the general ecosystem and not a single project, because the ecosystem is doing quite well in general.

Sure, there are some systems around the world with plenty of scams. This includes traditional financial market. But you cannot discredit the entire system because of a few black sheep.

DeFi is a new system and industry. There will be a few scams coming out but you cannot define this for the entire ecosystem, which is doing a lot of good and interesting things.

# DeFi and Ponzi

If you google the keyword ""DeFi and Ponzi"", you can see a lot of articles saying that DeFi is like Ponzi, just another name called, DeFi is basically ICO 2.0 where people are pumping and dumping, whale manipulation, etc.

**What it feels like:** Everything is just memes and a joke. Is this even serious? Why do I have to join? How is this legal and how can people make money? Projects with 100% APY; where does the money come from and why is it valuable? People just swapping or trading tokens together, but it was in a circle, a pyramid scheme.

**What it actually is:** Liquidity Mining (Synthetix) and Yield Farming (Compound) are ways to bootstrap growth and to reward a decentralised community to take ownership of the protocol. High rewards for risk takers in the early days is rationally sound. And when payout for the risk takers happen all at once, it feels like the APY is insanely high.

# Why DeFi is not Ponzi

**1. ¬† Grow the Pie**

Answer the above question briefly: this is not necessarily true. If you look at the distribution of the entire economic value as a pie, a ponzi scam is where you are extracting value every time someone is coming in. This means that the pie doesn't change much, you give your money to someone else to receive new tokens.

DeFi is like the pie, that keeps growing. There are many projects/protocols under construction, such as lending protocol, Dex protocol, portfolio asset management protocol, etc. They're in beta testing in this early stage and they do not try to capitalise on the entire financial market which is a big field.

Each DeFI tries to do well with a specific purpose, they are like small lego blocks, combined together to create various different products. This is composability, the protocols can interact with each other and make the pie grows. Just like in order to make a delicious pie, we have to add more kinds of fillings. This is why it is so interesting and exciting.

On the protocol side, the protocols with all these little ecosystems and applications whose own community can grow by interacting together.

With the platform which is pretty neutral because they are technology, the added value from connecting buyers and sellers. If we look at economics, this is supply and demand, and they only make sense when there is equilibrium and interacting together.

The protocols/applications are trying to build to the playing field, from which suppliers and buyers can come to interact with each other. The more interactions, the more economic value added is created and the pie keeps growing.

personalfinance,New hire who will report to me getting paid more than me ?,"I have been with this medical company for 3+ years. I started an entry level position and was promoted twice since then. I have 8-10 reps reporting to me. I was on leave for a couple weeks and upon my return I started to catch up with emails. HR lady CC me in the ‚ÄòWelcome‚Äô email to a new hire. I clicked on the attachments as I thought I had to approve him for access but instead find his offer letter attached. His offer was more than mine. This entry level new hire who will report to me, will get paid more than what I currently make! My first thought was confusion, why was he offered such a high amount? I asked my coworkers because I seriously thought something changed in my absence. We didn‚Äôt share salaries but they too gave me the impression this guys offer is more than theirs. I completed my associates and am still in school for my bachelors but this position I am in or the entry level, do not require a degree. I was curious and looked this guy up on linked in. From what it seems he is not bilingual like myself (which is one of the reasons I have my positions). I know how to do the job he will be doing (phone operator) and know how to do it well. (I take supervisor calls all the time). But what I‚Äôm more uncomfortable with is that I then find out he is the brother-in-law with one of the directors of marketing!

Of course, I was upset . I guess part of me is still confused. My boss just told me today how much she missed me while I was gone and has said multiple times I‚Äôm one of her best people. Just today I received a request from her to do an interview for recruitment marketing.

Because of covid, we are short staffed like many companies. But, could this be because favoritism and him being related to the marketing director or because we are short staffed? But why or how? I am taking my time to gather my thoughts before I call in a meeting. 

Please share any tips of how I can approach this?",finance
stocks,Inflationary Depression (Part 2): Inflation Before Recession,"Now a lot of what will be said here is not what you are used to seeing in the market news but bear with me. Some of this will be new because we *rarely* see inflationary depressions in countries who are a reserve currency (for those of you who do not know, the USA is a reserve currency). They are extremely rare (in the United States), and it takes a special set of circumstances to cause them. Read Part 1 on the sub BurryEdge to understand the bubble.

How is this bubble different?

The thing about Inflationary depressions is that the bubble leading up to an inflationary depression is extremely similar to a disinflationary depression such as 1929, 1999, 2008. These all came due to inflated assets that needed to come back down to earth. The 1999 crash is probably the most similar since it had relatively low household debt and it was caused by irrational exuberance. Currently we do not share the same debt to GDP that was seen in 2008 although it is beginning to climb (due to low interest rates and highly priced assets). 

&amp;#x200B;

So, without the internet mania of 1999 (you could argue tech has the same amount of hype but it‚Äôs not quite the same) why are we in such a huge asset bubble? Well, the reasoning is because as you can see in Part 1, we have been producing Money supply at all-time highs with the lowest interest rates this country has ever seen for the past 12 years (and it is again at 0%) with very little GDP Growth. 

As you can see the Fed has left interest rates near zero for most of the past 12 years and only briefly hitting 2.5% when it was raising rates. There is a similar trend in Quantitative Easing. Instead of tightening the money supply and selling the bonds back into the market the Fed has kept increasing the amount of assets held to 800 billion in 2008 to over 2 trillion now. Part of the reason for this is the taper tantrum in 2014 and the 2018 drop in stocks due to the 2.5% rate increase discussed earlier (also right before the Fed was supposedly going to unwind its balance sheet). What this shows me is that the market is coasting on the Fed right now and easy lending. 2018 is only a taste of what stocks will do if interest rates and tapering were to end. As with what was discussed in Part 1, the government is pumping money into this economy at all-time highs and the market has delivered in kind. This is just reinforcing the point that this market and the United States is being pushed up by Government Spending (as seen in Part 1) and Lax Monetary Policy.

**The Output Gap**

Well, I‚Äôm sure some of you are thinking that ‚Äújust because there is a large money supply doesn‚Äôt mean there will be large amounts of inflation and also none of this proves that the government is keeping the economy afloat‚Äù. 

Enter the output gap. The output gap is found by the following (Output is in reference to GDP):

Preferably we want the output gap to be equal to zero, this indicates that the market is operating efficiently. Now what if it isn‚Äôt zero?

A *negative output gap* indicates there‚Äôs slack in the economy as resources are being underutilized. The economy is performing below potential. And deflationary forces occur.

A *positive output gap* means any slack has evaporated and resources are being fully employed, maybe even to the point of overcapacity. In this case, the economy is performing above potential. Inflationary forces occur.

Currently according to the Fed, we are operating ‚Äúbelow‚Äù our potential GDP or at a negative output gap which was the case in *2020*. Now what is our potential GDP or how do we determine it. The way we determine potential GDP is by looking at Labor Supply Growth, Improvement of workforce quality, capital stock growth (machinery and equipment for and other capital investments such as infrastructure), technology advances that increase productivity, and increased availability of resources. GDP on the other hand is calculated by Consumption (C) plus Investment (I) plus Government spending (G) plus net exports. The point I am attempting to build up is that the Government is spending too much money and the output gap is actually *positive* due to an increase in real GDP and a decrease in potential GDP. To prove this, I will break down potential GDP:

*Potential GDP has decreased*

I am going to assume certain things will be at a fixed growth rate, technology that advances increased productivity, capital stock growth (it might increase but not substantially), and improvement of workforce quality (unlikely to change soon unless the US changes immigration laws), and the availability of natural resources (I don‚Äôt think this has changed much unless you count the current logistics shortages which is arguable, but I don‚Äôt believe it is a factor). 

So, let‚Äôs look at ‚ÄúGrowth in Labor Supply‚Äù. Our unemployment rate is not particularly high at 4.8% so your first instinct might be that our labor supply is growing, that is not the case. The labor force experienced the biggest dip in over 100 years, and it has not even gotten close to recovering to the pre-pandemic levels. Pre-pandemic labor force is roughly 164.5 million in February 2020, then an immediate drop to 158 million in April 2020, followed by an immediate increase to 160 million in July of 2020 and we are currently at 161.3 million over a year and a quarter later (at the current pace since July 2020 we would get back to the 2019 labor force around 2025). This shows that the current change in the labor force is permanent and will not bounce back as quickly as people thought. Hence reducing Growth in Labor Supply and the major key: the US Potential GDP is reduced.

So, if we look at the US GDP vs the Potential GDP (If this sub can‚Äôt post links/pictures, I highly suggest you go look at the chart for the US Real GDP vs US Potential GDP created by the Fed, as I will discuss that graph). If you look at the US GDP you will see that it is below the potential GDP but this is misconstrued because due to the permanent change in the United States Labor Supply we are actually producing more GDP than our Potential hence creating a positive output gap (hence why we are experiencing higher than usual inflation)! Also, as you can see, GDP is rapidly increasing which is just going to increase our current output gap. This causes inflation to occur.

Now to see it more visually, our long run aggregate supply is our potential output and it is to the left of the equilibrium of aggregate supply and demand, but our short-run aggregate has shifted to the left a little due to prices in raw materials, energy prices, wages, and soon to be increases in taxes and subsidies (we are beginning to see the shift to the long run aggregate supply), and our aggregate demand has shifted to the right due to increases in the M2. This gives us a chart similar to the chart pictured below, with the supply curve slowly shifting to the left (due to shortages) while the aggregate demand curve keeps shifting to the right as the government keeps increasing M2: 

As you can see this will cause prices to increase in the long run due to overstimulation by the United States Government and is the key to understanding our current inflation predicament.

*The Velocity of Money*

Well, why hasn‚Äôt the inflation been off the charts? With everything I have explained in the last 2 posts that must be your dying question. The answer to that is found in the velocity of money which is at the lowest point in history. But before we dive into the velocity of money, let‚Äôs look at the United States Savings Rate. US households have been saving at record levels, Americans haven‚Äôt saved more since the 1970s.

This indicates that the velocity of money is low AND there is still a large amount of money supply ready to be spent. The other thing we are seeing is that velocity of money might be at historical lows, but it has been moving that direction for years. 

This shows that for years that *investors* have been hoarding cash because the US treasury bond is not the place to invest due to interest rates being near zero for so long (check out graph 2), this has caused investors to hold onto liquid cash as a store of value (since they clearly aren‚Äôt spending it, and it doesn‚Äôt make much sense to invest in a treasury bond). 

Velocity of money did not just plummet from money supply increases but *also* plummeted due to the lockdowns provided by COVID. So, although in the past we have seen the velocity of money negate the money supply and keep inflation low, that is no longer the case. The problem now is that inflation has set in (due to the increase in money supply and a flat lined velocity of money) and now that has left the velocity of money to become a ticking time bomb for the United States. Usually, the money supply and velocity of money work inversely (there is no exact way to measure the velocity of money) but, as inflation picks up the inflationary psychology sets in which could cause consumers to start spending much more rapidly increasing the velocity of money. Basically, when consumers come to expect inflation then they will be much more likely to spend more money (increasing velocity of money). In extreme cases, money supply and velocity of money can increase at the same time leading to massive spikes in prices as found by this formula, (Money Supply \* Velocity of Money)/GDP = Price. Some economists like to say the velocity of money is constant, but this is not the case. The inflation mindset can set in very rapidly, leading to rapid increase in our current low levels of velocity of money, hence creating a facade of safety. But of course, consumers aren‚Äôt in the inflationary mindset \*sarcasm\* (just google ""consumers will shop earlier this holiday season""). 

**The Fed must react:**

So, what can the Fed do? They must taper rapidly and increase interest rates; this will cause markets to crash but on their current course this could have been avoided if they had done this sooner (basically they created an asset bubble and now they need to pop it). The Fed will start ‚Äúspeaking differently‚Äù while acting like there is inflation (basically the Fed will ensure everything is under control while their ‚Äúact‚Äù show things aren‚Äôt under control to stop the inflationary mindset from taking root and stopping the dollar from devaluing). The problem with tapering is this could cause capital flight as they (government) don‚Äôt want to increase interest rates as their deficits get out of control (lower interest rate means more government money to spend). Investors won‚Äôt be willing to buy US bonds though as real returns sink into the negatives, so the increase in interest rates will decrease government spending, at least hopefully (something to watch for). As markets crash along with other assets this will lead to another economic contraction.

The slower the Fed is to react the worse this will get as Congress passes budgets further stimulating the economy. If they wait too long to increase interest rates the velocity of money will pick up as inflation since the money supply is at insane levels, leading to extremely large increases in interest rates which can have a devastating effect on the economy. As the inflation mindset starts to take hold people will begin to shift money to commodities or spend it (as there is no reason to hold a devaluing currency) and due to the large amount of money supply, they have a lot of money to spend. Although this will slightly affect aggregate supply by increasing unemployment, it will crush inflation which can be much worse. This would cause assets to pop as debt becomes much more expensive and the discount rate increases. The Fed could also sell back the assets to the market, also decreasing the amount of ‚Äúprinted‚Äù money in circulation and reducing their budget (sorry I am pipe dreaming). The Fed does not seem interested in any of these measures currently though, as it is very hard to look at the congress that appointed you and tell them that you‚Äôre going to crash the market and truly act independent (Volcker deserves the world). If the Fed acts too slow or not at all, this could easily spiral into extreme inflation with extremely high interest rates (rather than moderate/controlled increases in interest rates by the Fed), and an extremely devalued currency leading to an impossibly uphill battle for the Fed in the future and a long term much worse outlook for society. This is the beginning of an inflationary recession.

In Part 3, I will discuss how to make money on how we expect markets to react to the resulting inflation that we expect to see and overall discussion about the current shortages (sorry, I said that would be in part 3 but I lied).

stocks,John Deere Workers Sure Look Like They‚Äôre About to Go on Strike,"John Deere workers are inching precipitously close to a strike after they overwhelmingly voted to reject a new six-year collective bargaining agreement that had been recommended by the union representing them, the United Auto Workers (UAW).

On Sunday, 90 percent of UAW voting members shot down the new agreement, which had been reached between the union and the tractor manufacturing company and had offered modest wage increases and enhanced retirement benefits that would have come at the expense of new hires. According to the Des Moines Register, pro-strike sentiment has been strong on the ground in Iowa, where union members have erected signs reading ‚ÄúREJECT THIS PIECE OF TRASH‚Äù and ‚ÄúYOU DESERVE BETTER.‚Äù According to a dispatch from Labor Notes, several union members also showed up to local meetings sporting ‚ÄúF*** No‚Äù t-shirts, and at least one member took up the microphone to say that the only thing the agreement was good for was ‚Äúwiping my ass.‚Äù

Now, unless an agreement is reached by the new strike deadline imposed by the UAW of 11:59pm on Wednesday, October 13, more than 10,000 Deere workers at nine locals in Iowa, Illinois, and Kansas are set to walk off the job in what would amount to the largest private-sector strike since the 40-day walkout staged by UAW workers employed by GM in 2019.

Officials at John Deere have, thus far, signaled a willingness to keep negotiations going, telling the Register in a statement that the company ‚Äúremains fully committed to continuing the collective bargaining process in an effort to better understand our employees‚Äô viewpoints,‚Äù and saying that operations ‚Äúwill continue as normal‚Äù in the meantime. But according to internal company emails reviewed by Labor Notes, the company also seems to be increasingly looking to hire white-collar workers in an active effort to ‚Äúcast a broader net to fill critical factory positions in the case of a work stoppage.‚Äù

In addition to setting itself up for one of the biggest labor showdowns in recent memory during a year that has already been rife with worker unrest, labor shortages, and strike efforts, John Deere has also recently emerged as a critical battleground for national right-to-repair laws. Because of its refusal to allow farmworkers to repair their own equipment, the company is frequently seen as being at the heart of the struggle against manufacturing repair monopolies and was referenced as such by Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders during his doomed campaign for the presidency in 2019.

‚ÄúIn rural America today, farmers can‚Äôt even repair their own tractors or other equipment because of the greed of companies like John Deere,‚Äù Sanders wrote at the time, vowing that if he became president, he would ‚Äúpass a national right-to-repair law that gives every farmer in America full rights over the machinery they buy.‚Äù

Under the administration of President Joe Biden, right-to-repair has seen several modest victories recently, including a sweeping executive order that directed the Federal Trade Commission to draft regulations that limit the ability of companies like Deere to restrict independent repairs of their products.

personalfinance,26 years old and in debt. I could really use some advice on how drastic my measures should be to get out of it.,"New reddit account because I'm embarrassed and don't want this linked to any personal info.

**Situation:**

As the title says I'm 26 in about 13 500 debt on a line of credit (6.940 percent). I also owe just over 17 000 on my truck (will be paid off in 2.5 years). I make 70 000 a year which translates to 3740 monthly income. It's a long story about how I got here which includes bad financial decisions, car trouble, leaving post secondary education, and phase of excessive drinking to deal with some things. I live with my girlfriend who is a student and is able to contribute 400 dollars a month.

**Breakdown:**

Income:  
3740  
400

Expenses:  
950 Rent  
263 Bi-weekly truck payment  
185 Electricity  
135 Vehicle and Renter's insurance  
100 Internet  
300 Gas  
600 Groceries  
20 Streaming services  
20 Bank Fees  
70 Phone Bill

Bottom line is I should still have about 1200 a month left over to pay down debt and buy things I need.

**Problems:**

I can't seem to make it work which is ridiculous I know. I tried for long time paying 500ish a month to decrease the balance on the LOC, and expenses seem to jump out of everywhere. Glasses, new truck tires (1100), maintenance, having to fly out to wedding to be the best man, clothes are falling apart etc. A lot of it is my personal failings too, I work a lot of hours and sometimes just can't bring myself to cook so I go for a faster option. I also still like drinking beer on weekends and I have a high tolerance so it adds up pretty fast. I have a difficult time not drinking as it's the ultimate stress reliever for me. I work out often and hard but it's just not the same. I also feel pressure to buy gifts for birthdays/holidays and treat my GF to things (pressure I put on myself, she is a sweetheart). Also if I don't keep a close eye on groceries I can easily blow past 600 dollars with the price of food nowadays. I also feel intense shame and feelings of dread regarding this topic so I ignore it when I shouldn't and can be careless. It kills me because I'm a pretty responsible guy in most other areas of life, I do well at work, stay in shape and stay on top of most other things. It seems like it only takes a couple minutes of weakness to set myself back a month of paying off the LOC.

**The Good:**

I'm lucky to have a pretty good federal job so I have a pension. It's value is approximately 80-90k at the moment, however this is untouchable unless I leave the job. I also was selected for a program to return to school while they continue paying my salary and my books and tuition. I am currently working on an engineering degree which will increase my pay once I move into a new position (not for 5 years or so). My truck has 90 000kms on it but I expect it to go well over 300 000kms as I keep it immaculately maintained. Private sale my 2017 goes for about 25-28k, if I was to trade it in I would get about 15-18k.

**My Thoughts:**

Do I sell the truck to free up more monthly income and save on gas? Or do I weather the storm and in 2.5 years have a fantastic reliable vehicle that's paid off? My GF is finishing school this semester and will be able to contribute more once she gets a job which will help alleviate my financial stress. Do I stop drinking all together and save a couple hundred a month? (I'm also extremely social so this would be hard on that front too) Not go to weddings? I am just unsure of the best plan. Paying down the LOC works for a while, then expenses come flying at me and it builds up again. This debt has been hanging over me for a long time now and I am getting increasingly disheartened that buying a house, getting married, and other goals I have are getting kicked further and further down the line. Any advice would be appreciated, please be blunt. Thank you for reading.",finance

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. dcSpark is unveiling a sidechain project called Milkomeda that will use wrapped ADA and so-called ‚Äúwrapped smart contracts‚Äù. The first sidechain, M1, will be an Ethereum Virtual Machine sidechain. This means Solidity devs can deploy their current smart contract code in M1 and those smart contracts will be accessible to Cardano users. This is ‚Äúthe pond‚Äù. This will be HUGE! Good work dcSpark! You guys are killing it!

34. Only 5 more days to Alonzo (as of Sept. 7)!
35. Despite all the negative posting about Cardano smart contracts on eUTxO, it ironically looks like some in the ETH community are actually trying to build ETH L2 on UTXO. [https://twitter.com/matiwinnetou/status/1434570158853529606](https://twitter.com/matiwinnetou/status/1434570158853529606)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhujKbMpTEA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhujKbMpTEA)
39. Weiss Crypto lays down yet another very positive thread about Cardano. They acknowledge that they can‚Äôt see the future of Cardano, but they vehemently reject a lot of the anti-hype.

46. A Weiss Crypto analyst calls the smart contract launch an alleged event and also doesn‚Äôt realize we already have NFTS. The Cardano community was quick to correct the analyst. Weiss was then also quick to apologize.

49. One of Cardano‚Äôs biggest competitors is once again suffering network problems. This time it started out as just being characterized as (more) ‚Äúinstability‚Äù, then they started saying that something had caused the blockchain to ‚Äústart forking‚Äù. This followed their September 2 ‚Äúinstability‚Äù and ‚Äúperformance degradation‚Äù event. It‚Äôll be interesting to see how well their community tolerates this in the future if it‚Äôs happening with their planned slashing model in effect.

55. Now one of Cardano‚Äôs most highly visible critics is implying that the Cardano community has something in common with anti-vaxxers. Unfortunately for him, it was one of his pet blockchains that was down a few days ago while Cardano just kept healthily trucking right along.

61. After the Senate hearing on Tuesday September 14th, Gary Gensler (SEC Chairman) gave a quote to a crypto publication indicating that custodial lending and possibly even staking platforms might be considered securities. This is very relevant for Cardano since it has non-custodial staking whereas many of its competitors have the kind of custodial staking that Gensler may have been contemplating.

worldpolitics,Clean Arctic,"The Arctic zone of Russia covers the territory from the Murmansk region to Chukotka with a  
strip of more than 2 thousand kilometers. There is no need to talk a lot about  
the riches of the Arctic shelf. According to the Ministry of Natural Resources  
of the Russian Federation, the oil reserves of the Russian Arctic are 7.3  
billion tons, and the reserves of natural gas are 55 trillion m3. Also along  
the northern shores of Russia is the Northern Sea Route, which may well compete  
with the Suez Canal. Naturally, the desire of the Russian government to prove  
that the underwater ridges of the Lomonosov and Mendeleev are of continental  
origin associated with the territory of Russia is categorically opposed by  
other Arctic players, especially the United States. Hence the constant  
accusations against the Kremlin of aggressiveness and expansionism. In  
addition, the US leadership, without providing any direct evidence, declares  
that the Russian presence in the Arctic is causing irreparable harm to the  
ecology of the region.  
However, since 2012, a large ‚Äúgeneral cleaning‚Äù has been underway in the Arctic, initiated by  
the Russian side. For 8 years, about 90 thousand tons of waste have been  
removed and disposed of from the Arctic territories. First of all, this is  
technogenic waste - equipment that has served its time, abandoned buildings,  
remnants of communications, fuel containers, etc.  
In addition, since 2019, Rosneft and the Russian Arctic National Park have been conducting  
the Clean Arctic environmental project to restore Arctic ecosystems. Some of  
the best Russian specialists in the field of geology, chemistry, biology, and  
geography take part in the program. So, on October 11, 2021, it became known  
that within the framework of the project, volunteers of the Clean Arctic collected  
50 tons of waste in Karelia. As a result of the work, the participants  
liquidated a dump near the village of Letnerechensky in the Belomorsky District  
and cleared the path leading to the archaeological complex included in the  
UNESCO World Heritage List in 2021 - the White Sea petroglyphs.  
And the Russian leadership does not plan to stop there. The strategy for the development of the  
Arctic zone of the Russian Federation and ensuring national security for the  
period up to 2035 involves the creation of a unified state system for  
preventing and responding to emergencies, liquidating oil and oil products  
spills, including in the waters of the Northern Sea Route and other sea  
transport corridors. In addition, Russian ecologists plan to create specially protected  
natural areas, identify and organize work to eliminate environmental damage,  
and prevent highly toxic and radioactive substances from entering the Arctic  
zone.  
Thus, the ongoing activities and projects planned for the future indicate that the Russian  
side is not just concerned about the environmental situation in Artik, but is  
also ready to throw all its efforts into preserving the environment in the  
region. This once again proves that all accusations from the United States are  
absolutely groundless.",energy

I‚Äôm a resident physician who makes less than $70,000 (filing single) and wondering if it would be worth it to make a $2500 one-time payment before the end of the year on my student loans to qualify for the deduction?  I have federal loans under an Income-Based Repayment plan and payments/interest have been on pause for most of my residency due to the pandemic.  I consolidated my loans under IBR prior to starting my job in 2019 (when my then-current yearly income was still $0) and then the pandemic happened 8 months later, so I‚Äôve actually never made a loan payment.

CryptoCurrency,The impact of crypto in the third world - An Argentinian Story,"&gt;*A few days ago I saw a post about crypto in the third world an I wanted to share the full Argentinian experience.*

*Let's first get a little of context:*

* **we live in a country with 50% inflation, 40% poverty, where the minimum monthly wage is 170 USD which continues to deteriorate more and more as inflation doesn't its thing and with an increasingly high level of crime**.
* The price of most goods is yet equal or even higher than the US. Forget about owning a house, car, even getting decent quality clothes.
* 50% of workers are not registered, and the ones that are are forced to take part in a public retirement plan that currently has no funds, a ponzi scheme basically.
* Here the monetary policy has been for as farther back in history as I can recall to simply **take debt at** ***almost credit card rates*** **and crank ""money"" printing to as much as the machines can handle**.

Not only that but the level of control that the government excerpts over the financial decisions of people is ***disgusting***:

* We the peolple almost can't buy real currencies like USD to protect us from inflation unless we do it in dark markets. If we by USD form banks we are charged 70% in taxes (which funny enough politicians don't have to pay)
* We can't deposit it dollars in banks because funds have been stolen before and if we instead were to have them in our houses we are exposed to the high levels of crime.
* If we even get to save some money we cant even choose to take the long term approach to protect us from inflation and invest our money in stocks because 90% of people aren't able to reach the minimum cost of entry or due to high government regulations which make it near impossible to invest outside the country.

# Even a poor homeless people has to pay 21% of taxes on food they can't even afford.

It is in this context that the daily Argentinian life happens and yet somehow some of us manage to get enough money to make it to next month with the uncertainty of what will happen next month.

&gt;**It is as if we were trying to make a house on top of quicksand.**

And is in this context of such high poverty that crypto enters our lives in numerous ways, but the main one is by allowing us to:

* buy stablecoins that we can quite safely store without the high risk of theft and deposit/farm them to gain interests;
* Invest it in small fractions of mirrored stock assets.
* Hedge non inflationary assets like BTC by borrowing against them

Not only that but some of us even make a full time job of playing videogames like Axie Infinity, getting tipped crypto.

&gt;This is no joke and I cant stress it enough, **some of us can put food in their families table because they play some silly game over the internet**. For some people getting tipped silly meme coins determines whether or not they will be able to have money to save at the end of the month.

Personally I managed to find a way to sell some merch through a meme coin sub (and farming them) that allowed me to save enough money so I can work editing content for social media productions. *But I consider myself an extremely privileged person as most of us can't access a computer to buy crypto or even save enough to buy crypto*\*\*. Fuck the cities are full of people looking something to it in garbage bins\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

I hope you found the post informing and interesting, this isn't a beg post of any sort I just wanted to share my experience of the harsh argentinian reality.

Much love! Take care of your families and dont take unecessarily risky finantial decisions!

*****

&gt; # 1. Wall Street looks to avoid a four-session losing streak

&gt; * U.S. stock futures were essentially flat Wednesday after Dow stock JPMorgan Chase reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue and ahead of key inflation data. Shares of JPMorgan rose modestly in the premarket as third-quarter results from the bank were supported by a $1.5 billion boost from better-than-expected loan losses.

&gt; * The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq all dropped Tuesday for the third straight session. The modest losses indicated that investors were in a wait-and-see mode ahead of earnings season really kicking into high gear.

&gt; * Shares of Delta Air Lines dipped in the premarket after the carrier on Wednesday reported that third-quarter earnings and revenue topped expectations. It was Delta‚Äôs first quarterly profit without taking federal aid into account since the start of the pandemic. However, it was still below 2019 pre-Covid levels.

*****

&gt; # 2. Supply chain woes, rising costs may make for rocky earnings

&gt; * Supply chain issues, labor shortages and higher energy prices are making this a very difficult quarter to model. As of Tuesday, 22 companies that are early reporters beat estimates by 11%, according to Nick Raich, CEO of The Earnings Scout. While this is above the traditional beat of 3% to 5%, it‚Äôs far below the average of prior quarters this year, including the roughly 18% beat for the second quarter. Third-quarter estimates, which had been rising steadily for months, have stopped in the last few weeks.

The government at 8:30 a.m. ET releases the September consumer price index. Economists expect headline CPI and core CPI, which excludes the food and energy sectors, to be around the prior month‚Äôs year-over-year increases of 5.3% and 4%, respectively. The Federal Reserve at 2 p.m. ET releases minutes from its policy meeting in September when central bankers indicated they expect to begin reducing monthly asset purchases ‚Äúsoon,‚Äù but did not say when.

&gt; # 4. White House aims to help key West Coast ports stay open 24/7

&gt; * President Joe Biden will unveil a plan Wednesday to try to ease West Coast port backlogs by expanding round-the-clock operations. The Port of Los Angeles is expected to announce a shift to 24/7 operations, following a similar transition by the Port of Long Beach in California last month. Central to this plan to ease supple chain disruptions are commitments by some of the nation‚Äôs leading retailers and shippers, including FedEx, UPS, Walmart and Home Depot, to increase overnight and off-hours operations at the ports to get the goods to market. Together, the ports account for about 40% of the shipping containers entering the United States.

&gt; # 5. U.S. to reopen land borders in November for fully vaccinated

&gt; * The U.S. said Wednesday it will reopen its land borders to nonessential travel next month, ending a 19-month freeze due to Covid as the nation moves to require all international visitors to be vaccinated. Vehicle, rail and ferry travel between the U.S. and Canada and Mexico has been largely restricted to essential travel since the earliest days of the pandemic. The latest move follows last month‚Äôs announcement that the U.S. will end country-based travel bans for air travel and instead require Covid shots for foreign nationals seeking to enter by plane.

CryptoCurrency,"Thought experiment on bulls, bears, and inflation","Let's consider a thought experiment, with a set of fictional assumptions, to explain why prices may go up in bear markets. Then it is up to you to consider if we are in bear, bull, crab, or anything else.

Let's assume that:

1. At January 1st 2022 BTC is the only crypto still in use, i.e. it represents the entire crypto market, congratulations BTC maxis!
1. At January 1st 2022 the price of 1 BTC is $100K.
1. At January 1st 2022 there are $20T as total supply from the FED.
1. At January 1st 2023 the total supply of USD has increased to $40T, steadily over 2022. ""The money printer goes brrr!""
1. At January 1st 2023 the price of 1BTC has increased steadily to $150K.

Is that a bull or a bear market?

1. Some will say that BTC gained 50% in 2022, certainly bull. You only need to see all the green candles and the higher price tag.
1. Some will say that BTC lost 25% in 2022, certainly bear. You have to understand against what are you measuring the value of 1 BTC.
1. Some will say that these assumptions make no sense, that I am full of shit, and just DCA and HODL and you will be fine.
1. Some will say that who cares about BTC, DOGE to the Moon!
1. Some will say something else, surprise me in the comments.

personalfinance,Take out new loan to pay off old debt?,"Would love some advice! So a few years ago, when I was down on my luck, I had to take out some loans and max out my credit card just to get by. I was gifted with some pretty high interest rates and I was no stranger to missed payments. My credit score dropped very low, of course.

Fast forward to today, I‚Äôm making much more money and have actually managed to cut my living expenses some. I haven‚Äôt missed a payment in about a year and my credit score is almost back in great standing. That being said, it‚Äôs still going take me to about the end of 2022/early 2023 to get the acquired debt paid off. 

I‚Äôm wondering if it would be worth it to take out another loan in order to pay off the current loan &amp; credit card debt? Because of my change in financial situation, I now qualify for loans with a much smaller interest rate &amp; monthly payment. Is it better for me to take out the loan, pay off my debts, and only have to worry about this one loan payment going forward (rather than the 4 that I have now)? My concern is that getting the new loan will tank my score (between the hard pull &amp; the new account), if I pay off my other loans though‚Äîwill it help create a balance?

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you!

ETA more details: I owe about $8k+ on the 4 total debts right now. I‚Äôm paying about $630/month on average to pay them down. The interest rates range from 17.73%-26.99%

One of the new loans I saw I qualified for: I could get a loan for that amount with just a 9.95% and $170/month payment (which I would totally allocate a bit more to a month so that I pay it off sooner).",finance

CryptoCurrency,Birth gift of crypto- hold for 18 years,"My brother in law and his girlfriend had their baby today. In their country, it is customary to gift a savings account to the kid to grow over the years, until he turns 18. I find this a beautiful gesture but with interest rates where they are, the kid will probably end up owing money when he turns 18. I want to do the same thing, but with crypto. 

My knowledge of crypto is quite limited. I have had some BTC and ETH since 2017, rode the NANO wave back when it was Raiblocks. My main strategy has been to just buy and hold. 

Given this, I wanted to gift a wallet with BTC and give him the private key on his 18th birthday. However, I know that Bitcoin is almost old-fashioned and there are newer flashier projects that also allow for staking. So my question to the community:

&amp;#x200B;

If you could choose any crypto asset to lock up for 18 years, which one(s) would you choose?

&amp;#x200B;

\-His crypto, his keys

\-If it's staking, I want on-chain staking. No platforms/exchanges that might go bankrupt and lose everything.

|Asking Price|$184,900|
|Buying Price|$188,500|
|Interest Rate (locked until 28 Oct.)|2.875%|

The issue is that a few major repairs came up during the inspection. The two biggest are termite damage and a leaking bathroom floor that will require essentially an entire bathroom remodel. The seller has agreed to pay the $15,000 it costs to repair, and they estimate it will take 3 weeks.

The bank I'm financing the (30 year, conventional) loan through, however, is mandating that the repairs be done before closing. However, 3 weeks from now is past the 28 October deadline that my rate is locked in at.

So, they say the new rate is now 3.375% (!!!). Feels a little strange that they can't hold the old rate for just one more week. Has this happened to anyone else before? What would you recommend doing in this situation?

**Edit:** We are actually still closing on the 27th of October. However, the bank will not disburse the funds to the seller until after the repairs are done. The terms of my lock-in agreement state that the rate expires unless it closes *and* the money is disbursed.

&amp;#x200B;

This also means that if the repairs took, say, a month, my new rate could *also* expire, even after I closed! This seems very wrong to me - why would closing and signing a contract not come with a guaranteed rate?",finance
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, October 13, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, October 13, 2021**

***Hey Psychos!! Today's recap is a bit longer than usual because there was a lot of really important information released. I urge you to read until the end, especially the part regarding the CPI.***

Stocks finished mostly even, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) leading the day as market participants digested the start of earnings season, the consumer and producer price indexes, which showed an acceleration in inflation, and the Federal Reserve‚Äôs September meeting minutes, which are basically notes of what was discussed in the meeting. 

While supply-side disruptions have been going on since the beginning of the pandemic (when the world was essentially forced to shut down overnight), recent developments reflect the extent of these disruptions heading into the holidays, by far the busiest season for retailers. Due to congestions in the ports and sky-high shipping rates, companies like Target (TGT), Costco (COST), and Walmart (WMT) have resorted to chartering their own ships and diverting the usual routes to less congested ports. In a statement, Target recently said ‚ÄúAs co-managers of the ship, we can avoid delays from additional stops and steer clear of particularly backed-up ports.‚Äù

In addition, President Biden met with leaders from the Port of Los Angeles, the Port of Long Beach, and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union to discuss supply chain issues at the ports. In the end, the parties agreed to expand port operations activities to be 24/7 nationwide. 

The latest batch of economic data due Wednesday confirmed that these supply and demand mismatches translated to ongoing inflationary pressures.  Labor Department's Consumer Price Index, core prices, excluding food and energy, rose by 4.0% in September over last year, coming down only slightly from June's 30-year high of 4.5%. And a broader measure of consumer prices including all categories rose 5.4% in September compared to last year, coming in at the fastest pace since 2008. Please, before you ask why food and energy are excluded from core CPI, read the exact reason by the Federal Reserve below. 

To understand why the categories of food and energy are more sensitive to price changes and thus not useful measures when considering broad inflationary measures, consider environmental factors that can ravage a year‚Äôs crops or fluctuations in the oil supply resulting from the OPEC cartel. Each is an example of a supply shock that may affect the prices for that product. However, although the prices of those goods may frequently increase or decrease at rapid rates, the price disturbances may not be related to a trend change in the economy‚Äôs overall price level. Instead, changes in food and energy prices often are more likely related to temporary factors that may reverse themselves later. Basically, including food and energy prices economists may be fooled into believing that general prices are rising or falling more rapidly than they really are

Please, I urge you to read the Fed‚Äôs exact reasoning as to why Core CPI is taken as the real measure of inflation, I‚Äôve seen a TON of misinformation spreading about this across social media. Core CPI has been calculated the exact same way for decades, I don‚Äôt understand why it became so controversial this year. Please read to link below, it is fundamentally necessary for us market participants to understand how this works. 

[https://www.frbsf.org/education/publications/doctor-econ/2004/october/core-inflation-headline/](https://www.frbsf.org/education/publications/doctor-econ/2004/october/core-inflation-headline/)

In the latest monthly monetary policy meeting, the Fed signaled it would likely begin reducing the pace of asset-purchasing by $15 billion per month starting in November or December. As a reminder, since early on in the pandemic, the Fed implemented a program of quantitative easing at a clip of $120 billion per month. This is exactly what I said would happen last month, and it seems the market already priced this in. Like I have said multiple times before, I remain bullish until the Fed begins discussing raising the interest rate. 

Q3 earnings season kicked off with JP Morgan (JPM), the largest bank in the US, and BlackRock (BLK), the largest asset management company in the world, reporting earnings. Both smashed earnings estimates. Here are the numbers

**JP Morgan - JPM**

* Revenue of $30.44 billion v $29.8 billion expected
* Earnings per share of $3.74 v $3 expected

**BlackRock - BLK**

* Asset Under Management (AUM): $9.46 trillion v $7.81 trillion last year
* Revenue of $5.1 billion v $4.9 billion expected
* Earnings per share of $10.95 v $9.54

Wall Street analysts are looking for third-quarter earnings growth of about 27% on a year-over-year basis, [according to FactSet data. ](https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_100821.pdf)Though this would still be the third-fastest earnings growth rate since 2010, it would be a marked slowdown from the second quarter's nearly 90% pace.

CryptoCurrency,Altcoin Fundamental Analysis 101: How to Avoid Losers and Pick Winners,"**TL;DR: Professional altcoin researchers like** [**Crypto Pragmatist**](https://cryptopragmatist.com/sign-up/) **and** [**Blocmates**](https://www.blocmates.com/) **understand three fundamental things a cryptocurrency before investing in it: the value proposition,  the supply and demand, and the stakeholders behind it.**

&amp;#x200B;

**The Universal Law of Crypto**

People who simply knew of and understood crypto in its early days have now been rewarded with hundreds of billions of dollars of wealth. And while crypto price action has been volatile, the industry has been consistent in two things since its inception:

1. **Those who understand cryptocurrencies have been financially rewarded.**
2. **Those who invest in cryptocurrencies without understanding have been financially punished.**

&amp;#x200B;

**The Three Rules for Altcoin Analysis**

If knowledge inefficiency allows us to create outsized returns for our portfolio, then the way to create reliable alpha (excess ROI) is to set up a repeatable process where we can research and understand cryptocurrencies. Fundamental analysis is difficult, but it does not require special education, exclusive information, or super-genius level brains.

&gt;**In today's market conditions, any halfway-clever investor can perform research that will allow them to generate better-than-average returns on their cryptocurrency portfolios.**

In my time as as an Altcoin Research Analyst, I've established a simple fundamental framework I go through to perform basic prospecting on all of the cryptocurrencies I research.

While this framework isn't comprehensive, it is a starting point that will give you a solid foundation for better understanding cryptocurrencies, and thus, make better investing decisions. I've broken it down into three rules: three questions to which you must have answers.

If you have a strong grasp on how these three rules apply to the altcoin you're researching, you are well on your way to making a good, informed investing decision for the given cryptocurrency.

&amp;#x200B;

The single most important thing to understand in a cryptocurrency is how it provides value for its users. This can often be distilled down to just a few words or sentences, but it sometimes can be tricky to wrap your head around.

We'll take a look at a few of the biggest cryptos for inspiration:

* **Bitcoin:** ‚Äúa decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on a peer-to-peer network without the need for intermediaries.‚Äù
* **Ethereum:** ‚Äúa decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality.‚Äù
* **Polkadot:** ‚Äúa blockchain network that connects, builds, and hosts blockchains.‚Äù

Conversely, many cryptos thought to be poor investments have flimsy (or sometimes no) value propositions

* **Bitconnect:** Crypto‚Äôs most famous scam intended to ‚Äúbuild trust and reputation in bitcoin and cryptocurrency ecosystem with Open-source platform.‚Äù (What does that even mean?)
* **Safemoon:** When you start diving into Safemoon‚Äôs documentation, you find a lot more related to their tokenomics (burning and redistributing sold Safemoon) than the value it hopes to add to the world.

https://preview.redd.it/1r6br9s5cat71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18b469595ee9b91d23ef919287f1f116d84f2ba1

If you couldn't explain to your Mom/Dad/Relative how this might add value to the world, it's a signal you need do more research and reading. White papers, the foundational documents of cryptos, are pretty helpful in this respect, (look up ""target cryptocurrency"" + white paper to find it) although they can be quite dense. Project roadmaps, often hosted on the crypto's official website are helpful as well.

Explore your curiosity and dive into what you don't understand. This is not the time to be shy or embarrassed about what you don't get, you're going to be putting your hard-earned money on the line: Twitter, Reddit, and Discord are all your friends.

Understanding how a crypto creates value allows you to:

1. Establish a thesis for why the crypto will rise in value
2. Determine when that thesis has been invalidated

This value proposition will serve as the foundation for the rest of your research.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/biezm9n9cat71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f804555dca5d8c60c3a2b69eafbe20d46dbdb5c5

It‚Äôs not enough that a cryptocurrency simply adds value to the world: it must have incentives built in to facilitate increasing demand that outpaces supply.

**Success Stories:**

Bitcoin and Ethereum are both successful examples of cryptocurrencies that have created markets where demand eclipses supply, which causes price to appreciate. Bitcoin has accomplished the feat by creating a solid monetary policy base (slowly decreasing mining rewards and a capped supply).

Ethereum has started to burn Eth tokens since the EIP-1559 hard fork was activated, creating a deflationary supply while network activity continues to increase, driving demand. Before the EIP-1559, Eth's supply still outpaced demand thanks to high network activity across DeFi platforms, NFT minting, peer-to-peer transactions, and other tokens that existed on the network. Exchange token FTX uses network proceeds to buy back and burn tokens, creating deflationary pressure that in theory causes the price to rise.

**Lessons:**

There are plenty examples of misaligned supply/demand pressures as well. Yield Farm/DeFi platform Iron Finance had a ‚Äòbank run‚Äô style collapse on on June 16th, 2021. The cause of the collapse? Poor management of supply and demand. Too much of the native farm token (TITAN) flooded the market as TITAN holders were not sufficiently incentivized to hold.

Since it was used as collateral for the yield farms, the entire ecosystem fell apart. To avoid a fate like that of Iron Finance investors, make sure you understand exactly why investors may choose to buy, hold, and sell a token.

White Papers are one way to understand these dynamics, while simply taking part in the ecosystem helps you get an intimate understanding of the incentives that affect market participants.

You can also take a look at CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap to see how much of a given coin has been mined (and thus how much it will be diluted). Total Value Locked (TVL) shows you how many dollars of a given asset is secured inside of a protocol, hypothetically showing you how much that protocol might generate in revenue and how confident players are in the protocols permanence.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dhskawxacat71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2785972d257f7ee4e2e49d8cd09bf108cbef6175

Why is Ethereum such a strong investment? It‚Äôs constantly being criticized for its slow transactions, its high fees, and it‚Äôs develop first/fix later, it‚Äôs managed to attract thousands of the most talented developers, marketers, artists, and community builders in the world. Nonetheless, it's the king of altcoins.

**Team**

Every individual working on Ethereum or on any project around Ethereum is creating value for Ethereum holders. Lending platforms like AAVE, NFT platforms like OpenSea, and Level Two (L2) ecosystems like $MATIC are all built on top of Ethereum. People building on Ethereum creates network effects that make other people want to build their platforms on Ethereum, which brings more smart, talented people ad infitum. The lesson? Work to understand who is working on a platform and why they are there.

Does the core team have a strong background in blockchain tech? Can you watch interviews or check their social media to get a feel for them? Are they transparent and accessible or mysterious and elusive? All of these can help us get a better feel for the project.

**Team Incentives**

We also must understand the stakeholders‚Äô incentives. Some projects (Decentraland is one that comes to mind) have gotten criticism recently, as vesting has ended and now the founders now have access to all of the tokens that were once locked up. Because the founders won‚Äôt be rewarded with any meaningful quantity of new tokens, and the project‚Äôs market cap is around $1 billion, there‚Äôs not as much incentive for the founders to be working hard on development.

**Whale Wallets**

Finally, we should look at whale wallets: who are the biggest holders? Why do they hold so much of the currency? Is their stake large enough to manipulate the supply?

Dogecoin gets a lot of this criticism: thanks to the miracle of public ledgers, we can see how much of a given currency the biggest whales own. The top 11 Dogecoin whales own around 47% of the total supply, meaning they could easily influence the price of the currency should they choose. The top Ethereum wallet, in comparison, owns a mere 1.65% of the total Ethereum supply. It‚Äôs easy to understand which coin is less likely to be manipulated.

Team info can be found by poking around Twitter and the team pages of official project sites. Info on incentives is often found on Medium, while whale wallet data can be found by poking around on blockchain explorers and on-chain analytics platforms.

&amp;#x200B;

**Picking Winners**

This framework is not a silver bullet, but it is a simple, replicable process for understanding cryptocurrencies that can be applied at any point in a market cycle to drastically decrease your probability of picking duds while simultaneously increasing your probability of picking the rare 1000x investment when it does come along.

economy,Next global financial crisis just started,"These conditions are called ""perfect storm"" so when smaller issues combine and lead to big problems. The pandemic caused disbalances in supply and demand and disruptions of the supply chains. We see them now as the demand exploded with the reopening of the global economy. This is temporary as the supply chains will be restored for several months. But right now there is deficit of free capacity in almost every point of the supply lines. That leads to significant delays. And although the global production and the demand are in general in tact, the prices rise as there is deficit of directly available goods in the warehouses. And people need and want their purchases now. Meanwhile comes the next problem. In the past few years China and in general the big economies in Asia started the shift to green energy. And the major part of that shit is replacement of the coal and diesel with natural gas. Meanwhile the unstable weather in US and specially in EU emptied the gas storages. And now with the rebound of the global industrial production and need of more energy, the prices of the natural gas skyrocketed. And that pushes the inflation even higher. As the interest rates are still relatively low, like they were in the entire past decade, Fed and ECB will not have a choice, but to suppress the demand so to tame the inflation by rising the interest rates. And that will blow all the balloons. Even now many companies make long term investments although the higher global demand is a temporary event,  but there are balloons in property prices, so mortgages, in private debt in general, in stock markets, literally everywhere, as in the last decade the money was cheap.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Washington State Senator Working with TREASURY Department on Crypto Regulation,"A couple of months back, I reached out to Senator Patty Murray of Washington State, to raise concerns about the Crypto legislation that was embedded in the Infrastructure bill that eventually passed. Senator Murray finally got back to me with some positive(IMO) news. I've copy and pasted her response below; 

Dear Mr. OP,

Thank you for contacting me regarding cryptocurrency provisions and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). I appreciate hearing from you on this important matter.

As a long-time senior member of the Senate Committee on the Budget and the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, I have always understood that our infrastructure is a critical national asset. The roads, bridges, transit systems, rails, airports, and waterways that span our country support tremendous economic activity‚Äîmoving millions of people, goods, and commodities across the country every day. It has always been, and will continue to be, essential that we make the necessary investments to ensure our infrastructure can keep supporting these vital activities, assuring that we can continue to compete in the global economy into the future.

Regarding cryptocurrency - as you know, the amendment proposed by Senators Wyden, Toomey, and Lummis aimed to narrow the definition of brokers subject to new IRS reporting requirements outlined in the original bill. However, the amendment was not adopted and IIJA advanced to the House as written. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and the Treasury Department to ensure that cryptocurrency regulations promote tax fairness, strike the appropriate information reporting balance and spur innovation in this emerging industry.

I was proud to vote to pass the IIJA. This is a major bipartisan infrastructure bill which includes the largest-ever federal investments in our roads, public transit, ports, bridges, and clean drinking water, as well as substantial investments in addressing the climate crisis, expanding internet access, creating a new 21st-century electric grid, and more. Most importantly, Washington state families will see the direct benefits of these investments as well. Our children will breathe clean air to and from school, rural communities will finally have access to reliable high-speed internet, and we are going to put folks from every part of the state to work with good-paying jobs by using the bill‚Äôs funds to build out our infrastructure‚Äîrepairing our bridges, building electric vehicle charging stations, replacing lead pipes, and everything in between.

I am also proud of IIJA‚Äôs inclusion of multiple bills I sponsored or cosponsored. The Digital Equity Act, which I authored and introduced, will provide $2.75 billion in grants to states and local communities to help close the digital divide and make sure everyone has the tools they need to get online and get connected. Similarly, the Clean School Bus Act, which I ¬†co-led with Senator Cortez Masto was incorporated and IIJA will provide $5 billion to help transition the nation‚Äôs diesel school buses to zero-emission, electric buses. The Bridge Investment Act, which I was a leading cosponsor of, will provide billions of dollars to repair or replace major bridges like the West Seattle Bridge or the Interstate Bridge, as well as smaller bridge and culvert projects. Beyond these bills, I am pleased with the significant funding that the IIJA provides for key Washington state priorities salmon recovery, ferries, public transit, rural water projects, and wildfire mitigation and resiliency. And while Congress must do far more, I believe the IIJA included the strongest possible climate provisions that a bipartisan process could achieve.

I am committed to supporting infrastructure investments that give our state and local communities the certainty they need to make plans, hire workers, and deliver projects that benefit us all. I will continue to work with the administration to ensure that we prioritize sustainable infrastructure, good-paying, union jobs, the environment, and uplifting rural and urban communities alike.

Again, thank you for contacting me. I appreciate hearing from you on this important matter. If you would like to know more about my work in the Senate, please feel free to sign up for my updates through the subscribe button below. Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts with me.

Last year I purchased my first home with the intention of it becoming my first rental.  Over this year my property has risen immensely in value.  As of today the property has over $150k of equity in it. (I paid $278k last year).  This wasn‚Äôt all luck, I bought in a very nice neighborhood knowing the new developments here would raise my property value.  In my area this home will rent for $2100.00 per month (which I intend to do) my mortgage payment is only $1370 so it will cash flow $730 per month. 

I want to get a HELOC on this property to cover the down payment on my next home that will be my new primary residence. (That way I can get away with 5% down) My new primary will be max $350k so around $17500 down without closing costs.  Based on Comps I think the new home with have around $20k equity upon signing.  I have the cash to fund the down payment, but I invest in the stock market (successfully) with said cash, and would rather not pull that money out since I can get a higher return on that cash in the market than the HELOC interest rate.  

After doing this I would plan to pay the HELOC back ASAP with my first properties cash flow instead of paying myself to get it paid back sooner and remove the lien against my first property.

Cash in bank - $50k
Income - $85k annual
Debt (besides mortgage) - $0

investing,Shorting Crypto-Mining Stocks Next Year,"In an ideal world, if we knew that sometime in Q1 of 2022 Bitcoin would peak at around $138k and with it most cryptocurrency mining stocks, what would be the best crypto-stocks to short?

How I see it, the macro-environment is really stacked against crypto-mining stocks AFTER the current bull run is over. Bitcoin usually takes 1-2 years to decline to a new low (this time a good estimate is probably 75% from ATH); interest rates are likely to go up in the next 1-2 years making the debt these companies have more difficult to service; and most importantly, these stocks are momentum-driven, when investors realize the bull run is over I think many will not want to wait years to see new highs. All of this is skipping over the real possibility of any kind of stock market correction, minor or major, because we are close to ATHs in most markets.

RIOT, MARA, HUT, etc. are some of the companies I'm considering shorting next year, but some other users on here have made great bear cases for Coinbase and even Microstrategy.

Because the difference is roughly ~$2k between the two results, I'd really like to get this right. The problem is that I'm just not sure who to trust / what to do.

* My taxes for 2020 are fairly straight forward (W2, 1099-INT, 1099-R, 1099-DIV), with only a slight complication around my IRA contributions.
* For the year 2019, I had to 1) recharacterize contributions made to a Roth into a Trad IRA and 2) convert the funds into a Roth in order to complete a backdoor Roth conversion.
* My 2019 tax return thus noted that I made non-deductible contributions to my IRA in the amount of $3630 
* When inputting $3630 as my total IRA basis in TurboTax, I am returned these numbers: (Federal Owed = $467; State Refund = $893)
* However, if I input $0 as my total IRA basis in TurboTax, I am returned a different set of numbers (Federal Owed = $1,338; State Refund = $556). Note this is the same result that my CPA is getting &amp; is less favorable for me by about $2k.

Any insight into what exactly is happening here and in particular, which set of numbers is more likely to be more correct would be most appreciated. I would also be curious to understand the implications if I happen to file incorrectly here. If I can provide more details, please let me know. Thank you.",finance

cardano,"Cardano Rumor Rundown October 14, 2021","Hey Everyone!

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. The first project that actually looks like it may one day be a virtual world launches on Cardano and it already has a community built parcel explorer. [https://pavia.luiscarlos.pt/](https://pavia.luiscarlos.pt/)
2. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce (cryptomom) gave a polite but scathing speech at the Texas Blockchain Summit where she laid bare all the problems with the SEC‚Äôs current approach to crypto. After her recent opinion piece and this speech, it‚Äôs fair to say that she and SEC Chairman Gensler are in open war over crypto. How this gets resolved will determine the regulatory landscape for Cardano and all of crypto going forward. Sadly, Gensler is in charge and not vice versa. [https://twitter.com/HesterPeirce/status/1448011388841037830](https://twitter.com/HesterPeirce/status/1448011388841037830) [https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-2021-10-08](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/peirce-2021-10-08)
3. The Fed may begin tapering it‚Äôs Treasury and mortgage backed securities purchases in mid November. This is relevant for the whole economy including crypto.

9. Another signpost for Cardano DeFi projects. Gary Gensler (SEC Head) tells the Financial Times that in his view DeFi platforms have ‚Äúa fair amount of centralisation‚Äù and ‚Äú\[i\]t‚Äôs a misnomer to say they are just software they put out in the web...‚Äù [https://www.ft.com/content/fb126d79-2e60-4002-8aba-b08887fca609](https://www.ft.com/content/fb126d79-2e60-4002-8aba-b08887fca609)

21. Only 5 more days to Alonzo (as of Sept. 7)!
22. Despite all the negative posting about Cardano smart contracts on eUTxO, it ironically looks like some in the ETH community are actually trying to build ETH L2 on UTXO. [https://twitter.com/matiwinnetou/status/1434570158853529606](https://twitter.com/matiwinnetou/status/1434570158853529606)
23. Here‚Äôs a great article on Cardano‚Äôs Determinism by IOG‚Äôs Polina Vinogradova. [https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/09/06/no-surprises-transaction-validation-on-cardano/](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/09/06/no-surprises-transaction-validation-on-cardano/)

25. Charles releases a new video on the Alonzo Update Proposal (on Aug. 7) being submitted so that we can go live on the 12th. He also gives some hints as to his thoughts on the short-term planning of some ‚Äúflavor of the week‚Äù blockchains vs. the long term planning of Cardano. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhujKbMpTEA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhujKbMpTEA)
26. Weiss Crypto lays down yet another very positive thread about Cardano. They acknowledge that they can‚Äôt see the future of Cardano, but they vehemently reject a lot of the anti-hype. [https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1435261343456768005](https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1435261343456768005)
27. Coinbase reveals they received a Wells Notice from the SEC on their crypto loan product. This is relevant for Cardano loan projects.

29. Messari has updated its ‚ÄúInitial Token Distribution‚Äù chart to include a previously missing project and Cardano is still among the very best in the Gen 3 space in terms of broad public coin ownership. [https://twitter.com/CryptoIRELAND1/status/1435708439951552513](https://twitter.com/CryptoIRELAND1/status/1435708439951552513)
30. After lots of criticism of Cardano layer 2 possibilities by ETH maximalists, Vitalik has ironically announced that ETH NFTs need to be moved to layer 2. [https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1435413681588736007](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1435413681588736007)

32. Here‚Äôs the tweet with the link for the Alonzo smart contract launch watch party tomorrow (Sept 12) at 21:30 UTC. This is going to be fun! Enjoy it, guys! [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1436325831199141888](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1436325831199141888)
33. A Weiss Crypto analyst calls the smart contract launch an alleged event and also doesn‚Äôt realize we already have NFTS. The Cardano community was quick to correct the analyst. Weiss was then also quick to apologize. [https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436369016545857566](https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436369016545857566) [https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436402039085576193](https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436402039085576193)
34. There is still the mystery of the lobster. Will it end up being connected to a fun smart contract to be launched tomorrow by IOHK? [https://twitter.com/crypto\_reflect/status/1435738017608740866](https://twitter.com/crypto_reflect/status/1435738017608740866)
35. Over 100 smart contracts are already running on Cardano Mainnet! [https://twitter.com/IOHKMedia/status/1437821632307994628](https://twitter.com/IOHKMedia/status/1437821632307994628)
36. One of Cardano‚Äôs biggest competitors is once again suffering network problems. This time it started out as just being characterized as (more) ‚Äúinstability‚Äù, then they started saying that something had caused the blockchain to ‚Äústart forking‚Äù. This followed their September 2 ‚Äúinstability‚Äù and ‚Äúperformance degradation‚Äù event. It‚Äôll be interesting to see how well their community tolerates this in the future if it‚Äôs happening with their planned slashing model in effect. [https://twitter.com/SolanaStatus/status/1437856638279487493](https://twitter.com/SolanaStatus/status/1437856638279487493) [https://twitter.com/SolanaStatus/status/1437757547235131396](https://twitter.com/SolanaStatus/status/1437757547235131396) [https://twitter.com/SolanaStatus/status/1433429598230876173](https://twitter.com/SolanaStatus/status/1433429598230876173)
37. The Cardano Foundation subtly hints (okay just straight up says) it has some mindblowing partnerships to announce at the Cardano Summit. [https://twitter.com/SidneyVollmer/status/1437855888237338627](https://twitter.com/SidneyVollmer/status/1437855888237338627)
38. Gary Gensler says that there are probably many tokens traded on Coinbase that are securities. [https://youtu.be/XLc4c7vL3rM](https://youtu.be/XLc4c7vL3rM)
39. Looks like Cardano Summit segments are being recorded and completed. [https://twitter.com/ch1bo\_/status/1437803839319691271](https://twitter.com/ch1bo_/status/1437803839319691271)
40. In macro news that could impact Cardano &amp; all of crypto, it has been announced that China‚Äôs Evergrande Group will not be able to make interest payments on its loans in a few days.[ https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/1438143063306690560](https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/1438143063306690560) [https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-09-15/evergrande-gives-china-an-impossible-equation-to-solve-with-its-liquidity-crunch](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-09-15/evergrande-gives-china-an-impossible-equation-to-solve-with-its-liquidity-crunch)
41. It looks like we‚Äôll get some news about further collaboration with Baia‚Äôs Wine of Georgia at the Cardano Summit. [https://twitter.com/ThornhillPublic/status/1438157239982956545](https://twitter.com/ThornhillPublic/status/1438157239982956545)
42. Now one of Cardano‚Äôs most highly visible critics is implying that the Cardano community has something in common with anti-vaxxers. Unfortunately for him, it was one of his pet blockchains that was down a few days ago while Cardano just kept healthily trucking right along. [https://twitter.com/spudiot1/status/1438402783040790532](https://twitter.com/spudiot1/status/1438402783040790532)
43. Cardano is still crushing it in terms of daily transaction volume. [https://twitter.com/Eilert/status/1438521555638644746](https://twitter.com/Eilert/status/1438521555638644746)
44. We might have gotten a peek at the virtual world that will be part of the Cardano Summit this month. [https://twitter.com/IOHK\_Charles/status/1438668061813342209/photo/1](https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1438668061813342209/photo/1)
45. Smaug gives us a rundown of how many actual Plutus scripts (19)are running on mainnet vs. timelock scripts (21k) as of Sept 17 and explains simple definitions for both. But, he also mentions down below how many Plutus scripts (213) are reportedly running on ‚Äúthe main testnet‚Äù not counting ‚Äúother Alonzo testnets‚Äù. [https://twitter.com/SmaugPool/status/1438816898234343432](https://twitter.com/SmaugPool/status/1438816898234343432)

47. Now the TX and NJ state securities regulators are after Celsius for crypto loans (BlockFi already got this treatment). Cardano loan projects should probably take note.

48. After the Senate hearing on Tuesday September 14th, Gary Gensler (SEC Chairman) gave a quote to a crypto publication indicating that custodial lending and possibly even staking platforms might be considered securities. This is very relevant for Cardano since it has non-custodial staking whereas many of its competitors have the kind of custodial staking that Gensler may have been contemplating. [https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/117675/crypto-lending-staking-custody-gensler-sec](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/117675/crypto-lending-staking-custody-gensler-sec)

57. Senators Lummis &amp; Sinema are planning to introduce a bill for responsible innovation in crypto. Caitlin Long says it will focus on (1) definitions to clarify regulatory jurisdiction, (2) consumer protection, (3) digital asset custody requirements [https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong\_/status/1440327869293465600](https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1440327869293465600)
58. The Hoskinson Center for Formal Mathematics has been established at Carnegie Mellon. Given the blockchain activity at the university it seems like the Cardano founder having ties there can‚Äôt really hurt us.

I live in the UK, and we are in the middle of some rather serious economic problems.

We have runaway inflation, we have a housing bubble that the government keeps pouring fuel on. We have rock bottom interest rates that the Bank of England are too scared to increase due to the housing bubble. We have energy prices going through the roof, a potential trade war with the EU due to the idiocy of Brexit, and wages that have been broadly stagnant for a decade. We also have a government that has implemented the highest peace-time taxes the Country has ever seen and a social care crisis due to our ageing population. Throw in our endless printing of money and the sums that have been spent on dodgy covid contracts, we are not in a good place.

And despite all this, they have the audacity to claim crypto is the real threat?!! We can't even seemingly stock our shops properly at the moment and we've just had a petrol (gas) shortage! Crypto is not the issue facing the UK!

Honestly, the desperation of the central banks is at this point clear for all to see. We have immediate and serious economic problems that need to be urgently addressed, but they would rather create bogeymen.

stocks,[DD] $GAN Limited - potential gem in the competitive online gambling industry?,"This thread is to start a discussion on a relatively unknown company and the broader online gambling industry. Do your own research.



I recently gained an interest in the rapidly growing online gambling industry. One of the key factors of growth was the legalisation of sports betting in the USA in 2018 at the federal level, with many of the states legalising sports betting soon after (with more to come). DraftKings has been the popular ticker (recently making headlines with multiple acquisitions and rumours), but there have been a few other players in the market. In May, I purchased shares of Rush Street Interactive and have seen good growth, so I‚Äôve been keen to invest more in the industry and this is when my research came across GAN Limited. 



**Overview:**  
Firstly, I‚Äôm looking for companies with high revenue growth. GAN benefits from being in 2 markets: B2B (supplying software to other operators) and B2C (operating their own sports book and casino direct to customers). Personally, I find the B2C market is more exciting as it scales faster and GAN stated that 78% are returning customers. GAN is close to 52-week lows due to missing earnings twice ‚Äì hence the good buying opportunity.



**Highlights/Bull Case:**  
-	Quarter (YoY) revenue growth of 316%  
-	Yearly revenue guidance of $125M to $135M (at the midrange that‚Äôs an increase of 271%)  
-	B2C customers grew 67% (112K to 187K) in 1 quarter  
-	Debt free balance sheet (only $0.5M)  
-	Strong leadership with focus on expansion (see recent Coolbet acquisition)  
-	Booming online gaming industry with natural catalysts  
-	CEO purchased $250K worth of shares in August 2021  



**Bear Case:**  
-	Highly competitive industry with no real moat  
-	Heavily regulated industry; GAN are subject to gaming licenses and dependent on state laws  
-	FanDuel accounted for 42.6% of their revenue in 2020 ‚Äì this is decreasing due to ceasing sports betting operations in August 2020 and the more recent Coolbet acquisition  
-	Net losses &amp; negative cash flows. Can argue this is to fund growth (hiring, marketing etc.) and costs related to regulatory requirements

It offers and licenses GameSTACK, a proprietary internet gambling enterprise software system as a turnkey technology solution for regulated real-money internet gambling, encompassing internet gaming, internet sports gaming, and virtual simulated gaming.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/14/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-thursday-oct-14.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Stock futures rise after S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq broke 3-day losing streaks

&gt; * Dow futures gained nearly 300 points Thursday as investors consider a flood of strong bank and health-care-related earnings as well as upcoming data on wholesale inflation and jobless claims. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped to around 1.53%, one day after minutes from the Federal Reserve‚Äôs latest meeting revealed a ‚Äúgradual tapering process‚Äù of bond purchases could begin by mid-November. U.S. oil prices continued to power higher, jumping to more than $81 per barrel. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq on Wednesday broke three-session losing streaks. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell for a fourth straight session.

*****

&gt; # 2. Data on wholesale inflation, jobless claims out before the bell

&gt; * The government is set to issue two key economics reports at 8:30 a.m. ET: the September producer price index and initial jobless claims. Economists expect first-time filings for unemployment benefits to drop to 318,000 for the week ended Oct. 9. Headline PPI and core PPI, which excludes the food and energy sectors, are expected to remain high, Thursday‚Äôs wholesale inflation comes after Wednesday‚Äôs elevated consumer inflation data. With price pressures mounting, the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment next year will be 5.9%, the biggest boost in about 40 years.

*****

&gt; # 3. Banks, health-related companies see shares rise on strong results

&gt; * The pace of earnings season accelerated Thursday, with slew of banks reporting quarterly results before the bell and their shares moving higher in premarket trading.
&gt; * Bank of America was first up, saying third-quarter earnings and revenue beat estimates on strong advisory and asset management results.
&gt; * Morgan Stanley beat estimates with quarterly earnings and revenue on record investment banking and asset management results.
&gt; * Wells Fargo posted a jump in profit in the third quarter, boosted by a release of credit loss reserves. Revenue beat estimates.
&gt; * Citigroup‚Äôs quarterly profit and revenue beat expectations on strong trading results.
&gt; * Dow stocks UnitedHealth and Walgreens Boots Alliance also reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue. Those stocks jumped in the premarket.
&gt; * Walgreens administered twice as many Covid vaccines as expected.
&gt; * UnitedHealth raised its full-year outlook.

*****

&gt; # 4. FDA vaccine panel gets ready to consider Moderna, J&amp;J boosters

&gt; * The FDA‚Äôs vaccine advisory group meets Thursday to consider a booster for Moderna‚Äôs two-shot Covid regimen. FDA scientists on Tuesday declined to take a stance it. The agency‚Äôs panel then meets Friday to consider a booster for Johnson &amp; Johnson‚Äôs one-dose vaccine and mix-and-match vaccine data. A highly anticipated NIH study, released Wednesday, suggests J&amp;J recipients are better off getting a booster from Pfizer or Moderna. Also on Wednesday, the FDA said data provided by J&amp;J suggests recipients may benefit from an additional dose. A booster of Pfizer‚Äôs two-shot vaccine was approved for certain groups of people last month.

*****

&gt; # 5. Foreclosures surge as Covid mortgage bailouts expire

&gt; * Foreclosures are starting to jump as government and private sector programs designed to help homeowners deal with the economic fallout of the Covid pandemic have begun to expire. Mortgage lenders began the foreclosure process on 25,209 properties in the third quarter, a 32% increase from the second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, it‚Äôs a 67% rise from the third quarter of 2020, according to Attom, a mortgage data firm. States with the largest number of new foreclosures were California, Texas, Florida, New York and Illinois.

CryptoCurrency,Securities?....... what does it mean exactly?,"**So I've been hearing some people I know talk about ""securities"", and how Ethereum is a security nd what not.  So lets get into the general question what is a security.**

***Now I know the SEC says Ether is not a security but a lot of people think it still is for the simple fact that it had an ICO.. Ill go with what's on paper for now ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è***

## What is a Security?

A security is a financial instrument, typically any financial asset that can be traded. The nature of what can and can‚Äôt be called a security generally depends on the jurisdiction in which the assets are being traded.

In the United States, the term broadly covers all traded financial assets and breaks such assets down into three primary categories:

1. Equity securities ‚Äì which includes stocks
2. Debt securities ‚Äì which includes bonds and banknotes
3. Derivatives ‚Äì which includes [options](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/options-calls-and-puts/) and [futures](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/futures-contract/)

# Equity securities

Equity almost always refers to stocks and a share of ownership in a company (which is possessed by the shareholder). Equity securities usually generate regular earnings for shareholders in the form of dividends. An equity security does, however, rise and fall in value in accord with the financial markets and the company‚Äôs fortunes.

# Debt securities

Debt securities differ from equity securities in an important way; they involve borrowed money and the selling of a security. They are issued by an individual, company, or government and sold to another party for a certain amount, with a promise of repayment plus interest. They include a fixed amount (that must be repaid), a specified rate of interest, and a maturity date (the date when the total amount of the security must be paid by).

Bonds, bank notes (or promissory notes), and Treasury notes are all examples of debt securities. They all are agreements made between two parties for an amount to be borrowed and paid back ‚Äì with interest ‚Äì at a previously-established time.

# Derivatives

Derivatives are a slightly different type of security because their value is based on an underlying asset that is then purchased and repaid, with the price, interest, and maturity date all specified at the time of the initial transaction.

The individual selling the derivative doesn‚Äôt need to own the underlying asset outright. The seller can simply pay the buyer back with enough cash to purchase the underlying asset or by offering another derivative that satisfies the debt owed on the first.

A derivative often derives its value from commodities such as gas or precious metals such as gold and silver. Currencies are another underlying asset a derivative can be structured on, as well as interest rates, Treasury notes, bonds, and stocks.

Derivatives are most often traded by hedge funds to offset risk from other investments. As mentioned above, they don‚Äôt require the seller to own the underlying asset and may only require a relatively small down payment, which makes them favorable because they are easier to trade.

# So, when is a crypto asset a ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù for purposes of the federal securities laws?

&amp;#x200B;

* Traditional equity or debt securities that have simply been ‚Äúdigitized‚Äù are clearly securities. The fact that they are represented by records on a distributed ledger or blockchain clearly does not alter their status as securities.
* At the present time, certain high-ranking officials of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)‚Äîbut not the SEC itself‚Äîhave concluded that two well-known ‚Äúcryptocurrencies‚Äù or ‚Äúvirtual currencies‚Äù‚Äînamely, Bitcoin and Ether‚Äîare not securities for purposes of the federal securities laws. Unfortunately, that does not give us a lot of guidance on the status of ‚Äúvirtual currencies‚Äù in general, because Bitcoin and Ether are only two virtual currencies out of literally hundreds if not thousands currently in ‚Äúcirculation.‚Äù

So where does that leave us with respect to ‚Äúvirtual currencies‚Äù other than Bitcoin and Ether, and with respect to other crypto assets such as coins and tokens? Are they securities?

Although, as noted above, certain high-ranking SEC officials have conceded that two types of **cryptocurrencies**\*‚Äî\*namely, Bitcoin and Ether‚Äîare not securities, the SEC‚Äôs general attitude with respect to other crypto assets (including other cryptocurrencies) is that it is up to market participants to decide whether a particular crypto asset is a ‚Äúsecurity.‚Äù¬†

Now that we are on our own, how do we determine whether a particular crypto asset is a security?

At the outset, the regulators have made it clear that simply calling something a ‚Äúvirtual currency,‚Äù ‚Äúcryptocurrency,‚Äù ‚Äúcrypto asset,‚Äù ‚Äúdigital asset,‚Äù ‚Äúcoin,‚Äù ‚Äútoken,‚Äù etc. is not determinative of its status as a **security** for purposes of the federal securities laws. For certain statements made by courts and regulators on this point.

What matters is **substance**, not **form**.

If, in substance, a crypto asset is a security, the fact that it consists of, or is represented by, records in a blockchain or distributed ledger clearly does not alter its status as a security. Again, for certain statements made by courts and regulators on this point.

How do we determine whether a crypto asset is, in **substance**, a security?¬†The answer:

Generally, we must apply the so-called ‚Äú*Howey* test,‚Äù **on a case by case basis**, to determine whether a particular crypto asset is a security.

Under the three-part ‚Äú*Howey* test‚Äù‚Äîwhich is named after a U.S. Supreme Court case,¬†*SEC v. W.J. Howey Co.*, 328 U.S. 293 (1946))‚Äîa financial instrument such as a crypto asset will be considered an ‚Äú**investment contract**,‚Äù and therefore a ‚Äú**security**,‚Äù where there is:

1. an investment of money (which could include, for example, an investment of fiat currency or cryptocurrency)
2. in a common enterprise
3. with an expectation of profit derived from the managerial or entrepreneurial efforts of others.

# Now Crypto and the SEC ( The Securities And Exchange Commission )

# 

Traditional equity or debt securities that have simply been ‚Äúdigitized‚Äù are clearly securities. The fact that they are represented by records on a distributed ledger or blockchain clearly does not alter their status as securities.

&amp;#x200B;

CryptoCurrency,BIS is developing a templete for issuance of CBDCs by Central Banks,"The Bank of Internation settlements (BIS) in collaboration with 7 Central banks (US FED, EU Central Bank, Bank of England, Bank of Japan, Swiss National Bank, Bank of Canada &amp; Swedish Central Bank) has come out with a report about the CBDCs. They are trying to develope a common templete for Central Banks to issue their digital currencies.

According to the report, The Motivation behind the crration of CBDCs is:-

""The centrality of central bank money in a monetary system anchors public trust in money and 
supports public welfare. As history has demonstrated, the evolution of money and payments deliversnew opportunities and business models, alongside new challenges. Our economies are becoming increasingly digital, user needs are rapidly evolving, and innovation is reshaping financial services. Many of our jurisdictions are seeing falling transactional use of cash, and new forms of digital money issued by the non-bank private sector (such as stablecoins) are emerging. These developments have accelerated since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Today, central banks are exploring how they can continue to deliver their public policy objectives, ensuring they are able to respond to a future system that appears to be changing rapidly.""

The report is devided into 3 parts titles:-
1. System design and interoperability;
2. User needs and adoption;
3. Financial stability implications.

One of the concerning part of the report is that it suggests there will be different versions of the same CBDC for different users. As stateted in the report ""A CBDC adoption strategy in a fast-changing payments landscape would require balancing the needs of the majority of consumers with reaching smaller parts of the population. Different users and needs would need to be defined and addressed in the system‚Äôs design.""

personalfinance,About to get a mortgage but do you see a problem?,"Good day!,

I applied and got approved for a specific mortgage loan at a fixed rate (under the terms of the loan) this loan's interest rate is a set rate so long as you are minimally qualified. The red flag on my paper work is a Discounts Points section for 1% of the loan amount. Why would the lender add a Discount Points section at 1% of the loan amount to my closing costs? I never requested to buy down the rate and I can't figure out why I would ever need to on this type of loan.

About the Borrower - Squeaky clean credit, all my ducks in a row. 

Have any of your heard of this before? I did not request to buy down the rate and there is no literature in the loan terms that say anything about different interest rates being approved. Its all one rate for everyone.

Have any of you had this happen in your closing costs, maybe with some other fee that made no sense. Did you move on to another lender or talk it out with the current lender? 

I understand the easy answer is to ask but should I consider trust as well with who I pick as a mortgage lender? 30 years is so long and I just want to make sure its the right fit for that kind of time line. Maybe it doesn't even matter.

CryptoCurrency,Cryptocurrency and Psychedelics,"Micro dosing in particular, but let's not discount a good ole macro or heroic dose. I'm curious as to others thoughts on this sub about the benefits of micro dosing psychedelics like psilocybin, lsd, and hell even DMT and if or how it has affected your thoughts, views, or the projects you invest in.

I think the two subjects are more closely related than it first appears, at least in my experience. They are both counter culture and both are currently up ending the norms of modern day society. For many the main goal of micro dosing is to increase productivity or see or feel something new. Or help with anxiety or depression. While all of those things can and will start happening the other thing that can start happening is more like an awakening. An awakening to the lies and fallacies of our society. You start to see things for what they are and realize it's all kind of a game. Especially money. 

Once you start to really be able to see all of the obstacles that are set in place by society/gov to literally keep you in your place, if your like me you start to look for an out. Which led me to crypto.

 I felt trapped, like there was no way an average person could break free from the ""work till you die"" model. Then I learned about decentralized finance, and other platforms offering huge daily compounding interest rates on crypto and stable coins. I took a chance and pulled out a chunk from a 401k. Ironically the only reason I was ""allowed"" to pull my own money was because of covid the temporary law change that allowed citizens to pull from a retirement account if impacted by COVID. Best decision ever. 

Any way crypto and Psychedelics are both revolutionaries!

Together they have impacted my life in such amazing ways. I hope they can help others in a positive and meaningful way. Thanks all",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Who should replace Tether?,"If (or when) Tether collapses, who do we think will surge to fill that gaping hole in the stablecoin market? USDC is the 2nd largest stablecoin by MC but is nearly half the size of Tether. Their audits have shown 1:1 backing for all USDC assets, with the majority being in cash &amp; cash equivalents.

Downside: they're the 2nd largest exchange and would lead to more centralization in the market. The SEC recently refused to allow CB to offer higher interest rates on USDC. Are further restrictions coming for USDC as banks feel crypto squeezing their profits?

Then there's Binance. Currently the largest exchange and 2nd largest stablecoin, BUSD also claims to have 1:1 backed USD in FDIC issued banks. Binance claims to have third-party and NYDFS audits performed quarterly for compliance.

Downside: Same as CB. They're already the largest exchange, and would further centralize the marketplace. Binance is also currently under investigation by the UK and the SEC for money laundering and tax evasion. Would we be replacing Tether with another house of cards?

Unfortunately, the next largest stablecoin, Dai, is far away from the big 3. Dai currently has a 473Mil MC, a minnow compared to the big boys above. Dai is also backed by other cryptocurrencies, mainly USDC and ETH.

 What are the communities thoughts?

personalfinance,Cash Out Advice,"So before I had really known about cash out refinance, I had refinanced my loan over a year ago to get a lower rate. Not sure if this affects my current situation.

 I currently have a $174,000 loan with a 3.25% interest rate with the current home value being around $274,000.  Not that it's an awful thing, but I hate seeing nearly $100k in equity sitting in my home when I could put even a portion of it to good use with a cash out refinance.  Maybe pay off debt with higher interest, build a garage, remodel portions of my house.  I'm currently engaged and both of us make pretty good money so a higher monthly payment doesn't completely scare me off. I also rent out the basement of our home to a friend of mine.

personalfinance,"Refinancing student loans to a much better rate, but most of it is a federal loan","I'm looking into my options for refinancing my student loan

* $41,000 currently at 0%, but set for 6.6% scheduled on Feb 1 2022 when federal student loan relief ends
* $7,400 at 7.250% (private loan)
* $3,600 at 8.625% (private loan)

I looked into what my refinancing rate was, and I could get 2.75% with an offer from CommonBond today. 

My question really revolves around the federal loan. Because of the current loan relief, I'm not paying any interest on the $41,000 until at least Feb 1, 2022, so does it make sense to refinance all of the loans right now? 

I suppose I see two unknowns that I was hoping someone could give some advice on

1. Is it worth waiting because the federal loan might get pushed back further? I know that the relief has been pushed back a few times, so it could be pushed back even further. Not having any interest accumulating on 80% of the total balance is nice. So should I wait to refinance until the federal loan relief for sure has ended or have people just been refinancing anyways while the interest rates are good?
2. How would refinancing my private loans now and then the federal loans when the loan relief ends work? CommonBond requires at least $10,000 to refinance. I see no reason why I couldn't do my private loan now and then the federal later if that is the best option. The one caveat is that I'm trying to buy a house at the moment. I did talk with my mortgage leader today, and he said that he is ""perfectly comfortable with you doing this"" as far as refinancing my student loan.

Am I overthinking this? Should I just refinance the private loan today, or should I refinance and just capture the good interest rate offer I have on the entirety of the loans?",finance

altcoin,Altcoin Fundamental Analysis 101: How to Avoid Losers and Pick Winners,"**TL;DR: Professional altcoin researchers like** [**Crypto Pragmatist**](https://cryptopragmatist.com/sign-up/) **and** [**Blocmates**](https://www.blocmates.com/) **understand three fundamental things a cryptocurrency before investing in it: the value proposition, the supply and demand, and the stakeholders behind it.**

&amp;#x200B;

**The Universal Law of Crypto**

People who simply knew of and understood crypto in its early days have now been rewarded with hundreds of billions of dollars of wealth. And while crypto price action has been volatile, the industry has been consistent in two things since its inception:

1. **Those who understand cryptocurrencies have been financially rewarded.**
2. **Those who invest in cryptocurrencies without understanding have been financially punished.**

&amp;#x200B;

**The Three Rules for Altcoin Analysis**

If knowledge inefficiency allows us to create outsized returns for our portfolio, then the way to create reliable alpha (excess ROI) is to set up a repeatable process where we can research and understand cryptocurrencies. Fundamental analysis is difficult, but it does not require special education, exclusive information, or super-genius level brains.

&gt;**In today's market conditions, any halfway-clever investor can perform research that will allow them to generate better-than-average returns on their cryptocurrency portfolios.**

In my time as as an Altcoin Research Analyst, I've established a simple fundamental framework I go through to perform basic prospecting on all of the cryptocurrencies I research.

While this framework isn't comprehensive, it is a starting point that will give you a solid foundation for better understanding cryptocurrencies, and thus, make better investing decisions. I've broken it down into three rules: three questions to which you must have answers.

If you have a strong grasp on how these three rules apply to the altcoin you're researching, you are well on your way to making a good, informed investing decision for the given cryptocurrency.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lbw9il08egt71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2b4690472999512436cbc30b05d99095567b134b

The single most important thing to understand in a cryptocurrency is how it provides value for its users. This can often be distilled down to just a few words or sentences, but it sometimes can be tricky to wrap your head around.

We'll take a look at a few of the biggest cryptos for inspiration:

* **Bitcoin:** ‚Äúa decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on a peer-to-peer network without the need for intermediaries.‚Äù
* [Ethereum](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)**:** ‚Äúa decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality.‚Äù
* [Polkadot](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polkadot-new/)**:** ‚Äúa blockchain network that connects, builds, and hosts blockchains.‚Äù

Conversely, many cryptos thought to be poor investments have flimsy (or sometimes no) value propositions

* [Bitconnect](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitconnectx-genesis/)**:** Crypto‚Äôs most famous scam intended to ‚Äúbuild trust and reputation in bitcoin and cryptocurrency ecosystem with Open-source platform.‚Äù (What does that even mean?)
* [Safemoon](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/polkadot)**:** When you start diving into Safemoon‚Äôs documentation, you find a lot more related to their tokenomics (burning and redistributing sold Safemoon) than the value it hopes to add to the world.

https://preview.redd.it/827dxhu8egt71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d91ecc84b4fd1cf7ee4d34d02d9155a19ef37212

If you couldn't explain to your Mom/Dad/Relative how this might add value to the world, it's a signal you need do more research and reading. White papers, the foundational documents of cryptos, are pretty helpful in this respect, (look up ""target cryptocurrency"" + white paper to find it) although they can be quite dense. Project roadmaps, often hosted on the crypto's official website are helpful as well.

Explore your curiosity and dive into what you don't understand. This is not the time to be shy or embarrassed about what you don't get, you're going to be putting your hard-earned money on the line: Twitter, Reddit, and Discord are all your friends.

Understanding how a crypto creates value allows you to:

1. Establish a thesis for why the crypto will rise in value
2. Determine when that thesis has been invalidated

This value proposition will serve as the foundation for the rest of your research.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/men473daegt71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95574b2651eb19b3ff99dba5e569781853d2e7ce

It‚Äôs not enough that a cryptocurrency simply adds value to the world: it must have incentives built in to facilitate increasing demand that outpaces supply.

**Success Stories:**

Bitcoin and Ethereum are both successful examples of cryptocurrencies that have created markets where demand eclipses supply, which causes price to appreciate. Bitcoin has accomplished the feat by creating a solid monetary policy base (slowly decreasing mining rewards and a capped supply).

Ethereum has started to burn Eth tokens since the EIP-1559 hard fork was activated, creating a deflationary supply while network activity continues to increase, driving demand. Before the EIP-1559, Eth's supply still outpaced demand thanks to high network activity across DeFi platforms, NFT minting, peer-to-peer transactions, and other tokens that existed on the network.

Exchange token FTX uses network proceeds to buy back and burn tokens, creating deflationary pressure that in theory causes the price to rise.

**Lessons:**

There are plenty examples of misaligned supply/demand pressures as well. Yield Farm/DeFi platform Iron Finance had a ‚Äòbank run‚Äô style collapse on on June 16th, 2021. The cause of the collapse? Poor management of supply and demand. Too much of the native farm token (TITAN) flooded the market as TITAN holders were not sufficiently incentivized to hold.

Since it was used as collateral for the yield farms, the entire ecosystem fell apart. To avoid a fate like that of Iron Finance investors, make sure you understand exactly why investors may choose to buy, hold, and sell a token.

White Papers are one way to understand these dynamics, while simply taking part in the ecosystem helps you get an intimate understanding of the incentives that affect market participants.

You can also take a look at CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap to see how much of a given coin has been mined (and thus how much it will be diluted). Total Value Locked (TVL) shows you how many dollars of a given asset is secured inside of a protocol, hypothetically showing you how much that protocol might generate in revenue and how confident players are in the protocols permanence.

Why is Ethereum such a strong investment? It‚Äôs constantly being criticized for its slow transactions, its high fees, and it‚Äôs develop first/fix later, it‚Äôs managed to attract thousands of the most talented developers, marketers, artists, and community builders in the world. Nonetheless, it's the king of altcoins.

**Team**

Every individual working on Ethereum or on any project around Ethereum is creating value for Ethereum holders. Lending platforms like AAVE, NFT platforms like OpenSea, and Level Two (L2) ecosystems like $MATIC are all built on top of Ethereum. People building on Ethereum creates network effects that make other people want to build their platforms on Ethereum, which brings more smart, talented people ad infitum. The lesson? Work to understand who is working on a platform and why they are there.

Does the core team have a strong background in blockchain tech? Can you watch interviews or check their social media to get a feel for them? Are they transparent and accessible or mysterious and elusive? All of these can help us get a better feel for the project.

**Team Incentives**

We also must understand the stakeholders‚Äô incentives. Some projects (Decentraland is one that comes to mind) have gotten criticism recently, as vesting has ended and now the founders now have access to all of the tokens that were once locked up. Because the founders won‚Äôt be rewarded with any meaningful quantity of new tokens, and the project‚Äôs market cap is around $1 billion, there‚Äôs not as much incentive for the founders to be working hard on development.

**Whale Wallets**

Finally, we should look at whale wallets: who are the biggest holders? Why do they hold so much of the currency? Is their stake large enough to manipulate the supply?

Dogecoin gets a lot of this criticism: thanks to the miracle of public ledgers, we can see how much of a given currency the biggest whales own. The top 11 Dogecoin whales own around 47% of the total supply, meaning they could easily influence the price of the currency should they choose. The top Ethereum wallet, in comparison, owns a mere 1.65% of the total Ethereum supply. It‚Äôs easy to understand which coin is less likely to be manipulated.

Team info can be found by poking around Twitter and the team pages of official project sites. Info on incentives is often found on Medium, while whale wallet data can be found by poking around on blockchain explorers and on-chain analytics platforms.

&amp;#x200B;

**Picking Winners**

This framework is not a silver bullet, but it is a simple, replicable process for understanding cryptocurrencies that can be applied at any point in a market cycle to drastically decrease your probability of picking duds while simultaneously increasing your probability of picking the rare 1000x investment when it does come along.

Bitcoin,Fiat Inflation Tax and Capital Gains Tax - A Post Bitcoin World,"Just a reminder to everyone, as governments normalize living with double digit inflation, that inflation raises the price of all assets by the amount the currency was devalued. A 90% loss in a currency's purchasing power raises the price of your assets by 1,000%, which means you lose 25% of your portfolio due to capital gains. If you include the risk that your assets may not even rise faster than inflation - a doubly whammy - then you get the following scenario below:

***Example:*** *Bob retired with a net worth of 1M USD. He owns a 500K house, 250K in stocks, and 250K in cash. From 2020 - 2040 the Federal Reserve expands the money supply by 1,000%, lowing the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar by -90%. The IRS sets a 25% capital gains tax. Assume Bob's house appreciates by 300%, stocks by 600%, and cash by 0%. Bob's net worth in the year 2040 is 325,000 USD:*

*0.1 \* (500,000 + (1,500,000 \* 0.75) + 250,000 + (1,500,000 \* 0.75) + 250,000) = 325,000*

**Simply by the Federal Reserve inflating the currency and IRS setting capital gains tax that does not discount for inflation, Bob loses approximately 70% of his net worth in 20 years.** Another cycle of this and Bob's children basically inherits nothing from Bob's portfolio. Bitcoin plays an important role to preserve generational wealth when holding property, assets, art, and other store of value goods during hyperinflation.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Three Reasons Why the Crypto Rating Council's Token Ratings are Irredeemably Flawed,"**TLDR; The CRC‚Äôs digital assets rating system should either be overhauled or discontinued because its efforts are riddled with silly to downright dangerous flaws and errors.**


The Crypto Rating Council (the ""CRC""), according to its website, ""is a member-owned and operated organization whose purpose is to assess whether any given crypto asset, or whether the development, issuance, and use of such asset have characteristics that make it more or less likely to implicate federal securities laws.""  Its founding members include industry heavyweights such as Anchorage, Bittrex, Circle, Coinbase, DRW Cumberland, Genesis, and Grayscale Investments.

In other words, the CRC rates digital assets in the hopes of providing the crypto industry greater clarity on whether the assets are securities. This is important because the SEC so far has largely been playing a game of whack-a-mole by relying on its enforcement authority to determine whether a specific digital asset is a security, which often forces both creators and investors of digital assets into deer-in-headlights situations. 

The CRC has rated a total of 28 digital assets since its foundation in May 2019 using a scoring [rubric](https://assets.website-files.com/5d766f847039d787f8a99a02/609998f89636a3f99c8429c6_CRC%20Securities%20Law%20Framework.pdf) it developed, which is based on the four prongs of the now-famous *Howey* test and the SEC's [""Framework for 'Investment Contract' Analysis of Digital Assets.""](https://www.sec.gov/files/dlt-framework.pdf)

The scoring exercise requires answering 36 yes or no questions, and each answer corresponds to a certain number of points in each prong of the *Howey* test.  The points total for each prong is tallied at the very end, and the digital asset is given a rating between 1 and 5 according to a scoring methodology table. 1 indicates the lowest likelihood of a digital asset being deemed a security by the SEC and 5 indicates the highest, and the final scores for each digital asset are published on its [website](https://www.cryptoratingcouncil.com/asset-ratings). While the CRC does not publicly release why it scored a given digital asset the way it did, each scorecard is accompanied by a short description of the digital asset that summarizes key relevant characteristics.

While the CRC's digital assets ratings are not legal advice and are only meant to serve as a useful reference for both industry participants and regulators, the crypto world pays careful attention whenever the CRC rates or is reported to be rating a digital asset. Examples:  [[1]](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/64569/crypto-ratings-preliminary-scores-trx-dot-ckb) [[2]](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptocurrency-exchanges-including-coinbase-to-rate-digital-assets-11569835801) [[3]](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/104515/crypto-ratings-council-publishes-rubric) [[4]](https://dailyhodl.com/2021/01/19/crypto-ratings-council-assesses-which-coins-may-have-characteristics-of-a-security/) [[5]](https://litecoindotcom.medium.com/the-crypto-rating-council-declares-litecoin-is-not-a-security-aa5db4a49f32#:~:text=We%20formed%20the%20Crypto%20Rating,the%20U.S.%20federal%20securities%20laws.)  
To illustrate just how much the CRC‚Äôs ratings shape chatter in the cryptocurreny industry, in this [podcast]( https://youtu.be/OBvJnaP0lgs?t=4599), Gavid Wood, the founder of Polkadot (DOT) and a co-founder of Ethereum (ETH), specifically addresses a leaked, preliminary rating of DOT by the CRC.


Despite the CRC's attempt at pseudo-legitimacy, however, the CRC's ratings are laughably amateurish for the following three reasons:

**(1) A difference of 1 point in the scoring rubric can mean the difference between a final score of 2 and 3.75 (on a scale of 1 to 5);  
(2) some of the descriptions of the digitals assets in the scorecards are  inaccurate; and  
(3) the ratings are not updated frequently or regularly, which defeats the entire point of rating the digital assets.**

Let's take a deeper dive.

**(1) A difference of 1 point in the scoring rubric can mean the difference between a final score of 2 and 3.75 (on a scale of 1 to 5)**

To see why, we only need to look at the last page (page 15) of the [rubric](https://assets.website-files.com/5d766f847039d787f8a99a02/609998f89636a3f99c8429c6_CRC%20Securities%20Law%20Framework.pdf), which outlines the rubric's scoring methodology. For some inexplicable reason, instead of using a true sliding scale, the CRC adopted a scoring methodology that only approximates one. 

A digital asset is given a final score of 2 if ""2 prongs have scores below 100 and 2 prongs are 100 or greater."" (Prongs here refer to the above-mentioned four prongs of the *Howey* test, the technical details of which do not matter for the purposes of this post.)

In contrast, a digital asset is scored a 3.75 if ""1 prong has a score below 100, 3 prongs are 100 or greater, and either (1) the sub-100 prong is 75 or above; or (2) one of the other 3 prongs is 200 or greater."" 

For the sake of simplicity, the above breakdown means that theoretically, a digital asset with a score of 99, 99, 100, 100 for each of the prongs will be scored a 2, while another with a score of 99, 100, 100, 100 will be scored a 3.75. One point in the rubric can mean the difference between a digital asset having a 50/50 chance of being deemed a security and it most likely being deemed one. **That is insanity.** Granted, the rubric isn't scored in increments of 1 - the question worth the least amount of points is worth 10 points. That still doesn't negate the fact that the scoring methodology the CRC uses is indefensible - one question out of 36 should not be the difference between a 50% and 75% rating.

**(2) Some of the descriptions of the digitals assets in the scorecards are inaccurate.**

The CRC reviewed a whopping 28 tokens, so I have not had the time to comb through each and every one of the CRC's scorecards.  Nevertheless, I've found two errors so far that make me believe that there may be more.

Example 1 - Litecoin (LTC): The CRC's scorecard states that Litecoin conducted a token sale in December 2017. **That is false.** Instead, it was [reported] (https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/20/litecoin-founder-charlie-lee-sells-his-holdings-in-the-cryptocurrency.html) in December 2017 that Litecoin's creator Charlie Lee had sold and donated most of his personal holdings of LTC.

Example 2 - Decentraland (MANA): The CRC's scorecard states that Decentraland raised $24 million through a token sale in 2017. **This is false.** Decentraland most certainly raised more than $24 million, because it blew through its own hard cap of $25 million within [10 seconds] (https://www.coinspeaker.com/vr-startup-decentraland-raised-25-million-ico-10-seconds/) of its ICO. Coindesk [reported] (https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2017/08/18/26-million-blockchain-vr-project-decentraland-raises-new-funding-in-ico/) that Decentraland raised $26 million.

**(3) Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the ratings are not updated frequently or regularly, which defeats the entire point of rating the digital assets.**

For an organization that aims to ""to create a compliance tool which, in partnership with securities law experts, allows the members to have a consistent framework to review assets supported in the ordinary course of their respective businesses,"" the CRC is **awfully** inactive. 

**23 of 28 of the CRC's digital assets ratings have not been updated since 2019.** Putting aside the fact that 2 years in the world of crypto is a [""lifetime""](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/stumpstatement092821b), this is hugely problematic because digital assets are subject to what is known in the industry as ""reclassification risk"" or ""morphing"". The idea is that digital assets may, due to evolving circumstances (e.g., increased decentralization, development of a use case, etc.), look more or less like a security over time. This concept is even explicitly acknowledged and addressed  in a [bill](https://beyer.house.gov/uploadedfiles/beyer_028_xml.pdf) that was introduced in Congress in July 2021.

To illustrate, in 2018, William Hinman, SEC's then Director of the Division of Corporation Finance, famously [noted](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/speech-hinman-061418) that while ETH was likely a security during its ICO phase in 2014, ""current offers and sales of [ETH] are not securities transactions"" because of the protocol's decentralized nature. Thus, in the view of at least one of SEC's own, ETH had gone from a security to potentially a non-security in a matter of 4 years. **Given the above, what is the point of the CRC digital assets ratings if none of them are being revisited and updated regularly?**

The ratings don‚Äôt help investors or potential investors determine whether a digital asset may  be at risk of being classified as a security, and it most certainly doesn't help builders and developers of these digital assets, who may walk away with a completely outdated, useless, and inaccurate characterization of their project.

**TLDR; The CRC‚Äôs digital assets rating system should either be overhauled or discontinued because its efforts are riddled with silly to downright dangerous flaws and errors. End rant.**",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,"In a World where Bitcoin is the Global Currency, How Would Governments Deal with Crises Situations?","We all know that governments worldwide have been printing money aggressively since the beginning of the pandemic, to keep their economies going and keep funding important social programs, food production, healthcare costs, etc. 

Everyone agrees to say that money printing is horrible, creates debt, drives inflation, and devalues currency, which is all true, **but my question is what other choice do governments have in a situation of crisis where there are massive lockdowns and no one can go get to work?** 

I mean, people still have bills to pay like rent, food, and healthcare, so they need income coming in even when they're not able to work. Governments were able to print money and send checks to these people during the pandemic, and that basically prevented a doomsday scenario **where everyone is looting everyone for food and resources**... 

My question is: if Bitcoin was the global currency, and governments didn't have the capacity to ""create"" more Bitcoin during lockdowns to keep people fed, what would have happened? I mean, a limited supply of 21 million Bitcoins means that at some point, **governments would run out of funds during extended periods of crises**...

Bitcoin,Antminer vs mining company,"You can buy a lot more hashes per second per dollar (insert your local fiat) with an Antminer than you can with a bitcoin mining company.

So, help a newb understand some pros and cons to the Antminer? I understand stocks well enough - though feel free to share your reasons for investing in a mining company if you want.

But, when it comes to the Antminer series (S19 pro the latest one?), how do you determine the risk that offsets the profit?

For me it looks something like:

* Private keys for owning your coins
* Complexity of set-up or account management
* Customer service ([Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) sucks balls. Sorry don't argue with me about it. I know from a very shady experience that is a felony and will never use them because of it).
* Transferability of coins from exchange to exchange.
* Technical issues with the hardware itself.

Each of those are where I really trip-up on wanting to get into mining in a pool. I don't know where to create a wallet. For instance blockfi sounds good because of the APY - but you don't own your own private keys.

I don't know where to mine coins to so that they are the most liquid, such as Coinbase is a closed loop so can't move coins off their platform? Does that just mean transfer to dollars? What if I want to keep coins on Coinbase but want to mine to Blockfi for the interest rate? How does that all look **IN GENERAL**?

Which exchanges/wallet holders(?what are places like blockfi even called?) have the best customer service, or the best ability to negotiate legally if shjt happens. Because let me tell you, [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) has nothing and can take everything from you and you can't even sue them.

Does it matter to be able to transfer coins? Are some exchanges or wallets less liquid than others?

Lastly - what's the complexity and warranty (if any?) for an Antminer, what's the actual experience there like? And what's it's shipment times given the rush to get one by these large miner companies? What if an Antminer breaks in just 2 years, are you S.O.L.?

personalfinance,Loan seasoning requirement for bridge loan (US),"Hi all,
 
I recently purchased a house using a hard money loan/bridge loan from my parents (drawn up by the closing attorney, collateralized by the new house). The reason for doing this was so that I could put in more competitive cash offers without financing contingencies, then once my current house is sold I would take out a traditional mortgage on the new house and pay back the bridge loan in part with that mortgage and in part with the equity from the old house.
 
I have a pretty substantial amount of equity in my current house, such that once I sell the current house, the ""down payment"" (so to speak) will be nearly 40% of the value of the new house. Or said differently, the mortgage I want to take out is for ~60% of the value of the new house.
 
I spoke to a lender about this before closing on the house and they didn't seem to have any issues with this transaction structure, however now they are saying that the loan requires ""seasoning"" and I will be unable to secure a mortgage until 6 months have passed from the origination of the bridge loan. Obviously this isn't ideal - I would like to pay back the money ASAP since it is basically a favor from my parents since they could have that money invested elsewhere earning much higher yield. There is also a risk that by the time 6 months pass, interest rates will have gone up, costing me a potentially significant amount of money over the life of the loan. 
 
So, first - is this information about loan seasoning correct, or is it possible the agent at the lender doesn't actually understand the transaction structure?
 
2nd - if this info is correct, are there any ways to bypass this requirement? Surely a loan with ~40% downpayment on the underlying asset would be seen as extremely safe?",finance
personalfinance,Refinancing home,I just finished refinancing my house a couple weeks ago. I got a really good interest rate. Everything went really smooth. I paid off a couple credit cards. All of a sudden I get a phone call from my new lender that I just refinanced with two weeks ago. They asked me if I want to refinance again for a lower rate. I just signed all the paperwork and closed 2 weeks ago. The old loan is paid. I have a new lender now. And this new lender calls me and asks me if I want to lower my rate a little bit more. He said I would have to sign all the papers again. It sounds a little fishy to me. Not sure why they would ask me to do that? Any comments would be helpful. I'm planning on asking a real estate lawyer their advice.,finance
personalfinance,High deductible with HSA or EPO,"For 2022, my employer is introducing a high deductible option. I have 1 dependent, a 6 year old. We're both healthy, but I have chronic allergies and have been getting allergy shots every 3-4 weeks. 

I currently have Aetna EPO. My current insurance premium is \~$3400 per year. The plan covers all lab testing, imaging, xrays, etc... in full. No deductible. Copays for specialists are $10/visit, $20 for urgent care and $100 for emergency care for in network providers. The only expenses I'm responsible for under this plan are really just copays. My kid goes to urgent care maybe 1-2x/yr. I never go. I see an allergist once a year at most. I get serums made once per year, which I think are about $1,000. 

The high deductible option premium is \~$2860 per year (I'm surprised it's that high?). The annual deductible is $3k, and a 10% coinsurance after deductible. This is the important part: my employer provides a $1,500 free contribution per year to my HSA if I use this plan. The out of pocket maximum is $5k. 

So if I go with the high deductible option, I would save about 500-600 on premiums per year and get $1500 in free money, so that comes out to be $2000-2100 net gain. Then I need to account for my medical expenses. I'll first start with the medical expenses that I'm certain I'll accumulate. 

My serums cost about $1k, so that brings the net gain down to $1000-1100. (Though I will probably have my current insurance make my serums for next year so I may not accumulate this expense next year)

The allergy shots (after plan discounts) cost about $65/shot for the high deductible or a $10/shot copay for the EPO. I get it every 3-4 weeks, so that's about $817 on allergy shots. So that brings the net gain down to about $200-250.

Now I'm pretty sure all the unexpected/unpredictable medical expenses are going to exceed the $200-250. If I had to guess, I'd say the unexpected expenses will be around $1000, so that brings the net gain down to -$800 ish if I choose the high deductible plan. 

Now it gets even more complicated because I now have access to a HSA and tax savings. I'm in the 24-32% federal income tax bracket and taxed by the state of NY. I believe my HSA contribution limit for my son and I is $7300 for 2022, so that's about $5800 (after accounting for the 1500 from my employer) I'd put in to a tax-advantaged account. If this $5800 is taxed at the 24-32% income tax bracket, that means I'd save over $1k in taxes by using the high deductible. I'd also save a few hundred in NY state taxes.

So it seems the high deductible plan more be more financially beneficial for me, but does this analysis seem sound and does the result seem significant enough to warrant the high deductible option or should I just go with EPO for peace of mind?

&amp;#x200B;

I think if I were going with the high deductible option, I will feel a bit annoyed with how much I'd have to spend on my allergy shots. I started my shots in Fall 2019 and I think it'll probably last until 2024. I would have never started the treatment if I had to pay out of pocket for all the expenses.",finance

CryptoCurrency,My Financial Life Before &amp; After Crypto,"**WALL OF TEXT WARNING. TLDR ACTIVATED.**

I just decided to write about my experience in finance as a way to understand myself better and maybe help anyone out there who needs some insights, especially those who are still exploring the idea of investing in general and/or getting into crypto. I guess I should just start right from the beginning, and it all started... when I was born - nah, just kidding. I'm just gonna start when I enter the workforce full-time.

**BAD START - YEAR 1**

When I got out of university, I basically couldn't get a decent job, and by decent job, I meant one that fits my degree. So I landed a typical office job, making money that could barely be qualified as a living wage. That's where I started making investments.

Long story short, I over-leveraged because I didn't know any better. I didn't do the research and I just jumped straight into it and traded mainly currencies. I would make insane bets with leverages of up to x100. At first, I was able to double my money because at the very least, I've put some thought into my trades. Then I got greedy and lost everything. Basically, I lost a few month's worth of salary plus all my gains. My colleagues thought I was severely ill when I sat at my desk, in shock. I was depressed for the rest of the year.

tldr:

* No research
* Currency trading
* Overleveraged up to x100
* Lost several months worth of salary
* Nearly died of heart attack
* Depression

**DARK AGE - YEAR 2-5**

Anyway, that experience made me swear off trading altogether. I decided to just concentrate on building a career for myself. My parents are fiercely traditional, and advised that I should make all my money from work alone, not investments, so there's that. I lost my first job when I couldn't make business targets, went on to a customer service job only to decide to quit on the first month because the environment and work was terrible and decided to go at it as a freelancer.

I got into private education, worked my way up from earning what was basically pocket money to becoming full-fledged middle-class independently. I got from working part-time to full-time, a few days a week to 7 days a week. Despite my comparatively short working hours at 35 hours a week max, it was still a slog as the job is very intensive. Where office workers basically get to slack half the day away, I was engaged almost every minute of my working hours and the kids... well, I don't blame them for being needy.

Despite this, life was good. I get to sleep as long as I want and I have plenty of free time. Still, realisation set in slowly but surely that in the long run, I'm basically fucked. As a freelancer, I have no benefits, no social security, and I'll be working like this until I'm 70. Housing in Singapore is expensive and second only to Hong Kong.

I met a financial advisor, who helped me start a savings plan with her company, then began working on my insurance portfolio. This presented another problem: it decreases the margins between expenses and income, and I have no way to increase my income any further as I was already giving it all I got.

tldr:

* Swore off trading
* Started building career
* Became successful middle class freelancer
* But screwed long-term due to lack of benefits
* Got savings plan and insurance
* Plateaued

**TRADE RENAISSANCE - YEAR 6**

Eventually, I decided to look again into investments. The trauma from my first experience was still with me, so I decided to research this time. I decided not to use leverage at all. I was able to make a few percent here and there, and my trading method was very cautious and conservative. You know what they say - the first time you trade and lost is basically tuition fee for the world of investments.

A friend introduced me into cryptocurrency and I discovered it concurrently. The platform I used had featured a few prominent ones, so I began trading those too. I was starting only at mid-cycle but better late than never, I guess. This is where I fell into the rabbit hole. Started watching crypto Youtubers, going to crypto subreddits, finding all sorts of tools for trading crypto.

All in all, I was able to make up for all my losses by the end of this period. My past demons were extinguished.

tldr:

* Let past trauma guide me
* Did research
* Reimagined past losses as 'tuition fee'
* Traded stocks
* Started trading crypto
* Fell into crypto rabbit hole. Got into Youtubers, subreddits, online tools
* Made back losses
* Past trauma largely cured

AGE OF CRYPTO - YEAR 7 (PRESENT)

And now we come to the present. I've decided to try holding (or hodling) instead of trading when the May-June crypto crash happened. All my demons briefly revisited me and it was a little depressing as this was more severe than anything I had ever experienced. My past losses was dwarved even by my unrealised losses during the crash. Having nothing to lose, I held. In fact, I did more than held. Determined to fight the demons of my past and conquer my financial setbacks, I bought the dip as much as I can, even utilizing bank loans as Covid-19 had reduced the interest rates to an all-time low.

Fast forward to the present, I found out that hodling is superior, in a way, to trading, as my current unrealized profits now dwarf my realized profits. It really depends, I know, especially when you started late, but I've made plans to just hold all the way, and just buy the dip whenever I can.

tldr:

* Started holding (hodling)
* May-June crash happened
* Unrealized losses piled up to nothing I've seen before
* Depressed
* Held through it regardless
* Unrealized gains now dwarf realized gains.
* Decided to hold from now on
* And buy dips whenever

THE FUTURE - YEAR 8 ONWARDS

This is where I need feedback on my current plan. All numbers here are arbitrary and rounded off. I've decided that I should sell somewhere close to the top, with my target being for my assets to get into the six digits. Let's call it $100,000 or $100k. From here onwards...

1. Wait for bottom, then buy $50k BTC, $15k ETH, $15k ADA, $20k spread among other altcoins that survived the winter. DCA if unsure of where the bottom is (YEAR 8-9)
2. Assets to be spread across at least 3 platforms. Currently on Etoro, thinking of Nexo and Kucoin as my friend suggested
3. Hold with the target this time to 10x my assets in the next bullrun to $1,000,000. Anything more will be a bonus. (YEAR 11-13)
4. Get a house without a loan after that, probably spending $300k-$400k at least (YEAR 13-14)
5. Repeat strategy for my third bullrun, turning $600k-$700k to $6,000,000-$7,000,000 (YEAR 13-18)
6. Host game where contestants play games to win money. Or maybe something to do with trading stocks and cryptos.
7. Plan subject to adjustment as the tides change.

Edit: Also intending to stake my cryptos while holding as well. Added final step just for laughs.

I hope for some feedback, and I hope I've illuminated some things in life for those who need it. I'll also be happy to answer some questions if any of you have any, so that makes this an AMA too.",cryptocurrency

9. Another signpost for Cardano DeFi projects. Gary Gensler (SEC Head) tells the Financial Times that in his view DeFi platforms have ‚Äúa fair amount of centralisation‚Äù and ‚Äú\[i\]t‚Äôs a misnomer to say they are just software they put out in the web...‚Äù [https://www.ft.com/content/fb126d79-2e60-4002-8aba-b08887fca609](https://www.ft.com/content/fb126d79-2e60-4002-8aba-b08887fca609)

21. Only 5 more days to Alonzo (as of Sept. 7)!
22. Despite all the negative posting about Cardano smart contracts on eUTxO, it ironically looks like some in the ETH community are actually trying to build ETH L2 on UTXO. [https://twitter.com/matiwinnetou/status/1434570158853529606](https://twitter.com/matiwinnetou/status/1434570158853529606)

He also gives some hints as to his thoughts on the short-term planning of some ‚Äúflavor of the week‚Äù blockchains vs. the long term planning of Cardano. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhujKbMpTEA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhujKbMpTEA)
26. Weiss Crypto lays down yet another very positive thread about Cardano. They acknowledge that they can‚Äôt see the future of Cardano, but they vehemently reject a lot of the anti-hype.

33. A Weiss Crypto analyst calls the smart contract launch an alleged event and also doesn‚Äôt realize we already have NFTS. The Cardano community was quick to correct the analyst. Weiss was then also quick to apologize. [https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436369016545857566](https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436369016545857566) [https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436402039085576193](https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436402039085576193)

36. One of Cardano‚Äôs biggest competitors is once again suffering network problems. This time it started out as just being characterized as (more) ‚Äúinstability‚Äù, then they started saying that something had caused the blockchain to ‚Äústart forking‚Äù. This followed their September 2 ‚Äúinstability‚Äù and ‚Äúperformance degradation‚Äù event. It‚Äôll be interesting to see how well their community tolerates this in the future if it‚Äôs happening with their planned slashing model in effect.

42. Now one of Cardano‚Äôs most highly visible critics is implying that the Cardano community has something in common with anti-vaxxers. Unfortunately for him, it was one of his pet blockchains that was down a few days ago while Cardano just kept healthily trucking right along. [https://twitter.com/spudiot1/status/1438402783040790532](https://twitter.com/spudiot1/status/1438402783040790532)

48. After the Senate hearing on Tuesday September 14th, Gary Gensler (SEC Chairman) gave a quote to a crypto publication indicating that custodial lending and possibly even staking platforms might be considered securities.

personalfinance,Quick payoff options question,"Hi everyone! I love the intelligent bluntness of reddit, so I thought I'd check my instincts here. 

My instincts, pay off the NC home ;-)

Details:
I have a primary residence where my wife and I live (200k owed on a 15 year at 2.3% just refinanced). 
I have a former primary I bought as my first home purchase when I was young in NC (owe 47k, 6.6% on a 30 year loan with 16 years left). I have this one rented for 600/month and I pay 700 per month mortgage (thats a little extra than the min payment). 
2 years ago I left a salary position at 101k/yr for private practice (I'm in the medical profession with a doctorate) and now I'm clocking around 250k/year gross. 
My wife works salary at 70k and her job covers our health insurance. 
Other debt - student loan at 95k balance, federal loan.
No credit card debt - set for auto pay each month. 
One car loan balance is 43k in the 3ish % interest rate.

Cash in holding is around 40k, and I put aside 35% of my gross monthly for taxes (and hooked up with solid tax strategy firm).

My gut is to pay off that NC home because its the highest interest loan we have, and I'm in for 16 years still. I have renters there who pay 600 per month, and at this point I pay more in mortgage and interest than I receive in rent, and if I killed that mortgage, whatever I'd receive would be income, and I'd be done with the years of interest. 

So, am I right- pay off that NC home as quickly as possible? or....am I missing something?",finance

bonds,"Rates Going Up Trade, Bear Trap?","I've seen talk on the net, and I have subscribed to this theory myself, and put on a trade that rising rates are an inevitability due to wide spread inflation concerns in the economy.  It's being talked about a lot in the media, and it seems like the fed would almost certainly have to act in some way to curb it (raising rates).  I'm starting to have my doubts, however.  The contrary situation I see arising is that inflation concerns are explained as temporary supply chain issues, to which raising rates will not be an effective tool to control.  Further economic issues come about from supply chain issues and central banks end up lowering rates instead to stimulate the economy.  

Where are rates going? Is the rising rates trade a bear trap??",finance

&gt; # 1. Wall Street on track for a winning week on strong earnings

&gt; * Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose more than 150 points Friday, one day after the 30-stock benchmark broke a four-session losing streak with a surge of 534 points, or nearly 1.6%. While the Dow on Thursday had its best day since July, the S&amp;P 500‚Ä≤s 1.7% increase was its best day since March. The Nasdaq Composite rose more than 1.7% for its best day since May. The three stock benchmarks were headed for weekly gains. U.S. oil prices rose to a fresh seven-year high, topping $82 per barrel. The 10-year Treasury yield ticked higher to about 1.54%. Dow stock Goldman Sachs rose more than 1% in the premarket ahead the bank‚Äôs latest quarterly report. Bank earnings this week have been strong.

*****

&gt; # 2. Retail sales out before the bell after this week‚Äôs hot inflation data

&gt; * Following two key inflation reports this week that showed sticky price pressures on the wholesale and consumer levels, the government is set to report retail sales at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect September headline retail sales to have dipped 0.2% after a 0.7% increase the prior month. Retail sales, excluding autos, are forecast to have risen by 0.5% compared with an August advance of 1.8%. The data will follow the release of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs September meeting minutes. According to minutes from its September meeting, the central bank could begin tapering its Covid-era bond purchases as soon as mid-November, as the economy recovers. The Fed‚Äôs next meeting is set for Nov. 2-3, with this year‚Äôs final meeting scheduled Dec. 14-15.

&gt; # 3. FDA panel to meet on J&amp;J booster after recommending Moderna

&gt; * The Food and Drug Administration‚Äôs vaccine advisory committee is set to meet Friday to consider a booster shot of Johnson &amp; Johnson‚Äôs one-dose Covid vaccine and data on mixing and matching shots. The panel on Thursday unanimously recommended giving a booster of Moderna‚Äôs two-dose Covid vaccine to people 65 and older and other vulnerable adults. The nonbinding decision would bring guidelines for Moderna in line with a third shot of Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine. A final FDA decision on Moderna boosters could come within days after consideration from the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

&gt; # 4. Virgin Galactic sinks 20% after delaying commercial service

&gt; * Virgin Galactic is delaying the launch of its commercial space tourism service until the fourth quarter of 2022. Shares of Richard Branson‚Äôs space company plunged 20% in the premarket. Virgin Galactic will start this month refurbishing and improving its spacecraft and carrier aircraft, rather than carry out its next spaceflight test. The company‚Äôs enhancement process, which is expected to take eight to 10 months, makes mid-2022 the earliest for the Unity 23 spaceflight. Last month, the Federal Aviation Administration cleared Virgin Galactic to return to flight after an investigation into the July spaceflight that carried Branson.

personalfinance,(TR/FR) Best way to keep money value in the case of high inflation &amp; high interest rate.,"I am French and my wife is Turkish. We are currently living in France, where we have most of our income and assets (in euro). We are very much middle class in France so not much to manage there. Our issue come with our Turkish money. As you might already know, Turkey is facing quite the economical trouble right now. A few years ago, the Turkish lira was trading 2:1 with the euro. Now we are up to 10:1 with no clear sign of the end. The inflation has been very high for a few years now (almost systematically above 10% in the last 5 years and getting close to 20% recently) and doesn‚Äôt get any better.


On the other hand banks offer very high rates (13-15% is not uncommon). We have a bit more than 100.000TRY sitting in a bank account and roughly the same amount in gold (in a ‚Äúgold account‚Äù in the same bank, very common in turkey). And we are getting ~1500TRY/Month from an income source.
 Our issue is that the value of this money has been steadily decreasing, since the inflation was usually higher than the interest rate, and we are completely unable to make any usage of it in France since the value of the lira against the euro dropped so much in recent years.


But we are very confused about what to do about it :

1. It seems too little too late to buy euro now, but at the same time we have been saying it since it was 6:1 ‚Ä¶

2. Buying gold has been the ‚Äúgo-to‚Äù method for a lot of Turk, which mean that the price of gold is also kept very high so it seems risky to buy more

3. Investing the money in fund is a possibility, but the interest rate of banks are so high, it make most fund uninteresting

4. Investing in ‚Äúsolid assets‚Äù like company, flats, etc ‚Ä¶ is a possibility but complicated to managed from another country.


Therefore, we would be very grateful for any advice to help us decide what to do (and also what not to do) with this money.",finance

CryptoCurrency,Coinbase Publishes Crypto Regulatory Suggestions,"On Thursday, cryptocurrency platform Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN) released a new regulatory framework aimed at giving federal regulators a blueprint for how to supervise the crypto industry.

Details: Some of the provisions suggested by Coinbase include regulating digital assets under a separate framework, designating one regulator for digital asset markets, protecting and empowering holders of digital assets, and promoting interoperability and fair competition.

Additionally: The proposal from Coinbase comes just one day after venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz said that it was going to make a proposal for crypto regulations.

Numbers: Shares of Coinbase jumped 5.36% on Thursday. Prices for most cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, also increased as well yesterday.

Bigger Picture: There's been a lot of talk from Washington lately about how to regulate cryptocurrencies. It was originally included in the infrastructure bill passed by the Senate over the summer. 

Final Thoughts: While regulators are not likely to take Coinbase's proposals too seriously, it is a common sense step in the right direction.

energy,"The Economy Needs Reliable Energy, Not Green Talking Points","[https://americanexperience.medium.com/the-economy-needs-reliable-energy-not-green-talking-points-ccdd61595297](https://americanexperience.medium.com/the-economy-needs-reliable-energy-not-green-talking-points-ccdd61595297)

 

At the same time America‚Äôs power, influence, and credibility in the Middle East are at an all-time low, the power of oil-producing states in the region are growing, putting the future of our nation‚Äôs economy in a dangerous position.

OPEC‚Äôs recently released highly influential and anticipated annual report, the organization predicts that the oil it produces will total 39% of global crude consumption by 2049. Up from 33% today. By 2049, OPEC expects its oil will control 57% of the world‚Äôs crude oil shipments, up from 48% in 2019.

This vast increase in OPEC production numbers should be a glaring red flag for our nation‚Äôs leaders. OPEC‚Äôs increased control of oil throughout the world could put our economy in an extremely vulnerable position. Despite the West‚Äôs aggressive transition from hydrocarbons to renewable energy, oil will still be a necessity for many years to power our economy.

According to the mainstream media, renewable energy is well on its way to replacing fossil fuels, but the numbers speak otherwise. As of 2019, 81% of the world‚Äôs energy supply came from fossil fuels according to the International Atomic Agency (IEA). The IEA estimates that fossil fuels will still be needed to power 73% of the world‚Äôs economy by 2040.

To account for the continued demand and for under investments in the western world, OPEC will have to increase its production by 8% to 108.2 million barrels a day! America‚Äôs declining investments in oil production will result in a drop of 1.5 million barrels by 2045. Given President Biden‚Äôs open hostility to the oil industry by halting oil and gas leasing on federal lands and waters, and canceling important pipeline infrastructure projects, we are well on our way.

Relying on a region where the United States has declining influence for a majority of our energy resources puts our economy in an extremely vulnerable position. Cheap reliable energy is the driving force behind economic productivity and industrial growth. Are environmentalists aware how much energy is required to make those microchips in their iPhones?

One can simply understand the potential of an economic crisis by asking their parents or grandparents about what the oil embargo dilemma in the early 1970s was like.

Relying on renewable energy to power a nation is a worthy goal that should be pursued and explored. However, it should not come at the cost of abandoning investments in infrastructure and production. The numbers don‚Äôt lie, they are the blunt truth that no poll-tested green talking point will cover up: We are decades upon decades away from reliable renewable energy powering our economy.

It is vitally important for our leaders to remove the green veil from their eyes and accept the numbers for what they are. If we are to stay the economic powerhouse of the world, we will need reliable oil and the infrastructure that comes with it for many years to come.",energy

CryptoCurrency,Altcoin Fundamental Analysis 101: How to Avoid Losers and Pick Winners,"# Knowledge Creates Wealth

Cryptocurrencies produce high returns because they are not well understood.

One of the biggest criticisms of cryptocurrency is the fact that the industry is ‚Äòspeculative.‚Äô Skeptics say that crypto investors are only here to make money. And sure, many crypto bulls don't really understand what they're investing in.

**It‚Äôs fair to call those people speculators.**

But the more you can educate yourself on crypto and verify the facts for yourself, the more you understand the intrinsic value behind a cryptocurrency and how it‚Äôs used, the **less risky** investing in it becomes.

If you‚Äôre aping money into cryptocurrencies without researching them, you‚Äôre virtually gambling. But if you‚Äôre investing into cryptocurrencies and have put in the time to understand them, your risk is mitigated.

By understanding the fundamentals of a given crypto, as circumstances and markets change, you can evaluate whether those changes affect the odds of that crypto being successful. Simultaneously, you can evaluate opportunities and pick investments that are likely to go up based on those foundational changes.

## The Universal Laws of Crypto

People who simply knew of and understood crypto in its early days have now been rewarded with hundreds of billions of dollars of wealth. And while crypto price action has been volatile, the industry has been consistent in two things since its inception:

1. **Those who understand cryptocurrencies have been financially rewarded.**
2. **Those who invest in cryptocurrencies without understanding have been financially punished.**

If everyone understood how crypto worked and its world-changing potential, it would be a lot harder to make money. The market would be more efficient.

Thankfully for us, we're early to the party. If we put in the work to learn and understand cryptocurrency, we can create incredible opportunities for life-changing financial reward.

# The Three Rules for Altcoin Analysis

If knowledge inefficiency allows us to create outsized returns for our portfolio, then the way to create reliable alpha (excess ROI) is to set up a repeatable process where we can research and understand cryptocurrencies.  
‚Äã  
Fundamental analysis is difficult, but it does not require special education, exclusive information, or super-genius level brains.

**In today's market conditions, any halfway-clever investor can perform research that will allow them to generate better-than-average returns on their cryptocurrency portfolios.**

In my time as as an Altcoin Research Analyst, I've established a simple fundamental framework I go through to perform basic prospecting on all of the cryptocurrencies I research**.**

While this framework isn't comprehensive, it is a starting point that will give you a solid foundation for better understanding cryptocurrencies, and thus, make better investing decisions. I've broken it down into three rules: three questions to which you must have answers.

If you have a strong grasp on how these three rules apply to the altcoin you're researching, you are well on your way to making a good, informed investing decision for the given cryptocurrency.

https://preview.redd.it/7hivy12xymt71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14fd01997a419180651f1c414a0de0777bd20a10

 The single most important thing to understand in a cryptocurrency is how it provides value for its users. This can often be distilled down to just a few words or sentences, but it sometimes can be tricky to wrap your head around.

We'll take a look at a few of the biggest cryptos for inspiration:

* **Bitcoin:** ‚Äúa decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on a peer-to-peer network without the need for intermediaries.‚Äù
* **Ethereum:** ‚Äúa decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality.‚Äù
* **Polkadot:** ‚Äúa blockchain network that connects, builds, and hosts blockchains.‚Äù

Conversely, many cryptos thought to be poor investments have flimsy (or sometimes no) value propositions

* **Bitconnect:** Crypto‚Äôs most famous scam intended to **‚Äú**build trust and reputation in bitcoin and cryptocurrency ecosystem with Open-source platform.‚Äù (What does that even mean?)
* **Safemoon:** When you start diving into Safemoon‚Äôs documentation, you find a lot more related to their tokenomics (burning and redistributing sold Safemoon) than the value it hopes to add to the world.

 If you couldn't explain to your Mom/Dad/Relative how this might add value to the world, it's a signal you need do more research and reading. White papers, the foundational documents of cryptos, are pretty helpful in this respect, (look up ""target cryptocurrency"" + white paper to find it) although they can be quite dense. Project roadmaps, often hosted on the crypto's official website are helpful as well.

Explore your curiosity and dive into what you don't understand. This is not the time to be shy or embarrassed about what you don't get, you're going to be putting your hard-earned money on the line: Twitter, Reddit, and Discord are all your friends.

Understanding how a crypto creates value allows you to:

1. Establish a thesis for why the crypto will rise in value
2. Determine when that thesis has been invalidated

This value proposition will serve as the foundation for the rest of your research.

https://preview.redd.it/20yulgr0zmt71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ada56215aa33914d6952ded21f5442e8594dd1c

 It‚Äôs not enough that a cryptocurrency simply adds value to the world: it must have incentives built in to facilitate increasing demand that outpaces supply.

**Success Stories:**

Bitcoin and Ethereum are both successful examples of cryptocurrencies that have created markets where demand eclipses supply, which causes price to appreciate. Bitcoin has accomplished the feat by creating a solid monetary policy base (slowly decreasing mining rewards and a capped supply).

Ethereum has started to burn Eth tokens since the [EIP-1559](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/5qunl25w50b7h6k3rlh6/p8heh9h948lxqmcq/aHR0cHM6Ly9jb25zZW5zeXMubmV0L2Jsb2cvcXVvcnVtL3doYXQtaXMtZWlwLTE1NTktaG93LXdpbGwtaXQtY2hhbmdlLWV0aGVyZXVtLw==) hard fork was activated, creating a deflationary supply while network activity continues to increase, driving demand. Before the EIP-1559, Eth's supply still outpaced demand thanks to high network activity across DeFi platforms, NFT minting, peer-to-peer transactions, and other tokens that existed on the network. Exchange token FTX uses network proceeds to buy back and burn tokens, creating deflationary pressure that in theory causes the price to rise.

**Lessons:**

There are plenty examples of misaligned supply/demand pressures as well. Yield Farm/DeFi platform Iron Finance had a ‚Äòbank run‚Äô style collapse on on June 16th, 2021. The cause of the collapse? Poor management of supply and demand. Too much of the native farm token (TITAN) flooded the market as TITAN holders were not sufficiently incentivized to hold.

Since it was used as collateral for the yield farms, the entire ecosystem fell apart. To avoid a fate like that of Iron Finance investors, make sure you understand exactly why investors may choose to buy, hold, and sell a token.

White Papers are one way to understand these dynamics, while simply taking part in the ecosystem helps you get an intimate understanding of the incentives that affect market participants.

You can also take a look at CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap to see how much of a given coin has been mined (and thus how much it will be diluted). Total Value Locked (TVL) shows you how many dollars of a given asset is secured inside of a protocol, hypothetically showing you how much that protocol might generate in revenue and how confident players are in the protocols permanence.

https://preview.redd.it/tju9xg23zmt71.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=77889737fe117bbfa24aa78dfb80dc8d76492269

Why is Ethereum such a strong investment? It‚Äôs constantly being criticized for its slow transactions, its high fees, and it‚Äôs develop first, fix later approach, it‚Äôs managed to attract thousands of the most talented developers, marketers, artists, and community builders in the world. Nonetheless, it's the king of altcoins.

**Team**‚Äã  
Every individual working on Ethereum or on any project around Ethereum is creating value for Ethereum holders. Lending platforms like AAVE, NFT platforms like OpenSea, and Level Two (L2) ecosystems like $MATIC are all built on top of Ethereum.

People building on Ethereum creates network effects that make other people want to build their platforms on Ethereum, which brings more smart, talented people ad infinitum. The lesson? Work to understand who is working on a platform and why they are there.

Does the core team have a strong background in blockchain tech? Can you watch interviews or check their social media to get a feel for them? Are they transparent and accessible or mysterious and elusive? All of these can help us get a better feel for the project.

**Team Incentives**

We also must understand the stakeholders‚Äô incentives. Some projects (Decentraland is one that comes to mind) have gotten criticism recently, as vesting has ended and now the founders now have access to all of the tokens that were once locked up. Because the founders won‚Äôt be rewarded with any meaningful quantity of new tokens, and the project‚Äôs market cap is around $1 billion, there‚Äôs not as much incentive for the founders to be working hard on development.

**Whale Wallets**

Finally, we should look at whale wallets: who are the biggest holders? Why do they hold so much of the currency? Is their stake large enough to manipulate the supply?

Dogecoin gets a lot of this criticism: thanks to the miracle of public ledgers, we can see how much of a given currency the biggest whales own. [The top 11 Dogecoin whales own around 47% of the total supply,](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/5qunl25w50b7h6k3rlh6/x0hph6hnexl3q2u5/aHR0cHM6Ly9iaXRpbmZvY2hhcnRzLmNvbS90b3AtMTAwLXJpY2hlc3QtZG9nZWNvaW4tYWRkcmVzc2VzLmh0bWw=) meaning they could easily influence the price of the currency should they choose. The top Ethereum wallet, in comparison, owns a mere 1.65% of the total Ethereum supply. It‚Äôs easy to understand which coin is less likely to be manipulated.

Team info can be found by poking around Twitter and the team pages of official project sites. Info on incentives is often found on Medium, while whale wallet data can be found by poking around on blockchain explorers and on-chain analytics platforms.

# Picking Winners

This framework is not a silver bullet, but it is a simple, replicable process for understanding cryptocurrencies that can be applied at any point in a market cycle to drastically decrease your probability of picking duds while simultaneously increasing your probability of picking the rare 1000x investment when it does come along.

CryptoCurrency,Coinbase says U.S. should create a new cryptocurrency regulator!,"The U.S. should create a new regulator to oversee digital asset markets, Coinbase said in a new policy proposal released Thursday. It warned that failure to regulate appropriately could leave the country even further ‚Äúbehind‚Äù other governments.

The proposal comes a day after one of its investors, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, released its own vision of how next-generation internet services including blockchain and digital assets should be regulated. Executives from a16z, as the firm is known, planned to meet with leaders across the government this week.

 Coinbase‚Äôs vision overlaps with Andreessen Horowitz‚Äôs but includes some nuanced differences and focuses more closely on digital assets. While a16z advocated for collaboration across regulatory agencies, Coinbase said in its policy report that there should be just one regulator for digital asset markets.

Coinbase Chief Policy Officer Faryar Shirzad told CNBC his team deliberately wanted to put out a bold plan to spark discussion.

‚ÄúWe started where a lot of people start, which is taking the existing multiplicity of regulators and trying to figure out what minimal surgery you could do to make things work,‚Äù Shirzad said. ‚ÄúAnd then there was a point at which, maybe three to four weeks ago, where we just kind of looked at each other \[and\] we said it takes more effort to try to adapt the current system which is predicated on an old market structure ‚Äî more intellectual effort, I would say ‚Äî than it does starting from scratch.‚Äù

He acknowledged that forming a new agency was certainly not the path of ‚Äúleast resistance.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think at the end what we thought, because our proposal is just a beginning of a conversation, that it made sense for us not to compromise on the core points of principle that we think people, that policymakers, should think about,‚Äù he said on an earlier call with reporters.

Shirzad said on the earlier call that the company has already met with about three dozen lawmakers‚Äô offices as well as several agencies to discuss aspects of the proposal. He said the feedback from Capitol Hill has so far been ‚Äúwelcoming.‚Äù

In general, Coinbase said in the policy report that it wants a ‚Äúclear and comprehensive approach to regulating digital assets, and for regulation that is fit for purpose.‚Äù It said that regulation needs to recognize how technology can benefit the public and warned that the U.S. is already ‚Äúbehind‚Äù other governments when it comes to creating comprehensive digital asset regulations.

‚ÄúAbsent taking similar steps,‚Äù Coinbase wrote, referencing the ‚Äúunified approach‚Äù to digital assets taken by the U.K., European Union and Singapore, ‚Äúthe United States is at risk of becoming a ‚Äòtaker‚Äô of regulation as opposed to the primary ‚Äòshaper‚Äô of modern financial services ‚Äî a position the United States has long occupied.‚Äù

The company broke down its suggestions into four major pillars:

* Create a new framework for regulating digital assets that is separate from that for the traditional financial system.
* Give the responsibility to regulate digital markets to a new single federal authority, in addition to a nongovernment self-regulatory organization, similar to that which exists in traditional markets.
* Protect digital asset holders from fraud and market manipulation and require disclosures to promote transparency.
* Promote fair competition and interoperability between products.

CryptoCurrency,"Felling bullish? STOP: If you plan to take profits, you need to make a basic strategy for the coming months! Here is an Updated Beginners Guide: Profit taking and Exit Strategies.","**Preface on WHY this might be the most important decision you make this decade:**

* Having experienced the rush of FOMO and everything mooning in 2018, only to be overly attached/commited to my couins, na√Øve and in denial when the Bear market started, I'll be the first to tell you how vital a planned STRATEGY is in order to **maximize profit and minimize losses**. 
* Yes. I listened to everyone shouting ""**HODL"", ""This time is different""** and **""Diamond hands will be rewarded""**, and so I HODLed, and sat and watched **my portfolio decline with 90-95% of its peak value**. I still have **not forgiven myself** (it's horrible) for not having a plan. Had I applied basic princiles, or at least sold 20%, could easily could have 2-3 x my current positions going into this bull market since January. LEARN FROM OUR MISTAKES.
* It's not about Exiting Crypto, it's about BUYING BACK IN to get MORE (stack the Sats!). The charts will not go up in a straight line forever, and  **there will come a time somewhere in the future where we go downwards before going up again.**
* Many, including myself, believe we follow the lengthening 4 year cycle with a current bull market, where we may see a 2nd top in late 2021, or most likely early-mid 2022 before a probable Bear market once the governmental and institutions clamp down on crypto and stable coins as a last attempt to stop our movement.
* A ""Black swan event"" might hit us beforehand, such as a premature stock-market crash, increased interest rates or the dreaded Infrastructure bill smashing the stable coins can incite a sudden bear market as well.
* Not taking profits, trying to time the top (spoiler: you will not), being to greedy or too attached to your investment (echo chambers) are the most common, and yet severe mistake us rookies do.
* The goal should in most cases be to have a predetermined Step-by-Step Strategy, that you can live with yourself should it go further than you expected, crash more/before you expected.

# When you invest, you should already have decided what you want:

1. What is your realistic price target/expected top? Is it in % gain, or is it a $ or ""BTC-Sats"" your goal?
2. How much gain will satisfy you? How much loss can you take before you close the position/admit your mistake?
3. Which do you consider high or low risk?
4. Which are your short term holds? Which are long term holds?
5. Are you taking profits from Alts into BTC? Stablecoins? Gold/metals, stocks or FIAT?
6. How do you want your portfolio to look like once the bear market happens? 20% BTC, 10% ETH and rest stable coins? 30% Gold, 30% property, 30% crypto and 10% FIAT?
7. When do you **Enter again** for the next cycle?

# Thoughts on strategy:

* Many start by taking out their initial investment as a start, but this typically leads to more riskier and often bad decisions with the rest of your crypto trying to time the top.
* Many investors will keep at least 10-30% of their holdings, just in case of a bigger up-cycle or because they firmly believe in the project.
* By DCA (dollar-cost averaging) OUT you will most likely ""time"" the top better than you ever would trying to find the peak
* Hence, most ""expert"" investors recommend the predetermined step-by-step plan, for when and how much profits you are going to take.
* This is typically done with limit/stop orders that is set beforehand, as the market progresses.

# And make the ""profit taking road"" ready!

1. When the time comes, make sure to have your assets on THE exchange or wallet needed to take profit. Have in mind many exchanges will ""**crash**"", there will be ""queues"" for deposits etc. when we get to the top!
2. Do you have e**nough gas** in your e.g. BTC, ETH or BNB etc. account to cover potential insane Tx/swap fees of the thousands or millions trying to use the network?
3. Does your **bank** approve FIAT deposits from your exchange? Will they freeze it and give you trouble?
4. Have you calculated the **tax implications:** Can you  pay the taxes? When is it profitable depending on taxation rate?

# To make an example, here is my simplified profit taking strategy for BTC:

* I believe might see a BTC FOMO peak $150 - 200k, then a drop to 60-90k the following months.
* My upside trigger of limit orders will be when BTC is closing in on $90k.

1. 5% ca 88 k
2. 10% ca 98 k
3. 10% ca 108 k
4. 10% ca 118 k
5. 10% ca 128 k
6. 10% ca 138 k
7. 15% 148 k
8. 30% HODL in case of super cycle 

* My downside of stop loss from a unexpected ""early"" peak/downtrend:

1. If BTC drops 25% from presumed peak,  35% sell.
2. If BTC drops  50%, sell rest of assets but leaving 10% of BTC.

* I will buy/DCA on the way down again, hopefully increase my BTC position by **x 2.**

Beanstalk is a new credit-based Ethereum native stablecoin protocol. Beanstalk uses credit instead of collateral to create a decentralized, liquid, blockchain-native asset, which is stable relative to the value of a non-blockchain-native asset. The first Beanstalk issues a USD stablecoin, Bean.

Beanstalk has the potential to usher in the Web 3.0 economy: anyone with an Ethereum wallet can now earn passive interest in a USD deposit account by depositing Beans into the Silo. As Beanstalk demonstrates stability and Beans become accepted across the DeFi ecosystem, a Silo Deposit account will offer a decentralized store of value with attractive interest rates.

Beanstalk creates protocol-native financial incentives to encourage participation in peg maintenance and governance without affecting Bean users.

Beanstalk relies on 3 interconnected parts: (1) a decentralized price oracle, (2) a decentralized governance mechanism: the Silo, and (3) a decentralized credit facility: the Field.

***1. Decentralized Price Oracle***

Beanstalk uses 2 Uniswap liquidity pools ‚Äì USDC:ETH and BEAN:ETH ‚Äì to create a decentralized price oracle. When the ratios of the two pools are identical, the price of¬†1 Bean is considered equal to $1. By trading against ETH instead of USDC directly, Beanstalk minimizes exposure to the centralized operators of USDC. Beanstalk calculates a time weighted average price for¬†1 Bean over each Season.

***2. Decentralized Governance Mechanism: The Silo***

Beanstalk uses the Silo, the Beanstalk Decentralized Autonomous Organization, to create a robust decentralized governance mechanism. Any Bean owner can earn yield from passive participation in Beanstalk governance by Depositing their assets in the Silo to receive Seeds and Stalk. Stalk owners can submit and vote on Beanstalk Improvement Proposals and collect a portion of Bean supply increases as interest. Seeds yield Stalk every Season.

***3. Decentralized Credit Facility: The Field***

Beanstalk relies on a decentralized community of lenders to maintain Bean price stability. The faster Beanstalk can attract creditors, the more stable the Bean price. Bean holders can lend Beans to Beanstalk in exchange for Pods, the Beanstalk debt asset. Pods are redeemable for 1 Bean on a first in, first out basis. Bean lending takes place in the¬†Field.

CryptoCurrency,Fundamental Factors Are in Favour of Bitcoin Growing in Q4.,"Statistics are straightforward things. While Bitcoin normally goes down in September, from October to December, it grows by double-digit figures. Last October, for example, the coin grew by 28% and by over 40% in November and December.

Institutional demand for Bitcoin is on the rise again. According to data from CoinShares, last week, all investment products related to it received over $226 million, and the investment grew by 227%. This positivity is linked with the backing of SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, who has given to the launch of a Bitcoin ETF, an exchange-traded fund that allows investment companies to work with cryptocurrency on a stock exchange. Earlier this year, this instrument was approved for Canada‚Äôs Toronto Stock Exchange. In the United States, similar applications are being held with a watchdog agency.

US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell recently said that the regulator is reluctant to restrict Bitcoin in any way. This has placated investors who fear a repeat of the Chinese scenario in which the government came down harshly against cryptocurrency trading and mining. A growing number of investors have been calling the cryptocurrency ‚Äòdigital gold‚Äô due to its built-in revaluation mechanism. JPMorgan spoke last year already about investors‚Äô preferences for Bitcoin over gold.

With the growth of institutional demand, the average transaction size has grown from 0.9 BTC in August to 1.3 BTC in September. The number of daily active market participants grew by 19% last week to 291,000.

Another bullish factor is Bitcoin‚Äôs retention in wallets in anticipation of its continued growth. In the past 7 months, holders have reserved over 2 million BTC, while only 186,000 BTC have been mined, and the total number of coins held by long-term holders (LTH) has reached 13.3 million BTC.

But big capital isn‚Äôt the only party expecting Bitcoin to grow. Judging by the growing funding rate of perpetual futures contracts, traders are again turning to leverage to buy more coins.

Metrics, statistics and fundamental factors are unanimously signalling that the last quarter of 2021 will be positive for Bitcoin.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Loan / 0% Interest CC / Sell investments,"Hey all. Wanted to run my thoughts on a purchase by you. Looking to make a 8k purchase (weekend classic car which I've fallen in love with).

I've looked into different loan options (classic car auto loans, crowdsourced loans, personal loans) which come with 6 - 10% interest rate over 36 month period.
I have sufficient liquid investments which I could sell to purchase the vehicle outright but that would mean losing out on the 10%+ average S&amp;P returns.

Is it crazy to take out a new CC, one with a 15 month zero APR (e.g Chase Freedom Flex) and hold onto my investments for another 15mths (and cut back from monthly spending to save up during the 15mths) so I can benefit from the extra 15mths stock market growth, and save, and then pay off the CC? Any potential issues or risks I'm not seeing? 

I have a stable income, 690+ credit score, I'm generally sensible with money (budget, pay regular CC on time each month...). This big discretionary purchase is not something I've done before and won't repeat for a long while.",finance
CryptoCurrency,"If Bitcoin reach 5 Million per coin, I'll be done for life...but I wont sell!","Basically, the title says it all. I wont sell my BTC position, unless something really unexpected happens, and I suddenly need the money!

And yes, I see bitcoin reaching 5 million$, because as long as the FED keep printing dollars, bitcoin will keep rising in value. It doesn't even mean I'm bullish in BTC but that I'm bearish in FIAT. Since I started to buy, back in january, I never sold, not even in the big dip of May. Because I got to understand what digital scarcity is, and because I think BTC will be the best thing I can leave for my children, if I ever get there.

Now, we're on the brink of breaking the ATH, and everybody is hypped AF. But for those who trully understood the base layer, hodling is the easiest thing. Because you feel you're hodling, not only for you, but for your older you and family. And it makes me sad to realize loads of people can't see the beautifull simple nature of bitcoin, energy money, in a distributed, decentralized ledger.

Crypto made me feel my life can really change. And yes, we're early. We came before huge institutional money, we came before heavy regulations attempts, we came before bitcoin being adopted as legal tender (at least I know I did, I understood bitcoin before El Salvador!). So, it will be a bumpy fuckin' ride, it has been a fuckin' bumpy ride. But it's worth it! Hope you guys can see the beauty of it, even with all the FUD.

CryptoCurrency,Binance.US is trying to steal my money,"I posted this in Binance.US:

I have a lot of money in Binance.US. I use it for bot trading with 3commas. I received an email today that my account is locked for TOS violations. When I requested additional information, I got this:

Upon completing a review of your Binance.US account, we regret to inform you that we will no longer allow you to use Binance.US‚Äôs services.

""We have closed your account due to a violation of our Terms of Use. Our decision was based on numerous factors, including but not limited to our commitment to abiding by all Federal and State laws and regulations, as well as adherence to our own policies and procedures. Unfortunately, we cannot elaborate on why we have made this decision.

Please note you have 72 hours to withdrawal any account balance remaining on your account. Thank you for your understanding.""

I have no idea what TOS I could have violated and they won't tell me. Most of my holdings are in alt coins that other exchanges don't even have in the US. I don't know what to do. Binance trading has become my primary source of income, and they won't tell me anything.

EDIT: I filed a support ticket. They will give me no further information, nor is there any way to speak to a human. I only get automated responses.

I need a lawyer in California familiar with crypto immediately. Can anyone point me to someone?

I can't even trade my coins for bitcoin or stable coins so I can transfer them out. I'm really upset right now. Can anyone shed any light on this? I'm a US citizen. As far as I know, bot trading is not a violation of TOS. This is a nightmare.

I have around 100k on this exchange.  It's locked in multiple cryptocurrencies.  I can't trade.   About half is in cash, half in various cryptos that I can't even withdraw anywhere.



I didn't have a bank account linked.  I linked an ACH account but it only allows me to withdraw $5000 per day.   I added a Wire transfer account and it tells me I can't withdraw due to ""Risk Management"".   But I only have 72 hours to withdraw.

Furthermore, they didn't cancel my open buy orders, so my ""available balance"" is a lot less that my actual balance.   

The whole thing is a nightmare.

Does anyone know of a crypto laywer in the SF bay area?

UPDATE:  I can't withdraw anything.  USD, BTC, alt coins, nothing.   All I get is ""Withdrawals suspended due to risk management.""  So, I have 72 hours to withdraw everything and all my withdrawals are suspended and they do nothing but reply with form letters.

UPDATE 2:  I've contacted a lawyer.  Will get a consultation on Monday hopefully.  kugelmanlaw.com.   I hope they're good.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,Which loan option would you choose? Please advise!,"Hi everyone. I‚Äôve posted here a few times in the past re: my inability to get approved for a conventional re-fi loan. Thanks to everyone‚Äôs advice here I reached out to a local lender who also brokers and there are offering me a ‚Äústandard‚Äù (but non-conventional) loan option for a refinance. 

This re-fi would combine a first and second (HELOC) mortgage that both have high rates. (Please see image) 
This is also a multi-unit investment property that I do not reside in, both units are rented and the income pays the current 1st and 2nd mortgages. 
My only option with this lender is to re-fi for a 30 year fixed, however if I don‚Äôt refinance the loans as they stand now will be paid off in in 10 years. 

Do I extend the loan to 30 years to have an extra cash flow of $1000 / month, with a significantly lower interest rate? If yes, which option of the below would you chose? (I‚Äôm leaning towards the higher point option as I don‚Äôt plan on selling and the break even point is only 11 months).

Bitcoin,Let's keep Bitcoin out of Politics,"If our end goal is to have Bitcoin denominate the base layer of our global economy, we need Bitcoin to stay out of Politics. Politicians shilling Bitcoin to their constituents will only divide sentiment among US Citizens which will delay mainstream adoption. 

TL;DR: It's more beneficial if Bitcoin organically spreads via capitalistic means than if shilled by US Politicians. 

-‚Äê-----------------------------------

When faced with a continuing debasement of global fiat, banks and businesses will eventually look to other means to stay solvent and will utilize Bitcoin as such. Can Politicians outlaw Bitcoin? Sure, but it'll be politically irrational. At that point, if they do outlaw Bitcoin, other countries will benefit from adoption (prisoners dilemma), and the US economy / US financial system will lose hard. 

But if we start playing partisan games with Bitcoin, adoption will be a long and difficult road to navigate. 

Alas, it is inevitable that Bitcoin will become mainstream partisan banter. This is why we need Bitcoin Ambassadors from all political parties to run for local, state, and federal government positions.

I guess I counter-argued my argument. 

What do you think? Should BTC stay out of politics?",cryptocurrency
stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, October 15, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, October 15, 2021**

*Sorry for not posting the recap yesterday, with the market bouncing so hard decide to take a day off and treat myself!*

Stocks rose on Friday, continuing a monster bounce in October that has seen the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) claw back a lot of the losses suffered in September, and finish the week 2% higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ), which fell as much as 8% from its previous peak, closed the week a remarkable 2.65% higher while the Dow Jones (DIA) closed the week 1.49% higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed the week 1.43% higher. Market participants are encouraged by an unexpected rise in retail sales in the US and a stronger-than-expected start to earnings season, which kicked off this week with big banks reporting. 

Not to toot my own horn, but as I have continuously said, I continue to see any dips in the markets as buying opportunities, including this latest dip. While I understood and have written extensively about the current risk factors in the market (China, inflation, supply-chain issues, etc), these are all issues that have been known about and have been affecting the market for months. Just because we see a sudden uptick in ‚Äúdoomsaying‚Äù headlines from mass media, doesn‚Äôt mean the fundamentals of the bull market in US equities have shifted (remember they are paid for you to engage with the content). Until something fundamentally changes (like inflation forcing the Fed to suddenly hike the interest rate), I continue to stick to my plan. Just be sure to be prepared for any eventuality, I do this by having zero margin in my long-term account and adhering to stop losses in trades.

The Department of Commerce released their monthly report on retail sales, which showed an unexpected rise in consumer spending in September despite supply-chain constraints. Retail sales for the month increased by 0.7%, against the Dow Jones estimate for a decline of 0.2%. Compared with a year ago, sales were up 13.9%. Still despite robust consumer spending, economists warn that supply bottlenecks will increase heading into the holiday season, as demand increases. Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets said,  ‚ÄúThe solid retail sales report reflects both consumer resilience and escalating prices. The main concern now is that supply-chain disruption and micro-chip shortages appear to be spreading, limiting selection and tamping down goods demand.‚Äù 

This week's early batch of stronger-than-anticipated quarterly results has helped assuage investors' concerns over a sharp deceleration in corporate profits, especially as expenses mount for companies across industries in the face of higher input and labor costs. 

So far, Wall Street analysts are looking for third-quarter earnings growth of about 27% on a year-over-year basis, [according to FactSet data. ](https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_100821.pdf)Though this would still be the third-fastest earnings growth rate since 2010, it would be a marked slowdown from the second quarter's nearly 90% pace. 

**Highlights**

* Big US banks kicked off earnings season with a bang, with XLF, the ETF tracking all banks in the SP 500, jumping to record levels. 
* In a statement, Amazon-owned streaming platform Twitch confirmed that last week‚Äôs data breach contained the company‚Äôs source code, but insisted that passwords, credit card info, and other sensitive info was not compromised.
* Shares of Disney (DIS) spiked after unconfirmed reports that the company planned to spin off its ESPN operations. Reports later come out to discredit the original report so it remains unclear if anything is actually happening.
* Chinese EV company NIO reportedly plans to increase production capacity by 20% at their main factory and aim for another 100% rise by mid-2022. Shares of the company are up 4% on the news.
* Microsoft (MSFT) is shutting down operations of business social media LinkedIn in China following increased regulatory scrutiny, but the company still has other operations within the country
* Disney (DIS) has unveiled a line-up of more than 20 new content titles from the Asia-Pacific region, including 18 original productions, that will be streamed over its Disney+ service. This is likely in response to the unprecedented success of Netflix‚Äôs (NFLX) Squid Game, which rapidly became the company‚Äôs most viewed showed ever.
* Twitter (TWTR) said it was rolling out new ad features and revamping the algorithm that decides which ads as the company deepens its push for monetization and launch new eCommerce features.

personalfinance,Am I Purchasing Way Above My Means??,"Hello Personal Finance Community,
 
I used to have bad spending habits in my previous marriage currently turning 40 and I am happy 4 years out of divorce (no kids) to be doing much better following this community passively.
 
Presently I make $100,700 a year salary $108,000 with yearly bonus and live in a very modest old apartment in HCOL Southern NH/Boston that is $1255 a month with heat and HW or 22-23% of my net income it is certainly not the most modern or nice place but it is comfortable. 

My only other debts are a Rav4 SUV loan at $14,000 at 1.49% and 240 a month and a student loan with 19,000 left at $252 a month and no CC debt. I have saved up in liquid cash $52,000 after my divorce in 2017 leaving me with 10K as well as have $115,000 in my 401k saving 12% of my check after having to give a big percentage to my ex and my credit is now at a 820 average.
 
Friends, family and my current partner say I am throwing money away renting this old place and so I started looking at Condos and Homes in this insane market. I found a new construction townhome for $325,000 in NH and put in an offer and it was accepted at $330,000 as everything is going over asking 10% in the area. Condo properties in the 250K range are few and far between and need lots of work in MA &amp; NH.
 
With an interest rate of 2.9% and 5% down my payments with high property tax are now estimated to be $2100 including the HOA for 30 year fixed on the new home due to high property tax as well. I gave a $10,000 deposit and signed on the P/S. I am estimated to have around $30,000 left in savings when the deal closes
 
Every night for the past week since the P/S is signed I feel like I am making the worst financial mistake of my life and just want to lose the $10,000 Escrow and stay in my current situation and punish myself for FOMO purchasing. 

Looking for some financial advice. Am I buying excessively much home for my income and debt? Should I cancel and stay put in the apartment..",finance

defi,How do you build a crypto investment portfolio?,"Even if you‚Äôve never invested in cryptocurrencies before, now is the time to start. The recent Bitcoin rally to $60k is just the beginning: many coins could grow by 100% in Q4. But how to create a profitable portfolio and minimize the risks? 

First of all, you should decide between passive or active investing. Personally, I prefer more passive investing, accumulating my portfolio month after month and earning interest rates. However, I do some swing trading with 10% of my funds. Having chosen one strategy or another, here's my advice:

1) Don‚Äôt chase the cheapest coins. Some are priced between $100 and $1,000, while others are worth $5,000 and more. A balanced beginner portfolio should center around mid-range and high-range coins because they offer a better risk-reward ratio. 

2) Don‚Äôt dump everything into Bitcoin. Bitcoin will certainly grow further, so you should allocate a part of your portfolio to it. But there are many cheaper, high-potential coins that can appreciate more than Bitcoin in 2021 and yield a higher passive income while you hold them. 

3) Invest in a ready-made portfolio. If you are not sure how to allocate your funds, it‚Äôs better to pick a managed portfolio designed by a professional fund. 

4) Try social trading ‚Äì but be careful. Many newbie traders use social or copy trading, meaning that they automatically copy the orders opened by experienced traders.

The problem with this method is that you don‚Äôt know the pro trader‚Äôs strategy and you can‚Äôt judge their skills.

# **Earnings are the big catalyst for stocks in the week ahead, as Tesla and Netflix report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/15/earnings-are-the-big-catalyst-for-stocks-in-the-week-ahead-as-tesla-and-netflix-report.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks appear to have shaken off the often spooky trading pattern of October for now, and whether that continues could depend on earnings in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Dozens of companies are reporting, from Netflix and Tesla to Intel, Procter &amp; Gamble and American Express. Railroads, airlines, health care, tech, financial firms, energy and consumer products companies are all reporting in the first big wave of reports.
*****
&gt; Stocks were higher in the past week, with the Nasdaq leading the charge with a 2.2% gain. Cyclical sectors, like materials, industrials and consumer discretionary were outperformers, and tech held its own with a 2.6% gain. Real estate investment trusts were also among the best sectors up nearly 3.5%.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúUnlike prior earnings seasons that we‚Äôve seen recently, the expectations are a bit more muted heading into this earnings season, as far as analysts‚Äô revisions are concerned,‚Äù said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke. ‚ÄúThat tends to lower the bar, which makes the earnings season much more manageable. Volatility is a code word for ‚Äòdown.‚Äô Manageable is a code word for ‚Äòup.‚Äô That‚Äôs a decent set-up and just the fact that the market has been down heading into the earnings season.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Hickey said it‚Äôs not clear the strong surge in stocks in the last few sessions is signaling an all-clear for usually negative tone of October.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have a better idea once we get through all these earnings reports coming up next week,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs going to be the big tell. So far the initial reactions haven‚Äôt been too bad, especially given all the concerns people have had over the headwinds. Everyone‚Äôs been so concerned about the supply chain issues and inflation, and the companies that reported have held up reasonably well.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Hickey noted that Nike stock has recouped much of the decline it saw after the company discussed supply issues Sept. 23 in its fiscal first-quarter report.
*****
&gt; Major banks, like Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, have reported quarterly results with solid beats in the past week. The financial sector, which includes insurance and credit-card firms besides banks, is at this point expected to see a profit gain of 30.7%, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. Overall the profits of S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to gain 32%, based on estimates and actual third-quarter reports.
*****
&gt; Refinitiv says companies are beating expectations so far by 15.6%, compared to the long-term average of 4%, but below the 18.4% average of the last four quarters. Energy is expected to see the biggest profit gains, a shocking 1,517%, while the utilities sector is forecast to have the lowest gain, just 0.2%.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúSome smaller groups are knocking the lights out, but it‚Äôs not the same thing as if it was uniform,‚Äù said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. ‚ÄúRoughly speaking, the cyclical groups are expected to have growth of 96% this quarter and tech is expected to be about 25%... I think the story here is the financial and cyclical parts of the market are really going to surprise, as long as you have disruption. As long as disruption continues, it‚Äôs going to benefit certain companies. It may be transitory, but transitory could last a year or two.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Golub said it could be a risk for the market if only some groups are earnings winners. ‚ÄúIf we can get an aggregate beat of 8% to 10%, but it‚Äôs being held up by a smaller part of the market, and the median company is not delivering stronger earnings numbers, it is a negative,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of my concerns about the earnings season.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Golub said investors have been worried about margins being squeezed because of higher input costs, but he said a bigger concern is that companies are unable to make deliveries because they don‚Äôt have products.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThey got an order. They can‚Äôt fulfil it, and they can‚Äôt book the sale. That‚Äôs the risk here. I think it‚Äôs real. Inventories are being adjusted further down, and backlogs are being adjusted further up. Delivery times are getting extended further and further,‚Äù Golub said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the risk.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Golub expects the S&amp;P 500 to reach 4,600 by the end of 2021, from its current 4,471 level, and he said he sees nothing to derail that expectation. He expects cyclicals should do better, but technology stocks are likely to be just market performers.
*****
&gt; ‚Ä≥[Tech‚Äôs] growth is not impressive on a forward 12-month basis, and it‚Äôs disproportionately expensive,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI think the growth stocks in general and tech stocks more specifically are going to face stiff headwinds from the combination of valuations being really high and their expected sales growth being weaker than the rest of the market. If this was just the current quarter, it would be one thing but it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs the next 12 months.‚Äù
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúIf interest rates and everything lines up for tech, that‚Äôs great,‚Äù he said. But he said he does not see tech as a leader in the next year. ‚ÄúI think they‚Äôll be market performers, but I think they‚Äôll be winners for the next decade ‚Äî100%.‚Äù
*****
&gt; The 10-year Treasury yield, which particularly influences technology and growth shares, was at 1.57% Friday, after topping 1.60% in the past week.
*****
&gt; Besides earnings, there are a few economic reports to watch, including existing home sales and the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey on Thursday. On Friday, Markit manufacturing and services PMI data is released. The Federal Reserve‚Äôs beige book on the economy is issued Wednesday afternoon.
*****
&gt; The first bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund could begin to trade next week, when ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF is expected to debut. The Securities and Exchange Commission could still hold up the ETF if it objects to the filing before midnight Monday, but that is not seen as likely, a source told CNBC.
*****
&gt; Bitcoin rose above $60,000 for the first time in six months Friday, as investors bet the ProShares and other cryptocurrency-based ETFs would begin to trade soon.

&gt; # Double Digit Gain for Bullish Sentiment

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has managed to put in a higher low in the past few days, and investor sentiment is reflecting the recovery in equity prices. The AAII's weekly sentiment survey saw the percentage of respondents reporting as bullish leap 12.4 percentage points to 37.9%. That is only the highest level since September 9th, but it also marked the largest one-week increase in bullish sentiment since last November. The last double-digit increase was just over six months ago during the week of April 8th when it rose 11.1 percentage points.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101421-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; The recovery in bullish sentiment this week leaves the reading essentially right in line with its historical average, but again it has been a while since bullish sentiment has experienced such a large increase. Going back through the history of the survey, there have been 43 other times in which bullish sentiment has risen at least 10 percentage points in a week without another occurrence in the prior six months. As shown below, those types of moves have typically been positive for short-term performance with the S&amp;P 500 on average outperforming the norm one week, one month, and three months out. With that said, returns six and twelve months later have tended to see slightly weaker than normal returns.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101421-AAII-Bull-Jumps.png))**

&gt; With a big increase in bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment pulled back to 31.8%. That is the lowest level since the first week of September, and similar to bullish sentiment, it is not far off from the historical average. In other words, the size of the move was large but the level of sentiment is pretty unremarkable.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101421-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; The inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment resulted in the spread between the two to move back in favor of bulls for the first time in a month. The one-week increase in the spread also tied the week of February 11th for the largest jump since last November.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101421-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

&gt; Bullish sentiment appears to have borrowed more heavily from those formerly reporting as neutral. Whereas bearish sentiment dropped 5 percentage points week over week, neutral sentiment shed 7.4 percentage points. Again, that decline does not mark any notable low and is not far away from the historical average.

&gt; # Two Big Banks Break Two Long Streaks

&gt; Earlier on Thursday, we noted how shares of JP Morgan Chase (JPM) had traded lower on their earnings reaction days for five straight quarters. Despite the string of weak short-term reactions to earnings, though, JPM has performed very well in the period encompassing this streak rallying more than 66% since the start of September 2020. While JPM's streak of five straight negative reactions to earnings reports was impressive enough, two other big banks that reported on Thursday were riding even longer streaks of negative reactions to earnings. Heading into Thursday's report, Bank of America (BAC) had traded lower in reaction to earnings for seven straight quarters while Citigroup (C) traded down for six straight quarters. In both cases, Thursday's positive price reactions to their respective reports ended those streaks.

&gt; Like JPM, while both stocks have experienced very negative short-term reactions to their earnings reports, during the entire run of declines on their earnings reaction days, they have both rallied sharply. In the case of BAC, the stock has rallied 33% since the start of 2020 when its earnings losing streak began, while shares of C are up 95% since the start of April when its six-quarter streak began. In the case of Citi, in fact, it has actually outperformed the S&amp;P 500 which is up 75% in that same span. As noted with JPM, the performance of these two stocks also suggests that a stock's short-term reaction to earnings isn't necessarily a good indicator of its longer-term outlook.

&gt; # US Outperforms the Rest of the World... Again

&gt; In January of this year, we looked at the relative performance of the United States versus the rest of the world (ROW). At the time, ROW was making up lost ground relative to the US, but that didn't last long. Through the first three quarters of 2021, the US (SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF-SPY) picked up steam once again and has significantly outpaced both the rest of the world (Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US ETF- VEU) and emerging markets (iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF- EEM). Emerging markets have been the underperformers of the group while the US has led. Although EEM outperformed at the beginning of 2021, the index has since moved lower while the US trudged higher right up through early September. YTD through the end of Q3, SPY has outperformed EEM by 19.5 percentage points, which ranks as the second-widest spread between the two ETFs since EEM started trading in 2004. While not to the same degree, the US has also notably outperformed the rest of the world as well with a performance gap of 12.4 percentage points.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/SPY-vs-int-etf-perf-101121.png))**

&gt; Over the last 17 years, Q4 performance has been mixed after the performance spread between SPY and EEM during the first three quarters of the year was in the double digits. Since 2004, there have been five prior occurrences, and in three of those years, SPY continued to outperform in Q4 while it lagged twice. Over the last decade, EEM has only outperformed SPY two times through the end of Q3 (2016 and 2017), and this year is the fourth in a row where SPY outperformed EEM.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101121-spy-eem.png))**

&gt; Similar to EEM, SPY has also steadily outperformed VEU in the first three quarters of the year with outperformance in 11 of the last 14 years. Interestingly, in the three years where SPY lagged VEU, it outperformed in Q4 all three times. Like this year, SPY outperformed VEU by double-digit percentages in the first three quarters of the year only three other times since 2008. The last two times there was a positive double-digit spread (2018 and 2020), VEU outperformed for the remainder of the year.

&gt; Investors often look to play trends in the first three quarters of the year for a continuation through Q4 or a reversion to the mean. However, in terms of big performance gaps between US stocks and both international and emerging markets in the first three quarters of the year, like the analysis we highlighted last week with sectors, historically there's been no discernible trend of either a continuation or reversal of that trend in Q4.

&gt; # Airline Passenger Traffic Back on the Ascent After a Weird August

&gt; After a surge in the first half of the year and into Summer which took the number of daily air passengers back to levels last seen before the pandemic, Americans started to pull back in their air travel from late July through early September. Much of this decline was likely seasonal in nature, but the rise of the COVID Delta variant likely played a role too, at least at the margin. After peaking out just shy of 2.1 million passengers per day, the average daily volume of travelers in the nation's airports fell by nearly 25% through mid-September. Since that low a month ago, though, volumes have been on the rise, and average daily air passenger traffic over the last seven days is now only down 10% from its July high.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101421-TSA-Throughput.png))**

&gt; As air passenger traffic has picked up, it's not surprising that the airline stocks have bounced a bit off their lows in August. The ETF which tracks the major airlines in the sector (JETs) has rallied more than 10% from its August low. It was also up as much as 18% earlier this month before crude oil prices topping $80 started to weigh on sentiment in the sector.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101421-JETS.png))**

&gt; In looking at air travel trends on a monthly basis, one thing that stands out is just how strange of a month August was. The chart below shows the percentage of days by month that passenger traffic was up relative to its reading in the prior week. Back in March 2020 when air passenger traffic ground to a halt, every day saw week/week declines in passenger traffic. Coming off of a low base, these readings picked up in May and June as the panic started to subside, and throughout 2021, we continued to see steady levels of week/week increases in air passenger traffic. In five of the first seven months of 2021, at least half of all days saw air passenger traffic levels above their week-ago levels, and the two that didn't (January and April) still had more than a third of all days show increases.

&gt; But then came August. Throughout the entire month of August, there was only one day (8/1) where passenger traffic was up week/week and from there the next 30 days were all lower. Granted, traffic levels were coming off of post-pandemic highs, but the fact that traffic levels were so steady to the downside implies that Americans just didn't want to fly. While most people were sad to see the summer come to an end, thankfully for the country's airlines, traffic picked up again in September, and October is now on pace to be the second straight month where passenger traffic levels have increased on a week/week basis on at least two-thirds of days.

&gt; # Claims Sub-300K

&gt; Initial jobless claims have continued to decline with this week's reading falling to 293K from an upwardly revised reading of 329K last week. The 36K week/week decline was not only more than double the expected decline, but it was also the largest since a 48K drop at the end of June. Additionally, after this week's decline, the seasonally adjusted number is now at the lowest level of the pandemic, only 37K above the levels from March 14, 2020. After revisions to prior weeks, this week also marks the first sub-300K reading since the pandemic began.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101421-Initial-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

&gt; While seasonally adjusted claims were lower, unadjusted claims rose to 277K from 261K. A rise in regular state claims is very much the norm for the current week of the year with said week having historically observed claims rise WoW over three-quarters of the time going back to 1967. Before seasonal adjustments, claims have likely put in their seasonal low and will continue to trend higher into the end of the year. Additionally, with the end of enhanced benefit programs in early September, PUA claims have continued to drop off coming in at 21.62K this week. While at a nearly negligible level, that is still a few thousand off the low of 14.79K from the week of September 17th.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101421-Initial-Jobless-Claims-NSA.png))**
&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101421-Initial-Jobless-Claims-NSA-Season.png))**

&gt; Continuing claims after seasonal adjustment likewise reached a new low of 2.593 million. This week's 134K decline was the third week/week drop in a row and the largest of those weeks. That leaves claims 809K above the levels from right before the pandemic.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101421-Cont-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

&gt; Tacking on all programs for continuing claims gives a more complete picture with the most recent data through the week of September 24th. Total claims across all programs totaled 3.66 million that week. Since the end of the support of pandemic era programs, total claims have now fallen by 7.6 million. Essentially the entirety of that decline is thanks to the massive drops in PUA, PEUC, and Extended Benefits programs as support has come to an end. In fact, since the first week of September (the last week before the expiration of enhanced benefits) regular state claims are actually higher by 26.4K whereas PUA, PEUC, and Extended Benefits programs have together fallen 7.616 million. Outside of regular state programs, PUA claims still account for the largest share of total claims with 549.1K claims followed by PEUC (440.4K), and the Extended Benefits (222.6K). With regards to Extended Benefits, throughout the summer we noted the volatile swings in that program. The teeter-tottering has appeared to have stopped for the time being as the program has now seen back-to-back significant declines from the 9/10 high of 431.3K. In other words, any oddities in that program's data (potentially as a result of claimants switching from PUA or PEUC claims as their expiration ended) appear to be finally working themselves out.

ethereum,Why Is Algorithmic Stablecoin Important?,"We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile)

  
**TLDR**

We are creating dynamic systems and integrating the financial infrastructure into this new system. And this new system can integrate the current policies in place like fractional banking and reserve banking with capital efficiency. The innovation it brings now is dynamic monetary policy and reduced time lag in monetary response. We see an increasing number of papers being written on more robust monetary policies by central banks. They seem novel and to implement them to rewrite the current monetary system is difficult. But with algorithmic stablecoins we can experiment with these designs and study the empirical evidence of their efficiency. In this way we can build better monetary models for the future.

&amp;#x200B;

# What Is Stablecoin?

Stablecoins are crypto assets that try to reduce volatility by pegging the value to another asset. Thus, it is stable with respect to the asset. For example, the value of the stablecoin will often be anchored to another type of stable asset such as central bank money (USD, CHF, RMB, SGD) or a commodity (gold, silver, precious metals).

# Why We Need Stablecoin

&gt;Stay tuned for our algo stablecoin research paper coming out! It is a collaboration between Economics Design, Lemniscap VC and Bocconi University.

*TLDR: easy access to this new digital crypto space.*

Stablecoins appear to solve the biggest problem in the current cryptocurrency market, volatility. For traders or investors, they can convert assets to stablecoins to avoid cryptocurrency volatility without necessarily converting to fiat.

For stores, it is difficult for a company to accept payment with a cryptocurrency when there is a fluctuation of 20-30% in value in a short period of time. This makes the broad adoption of cryptocurrencies much more difficult.

Therefore, stablecoin is important as a bridge between the electronic market and the traditional financial market. The transition from fiat to cryptocurrency has been a lot easier since the advent of stablecoins.

As Erik Voorhees, CEO of Shapeshift said:

&gt;‚ÄúStablecoins are important in the same way that a bridge is important. You may not care much about the bridge, but without it, the beautiful land beyond is much harder to get to‚Äù.

# Types Of Stablecoin

How are these stablecoins created? Via various mechanisms which can be broadly classified into fiat-collateralised, crypto-collateralised and algorithmic.

## Fiat-Collateralised Stablecoin

This is the most popular form of stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market at the moment. The value of these stablecoins is often pegged to the value of real money at a 1:1 ratio.

The main feature of this type of stablecoin is that the total supply of it on the market must be worth the equivalent of the amount of money stored by the issuer.

To ensure the truthfulness of that, the issuers will be inspected, managed and audited by a reputable financial institution such as a bank or financial audit company.

The risk of this type of stablecoin is the risk that the issuer of the stablecoin cannot prove that the reserve amount is of equal value to the value of the stablecoin circulating in the market.

Some typical fiat-backed stablecoins: Tether ($USDT), TrueUSD ($TUSD), USD Coin ($USDC), Paxos Standard ($PAX).

## Crypto-Collateralised Stablecoin

Like fiat-backed, crypto-backed stablecoins are stablecoins that are collateralised by a crypto asset.

However, the difference between these two types of stablecoin is where the collateral is stored.

With fiat-backed, collateral is stored off-chain by reputable third parties such as banks or auditing firms.

With crypto-backed, collateral is stored immediately on blockchain (on chain) which is locked in by means of a Smart Contract. This brings transparency as well as decentralisation.

The risk of the form of stablecoin collateralised by crypto is the fluctuation of the price of the crypto coin that is collateralised.

To minimise that risk, these stablecoins have to increase the value of the collateral to a very high level to ensure that price fluctuations do not affect the stability of the stablecoin.

In case the value of the collateralised crypto is lower than the issued stablecoin, the smart contract liquidates the collateralised assets to ensure the stability of the stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins: MakerDAO ($DAI), Bitshares ($BitUSD), Celo, Reserves ($RSV).

## Algorithmic Stablecoin

This type of stablecoin is not collateralised by any kind of asset. Instead, to maintain stability, these stablecoins use an algorithm-based supply-demand elasticity mechanism.

The working nature of this stablecoin is similar to how central banks work with fiat money.

When the value of a stablecoin is too high due to increased demand, the issuer will bring to the market a quantity of stablecoins until the value of the stablecoin is stabilised.

And vice versa ‚Äî when the value of the stablecoin drops too low, issuers will issue bonds bought with stablecoins to attract speculators to buy stablecoins. This increases the demand for stablecoin which brings its value back to a stable level.

The risk of this form of stablecoin is that when speculators no longer buy bonds, that stablecoin will collapse. A prime example of this collapse is the Basis Stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins of this type: Carbon, Steeem Dollar, Bitpay Officical, Nubits.",cryptocurrency

defi,Why Is Algorithmic Stablecoin Important?,"We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile)

  
**TLDR**

We are creating dynamic systems and integrating the financial infrastructure into this new system. And this new system can integrate the current policies in place like fractional banking and reserve banking with capital efficiency. The innovation it brings now is dynamic monetary policy and reduced time lag in monetary response. We see an increasing number of papers being written on more robust monetary policies by central banks. They seem novel and to implement them to rewrite the current monetary system is difficult. But with algorithmic stablecoins we can experiment with these designs and study the empirical evidence of their efficiency. In this way we can build better monetary models for the future.

# What Is Stablecoin?

Stablecoins are crypto assets that try to reduce volatility by pegging the value to another asset. Thus, it is stable with respect to the asset. For example, the value of the stablecoin will often be anchored to another type of stable asset such as central bank money (USD, CHF, RMB, SGD) or a commodity (gold, silver, precious metals).

# Why We Need Stablecoin

&gt;Stay tuned for our algo stablecoin research paper coming out! It is a collaboration between Economics Design, Lemniscap VC and Bocconi University.

*TLDR: easy access to this new digital crypto space.*

Stablecoins appear to solve the biggest problem in the current cryptocurrency market, volatility. For traders or investors, they can convert assets to stablecoins to avoid cryptocurrency volatility without necessarily converting to fiat.

For stores, it is difficult for a company to accept payment with a cryptocurrency when there is a fluctuation of 20-30% in value in a short period of time. This makes the broad adoption of cryptocurrencies much more difficult.

Therefore, stablecoin is important as a bridge between the electronic market and the traditional financial market. The transition from fiat to cryptocurrency has been a lot easier since the advent of stablecoins.

As Erik Voorhees, CEO of Shapeshift said:

&gt;‚ÄúStablecoins are important in the same way that a bridge is important. You may not care much about the bridge, but without it, the beautiful land beyond is much harder to get to‚Äù.

# Types Of Stablecoin

How are these stablecoins created? Via various mechanisms which can be broadly classified into fiat-collateralised, crypto-collateralised and algorithmic.

## Fiat-Collateralised Stablecoin

This is the most popular form of stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market at the moment. The value of these stablecoins is often pegged to the value of real money at a 1:1 ratio.

The main feature of this type of stablecoin is that the total supply of it on the market must be worth the equivalent of the amount of money stored by the issuer.

To ensure the truthfulness of that, the issuers will be inspected, managed and audited by a reputable financial institution such as a bank or financial audit company.

The risk of this type of stablecoin is the risk that the issuer of the stablecoin cannot prove that the reserve amount is of equal value to the value of the stablecoin circulating in the market.

Some typical fiat-backed stablecoins: Tether ($USDT), TrueUSD ($TUSD), USD Coin ($USDC), Paxos Standard ($PAX).

## Crypto-Collateralised Stablecoin

Like fiat-backed, crypto-backed stablecoins are stablecoins that are collateralised by a crypto asset.

However, the difference between these two types of stablecoin is where the collateral is stored.

With fiat-backed, collateral is stored off-chain by reputable third parties such as banks or auditing firms.

With crypto-backed, collateral is stored immediately on blockchain (on chain) which is locked in by means of a Smart Contract. This brings transparency as well as decentralisation.

The risk of the form of stablecoin collateralised by crypto is the fluctuation of the price of the crypto coin that is collateralised.

To minimise that risk, these stablecoins have to increase the value of the collateral to a very high level to ensure that price fluctuations do not affect the stability of the stablecoin.

In case the value of the collateralised crypto is lower than the issued stablecoin, the smart contract liquidates the collateralised assets to ensure the stability of the stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins: MakerDAO ($DAI), Bitshares ($BitUSD), Celo, Reserves ($RSV).

## Algorithmic Stablecoin

This type of stablecoin is not collateralised by any kind of asset. Instead, to maintain stability, these stablecoins use an algorithm-based supply-demand elasticity mechanism.

The working nature of this stablecoin is similar to how central banks work with fiat money.

When the value of a stablecoin is too high due to increased demand, the issuer will bring to the market a quantity of stablecoins until the value of the stablecoin is stabilised.

And vice versa ‚Äî when the value of the stablecoin drops too low, issuers will issue bonds bought with stablecoins to attract speculators to buy stablecoins. This increases the demand for stablecoin which brings its value back to a stable level.

The risk of this form of stablecoin is that when speculators no longer buy bonds, that stablecoin will collapse. A prime example of this collapse is the Basis Stablecoin.

personalfinance,This job has been mentally exhausting me.,"I have been working at this gas station for a year and I have been feeling so terrible lately. At first it was okay but now I feel it has gotten worse and more dangerous. I do some graveyard shifts and whenever there is a party around these night clubs, it gets very bad. I am a young female and get harassed a lot by guys... Either they discriminate towards my ethnicity randomly or ask me if that is my real hair or eyes. I tell them off and well, I don't care about it but it has gotten bad. 

Also the management is pretty bad, we are currently short-staffed and no other people want to work 6 days x 6 hours, the pay is too little and taxes are high. (I live in California)

I want to find another job but majority of jobs here are part-time which means no benefits. I stay there because of the insurance and a surgery I want to get. Apparently I was told opening an HSA account could help to gather enough for that surgery.

He just got a good bonus for work, enough to pay off that car (it's a 9% interest rate). What would happen if I paid it off on Monday (allowing us to cut expenses by suspending insurance on it, which is currently full coverage because it doesn't run at the moment), and then dispute it to have it removed from his credit report because it's paid in full? Those late payments are harmful, but this car loan is also his oldest open account (3 years into 5 year loan, his age average is 1.8 years because of it). We are still ""new"" to building our credit (his dropped 36 points recently because of the new car), and hoping to have both of us in the 720+ zone by next year.",finance

vet,Reasons for foul-smelling urine in dog negative for UTI?,"Hi. Our dog is a 5 yo neutered American Bully being treated with chlorambucil for lymphoma. Also positive for MCTs, and a sarcoma on his prepuce, but those are static for the moment; no treatment but no worsening or growth. He weighs 63 pounds.

Since before we adopted him he has had periods of dribbling of incredibly foul-smelling urine. It smells like straight ammonia and it scalds his skin. He drinks a lot of water, eats Victor Hi-Pro Plus kibble and gets his meds in Orijen grass-fed freeze-dried lamb treats. That‚Äôs all he consumes, no human food. 

In addition to the chlorambucil he takes Benadryl TID for the mast cell tumors and Gabapentin for a knee injury (likely caused by steroid treatment, we were told).

He was treated twice with antibiotics but it hasn‚Äôt helped. He still dribbles, and it smells fouler than ever. We keep him in a diaper when he is inside the house, which is most of the time. His snap-in pad is changed three times a day and the diaper is changed daily. He recently was prescribed a cream for the urine scalding.

I don‚Äôt know if this is relevant, but he was bred by backyard breeders and seized by police in a raid (then turned over to animal control, then to a rescue organization from where we adopted him) and has some ‚Äúflaws,‚Äù according to breeders. His tail is cropped, kinked, and to the left of his anus. It is very sensitive, so we are very careful not to touch it. It seems to cause low back pain if touched.

btc,Bitcoin - new gold,"I found this article interesting [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/bitcoin-may-very-well-become-the-new-gold-1030865899](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/bitcoin-may-very-well-become-the-new-gold-1030865899)

and though of some translation for crypto enthusiast with good heart but lack of knowledge about market reality.

Gold  is becoming Tier 1 asset due to Basel III regulations, that means banks  will no longer be allowed to finance their liabilities with paper  assets, these will have to be now &gt;85% physical. This is causing  massive buying of gold by all central banks at hugely discounted price  comparing to M1 money supply. Obviously there isnt enough physical  available to cover just a fraction of paper gold.

The  price suppression is achieved by combining the real physical gold with  paper derivatives in 1:100+ ratio used in short selling at artificially  low prices. This process is something that may come to BTC with creation  of new ETF and futures market: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/q4k2bl/jpmorgan\_and\_soros\_are\_now\_into\_btc\_beware/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/q4k2bl/jpmorgan_and_soros_are_now_into_btc_beware/)

US  and EU are already compliant with Basel III and the last bastion of  global price manipulation in London due for compliance in Jan 22. It is  obvious there is not enough physical gold to sustain trading volume  required for ongoing suppression and if in January the main market  makers: Barclays, HSBC, Standard Charted, JPM are not compliant, will be  penalized by regulator.

Gold  business is fading away so what comes next for speculative capital? This  feels like possibility for BTC to replace Gold or precisely paper BTC  could replace paper Gold.

Forget  about all characteristics of crypto or fact its digital, hassle free.  Derivative is derivative it has no encryption key or hash and if paper  volume becomes dominant, complete price control becomes reality.

Remember  that bullion banks , which are custodian of smaller funds (citadel etc)  are all together working for FED and other central banks, ensuring  their flagship product (fiat currency) maintains purchasing power. Price  of BTC will be set to suit central banks agenda.

Btw. When the time comes gold and silver (even more suppressed) will be re-valued to cement demise of fiat currencies.

CryptoCurrency,Crypto Pays for Guitar.,"People!

The candles are green everyone is delighted, it looks really good, it feels really good. I'm over the moon with the amount the Markets gone up.

However, Im taking a small bit of profit, not much, just a slice off the top. Probably about 5% of my Portfolio as its up 100%.

Why? Because the Fear and Greed index is at an all time high. Yes, this could go on for another month, yes, it could end in 5 minutes, who knows. What I do know is right now, I can take a little bit of profit. 

Most who have been through the May crash will tell you they should have sold some or all when it was up. Because the worst thing is saying, I could have sold and made X amount. But if you take a little bit, it makes it that much easier to bear when the dip happens and yes it will happen. And the little bit is quick to replace itself through DCA and if the Market keeps rising.

I've taken something and bought myself that Electric Guitar I've always wanted. I can play it when the markets are Red and I need some distractions. 

Do what you want. I know you will anyway but if you don't take at least a small something, you will probably regret it.

If the whole market crashes we're all F***ed anyway. 

At least I'll still have my Guitar. But yes I really, really need lessons. ü§ò

CryptoCurrency,I've held for a year now. Here's what I've learned:,"TL;DR

Accidentally DCA'D

Spent all my OG BTC on THC XTC DMT MDMA

Was Ready to Do it Again
Learned about Shit Instead

Took Care of My Mind and Body

NO TRADE ONLY HODL

Have Strong Convictions About Utility If You Are Going Unreasonably Long

I got into bitcoin a year ago playing poker and having a nice run from $4 to $150 and without realizing made my first DCA of $75 into BTC around $12k. I had no intention to hold, and was checking dark net markets for the price of various drugs, ready to spend the winnings after a week. I had stumbled upon a Ray Dalio  video about stores of value, and told my friends to buy bitcoin, but didn't really understand why and had no conviction.

My first coinbase transaction was buying a quarter of a BTC in 2016 for $90, 25.4m sats. I had used dark net markets since 2012 and at this point dozens of bitcoin had gone through my lungs, tounge, and other various organs. Not a single sat was left.

With this in mind, after a month in Nov 2020, I deposited 25% of my stack back into the poker website once btc hit 20k, that was the ATH right? Surely it was done pumping. No, and I lost the money I deposited.

November has historically been a tough month for me. It brings seasonal depression and often becomes hard for me to enjoy things. This one though, I began to work on my game. The weakest part of my game was my inability to follow through with rational thought, and letting emotions make decisions instead of logic.

By the end of November my bankroll had tripled, and I kept most of it in a hot wallet in btc. Michael Saylor had started to buy bitcoin and my interest in poker turned more to finance and business. For the first time in my life, I wanted to become more educated and saw the value in learning. My high school self wanted to trade rocks for sticks with the mud people; now I wanted to impact society a little more. I was voluntarily taking online classes at Saylor.org, a foreign concept to my younger self.

I started to listen to Cathie Wood and Michael Saylor a lot. I took interest in fiduciaries and their advice of a 2 to 5% allocation of net worth to crypto. I started to seriously advise my closest friends and converted my nocoiner friends, including a Mt Gox victim who was super burnt and had no trust left. I began to understand common misconceptions I had about debt, and finally stopped trying to day trade or swing trade with $100, it's just a waste of time.

I read The Bitcoin Standard and started to see why a public ledger is so threatening to frivolous government spending, how inflation taxes wage earners quietly and rewards asset holders, and how money represents economic energy, an important concept to preserve and increase quality of life for all. Gold gained my respect for its historical role as a unit of account. Shoutout to stock to flow models.

I began to see that macro economics and astrology had way more in common than either of them want to admit in that no one really knows shit about fuck, and a lot of global monetary policy is based off feeling, and established status quos. The science of economics is often ignored by world leaders and the money printer goes brrr for the war machines.

Finally, investments are personal. It's important to have strong conviction for it removes the feeling to sell. I have a 30 yr hold plan at this point. We tryna retire here. I don't have to explain myself to anyone. I understand the utility. I understand morality is trumped by utility. This is why the BSC is relevant. CEX have undeniable utility. Bitcoin's energy use is problematic, but it wouldn't be if we generated our energy more sustainably, which commercial use dwarfs all other retail use of energy.

CryptoCurrency,cUSD - A Write Up about a Stablecoin,"The many and varied uses of stablecoins

Stablecoins first emerged on the cryptocurrency scene in 2014. By tracking the value of an underlying asset, they aimed to protect users from the volatility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This stability allowed stablecoins to function as a medium of exchange and store of value. However, a lack of transparency, long transaction times, high costs and limited access meant adoption was initially slow.

To overcome these difficulties, the Celo network launched its first stablecoin, the Celo Dollar (cUSD), in June 2020. cUSD tracks the US dollar, and it has been designed to enable users to near-instantly send and receive money from a mobile phone- without a bank account- for a negligible fee.

To maintain its stability, cUSD is backed by the Celo reserve consisting of a basket of crypto assets, including CELO, the network‚Äôs native asset. The Celo reserve algorithmically adjusts the supply of stablecoins to user demand. If the value of cUSD rises above $1, then the network increases the cUSD supply by allowing users to purchase newly created cUSD from the Celo reserve in exchange for $1 worth of CELO. The opposite happens when the price falls below $1.

A second stable asset, the Celo Euro (cEUR), was launched earlier this year and further stablecoins can be added in future to meet the needs of the community. These could track other fiat currencies such as the Brazilian Real, the Philippine Peso, the Japanese Yen or a basket of assets which functions as a community currency or local unit of account.
Following the launch of cEUR, now seems like a good time to discuss some of the use cases for stablecoins. They fall into two categories- transactions and decentralized finance (DeFi).

Transactions

Celo‚Äôs architecture is one of the main reasons that cUSD and cEUR make mobile payments so easy. Celo is a mobile-first blockchain, designed for fast and light transactions (about 5 seconds) with block headers optimized for mobile phone synchronization. 

With non-custodial wallets like Valora, users can send payments to phone numbers, which makes transactions on the Celo blockchain as easy as sending a text message to a phone contact. Transaction fees on the Celo blockchain are negligible and payable in stable assets, which means that users sending cUSD to friends or family are able to pay fees out of their cUSD balance, and do not need to hold a separate balance of CELO in order to make transactions.

For the record, the architecture is also climate-friendly. The Celo blockchain relies on a consensus mechanism known as Proof-of-Stake, which consumes much less energy than Bitcoin‚Äôs Proof-of-Work mechanism without compromising security. The network offsets its remaining emissions through various programs like its partnership with Project Wren.

Payment Alternatives

Celo‚Äôs stablecoins offer merchants a cheaper and faster alternative to other payment solutions. Transactions on the Celo blockchain cost a fraction of a dollar cent regardless of the value and get processed rapidly, whereas payment providers using legacy payment infrastructure typically charge a flat fee plus an additional 1.5% to 3%.

Another advantage of using blockchain technology is it reduces counterparty risk by eliminating the intermediary. The sender and receiver transact directly with each other rather than through a third-party payment provider, removing a potential point of failure.

Singapore‚Äôs MugglePay was one of the earliest adopters of stablecoins, while Deutsche Telekom, web browser Opera, and PayU, which serves 450,000 merchants in Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia, recently joined Celo‚Äôs Alliance for Prosperity and announced support of Celo‚Äôs stable assets.

Transfer Alternatives

Stablecoins also offer users an affordable way to directly send money across borders without an intermediary. To put this in context, sending $200 in cUSD or cEUR costs less than a cent, compared with a global average charge of $12 according to the World Bank, rising to more than $30 in some countries.

Thanks to projects such as Kotani Pay, users can send and receive money and apply for loans from the most basic mobile devices owned by roughly 60% of the African market.

Giving Alternatives

Celo stablecoins allow for targeted, fast and cost-efficient distribution of humanitarian and environmental aid. In June 2020, the nonprofit Grameen Foundation launched a project to send emergency cash relief to female entrepreneurs in the Philippines. Delivering physical goods was a challenge given the measures to combat the covid pandemic, so the foundation used the Celo platform to send nearly $160,000 in cUSD to more than 730 beneficiaries. The recipients spent the money through a custom microsite selling groceries and daily necessities. The United Nations World Food Programme, Mercy Corps and CARE also have announced projects on Celo

Earning Alternatives

The world is gradually shifting towards a gig economy, especially in developing countries which generally have large, informal labor markets. Meanwhile, improved connectivity has created microwork opportunities, giving people a chance to either earn a full time living or top up their salary. However, microwork payments are typically small, so they‚Äôre best suited for low fee solutions that use stablecoins. And as pointed out earlier, Celo‚Äôs technology is compatible with basic mobile phones.

Decentralized finance (DeFi)

Stablecoins give users access to a new generation of alternative financial products, traditionally only available through a bank, from their mobile phone. The DeFi ecosystem may become important in countries with limited financial infrastructure where it‚Äôs difficult to open an account or apply for credit or lending facilities.

Saving Alternatives

By converting local currency into cUSD and cEUR, users can protect their income and savings from some of the risk of hyperinflation which can rapidly erode the value of certain fiat currencies. And hyperinflation remains a real concern for millions of people with inflation rates in 2020 exceeding hundreds and thousands of percentage points in some countries. 

Take Zimbabwe for example. Prices are rising by an estimated 100% this year, although that‚Äôs an improvement on 550% in 2020. Elsewhere, Argentina is facing more than a decade of double-digit inflation with current inflation rates between 40% and 50%.

Even in countries with low inflation, such as the EU and the US, stablecoins can help to avoid erosion of savings. The European Central Bank‚Äôs deposit rates are negative at present, and commercial banks pass these costs to retail customers, either as negative rates or increased fees. 
However, Euros held as cEUR aren‚Äôt exposed to these rates, or, for that matter, the foreign exchange risk of converting Euros into other fiat currencies. Interest rates in the US are near zero, while the Celo community set aside funds to provide users of Valora rewards of 5% on cUSD holdings.

Some community members have launched their own stablecoins on the Celo network to meet the demand of local communities. DuniaPay‚Äôs cXOF stablecoin tracks the value of the West African CFA franc ‚Äî a currency used by residents in more than fourteen countries in West Africa ‚Äî and allows holders to earn 8% on their cXOF holdings.

Lending Alternatives

On platforms like Moola Market, users can lend stablecoins and earn on or borrow stablecoins against collateral if they don‚Äôt want to liquidate holdings. Earnings depend on demand for an asset: they rise when demand grows and fall when it shrinks.

Pooling

In traditional markets, assets are traded via order books on centralized exchanges that determine clearing prices according to supply and demand. 
Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Ubeswap remove the need for an intermediary. Instead, users trade directly against liquidity pools, a collection of coins held in a smart contract on the blockchain. DEXs employ an algorithm to adjust the price of an asset based on the flows into and out of the pools.

DEXs can only execute trades if the pool has sufficient liquidity, so they offer an incentive by paying liquidity providers. There are risks of loss, though, especially when the coins are volatile.",cryptocurrency

The big dream back then was to graduate and beg to get accepted into some fiat mining pools where devs are 70% toxic and you have to run your corpse flesh mining rig for 40 hours a day till 65. The world ran on fiat and  fiat devs are more often than not anon, and are shady as fuck, and due to their coding incompetence, double spending exploits occur every day, and 100% all fiat codes are not audited. Because tokenomics are bad, inflation in some fiat coins can get very high, but this only affects krill wallets, because whale wallets already are earning yields in exclusive clubs. 

100% all contracts were non-smart, so banks can charge you up to 2% on a total contract's value to perform a non-smart contract interaction. So a $10 million transaction can incur a fee of $200,000 and a week to finalize.

The big whales that took absurd amount of risks and lost all their money in shitcoin trading were bailed out by the government, so they can start new pools to  bet on more shitcoins in the future.

Do you think I can get a better rate. My husband and I are working really hard to get rid of our debt. We've recently completely paid off 3 out of our 4 credit cards. I'm concerned about rate shopping because I do not want to mess up my credit. Scores are a funny thing. Wells Fargo shows my score at an 835/850, Discover 850/850 and then you have Capital One saying it's only a 740. Just a week ago we recently purchased my husband a new vehicle and when they pulled my score it was a 891/900. Can I do a refi even though I technically have no income without my husband also having to be on the loan?

personalfinance,WWYD - Traditional vs Roth 401(k) - State (PA) Tax edition,"Hello Reddit PF - I have a variation on the frequently question posted here. Here is the situation:

Living in Philadelphia PA for the next \~8 months then will be moving to an unknown city (and certainly don't know where we will be retiring at this stage - currently late 20s), 22/24% federal tax bracket for next \~5 years then will be 32/35% there after. PA state/Philly local taxes are 6.9% and 401(k) contributions are **non-deductible** in PA. So, traditional 401(k) contributions are taxed 6.9% up front for PA (no federal obviously) - we would get this on the backend if we stayed in PA as they don't tax 401(k) withdrawals but again, don't necessarily have plans to be back in PA 30 years from now (here for school).

personalfinance,Mom is $30k behind on her mortgage. Need help figuring out how to fix it.,"Long story short, I'm in the process of getting power of attorney for my elderly mother so I can manage her finances for her. Her main problem is that she's somehow 18 months behind on her mortgage, for a grand total of nearly $30,000. Someone was stealing everything in her checking account during that time period, so unfortunately that money is now gone. Not sure how she still has her house, but the good news is that she recently enrolled in a pandemic forbearance plan, so I have a few months to figure things out.

She has two mortgages, one for $200k (the 30k delinquent one) and one for $40k (a few months delinquent). The interest rate for the main one is around 5%. She can theoretically afford to get on a payment plan or something, but she also owes the water company $8000, so that's going to soak up her disposable income for a while.

I'm 30ish and have never owned a home, so I'm not sure what to do here. It seems like the best way to make the problem go away is refinancing the house, which would also have the added benefit of lowering her interest rate. The problem is her credit is now around 500, so I assume I would need to cosign with her (mine is \~760), but I'm not thrilled about it.

What are the implications for me if I do this? Like will I still be able to qualify for first-time homeowner loans and such if I want to buy a house later? Do I have any other options here besides negotiating a payment plan with the mortgage company?

Aside from that, I have serious reservations about her current living situation. I'm hoping it won't be necessary, but at some point I may need to sell her house and move her closer to me. It would probably be on short notice and I wouldn't be in a position to make repairs or stay in the area for long.

What would be the best way to get rid of it? Do I contact one of those sell your home fast types or try to get a realtor to handle it? It's in poor repair, infested with rats, and probably full of junk, so I was figuring I'd have to do the former. Roughly how far below market value should I be expecting it to go for? The Zillow estimate puts it at $460k.

&amp;#x200B;

To recap, here are my main questions:

1. Is the best way to deal with the $30k delinquency on the mortgage to refinance the house?

2. Do I have to cosign? If so, does this have any implications for me, as someone who has never owned a home?

3. If I have to get rid of the house at some point, should I sell it to one of the ""buy homes fast"" people?

4. If so, how bad of a deal should I expect?",finance

personalfinance,Loan Decision for Refinancing Student Loans? 10/15 year? Investing excess to determine which is more profitable.,"I'm 22 years old with a new job fresh out of college. I have about $90,000 in student loan debt currently from Sallie Mae. If I pay off with Sallie Mae at their scheduled rate, it will end up costing about $160,000 in total at ~$1177/month.

So I've just started looking into refinancing options and have been trying to decide between a 10 and 15 year fixed interest rate loan for ~$90,000.

**10 Year Loan**: $940/month for 10 years. Total loan cost = $112,800.

**15 Year Loan**: $710/month for 15 years. Total loan cost = $127,600. 

As I thought about it, I figured the 10 year was better given that I can afford it and pay less overall. However after considering the investment opportunity of a lower monthly payment, my mind has changed. 

Given that I can afford $940/month, my plan would be to set this aside regardless of loan choice for 15 years. If I were to choose the 15 year loan, I would be able to invest the excess $230/month in a safe 10% annual ETF for 15 years. This would result in a total cost to me of $169,200. However after 15 years, my invested $ would be worth ~$91,000. 

If I were to go with the 10 year loan, I would also set aside the $940/month for 15 years. For the first 10 years, this would only go toward paying off the loan. When the loan is paid off, I would be able to invest $940/month into the same 10% ETF for 5 years. The total cost would be the same at $169,200, but my investment after 5 years would only be worth about $71,000. 

After doing this math, it seems clear to me that the longer term loan would be a much better option given that the total investment over 15 years is the same, however I am making more by investing $230/month for 15 years rather than $940/month for 5 years. What are your thoughts on this?",finance

What are moves you all are making after building up your savings? Nearly everything seems risky to me at the moment. A couple of years ago, I was interested in saving for a down payment on a home.

solar,Phased Migration to Solar. Has Anyone Done This?,"I'm looking at purchasing a property and building a house on it. In a perfect scenario, I would have a grid-tied system with full battery backup, and run my house off the batteries, and just sell back extra power to the grid. I've done research and haven't been able to find any real products that do the automatic shutoff of the grid when it goes down, so it looks like that might not be an option. If I could do that, and just use the solar to make money while I run my house off of the panels and batteries, I'd do that and potentially just finance the whole system up front.

Anyway, what I've thought about doing is this: Add a 5kw all-in-one inverter/charge controller (maybe a Growatt), along with a battery/batteries, and a few solar panels. Bear with me, I'm early in my research so I don't have specific parts picked out yet. Anyway,  what I wanted to see is if it's possible or advisable ( because I can't afford to go 'whole house off grid' in one go unless I'm able to generate some return income by selling back to the grid) to simply run several rooms' circuits off of the solar, and because I don't know what the energy usage will be until I'm in the house, move circuits over to the electrical panel that's fed by the solar/battery system as I see how much power I actually use. Then, as I can afford it, will add additional all-in-ones with a battery and panels, and migrate a couple more circuits, until I'm completely off grid.

CryptoCurrency,"Story time: A crypto kid had a $23,000-a-month condo. Then the Feds came","Stefan Qin was just 19 when he claimed to have the secret to cryptocurrency trading.

Buoyed with youthful confidence, Qin, a self-proclaimed math prodigy  from Australia, dropped out of college in 2016 to start a hedge fund in  New York he called Virgil Capital. He told potential clients he had  developed an algorithm called Tenjin to monitor cryptocurrency exchanges  around the world to seize on price fluctuations. A little more than a  year after it started, he bragged the fund had returned 500%, a claim  that produced a flurry of new money from investors.

He became so flush with cash, Qin signed a lease in September 2019 for a  $23,000-a-month apartment in 50 West, a 64-story luxury condo building  in the financial district with expansive views of lower Manhattan as  well as a pool, sauna, steam room, hot tub and golf simulator.

In reality, federal prosecutors said, the operation was a lie,  essentially a Ponzi scheme that stole about $90 million from more than  100 investors to help pay for Qin‚Äôs lavish lifestyle and personal  investments in such high-risk bets as initial coin offerings. At one  point, facing client demands for their money, he variously blamed ‚Äúpoor  cash flow management"" and ‚Äúloan sharks in China"" for his troubles. Last  week, Qin, now 24 and expressing remorse, pleaded guilty in federal  court in Manhattan to a single count of securities fraud.

‚ÄúI knew that what I was doing was wrong and illegal,"" he told U.S.  District Judge Valerie E. Caproni, who could sentence him to more than  15 years in prison. ‚ÄúI deeply regret my actions and will spend the rest  of my life atoning for what I did. I am profoundly sorry for the harm my  selfish behavior has caused to my investors who trusted in me, my  employees and my family.""

The case echoes similar cryptocurrency frauds, such as that of  BitConnect, promising people double-and triple-digit returns and costing  investors billions. Ponzi schemes like that show how investors eager to  cash in on a hot market can easily be led astray by promises of large  returns. Canadian exchange QuadrigaCX collapsed in 2019 as a result of  fraud, causing at least $125 million in losses for 76,000 investors.

While regulatory oversight of the cryptocurrency industry is  tightening, the sector is littered with inexperienced participants. A  number of the 800 or so crypto funds worldwide are run by people with no  knowledge of Wall Street or finance, including some college students  and recent graduates who launched funds a few years ago.

Qin‚Äôs path started in college, too. He had been a math whiz who planned  on becoming a physicist, he told a website, DigFin, in a profile  published in December, just a week before regulators closed in on him.  He described himself on his LinkedIn page as a ‚Äúquant with a deep  interest and understanding in blockchain technology.""

In 2016, he won acceptance into a program for high-potential  entrepreneurs at the University of New South Wales in Sydney with a  proposal to use blockchain technology to speed up foreign exchange  transactions. He also attended the Minerva Schools, a mostly online  college based in San Francisco, from August 2016 through December 2017,  the school confirmed.

**Crypto Bug**

He got the crypto bug after an internship with a firm in China, he told  DigFin. His task had been to build a platform between two venues, one  in China and the other in the U.S., to allow the firm to arbitrage  cryptocurrencies.

Convinced he had happened upon a business, Qin moved to New York to  found Virgil Capital. His strategy, he told investors, would be to  exploit the tendency of cryptocurrencies to trade at different prices at  various exchanges. He would be ‚Äúmarket-neutral,"" meaning that the  firm‚Äôs funds wouldn‚Äôt be exposed to price movements.

And unlike other hedge funds, he told DigFin, Virgil wouldn‚Äôt charge  management fees, taking only fees based on the firm‚Äôs performance. ‚ÄúWe  never try to make easy money,"" Qin said.

By his telling, Virgil got off to a fast start, claiming 500% returns  in 2017, which brought in more investors eager to participate. A  marketing brochure boasted of 10% monthly returns -- or 2,811% over a  three-year period ending in August 2019, legal filings show.

His assets got an extra jolt after the Wall Street Journal profiled him  in a February 2018 story that touted his skill at arbitraging  cryptocurrency. Virgil ‚Äúexperienced substantial growth as new investors  flocked to the fund,"" prosecutors said.

**Missing Assets**

The first cracks appeared last summer. Some investors were becoming  ‚Äúincreasingly upset"" about missing assets and incomplete transfers, the  former head of investor relations, Melissa Fox Murphy, said in a court  declaration. (She left the firm in December.) The complaints grew.

‚ÄúIt is now MID DECEMBER and my MILLION DOLLARS IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN,""  wrote one investor, whose name was blacked out in court documents. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs  a disgrace the way you guys are treating one of your earliest and  largest investors.""

Around the same time, nine investors with $3.5 million in funds asked  for redemptions from the firm‚Äôs flagship Virgil Sigma Fund LP, according  to prosecutors. But there was no money to transfer. Qin had drained the  Sigma Fund of its assets. The fund‚Äôs balances were fabricated.

Instead of trading at 39 exchanges around the world, as he had claimed,  Qin spent investor money on personal expenses and to invest in other  undisclosed high-risk investments, including initial coin offerings,  prosecutors said.

So Qin tried to stall. He convinced investors instead to transfer their  interests into his VQR Multistrategy Fund, another cryptocurrency fund  he started in February 2020 that used a variety of trading strategies --  and still had assets.

**‚ÄòLoan Sharks‚Äô**

He also sought to withdraw $1.7 million from the VQR fund, but that  aroused suspicions from the head trader, Antonio Hallak. In a phone call  Hallak recorded in December, Qin said he needed the money to repay  ‚Äúloan sharks in China"" that he had borrowed from to start his business,  according to court filings in a lawsuit filed by the Securities and  Exchange Commission. He said the loan sharks ‚Äúmight do anything to  collect on the debt"" and that he had a ‚Äúliquidity issue"" that prevented  him from repaying them.

‚ÄúI just had such poor cash flow management to be honest with you,"" Qin  told Hallak. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have money right now dude. It‚Äôs so sad.""

When the trader balked at the withdrawal, Qin attempted to take over  the reins of VQR‚Äôs accounts. But by now the SEC was involved. It got  cryptocurrency exchanges to put a hold on VQR‚Äôs remaining assets and, a  week later, filed suit.

**Asset Recovery**

By the end, Qin had drained virtually all of the money that was in the  Sigma Fund. A court-appointed receiver who is overseeing the fund is  looking to recover assets for investors, said Nicholas Biase, a  spokesman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss. About $24 million  in assets in the VQR fund was frozen and should be available to  disperse, he said.

‚ÄúStefan He Qin drained almost all of the assets from the $90 million  cryptocurrency fund he owned, stealing investors‚Äô money, spending it on  indulgences and speculative personal investments, and lying to investors  about the performance of the fund and what he had done with their  money,"" Strauss said in a statement.

In South Korea when he learned of the probe, Qin agreed to fly back to  the U.S., prosecutors said. He surrendered to authorities on Feb. 4,  pleaded guilty the same day before Caproni, and was freed on a $50,000  bond pending his sentencing, scheduled for May 20. While the maximum  statutory penalty calls for 20 years in prison, as part of a plea deal,  prosecutors agreed that he should get 151 to 188 months behind bars  under federal sentencing guidelines and a fine of up to $350,000.

That fate is a far cry from the career his parents had envisioned for  him -- a physicist, he had told DigFin. ‚ÄúThey weren‚Äôt too happy when I  told them I had quit uni to do this crypto thing. Who knows, maybe  someday I‚Äôll complete my degree. But what I really want to do is trade  crypto.""

personalfinance,Help with prioritizing goals- paying off student loan debt vs investing vs saving for a house.,"Hi r/personalfinance, I was hoping to get some help prioritizing my goals. I have just started my journey to become more financially literate a few months ago so hoping to get advice from you all.

I am 27 years old (single) living in AZ. Graduated into the pandemic last year and luckily landed a job. My current salary is **$120k** before taxes. After taxes, insurance, traditional 401k, and HSA my monthly income is just a bit over **$6000**.

My investments:

\- I currently contribute just up to max my employer match in my 401k. Same story with my HSA- due to be maxed out soon.

\- I contribute **$500**/month to my Roth IRA to meet the max per year.

\- I contribute **$200**/month to my personal taxable account.

\- I contribute **$100**/month on crypto.

As for my expenses:

\- Rent is **$1000**/month.

\- My spending budget is currently set to **$2000**/month. This includes pretty much everything else such as: eating out, groceries, shopping, travel, gas, etc (this all goes on CC). As well as bills like: car insurance and phone

\- I have CC debt currently totaling **$2,300**. I pay off the varying statement balances every month (working on getting this sub $2k consistently- it used to be at $8k).

Luckily I don't have any other debts apart from student loans and CC.

This brings my savings per month to about **\~$2,200**.

I have an emergency fund of **$10k** sitting in a regular savings account.

My student loans are just under **$23k**. I was not paying anything while I was in school and I am not due to pay anything until Feb 2022. Currently, they are not accumulating interest.

Here is a breakdown of the loans along with their interest rates:

$6,498 - 4.53% | $5,500 - 4.53% | $5,189 - 4.45% | $4,500 - 5.05% | $902 - 4.45%

I am looking to pay this off aggressively.

I do want this to be my last year of renting and am hoping to buy a house in mid-2022 once my current lease is up. Looking to leverage some sort of FHA loan to keep down payment low (wondering if this is a good idea as well). My question is what should I prioritize? Saving for a house, investing, or aggressively paying off student debt? Should I be investing at all? I was thinking maybe halting contributions into crypto and my personal taxable account. What about saving for a house? Should I not until I pay off my student loan debt? Happy to take any and all advice. Thanks in advance!

**TLDR**:

Recently, the cryptocurrency market has become more and more exciting because of the rapid increase in the number of new participants. In the current situation of extremely low bank interest rates, more and more people with a demand for ""fixed interest rate loans of 10% a year"" will step into this market.

Applications like Outlet, Linus, Dharma, BlockFi, Celsius have developed user interfaces to meet this need, with liquidity coming from centralised liquidity pools or from Compound and Aave. Therefore, users' attention to decentralised fixed-rate products will be even greater.

&amp;#x200B;

# General Conclusion

Bonds are one of the most in-demand financial products to date. According to [Icmagroup](https://www.icmagroup.org/Regulatory-Policy-and-Market-Practice/Secondary-Markets/bond-market-size/), the total bond market is over $128Tn and the terrain is open for blockchain projects to penetrate the market.

Many new DeFi projects are looking at concepts found in traditional finance, such as:

* Fixed interest;
* Decomposing fixed income assets into principal and interest;
* Leveraged yield.

DeFi protocols are beginning to address basic concepts and meet the needs of many classes of users that TradFi cannot, because of crypto's nearly frictionless composability.

These protocols were born with the primary goal of uncertain and often volatile returns received when staking or depositing tokens for lending (Aave, Compound), trading (Curve) or actively farming (Yearn, Harvest).

# Traditional Bond

## Definition

A bond is a security issued in connection with a debt arrangement. The borrower (the seller) issues a bond to the lender (the purchaser) in return for some cash. A bond is an ""IOU"" (I Owe You) of the borrower. A typical coupon bond requires the issuer to make predetermined payments.

When the bond matures, the issuer repays the debt by paying the face value of the bond. The bond's interest rate determines the interest payment. The annual payment amount equals the bond's interest rate multiplied by the bond's face value. The coupon rate, maturity date and par value of the bond are part of the bond indenture agreement, which is a contract between the issuer and the holder of the bond.

## Types of Bonds

* Government bonds  
This is a type of security issued by a government for the purpose of raising medium and long-term capital for the government. Revenues from bonds can be used to make up temporary shortfalls of the state budget, to implement national construction projects, or to finance other government purposes according to the budget allocation plan. books every year.
* Local Government bonds  
These are bonds issued by the People's Committees of provinces and centrally run cities to raise capital for local investment projects and works.
* Government-guaranteed bonds  
This is a bond issued by enterprises, financial institutions, credit institutions, and policy banks of the State subject to the provisions of the relevant laws and guaranteed for payment by the Government.
* Corporate bonds.  
Debt securities are bonds issued by companies or financial institutions in order to raise capital for business activities.

personalfinance,Here‚Äôs why I kept my junker and saved the payments I would have made instead,"Back in March my 99 Ford exploder needed a $200 repair. I‚Äôd just made $100 in repairs the month before and $75 the month before that. Generally I see advice to buy a new car if your old one starts costing as much to repair each month as a car payment. I started shopping around for financing options and didn‚Äôt like what I was seeing. If I financed through my bank for example, they would require the financed amount to be $7,000 minimum on a car 4 years old or newer with less than 100,000 miles. APY would be ~18%. Since I‚Äôd need to also get comprehensive insurance coverage, the minimum payment I was looking at was around $170/mo for 72mos if I met the bare minimum requirements for financing with my bank and upping my insurance, including a $3,000 down payment. 

I bit the bullet and repaired my car. I didn‚Äôt want to take on the credit hit nor the financial responsibility. My salary isn‚Äôt great right now and that‚Äôs a lot of money. But I know in 5 years, my salary and credit will be better and I could afford a bigger down payment. 

Since March, I‚Äôve put $150 away each month that would‚Äôve been the difference in my current insurance and no car payment and the cost of getting the new car. 

This has done a few things for me. 

(1) more savings. If I suddenly need to make a large repair or afford a new car, I have more money to make the repair or down payment with. My old gal hasn‚Äôt needed a single repair since then, thankfully. I‚Äôve put the money into stable ETFs with a 5 year time horizon and have actually made an average 9% return. 

(2) I now know I could have afforded that payment, which is a huge peace of mind if I have to soon. I feel like the decision would have been less impulsive. 

(3) I avoided the used car price surge. It was crazy to see used cars I was looking at a couple months before increase in price by ~20%. We don‚Äôt know how long this used car inflation rate will last, but at least it‚Äôs something I can spectate rather than experience. 

(4) I‚Äôve actually managed to raise my credit the last few months by almost 50 points. I also have enough room financially and credit wise to take an international trip using a travel credit card and earning a $500 value travel bonus. 


In 5 years, I should be able to afford a $13,000 car completely out of pocket rather than a $7,000 financed car with more insurance costs. 

If any of you are considering buying a new car, I‚Äôd recommend weighing your pros and cons carefully and on a long-term basis!








*Edit/update*

My post was removed temporarily, but I got it reapproved. Thank you all so much for your encouragement and feedback! This is the most attention I‚Äôve ever gotten on a post. 

Just to address a couple things I see mentioned a lot: 
I‚Äôm 24 and a semi-recent college graduate, so my credit wasn‚Äôt too hot back in March. I‚Äôve done a lot of work to increase my credit so drastically in the last 6months. I know that my old gal might not make it another 5 years, but at least if I have to get a new car in the next 2 years, I‚Äôll have better credit for a better interest rate, hopefully these inflation costs will have gone down a little, and I‚Äôll have more funds for a down payment. I‚Äôll definitely be looking into credit unions for financing if I need to finance! 

Some of you are also rightfully concerned that I‚Äôm putting the funds in the market. Although it‚Äôs a stable EFT, I know there are risks; however, I have a separate emergency fund and if my 5 year time horizon isn‚Äôt met and I‚Äôm not able to liquidate, I have emergency funds to tap into. This was also a risk I took into consideration and why I went for a low-risk conservative investment option.  

I also see some people are concerned for my safety with driving a 23 year old car. That‚Äôs a risk I weighed, and bc I only drive a few miles to work at under 55mph limits, it was a risk I accepted. That‚Äôs not the same for everyone, and something important for you to consider with your own lifestyle when considering getting another car. 

Here are the repairs I needed to make, since some of you were curious: new brake pads for front wheels, front passenger rotor and rim, and a battery. My dad and I were able to fix these without a trip to the mechanic. That might not be a feasible option for everyone if not mechanically inclined and definitely would have costed more if I did visit a mechanic. The only other maintenance I anticipate in the short term is replacing 3 of the  tires and getting an oil change, which might cost around another $300 but it would be worth it to not have a car payment imo.",finance

Brokerage: \~80k, Savings: \~60k , Retirement Accounts: \~350k (Before anyone asks, I've been maxing the mega backdoor Roth for several years and maxing a roth IRA since I was 18).

We're looking at properties in the 550k-650k range, with the intentions of staying until we're having kids in 5-7 years, at which point we would buy a SFH and either sell or continue to rent it out.

We currently pay 2.8k/month in rent, but anticipate this being hiked to \~3k/month this coming year. The ongoing payments on the property at the middle of our range would be \~3.4k a month (2k mortage, rest property tax / insurance / HOA).

We plan on splitting the down payment 50/50 and at the high end of this range I anticipate \~80k in total closing costs, plus probably 10k in moving related expenses. To finance this and maintain a 25k emergency fund I would need to sell off about half of my brokerage account.

Maybe I'm just overly conservative, but it feels like I'm overextending and will have too much tied up in an illiquid asset, although some of this might just be my own fears about money.

Questions:

* Since the expected returns on stocks are much higher (especially since condos/townhomes in Chicago have not appreciated for many many years), would it be stupid to liquidate my brokerage account to fund this instead of continuing to rent? I will re-fund this brokerage account over the coming year(s) of course, but may be missing out on returns. That being said, interest rates are at all time lows and the markets are at all time highs.... so I'm torn.
* Would it be smarter to just save for another couple years and then buy the SFH we ultimately will want (at least 1M here, maybe 1.5M) instead of taking on this intermediate property?

I know this a niche scenario, but fundamentally the question is **in a market where appreciation is unlikely does buying real estate over investing more + renting make sense?**",finance
investing,Have a very low rate line of credit - thoughts on investments?,"Hey folks, because I work at a bank I can get a 20k line of credit at 1% interest (compounded monthly, so it's 1.0046% annualized) (edit : this is fixed rate not variable)

personalfinance,Please help with the best student debt repayment option.,"I have exactly $160,000 in federal student debt. I have been trying to pay it off with the REPAYE repayment plan for about 5 years now. For the last 5 years, I have been only paying the monthly accrued interest. I have 7 loans with an average of 7 percent. I have two loans that are at 7.8 percent each and worth $29,000 each. Without REPAYE, I would be paying around $3200 per month.

I am finally in a position where I can finally start aggressively paying the debt off. I make $220,000 per year. I currently have $60,000 that I plan to pay immediately. However, I am not sure what is the best way to go about this. As I see it, I have two options. Option one, I pay $60,000 now and cover both groups that have 7.8 percent. I then start paying as much as I can per month until I pay it off. Second option, I pay $60,000 towards the two groups with 7.8 percent. I then refinance to private at 3.6 percent for 15-20 years. I then pay as much as I can per month until it is paid off. Staying with REPAYE is not an option because I am unlikely to qualify for it now with my new income. Even if I will, I will pay the total amount way before I reach 25 years of qualified payment to qualify for the discharge.

The biggest drawback with option one is that if for whatever reason I can‚Äôt pay more than $1,000 per month, I will again only be paying monthly accrued interest and stay stuck at $160,000. However, with option two, I will not be accruing so much interest. The biggest drawback with option two is that I will lose out on the federal protections. Although, my current job is very stable and secure. It is highly unlikely that I will lose it. The most appealing aspect of option 2 is only having to pay less than $1,000 with a low interest in case my income plummets somehow. It‚Äôs a lot more flexible. Plus such a low interest rate may not return.

Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.",finance
personalfinance,Where do I store my excess cash?,"Hi, I just made some money on crypto and would like to learn more from this community on a safe way to secure these gains. 

It's a 4 figure amount but my total liquid cash is now 50% of my total finacial portfolio and I don't need that much cash on hand sitting idle and not at least beating yearly inflation.

I'll meet with a fee based fiduciary in the coming weeks to have a professional opinion but want to ask the community first to see if someone has a perspective I haven't heard about before.

A little background first:

I already contribute the maximum amount to my ROTH each year ($6000), another $6000/yr to a 403b, and $12000/yr to a 457b (neither of these have company matching). I have a golden handcuffs pension which removes an additional 7% or ~$450 a month from my paycheck but contributes 14% to the pension (for a total contribution of 21% per month). I receive my full salary as a pension if I retire after 40 years, otherwise it's a percentage based on how long I've worked. I probably won't stay at this job the whole time, and if I do leave, I can roll over all of my self contributed 7% into one of the retirement accounts listed above. 

Anyway, I think I'm good on contributing to my retirement accounts; however, I still have the option to max everything out and save 6000/19500/19500/5383.84 for each account per year. I wouldn't have enough to live on and I've read elsewhere that if you have too many maxed out retirement accounts you can actually be screwed by your retired tax burden when you do start drawing out money.

I think the following thought experiment is important to explain because it'll influence what I do with my liquid cash or whether I should contribute more to my retirement accounts now. 

Say I contribute the maximum for 30 years or 180k/585k/585k to my retirement accounts and they have compound interest around 7%. Then each account will have 566k/1.8m/1.8m plus the pension which will be 10k/month when I retire, plus Social Security benefits, which since I've been paying into them are around 1.8k/mo but may climb higher when I retire. 

If I draw out 4% per year on each retirement account and include my other income sources, then I have 1.8k/1.9k/6k/6k/10k or 25.7k/mo or $308400/yr pre-tax income. Social Security, 403b, 457b and the Pension have some kind of income taxes on them, so let's assume my tax burden is really 288000/yr. After tax income for married couples with current California and Federal income tax brackets becomes ~203k take home with ~85k going to taxes.

So my first question is, is it always worth maxing put all of my retirement accounts if I plan to incur such a high tax burden in retirement? 

Second question. If instead I place my excess cash, whether it be crypto gains or odd jobs, in an individual brokerage account and withdraw 288k per year, I'd pay effectively combined 15% in taxes for California+Feds and effectively 10% just Federally. I know the individual brokerage account would be doubled taxed since it's all after tax dollars flowing into it, but logic wise, there does seem to be a case to contribute in your youth after tax dollars to a brokerage account and 30 years later withdraw the long term capital gains for lower tax burden than incurring the tax burden in old age? I haven't ran the numbers in an excel sheet yet and I'll do so after I post this, but how flawed is this logic?

Third and final question, should all my excess cash simply be going into a brokerage account for at least 1 year? I do not expect any gains above 40k for several years so this should be a safe tax option unless there's a massive downturn, right? I'll still have a 6-12 month emergency fund and a I understand if I have a huge emergency I can use margin and borrow against my account for relatively low APR. Does this sound like a reasonable strategy? My risk tolerance is relatively high being relatively young and my expenses should be covered by normal salary and my emergency fund.

Thanks in advance!",finance

CryptoCurrency,Series 1 - Myth Buster: Ethereum,"# 1. Ethereum is completely decentralized.

We will define a centralised blockchain as an environment in which a single actor, or a small group of players, may exercise unilateral control over the platform's day-to-day operation and continuing development. According to this description, Ethereum, like the bitcoin blockchain, is a decentralized network with validators and miners located all over the world.

# 2. Ethereum is more valuable than bitcoin

No, as of the time of writing, Ethereum market cap is at  **$458,424,536,927** and Bitcoin is at $**1,150,950,057,342**

# 3. EIP-1559 will improve the predictability of Ethereum's monetary policy

EIP-1559 implements a fee-burning mechanism that will permanently eliminate coins from the ether's total circulating supply. The purpose for burning the base fee rather than distributing it to ether miners is to guarantee that miners do not have a financial incentive to intentionally congest the network and keep the base cost high. Because of this burning process, EIP-1559 may add to the investment case for ether a bitcoin-like story of finite supply. It is, however, difficult to forecast how much ether will be burned over time. If more ether is burned in this manner than is issued, ether will become deflationary. While this burning serves as a counterweight to an ever-increasing ether supply, it does not improve the long-term stability of ether's monetary policy. However, the drop in inflationary pressures will make it more favorable.

# 4. The most recent Ethereum upgrade (EIP-1599) eliminates fees.

This is a common misunderstanding regarding the EIP-1559 Ethereum update. Its primary goal is to reduce the volatility and predictability of transaction fees by developing an algorithmic model that automatically adjusts charges by a factor of 1.125x, at most, every block. This enhancement will assist smart-contract developers in creating more dependable future pricing structures for their apps. The present blind, auction-like mechanism for calculating fees on the Ethereum blockchain causes transaction prices to soar at the drop of a hat, based on the ups and downs of the crypto markets. Fees are controlled by EIP-1559 to grow and decrease dependent on the utilization of block space.

# 5. Ethereum is the most popular cryptocurrency among financial organizations

While bitcoin remains the most popular cryptocurrency, ether is coming up ‚Äì and making its own mark. The Ethereum blockchain is getting much-deserved favor from more institutions as smart contracts and the realm of DeFi (decentralized finance) evolve, and these sectors continue to develop tremendously.

# 6. Ethereum mining consumes more energy than bitcoin mining

To keep the network safe, Ethereum needs less energy than bitcoin (through mining). According to Digiconomist, ethereum miners now spend 61TWh/year, whereas bitcoin miners consume 146TWh/year. However, according to conservative estimates, the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade to PoS (""proof of stake"") would make Ethereum roughly 2 000 times more energy efficient, resulting in a decrease of at least 99.95 percent in overall energy usage.

# 7. Ethereum has no mistakes or failures.

We frequently hear the misconception that ethereum is a cryptocurrency that is completely devoid of failure or error. This is not true. Like other blockchains, the Ethereum blockchain is not impregnable. However, it is becoming more secure by the day. As the Ethereum network expands at a rapid pace, so does its security and resilience. To far, Ethereum has not been subjected to a totally compromising assault.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Where to find 100x potential.,"Not financial advice.

As BTC recovers to its ATH I see a lot of new people coming in again, asking what is the next token/coin to explode.

Most of the suggestions are protocols that are already on centralised exchanges, these are not going to be your 100x tokens, because they've already had the exposure needed to get listed on centralised exchanges. Of course there is every chance they can still do 2-5x, and that is good enough also but anyone's guess is as good as nipples on a bull. 

What you need to do is to look at which layer 1 protocols are pumping and buy into the protocols in their ecosystem. Figure out how to use Metamask so you can connect to Dexes and allow yourself to buy these tokens (after doing some DD, always buy good projects) before they're listed on centralised exchanges i.e binance, Coinbase, FTX etc. 

You'll also be surprised to see the far better 'interest rates' staking on the Dexs compared to Cexs. 

Moral of the story, if someone is telling you to buy something on here then it's probably too late. DYDR and you'll have a much better chance of finding that 100x token.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Remember **** china - USA now largest bitcoin mining nation in the world,"The U.S. is knocking former mining world champion China off its throne. Even Germany now contributes more to the global Bitcoin hash rate than China.

It couldn't have been summed up more aptly than Bitcoin podcaster Matt Odell: ""The Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) mining ban will go down in history as the biggest geopolitical blunder of the 21st century.""

While the Middle Kingdom contributed about 75 percent of the hash rate to the Bitcoin network as recently as September 2019, the share is now zero. The Communist Party's restrictive course represents nothing less than a turning point in the global race for Bitcoin network dominance. For while Chinese miners are bleeding, people elsewhere are rejoicing. 

As we anticipated in the cover story of the 9/2021 issue of Cryptocompass, North America is turning into a mining mecca. Regions like Texas or Quebec in Canada are preparing to fill the power vacuum in the mining market - and lo and behold, mining farms in the US are sprouting like mushrooms.

At the time of writing, the USA's hash share is already 35 percent, making the country the largest mining nation in the world as of today. By comparison, as recently as October 2020, the U.S. share was a meager 6.5 percent.

Incidentally, even Germany is moving past the former mining world champion and currently accounts for 4.5 percent of the global hash rate. Whether 4.5 percent of the hash rate actually comes from the Federal Republic is questionable, however. There is already speculation that Chinese miners are concealing their participation in the network via VPN.

personalfinance,"Continue living at home with my parents, or move out?","**TLDR: If you have a great relationship with your parents but can also afford to move out, is it worth it?** 

Hey y'all, curious to hear your thoughts on my situation. I am a 24M currently living at home with my parents in the suburbs. I graduated from university in May 2020 and have been living with my parents since graduation- at first my rationale was ""oh, its the pandemic"" but since then I have wondered if it is time for me to move out. I know that moving out would be a great opportunity for personal growth, but I am saving a ton of money and have a great relationship with my parents. 

I have been employed with the federal government since graduation, **current income is 60k** and expected to surpass 100k in the next 3 years (GS ladder, unlikely to get fired but you never know).

**Assets:**

**Emergency Fund/Checking: 5k**, I add $100/month to this account and do not let it dip below 4k.

**Cash: 1.5k**

**Crypto: 7k**

**Vanguard Brokerage: 65k**, 75% of this is in mutual funds, contributing $600/month to VTSAX. Take home pay, after the $600 post-tax contribution, is $1100/month. 

**Vanguard Roth: 35k**, maxed for 2021, all in target retirement funds

**TSP (Government 401K): 25k**, set to hit the 19.5k max for this year

**Total: $138,500**

&amp;#x200B;

**Expenses:**

**Rent: $0**, my parents were charging me rent so that I learned to budget appropriately but have since stopped. In return for free rent, I cook/clean/do yard work (average of 10hrs/week). Very generous of my parents, and a privilege. 

**Side Hustle: $300/month**, I am in collectibles and usually generate $400-$500 in profit each month with my $300 investment. Not much, but my collection of my collectibles is growing and I would value it at about 5k with current market comps.

**Other Expenses: $600/month,** this encompasses car maintenance, eating out, groceries, clothing, medical expenses, subscriptions, etc. I am not breaking this down right now because I consider this to be a healthy spend for all of these things, but let me know if you disagree. I do average around $175/month on eating out, but I consider this my ""splurge"" and would not like this to change. 

**Total: $900/month**

&amp;#x200B;

**Personal:**

My SO lives in a nearby city, so I am able to visit them during the week and on the weekends to get out of my parents's house. I would say I have a healthy social life- I am usually busy 5/6 weekends, and either relax or take on a project at my parents' house with that 6th weekend. My current commute to my girlfriend is about 75 minutes one-way. Girlfriend and I have been together 1.5 years, so serious but not planning on marriage any time soon. 

In terms of my financial plans, I am considering trying to FIRE at 50 (I will hit 30 years with the government then) and am trying to position myself to do so. I plan on working after I FIRE but will move to either education or non-profit work. 

While my office is about a 30-minute commute from my parents' house, I have been remote since graduation and am expected to be remote for at least another 6 months. My manager has been pleased with my job performance thus far. I love my work team and have a great manager; there is upward mobility within my field and I am in a desired profession (healthcare contracting). I will be teaching a course (on personal finance, ironically!) at my undergraduate university starting Spring 2022 and will have an additional 3.5k in income at that time. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary:**

While I am content in my current situation, I also know that contentless breeds laziness, and it is definitely easy to keep living at home. I lived on my own at university, but I know living post-college is much different. I have a friend of mine who is also looking to move out of his parents' house around December of this year. Average rent + utilities where he and I would be looking is \~$900/ea, and would  keep me \~30min from work but put me only \~40min from my SO. We could get it down to \~$600/ea if we lived in a less safe area, but I think I would rather live at home than do that. Should I consider moving out with my friend at that time, or should I stay a home for another year or two and continue to save at my current rate?

CryptoCurrency,"Here's how you can turn $10 to $1,000,000","The idea is to take advantage of compound interest. 

So the formula for compound interest is as follows: 

The final amount, say X is equal to the product of your principal amount and (1+(r√∑100))^n

Where r is the interest rate, and n is the number of iterations you're compounding. 

Assuming you make a 2x trade every iteration, it'll take you 17 trades to hit $1.3m. 

How? 

$10 √ó (1+100/100)^17 = $1,310,720.

It's that simple! 17 trades is all it takes. 

Sure, you may not get all 17 in 1 bull run. But if you do it over a few bull runs, it's still a solid return on your investment. 

Now i know you're thinking, ""no way anyone is that lucky 17 times"". And you're probably right. Nobody's that lucky. Especially in crypto, where things are so volatile. 

The above was my mindset back when i was balls deep in shitcoins. I would throw money at random ""projects"" hoping they go 2-10x at least. Many times i got burned. Either got rugged, or dumped on.

Anyone who tells you that they can get guaranteed back to back 2x returns on their investments 17 times, is a liar or a fool. 

I soon learnt that the strategy through it all is the ""boring"" DCA and hodl. 

One way that you can make compound interest work for you though, is through staking. Any coins you hold that can be staked, should be staked. Take advantage of that compound interest. No, you won't go from $10 to $1,000,000. But you can make some pretty sweet gains. Slow and steady wins the race.

What I thought I would do is simply share some general knowledge based on my first-hand experiences over the last few years in the crypto space. By no means is this comprehensive, and it is only my personal opinion. So, take this all with a grain of salt.

P.S. None of this is in any particular order. It's a pure knowledge dump in the rawest form. Also, I'm based in the USA, so some of this may not be applicable to those in other parts of the world.

# Multi-Factor Authentication

Please use MFA on EVERY account you have. I'm not just talking about crypto here. Email, social media, shopping sites...anything and everything you can enable MFA on - do it. And, wherever available, use an MFA app as opposed to SMS-based MFA. My app of choice is Authy simply for the fact that it's very easy to move between phones or recover if your phone is lost or damaged.

# SIM Protection

In a perfect world, everything would use OTP apps instead of SMS. But, as many of you know, some sites only offer SMS. Sure, it's better than nothing, but it's weakness is the SIM swap attack. The best thing you can do is log in (or contact) your cell phone provider and enable additional protections for your SIM. Some offer a PIN you can enable, others have a verification process. Whatever it is, enable it! Also, if you have an iPhone, you can enable a [SIM PIN](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201529). Every time you power on your phone, you have to enter this PIN for your SIM to activate. Just another nice layer of security in case your phone or your SIM are stolen.

# Whitelisting

Every time I set up a new exchange or crypto app, I enable whitelisting. The concept is relatively simple. You define your list of authorized wallets your funds can be withdrawn to. Once they're added, there is now a hold period if any changes are made. If someone gets your login credentials and somehow gets past your MFA, they still have to wait a few days before they can withdraw funds to any wallets they're in control of. This gives you ample time to stop the attack before they can steal your crypto.

# Track Your Transactions!

Alright, with all that security stuff out of the way, let me share my biggest lesson learned. Every time you buy, sell, move, or are rewarded with crypto, TRACK IT. Trust me, if you wait to do this later, you will be in a world of hurt. I didn't wait too long, but still had close to 1,000 transactions to go back and record. And believe me, not all exchanges/platforms are created equal for their reporting. If you don't know how or where to begin, create a simple spreadsheet and track the following:

1. The exchange, platform, or wallet where the transaction took place
2. The date of the transaction
3. The crypto ticker symbol
4. The type of transaction (Buy, Sell, Transfer In, Transfer Out, Reward/Interest)
5. The amount of the crypto that was transacted
6. The dollar value of the coin at the time of the transaction
7. Any fees paid for the transaction

I personally use both a spreadsheet and CoinMarketCap to track every transaction. I strongly recommend everyone always use a spreadsheet for one reason: In the future, you can better calculate your realized and unrealized gains across platforms. CMC is a good start, but it won't give you that level of detail to make really informed decisions about profit taking and ROI. CMC also doesn't let you track rewards or interest in their own category. When I earn a reward, I really like to know how much those rewards have gained, as well as how much in total rewards/interest I've yielded.

# Learn How To Use A ""Pro"" Exchange

There are so many ways to buy crypto these days; and many of those apps make it so simple to deposit and trade. But you will pay through the nose in fees or spreads and not even realize it. It can feel overwhelming at first, but I strongly recommend you learn basic stock-trading concepts like Limit Orders, the Order Book, and the Ask/Bid price. Once you're comfortable with those concepts, use the pro version of an exchange and always use Limit Orders for your buys/sells. You will save yourself a staggering amount in fees over time. After trying over a dozen exchanges and platforms, my all time favorite is Gemini Active Trader Pro. It has a relatively limited number of coins compared to other popular options. But the the total transaction cost including the withdrawal is almost impossible to beat in my experience.

# Let's Talk About Fees

It is WAY too easy to lose your butt in fees with crypto. Exchanges or other platforms charge a fee for each transaction, some like to charge a ""spread"" which is even worse, you have to pay network fees to move crypto between wallet addresses...it all adds up. If you don't trade often, and you trade in large amounts, you're not going to notice it. But if you're an average person like me who dollar cost averages on a weekly basis, you'll waste a significant portion of your investment to fees.

What's my strategy? I ACH transfer fiat into Gemini Active Trader Pro (free), I buy my crypto using a limit order at a price that won't get filled immediately (so I can guarantee I'm a ""Maker"" and get the lowest fee), wait the 5 day hold period, and then withdraw to Celsius (my preferred CeFi platform). My only fee in that entire transaction is the .25% maker fee, which I find to be more than fair considering I pay zero withdrawal/network fees.

The best part? When I'm ready to sell or move off Celsius, I can either withdraw back to Gemini or to my hardware wallet for free! So, I get to buy and sell all I want and never pay anything more than that low fee to Gemini.

As an added note, I also hold some funds in USDC, which Gemini does not support. So, in the case where I need to buy/sell USDC, I use BlockFi. BlockFi only allows one free stablecoin withdrawal per calendar month, so I just have to limit those transactions to avoid unnecessary fees.

# Hardware Wallets

I recommend everyone gets a hardware wallet. And no, this is not necessarily because of the ""Not your keys, not your crypto"" argument. I find two very positive benefits of having a hardware wallet:

1. This is one of the best ways to learn how blockchains work and how crypto is moved between wallets. Once you get comfortable using a hardware wallet, everything else becomes second nature.
2. A hardware wallet is a fantastic safety net. I hold most of my crypto on CeFi platforms. But, this crypto space is still very much in its infancy, and you never know what could happen to one of these platforms. If I start to feel uncomfortable or see the writing on the wall, I can withdraw all my crypto to my hardware wallet in minutes. Every time I set up a new exchange or CeFi platform, I always whitelist my hardware wallet addresses so I'm ready in a moments notice. I also do a few test transfers a couple times a year just to make sure everything is working as it should.

My hardware wallet of choice: Ledger Nano X.

# Earning Yield

This is one of my favorite aspects of crypto. It's also one of the most polarizing in this community. As I mentioned before, I personally hold most of my crypto on CeFi platforms such as Celsius (my current favorite). Others will argue the dangers of this and recommend people control their own crypto on hardware wallets and via staking. I completely understand and respect this other argument, and I definitely think it's appropriate for some. Really, this is just a risk-tolerance argument. Everyone's tolerance is different, and that's perfectly okay. You do you.

For me, I love using platforms like Celsius to earn yield on my crypto. Not only do I get to hold an appreciating asset, but then I get to earn interest on top of that. And that interest is also an appreciating asset, compounding over time. I'm not wealthy and don't have a lot to invest. But, my yields from interest every year are enough to cover my annual property taxes among a few other expenses, and that's nothing to scoff at.

# IRAs

Now this is an aspect of crypto that I'm shocked more people don't understand or take advantage of. We're always talking about how we're in it for the long term, and how we do our best to avoid capital gains taxes. But very few people know that you can kill two birds with a crypto IRA. Here are a few notable benefits of a Roth IRA (my personal choice):

1. Any crypto you buy inside your IRA grows TAX FREE.
2. When I retire, I get to cash out my crypto TAX FREE.
3. If I get in a pinch, I can withdraw any contributions I made to the IRA TAX AND PENALTY FREE.

I did something very few are comfortable doing: I had an emergency fund ($15k) sitting in a traditional savings account with a bank. I opened a Roth IRA with iTrust Capital in December of 2020 and contributed $6k of my emergency fund into it (the max annual contribution). In January, I contributed another $6k. I invested in the cryptos of my choice, and over the next year that IRA more than doubled. Now, at any time I desire, I can withdraw up to $12k out of that account without penalty or without any capital gains tax. The rest of the funds have to sit there until I retire. But hey, it's free money!

As I said, iTrust Capital is my personal pick for this one. There are several options on the market, but they were a clear winner in my book. I'll be happy to write another post just on this if anyone is interested.

# Dollar Cost Averaging

If you've made it this far, then you'll see that I hold all my crypto in two primary places: Celsius and iTrust Capital. As great as it is to be able to grow my crypto holdings tax-free in my IRA, I'm limited to how much I can contribute each year, and it's not nearly as ""liquid"" as Celsius. Plus, Celsius gives me the ability to borrow against my crypto for extremely low interest rates, which has some awesome use cases.

So, I still buy and hold quite a bit outside of my IRA. My strategy:

1. My bank (Ally) has this feature called ""Round Ups."" Any every couple weeks, all my individual bank transactions are rounded up the nearest dollar and then moved into my Ally savings account. Every time they do that, I take those round ups and buy a little crypto. It's not much, but it's a really consistent way of DCA'ing.
2. Credit card rewards! Of course, I had the BlockFi Credit Card and took full advantage of the 3.5% cashback for the first 90 days. After that, I switched back to my regular credit card which is a flat 2% cash back on everything. Every single month, when my cash back rewards are paid out, I buy some more crypto. Once again, it's not a ton, but it's consistent.
3. Finally, I have a set, bi-weekly amount I invest. I have a reminder on my phone so I don't forget. I don't care about the price at the time. I just set a limit order and let it do its thing.

# Learn And Earn

This is another super cool aspect of crypto. It's not going to make you rich, but it's free money! I think the most consistent and common option is Coinbase's Learn and Earn program. You get a notification whenever there is a new option available, you watch 3 quick animated explainers, answer 1 quiz question after each one, and earn a little bit of crypto (usually $1 for each quiz, $3 total). To date I've earned $50 doing these, and some of those have seen some nice gains. Of course, I could easily cash these out each time and buy my favorite crypto. But I like to hold on to them just in case 10 years down the road one of them rockets in price. There's an extremely slim chance they will. But, I see them almost like free lottery tickets. If I win, amazing. If I don't, oh well.

personalfinance,UK Student Loan Interest Rates,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently studying at a UK university. Here, like most people, I've taken on some debt from the government to cover living expenses and rent etc (maintenance loan). For me that's in the region of 10k per year, so 30k in total. As everyone was taking them, when I first signed for this I didn't think much of it at the time (naive I know). Turns out that interest begins to accrue as soon as I'm paid at a rate of 4.1%! This seems insanely high.

I was wondering if there were any current accounts or similar with interest rates in that region where I could keep that money whilst at university so that that money isn't immediately burning a whole in my pocket? Is it just me or are other people just figuring this out?

Thanks in advance!",finance

Bitcoin,"In the era of inflation, only BTC is the real asset","The production price affected by the rise in commodity prices is a manifestation of the beginning of inflation. The inflation rate in developed countries accounts for 7.1%, and it is now in the 90th percentile of historical data.

During the epidemic, non-agricultural wages increased due to the dismissal of low-paid workers. As these workers return to employment, wages are more likely to fall rather than rise in the coming months.

The data shows that BTC has begun to play a role in hedging inflation. Observing the changes in BTC prices relative to inflation, we can find that this relationship is becoming more and more important statistically.

We are still not sure what will happen to inflation in the next 5 years, but we believe that increasing real assets is a prudent measure to protect the investment portfolio from the tail risk of out-of-control inflation.

1. Inflation is beginning to show up

Signs of potential inflation problems are beginning to appear, the most obvious being the tightening of employment conditions (and the consequent rise in wages) and the rise in global production prices. However, there are still differences among investors. The outlook for inflation is divided into two schools of thought: one believes that the impact of inflation is more short-lived in nature, and the other believes that inflation has risen to a level that threatens economic stability.

&amp;#x200B;

The data shows that from a historical point of view, the current global inflation rate is not that high. The current level of inflation is similar to that observed after the 2008 financial crisis, and since 1970, it has only been placed at the 55th percentile. This is because production prices are affected by rising commodity prices, and inflation is beginning to rise. 7.1% in developed countries, the current figure is in the 90th percentile.

&amp;#x200B;

In the era of inflation, only BTC is the real asset

&amp;#x200B;

During the recovery phase of the new crown epidemic, the unemployment rate has fallen much faster than during the global financial crisis, which means that the labor market has begun to heat up, and it also means that wages may increase with it, as we have seen in the United States this year. Although wage growth has intensified during the epidemic, the unemployment of low-income workers has reversed this situation. As these workers are re-employed, wage growth in the coming months is likely to decline, rather than increase.

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether a higher inflation rate is just around the corner. Global shipping disruptions, wider supply chain issues, and inventory challenges have exacerbated short-term inflation, which has led to some supply bottlenecks, but this does not necessarily mean that it will lead to longer-term inflation problems. Therefore, it is difficult for us to say exactly what will happen to inflation. This issue is in the hands of central bank officials, and history shows that they will be more passive rather than proactive.

&amp;#x200B;

2. The dilemma of the central bank

Reducing currency issuance after unprecedented easing policies is likely to cause a dislocation in the bond market, which will result in greater market volatility. Speeding up liquidity in order to alleviate market pressure has left the US Federal Reserve and other central banks stuck in this dilemma, so it is difficult to eliminate its negative impact.

&amp;#x200B;

This is why the market pays so much attention to the recent June FOMC (Federal Oversight and Monetary Commission) statement. The minutes of the FOMC meeting highlight that the Fed maintains a very moderate attitude in general (even if the minutes are unexpectedly tough). At the same time, they are considering the danger of inflation by raising the inflation forecast rate and sending out a signal to predict a rise in interest rates in 2023. The FOMC still believes that inflation is temporary in nature and is therefore happy to see inflation ""heat up"" over a period of time.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that the Fed‚Äôs ‚Äúresult-based‚Äù approach, which is the so-called ‚Äúwait until inflation arrives before taking action‚Äù, is risky. Especially considering the rapid changes in the world economy and technology, some traditional indicators of inflation may be unreliable.

&amp;#x200B;

Investor behavior also shows that many people do not believe in results-based methods. Due to a series of capital inflows since mid-2020, the assets managed by trading products in the trading platforms protected by inflation have increased by 74% in the past year.

&amp;#x200B;

In the era of inflation, only BTC is the real asset

&amp;#x200B;

These record capital inflows also highlight that perhaps concerns about inflation are becoming a consensus rather than an isolated view. It also implies that many investors believe that the Fed and other central banks may be behind the curve in the chart.

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless of the outcome of inflation, the central bank may lose control of inflation, and there is still considerable tail risk. Therefore, as highlighted by the above-mentioned capital flow events, inflation hedging is becoming more and more popular. During inflation, there is a small part of hard assets that should perform well, and we think BTC is one of them.

&amp;#x200B;

3. BTC as an inflation hedge asset

Conceptually, BTC makes sense as an inflation hedge asset. This is what economists call ""real assets""-an asset with a limited and predictable supply. Therefore, if the supply of U.S. dollars or any other fiat currencies increases, the price at which BTC can be exchanged for these fiat currencies may appreciate, even if its purchasing power remains stagnant.

&amp;#x200B;

The data shows that BTC is beginning to play the role of this inflation hedge. Since its creation in 2009, observing its price changes relative to inflation during the two-year period highlights that this relationship is improving, and the current R2 is 0.30 (since 2019). And the relationship between BTC and inflation is currently better than the relationship between inflation and gold.

&amp;#x200B;

In the era of inflation, only BTC is the real asset

&amp;#x200B;

Citigroup compiled an index to track unexpected inflation by measuring inflation forecasts and delivery results.

&amp;#x200B;

At a level above zero, inflation is higher than expected. BTC also has an early but possibly convincing relationship with unexpected inflation. Our analysis emphasizes that BTC does respond to unexpected inflation and will rise when the inflation data is higher than expected.

&amp;#x200B;

In the era of inflation, only BTC is the real asset

&amp;#x200B;

We realize that the relationship between BTC and inflation is likely to be uncertain at this moment, because the sample size is small. In other words, this relationship has been steadily improving over time, which has also increased the credibility of the concept of BTC as a real asset.

&amp;#x200B;

Fourth, BTC as an asset is maturing

More and more evidences show that BTC as an asset is constantly maturing. After the recent FOMC statement (June 16) expressed an unexpectedly tough tone, the price movement is very similar to that of gold. This highlights that BTC's behavior is in line with investors' expectations of physical assets, which will appreciate when the U.S. dollar depreciates, and vice versa.

&amp;#x200B;

In the era of inflation, only BTC is the real asset

&amp;#x200B;

We are still not sure what exactly will happen to inflation in the next 5 years, but we believe that adding BTC and other physical assets as a prudent measure is to protect the portfolio from the tail risk of out-of-control inflation. BTC originally had the concept of an inflation protection certificate, and it is now proven by increasing investor participation, as evidenced by the improvement in its relationship with consumer prices.",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,Beyond SoV - Bitcoin is the best money in history. It's the pinnacle of monetary evolution. Reserve currency status is a fait accompli. Nothing can stop this eventuality. Bitcoin has already won.,"How can a good store of value (SoV) also be a good medium of exchange (MoE) and unit of account (UoA)? Seems too perfect, right?

If the goal of Bitcoin is to replace fiat money, but Bitcoin is expected to increase in value in the long term, wouldn't it be prohibitive to use Bitcoin for paying for things?

This perspective comes from measuring Bitcoin's value in an inferior, depreciating form of money, and stems largely from a collective [price illusion](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/money_illusion.asp) that the dollar is a stable representation of monetary value. The dollar price of Bitcoin is merely relative face value, rather than intrinsic value, while Bitcoin, as a nascent form of money, still very much remains in the process of discovering its true value to humanity.

You could indeed argue that it's humans who are in the process of learning to appreciate its value. Bitcoin is quite the monetary paradigm shift.

# What is money?

Money is anything that's accepted as representing value by the parties to any transaction. It's really that simple. Three thousand years ago, cowrie shells were used to represent value. Humans have always sought money that can hold value over time until it was required to purchase other things that hold value to them - goods and services.

When you purchase goods and services now, the question you ask yourself is whether what you're purchasing is valuable enough to you that you're happy to part with a certain amount of dollars to acquire it. Everything being denominated in dollars/fiat money lends to this perspective that the dollar represents some value that can be exchanged to buy things you need in life.

When we get to a place where satoshis (sats) replace dollars as UoA, it would be a question of whether the good/service you're purchasing is necessary/valuable enough to you that you're happy to part with a certain amount of sats to acquire it.

But the supply is finite and limited to 21 million. Is this not a problem? It's finite but divisible. Injecting new money into the economy, as central banks do, is just an artificial way of re-dividing the aggregate monetary value within the economy inequitably, in favor of those close to the new money.

Sure, there aren't enough bitcoins to go around for everyone, but there are more than enough sats  (units of money) to go around for everyone,  \~ 2.1 quadrillion sats.

For context, the total value of all the physical money and money deposited in savings and checking accounts across the world is $40 trillion. The total value of all money in the form of all investments and derivatives is $1.3 quadrillion.

Let's try imagining that 1 Bitcoin represents a 100 million-dollar bill, which at the current rate of inflation may not be so far-fetched to imagine in the near future, just look at the likes of Venezuela and Argentina. Are there enough 100 million-dollar bills to go around for everyone? No, not yet anyway. But there are enough one-dollar/ten-dollar bills (units of money) to go around for everyone.

Additionally, the smallest unit on Lightning Network is millisats, 1/1000th of a sat, named after mill, which is 1/1000th of a dollar, an abstract unit of account in dollar-denominated accounting.

1 Bitcoin = 100 million sats

21 million Bitcoin = 2.1 quadrillion sats = 2.1 quintillion millisats

Infinite divisibility, but not infinite supply, is an important property for money. The putative best scarce money in history, gold, does not have this property. Bitcoin does.

# Bitcoin economy

In a Bitcoin economy, every good/service will be priced in sats, rather than dollars, and you can move your sats instantly from [one corner of the world to another corner of the world](https://preview.redd.it/esqddcdq10d71.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95c4cb49f6d3405594ee84a16c693b558daa0b18) at next to no cost peer-to-peer without middlemen. No money in history ever had this property, not dollar, not gold, and it's arguably what makes Bitcoin usurping the dollar as the world's reserve currency inevitable.

What a Bitcoin economy would do is immediately eliminate the moral hazards that inhere within the extant monetary/economic paradigm predicated on arbitrary, unscrupulous, flagrantly reckless expansionary policies founded upon nothing more than the existence of a lender of last resort with access to an infinite supply of money created without any effort out of thin air to continually bail out those at the top of the pyramid exploiting said moral hazards with impunity. It would restore rigor and sustainability to credit lines without frequent intervention at the cost of rampant inflation, and overall, cultivate better spending habits.

# Fiat money is a pyramid scheme

The current system of credit constantly incentivizes or even forces you through a myriad of machinations to keep spending money from tomorrow's labor, but the new injection of money from your tomorrow's labor ends up being concentrated at the top, with the ultimate consequence of inequitably diminishing your purchasing power and continually enriching those at the top of the pyramid.

In short, money borrowed against your future labor ends up destroying your own purchasing power while the lender profits off your future labor, both in the form of interest and by being closer to the new money. It's a double whammy. Fiat money post hoc undercuts the value of your work and time.

# Aftershocks of the Nixon Shock

In 1971, President Nixon canceled the convertibility of the US dollar to gold. The subsequent collapse of the Bretton Woods system gave central banks absolute monetary authority as the dollar was no longer required to be backed by gold reserves.

The Fed's newfound ability to continually manipulate supply, interest rates, and velocity of money has led to deleterious consequences. Perpetual expansion to spur illusory  ‚Äúeconomic growth‚Äù has sent deficits spiraling out of control and resulted in, inter alia, a vicious cycle of high inflation, recession as a consequence of efforts to mitigate the effects thereof and ever-increasing, now extreme, economic inequality.

# The Pinnacle of Monetary Evolution

I view Bitcoin to be the culmination of humanity's 7000-year quest to perfect the representation of value by truly democratizing its creation, distribution and exchange. Never before have we had a money with all the necessary properties of sound money. All previous forms of money had compromises.

Scarce money has always been sound money but previous iterations of scarce money lacked the other properties required to be viable as MoE and UoA - fungible, readily portable, infinitely divisible, incorruptible, indestructible, provably finite and objectively verifiable.

Bitcoin ticks all the boxes. It further adds a whole new dimension to money hitherto unimaginable, obviating the need for trust, eliminating counterparty risk without the burden and attendant inefficiencies of involving trusted middlemen.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Sound money fulfills all three functions of money - SoV, MoE, UoA](https://preview.redd.it/t1azmamjn0u71.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eeb96dbc2eb0e78bfaaca45fb2da5b10305848f1)

# Triffin Paradox

The Triffin paradox explains why any sovereign currency serving as a global reserve currency is unworkable - the state issuing the reserve currency is required to continually run up a deficit to meet the world's demand for its currency. This creates a conflict of interest between domestic and international monetary policies, which becomes untenable in the long run, leading to the collapse of the system. The average lifespan for reserve currencies is 95 years.

Bitcoin is the only monetary system in history that has the properties to last forever, for it doesn't derive value from the authority/wealth of the issuer, which is fleeting, but a timeless universal constant - [hard-coded mathematics](https://i.imgur.com/eFwM54J.jpeg).

stocks,I've come to think that stocks are a waste and that I should buy corporate bonds instead,"This will sure bring on criticism and that's exactly why I'm making this post. Still, please be nice. I'm also a noob, so don't just call out my idiocy without explanation. Thanks. :) Also remember I'm talking about corporate bonds, not government bonds.

I'm invested in stocks, a serious chunk of my wealth is in stocks. Of course the point is to save up and also make some profits, but lately I've been thinking why we should choose stocks in the first place. In the end, it's just a share in someone else's company. Assuming I'm buying on the secondary market, I'm not providing direct benefit to the company itself, I'm only speculating on company's future. The profit I gain is a) through dividends, which are paid from the profits of the company for no effort on my side, and b) by selling the stock again. I know this is simplified, but that's what it is in practice. You already probably want to argue something like ""you do deserve dividends because you bought the shares that once provided funding for the company at IPO or at another funding run at later stage in the past"", but the price of those shares now is not what it was then. Share price provides value to the company in case they wanted to collect more funding by selling more shares, but that company generated the value of those shares mainly by itself, not by the investors (yes, investors give it value by desiring those shares, but they desire those shares because of the performance of said company). Basically, the way the general stock market functioning is, IMHO, not providing real value to the underlying market itself.

When I look at corporate bonds, they serve a specific purpose: investors lend money to a company to fund a project. The bonds are issued for that purpose and company promises some interest on that loan. At expiration date the loan is repaid back to the investor. Bonds can be resold and bought on a secondary market too, but the expiration date remains and the price is also easily determined.

So if I put it like that, stocks are like bonds without an expiration date; dividends are like interest payouts (if any). Price of bonds is easy to determine, but pricing shares is difficult and unpredictable. The benefit of bonds is straightforward, but stock value is beneficial only for a \*potential\* future share sell out, if that every happens again. Bonds also provide some guarantee of profit, while stocks can go up, down, or sideways. So why are stocks so damn popular? Shouldn't we prefer buying bonds? I mean, bonds actually provide value for both the company and the investor. Is it just our greed that we hope that our stocks will outperform bonds? World / broad market ETFs are so popular, because they diversify, lower risks, and still provide an average 8%-or-so p.a. profit. I regularly see bonds with &gt;9% interest rates. Yes, broad market ETFs provide diversified portfolio, but that's diversified only to minimize risk because stocks can be so volatile. Given the fact that bonds promise profit by default, isn't the risk minimized even more that way? Bonds promise to be repaid at predetermined price, while nobody guarantees the price of a share. However, I understand bonds are probably not that liquid like shares are.

I don't get it. Bonds seem like the obvious choice for a sensible investor because you get a promise of profit on investment which can be demanded by law. Stocks don't promise anything. If a company performs poorly, you will lose on stocks, but they are still required to repay you what they promised you. Bonds provide real-world value for your money; stock price is only an estimate of company's worth partially based on non-tangible components like investor sentiment.

Based on what I've read here before, there are people that wanna say ""business is business"" or ""don't bring ethics to business"", or ""for every buyer there's a seller"". Albeit true, those statements only describe status quo and are not constructive. I get it that people want to buy stocks and therefore they are in high demand and therefore they are priced accordingly and whatever, but that doesn't explain why bonds are not sought after more as the general instrument for money saving and profit generation among personal finance and FIRE communities and alike.

Do I make sense?

personalfinance,My job calculates everything weird on my Paystub. Nothing adds up right?,"So I'm trying to figure out how my job is calculating my paycheck. I live in TN. It's so vastly different from online calculators I cannot figure out what a 40 hour paycheck is just on the off chance I actually worked 40 hours for bill organization purposes. So generally I can put in my hours and deductions on paycheckcity and use their calculator. But no matter how I do it the math doesn't match. My job charges me less on federal than they should be according to this calculator, but a little more on medicare and SS. I'm worried my W2 is gonna be all sorts of wrong and I'm gonna get screwed later when filing my taxes. So I decided to run it by hand using the 12% federal for under 40k a year. Still shows wrong numbers in comparison. It's always off by +/- 10ish dollars. Nothing I do is making it match how they've calculated this and I cannot see % used for withholding, Medicare, and social security. I worked OT this past week so my check was higher than a 40 anyway.

So here's a run down.

18.62/hr

22.42 deductions for insurance

4% 401k

1.3% Union fee (after tax deduction but is coupled into pretax deduction total?)

But it gets weirder. There is also an OT premium that shows up on top. Usually it's only a dollar or 2. Then, it shows a W2 earning which should be Gross - Deductions but the number doesn't match up at all. It's actually lower? My deductions, pre/post tax is shown as 66.52 but the difference between gross earning and W2 earning is like, $53.

All of this are weekly deductions. When I run it through the calc says I made less than what my stub says. The taxes show higher, and that worries me. I'm about ready to go into payroll on Monday and ask for an explanation of how they run their payroll because I'm confused as hell. I have a business degree and I still cannot understand what they're doing.

personalfinance,Refinancing house to pay for repairs and upgrades,"Bought house in 2017 for $200K; Zestimate started out at $250K at purchase and is now at $350K, and spouse and I owe $181K. Monthly payment in 30-year mortgage is around $1500.

Home needs a few things: New siding (a must), new flooring (a must, and must be completed by January for insurance reasons), amperage increase and level 2 EV charging install. Considering kitchen refurb and also considering on-grid solar install.

Given the expense of these things and very low interest rates, we're considering refinancing, taking $60-80K in cash out, and prioritizing in this order:

Flooring
Siding
Amperage upgrade and level 2 EV install
Everything else

We would take a substantial hit on resale without fixing the siding and flooring so to me it's a priority. 

Question is this: What are the risks? Am I thinking about this all wrong? Am I risking being overextended? 

We've already installed heat pumps and expect that demand will rise for low-emission, EV-ready, passive solar homes over the next ten years, but I'm also wary of the possibility that we're in a housing bubble due to stimulus cash. We expect to live here for anywhere between two and forever more years, can work remotely, have around $150K in annual household income and $120K in savings.

CryptoCurrency,Don't keep your entire wealth in fiat. Inflation is making Crypto skyrocket while your fiat money is being eroded.,"Inflation is already becoming a major issue almost everywhere on the planet. There is a huge energy crisis in Europe and Asia as well with prices for gas and electricity skyrocketing. Bitcoin went from a couple dollars to 60,000 dollars in 10 years.  Couple this with inflation and it wont be surprising if Bitcoin becomes worth at least a couple million dollars in the near future. 

The fact is, in the future we're definitely going to see terrible inflation numbers. The US is increasing its dollar supply by 50% in a matter of 2 years. Inflation is the consequence and it's not going to go. It's not just fiat nowadays that's affected by inflation. The housing market is also very abnormal. There is absolutely something wrong going on in the economy. The US has been sitting at 0.25% interest rate almost the entire time since 2008. It's not just the US either, almost the entire world is having price increases and an electricity crisis.

No matter what is happening, you should invest your future and buy some Crypto. Not only is this money going to be a cushion against inflation, Crypto is also going to be one of the most reliable safety nets in case shit hits the fan.

personalfinance,"Trying to minimize hard pulls, already have a loan estimate with original preapproved lender.... whens the best time to shop around without a close date?","I am buying my 1st home with my wife but is still under construction in Houston, TX. We got a preapproval from a lender that was referred to me and had used that to shop for homes back in May. We ended up choosing a home that was still under construction with original estimated completion date of end of September to early October. We didnt shop around at the time cause obviously the closing date wasnt within the time frame.

Anyways, due to supply chain issues, that estimated timeframe has been pushed back and now the home is estimated to be ready in Mid november. We are looking to lock something in relatively soon as we are seeing interest rates already climbing and probably lock something in for 60days. We dont have a closing date from the builder but they are are sure it should be mid-end november.

I went back to my original preapproved lender and the rates we got was 3.25% w/ 5% down on a $380k home w/ credit scores from both of us being 790+. He said if i acted a week or 2 ago it could have been 2.99% but if i lock something down now it would protect me from higher rates. If the rates drop by .25% they could adjust the rate to that but it has to drop by .25%. He provided me a docusign with the loan estimate lock but holding off to sign.

I want to shop around with a few more lenders to see if i can get a sub 3% rate with maybe origination or underwriting costs waived. I want the multiple mortage applicaiton to fall under the same hard credit pull. I am guessing that my preapproved lender is still using the same credit file/ application from May and will probably rerun the credit pull when i sign the documents and send him our updated financial documents.

personalfinance,Help determining which debt to pay off first,"Hi there, I currently have a few different debts I‚Äôm aggressively trying to pay off and I‚Äôm going to be coming into a decent sum of money next week (about ~14k) and I‚Äôm not sure how I should use that money that I intend on using exclusively for debt. Here‚Äôs the breakdown of my debts:

- About 22k in high-interest credit cards (averages between 19-24% interest rates as most cards do): the minimum payments for these monthly is around $650/month 
- 17k in a private student loan with a 7% interest rate: the struggle here is that my monthly payment for this loan is exceptionally high at $829/month so it really takes a chunk of my take-home pay from my FT job and making this payment on a monthly basis is almost like depressing
- 11k left on my car loan that has a 6% interest rate 

I obviously am already planning on using this sum I‚Äôm getting to put a good dent in these debts.

CryptoCurrency,Ampleforth: Deep Dive,"When you think about the pure monetary-assets we‚Äôve seen, most of them came from forks of Bitcoin. And they‚Äôve all been pretty much the same from a monetary point of view. There hasn‚Äôt been much innovation in the ‚Äúmoney-crypto‚Äù space. AMPL is the first differentiated money innovation we‚Äôve seen in a long time, which is exciting.

These guys have been thinking about how they would improve upon Bitcoin as a collateral asset from the start, they‚Äôve viewed Bitcoin more as a building-block for future banking systems than as a substitute for dollars. And they‚Äôve really hit the nail on the head of two massive problems in the space that everyone else has ignored until now:

1) Hyper-correlation 2) Supply inelasticity

Their protocol translates volatility from price to supply which has a couple of really interesting effects.

1) It counteracts liquidity crises (like what we saw on Black Thursday with DAI and what we saw under Bretton Woods with gold). 2) It creates a diversified movement pattern that‚Äôs unlike any traditional or crypto asset. Which makes it interesting as a collateral asset or as part of a portfolio of crypto-assets. 3) Despite not being a stablecoin, It can be used like a stablecoin as a unit of account for denominating debt, contracts and prices 

Ampleforth's supply is elastic and can change every day while the ownership of the AMPL tokens is never diluted.

When it comes to money, having an elastic supply allows for printing new money or removing money from the circulation depending on the demand. Fiat currencies such as the US Dollar are good examples of money with an elastic supply as the FED can decide to print more money if there is more demand for it.

Bitcoin is quite the opposite, its supply is fixed and the only way to accommodate the increase in demand is for the price to go up. Constant price changes can be quite problematic, especially when it comes to denominating things like services, contracts or debt.

So even though elastic money supply can be quite useful to achieve price stability it comes with a certain problem ‚Äì dilution.

When the fed increases the supply of dollars by printing new money that money is put into the circulation, diluting everyone else‚Äôs proportion of the total supply of dollars basically making them poorer. Ampleforth is non-dilutive. This is achieved by applying supply adjustments proportionally across everyone‚Äôs balances.

Imagine the following situation: let‚Äôs say the fed prints an extra 5% of the total supply of US dollars to meet an increase in demand. This extra 5% would be proportionally distributed across all the accounts holding USD, so if you had $1000 in your bank account, after the supply change you would end up with $1050. That scenario would make the US Dollar non-dilutive as your proportion of the overall supply of dollars would remain the same after the adjustment.

So to summarise this part. Bitcoin is inelastic and non-dilutive. Fiat money such as USD is elastic but dilutive. Ampleforth is both elastic and non-dilutive, so even though the number of your AMPL tokens can change automatically, you‚Äôll always own the same proportion of the overall supply

By having this unique feature, Ampleforth solves the following problems:

-Inelasticity Problem. Almost all cryptocurrencies today have fixed supplies, because of this, volatility in demand results in volatility of price. This price volatility makes most cryptocurrencies unsuitable for use as a unit of account. You'd never denominate wages, contracts or a loan in btc, because the amount you owe would change dramatically month to month. By their very nature fixed supply monies can never be price stable.

Ampleforth translates this price volatility into supply volatility, which means that you CAN use ampleforth to denominate wages, loans, contracts, etc, because you know that 1 ampl will always have the buying power of roughly 1 2019 US dollar. 

Diversification Problem. Today‚Äôs cryptocurrencies are tightly correlated. When Bitcoin pumps, Alts pump, and when Bitcoin dumps, Alts dump. The rebase allows ampl to be less correlated with Bitcoin, which makes ampl appealing as a collateral asset.

Let‚Äôs see how these unique characteristics of Ampleforth are achieved.

-How does it work There are 3 states that the Ampleforth protocol can be in, these are expansion, contraction or equilibrium.

-Expansion. In this state, the supply of AMPL tokens is proportionally increased across all the wallets holding AMPL tokens. Let‚Äôs go through a quick example

Imagine Alice buys 1 AMPL for $1. As demand for AMPL suddenly increases, 1 AMPL is now worth $2 which is above our target price of $1.009. In this case, the Ampleforth protocol will seek a price-supply equilibrium by increasing the supply of AMPL, so Alice ends up with 2 AMPL each worth $1

-Contraction. As expected, this is the exact opposite of the expansion state. When the system is in the contraction state the supply of AMPL tokens is proportionally decreased across all the wallets holding AMPL tokens.

So if Alice buys 1 AMPL for $1 and due to a decrease in demand, the price of AMPL drops to $0.5, the system will reduce the supply of AMPL. Alice ends up with 0.5 AMPL worth $0.5 as the price of 1 AMPL reverts back to $1.

One important thing to add here is that the algorithm can only affect the supply of AMPL. It cannot, of course, dictate the price directly It‚Äôs up to external players to notice the supply change and this should, in theory, drive the price in the correct direction.

The last state which is equilibrium is the only state where the algorithm doesn‚Äôt seek to increase or decrease the supply of AMPL This is basically a state where there is no need to do anything as the current price is within range of the target price

Ampl is hybrid between a stablecoin, and a floating price asset like btc. There's really nothing else quite like it out there. I've done a lot of reading about this project and can say a lot more about it, so if you have any questions ask away!",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,UKs central bank deputy governor FUDs rapidly growing crypto sector .. seemingly not realising it's the historic low interest rates and money printing by central banks thats driving its mass adoption!,,cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Crypto,"The school system doesn't teach you about investing.  If you're lucky, you'll figure out how to do RRSP or 401k and even those have low interest rates.  Maybe you get into stocks and get modest returns of 10%.  But they don't teach you how to invest in stocks.  The media will tell you it's risky and scary.  At least Bitcoin will give you 200-400% yearly reruns.  Crazy insane returns with other crypto.  But one thing is for sure, they especially don't want you to know about Crypto.  There's still a whole lot of FUD going around.  The space is growing. And for many of us Crypto is a means of financial freedom.  A better life for ourselves and loved ones.  It's a way to be free.

Wow.  This can be said for any popular investment in recorded history.      If you invested in lumber before the pandemic you'd have x amount.   

These articles are clearly paid for because it's not really journalism.     Anyone can make a post about how much you'd be up if x, y, and z happened.    

These are kill 2 birds with one stone shills paid for as reminders to holders to keep holding , and noobs to buy or they will keep missing out.

CryptoCurrency,"There are plenty of good reasons to get into crypto, even if you don't end up making immediate huge gains or have tens of thousands to invest!","*I am no crypto veteran (actively investing for a year now), I will attempt to keep up with the comments and correct this post if mistakes were made. I am confident in my overall statements here, but I'm not infallible.*

* Crypto is an appreciating asset as well as a currency. There are plenty of posts on this subreddit that talk about how USD has been on a steady decline in value [(for over 100 years now)](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Purchasing-Power-of-the-US-Dollar.jpg) , and that cryptos like BTC are a great store of value as well as a smart future investment.
* Cryptocurrencies (the well known ones at least) have a set process for creation (called mining) that cannot be inflated. BTC, for example, [has a set amount of coins that can be mined each year, and a cap on total coins mineable that will end in 21 million coins being created](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/051115/bitcoin-mining-still-profitable.asp). About 18.78 million have already been mined, and [the remainder is supposed to take until 2140 to reach](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/10/18/with-18-million-bitcoins-mined-how-hard-is-that-21-million-limit/).
* Cryptocurrencies (the ones that carry the idea Satoshi intended) are decentralized; the federal reserve can't print billions more and give the majority to their wealthy friends to help them avoid the consequences of their actions. This takes power away from the banks and those who game the system in ways the ""little guy"" can't, which is good for everyone else even if you ***aren't*** invested in crypto. [(read more on decentralization and blockchain here)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp)
* This last one is the subject of debate on here a lot, but it's believed we are still in the early stages of Cryptocurrency. This year we have seen huge widespread adoption of cryptos, so this window of ""still early"" is closing faster than it used to be. What this means for the common retail investor is that if you recognize which cryptos will receive more adoption and use in the future, getting in now will eventually net gains on your investment. The prices will continue to rise as they are used and adopted more, and your initial investment will appreciate over time.

***So..*** even if you don't find the next alt coin that blows up in the next month or two, a conservative portfolio of even just BTC and ETH is a great investment for your future. It will help you keep the wealth you've earned without it slowly burning away, and take power away from the corrupt people/organizations at the top who have had too much for too long.",cryptocurrency

The interest rate is .03% and I'm on track to earn about $5 interest this year.  What else can I do with this money?  I'd prefer to not take a huge tax hit, but I guess I could if it makes sense.  I'm 38 so not young, but not close to retirement.",finance

personalfinance,"With home prices having skyrocketed and interest rates having dropped, is the old saying that you should ""buy a home no more than 3x's your yearly income"" even valid anymore?","So I live in a high cost of living area, and with interest rates being what they are and the market being what it is, it would be almost impossible to find anything for my growing family in the area we want to be that comes even close to only three times our annual incomes if we want to stay in our current radius.

We are looking at two houses to get out of our townhome we've been in for 15 years. We have about two years of income in equity in it that we will use for a new house.

Here's the thing: Even The ""cheaper"" house options we are looking at are still 4.7 times our yearly incomes in our city. You can get cheaper, but they are in areas we have no desire to live in either do to school districts, commute time etc.

The one that is more expensive--but we would put more cash down on to ensure a DTI under 36--is 7.3 times our annual income.

We have no other loan obligations except our current mortgage, so we are in good shape there, and we have several years of income saved up in cash for down payment of 25-30 percent on either home, but the total home prices in my area are simply MUCH more expensive than 3 times our yearly income.

So is this old rule even valid anymore? Or is the answer ""move to a cheaper neighborhood farther out"" the correct one here? Again, we would pay enough cash on any home we got into so that we wouldn't be over-mortgaged, but I am really wondering about this rule and if it still applies.",finance
personalfinance,Synchrony CareCredit upgraded my card to a CareCredit Rewards Mastercard without consent. Will declining it harm my credit?,"So Synchrony upgraded my regular CareCredit card used for vet bills (with the typical 6 months no interest if paid in full) regularly in our house for the bi-yearly animal medical care.

I never let the interest free period expire before paying in full, so I have never paid interest to CareCredit. 

Today in the mail, unsolicited, was a package congratulating me on my excellent credit card usage and containing a new card with the Mastercard Logo. The promotional materials indicated this upgrade to a major credit card was being done for ""my convenience"". The T&amp;C's indicated the interest rate as 26.99%. For reference, I have a 751 score and have both Citibank and CapitalOne Ventures with fixed 9.99%, so god knows where this 26.99% rate came from.

**I do not want this card**. Buried deep in the legal disclosures was  a number to call within ""45 days of receipt"" to ""reject"" the upgrade, after which I would ""never again be eligible to be upgraded"" after rejecting the offer (great negative reinforcement language, some copywriter got paid to engineer that).

My only question is this; ***If I reject the upgrade and stay on my existing proprietary card, will it negatively harm or alter my credit score in any way?***",finance

personalfinance,I don't know which career to choose,"Correct me if this is the wrong sub, but this has really been eating me up inside.

I will be graduating this year with an undergraduate Economics degree, and the time to choose a career has arrived. I have two paths before me: diplomacy (foreign service) or a Master's in Statistics/Data Science. As you can see, these are two extremely different paths.

The thing is, the foreign service would be a REALLY safe choice. I would never have to worry about housing, as the government in my country ensures it for diplomats here and abroad. The initial salary abroad is between US$100k-US$130k net, with a US$3k monthly housing aid. At home, on the other hand, the salary is only US$35k considering the current exchange rate. I would not have to worry about retirement, as the government would also provide a federal pension. I'd have to study as a slave to pass the test for the foreign service, and I don't know if it is worth it.

On the other hand, I could go work in the industry, as a Statistician/Data Science (my degree is very quantitative). I know that there are big salaries in tech, and data science, for instance. I really enjoy the area, and I feel like I would miss it if I went for the foreign service. I was thinking about doing a Master's in the US for a bigger salary and better careers prospects. 

I'm really scared of making a mistake here. I haven't asked my family about it as they are very traditional and would think I'm an idiot for not choosing the foreign service route, but I'm worried I will have to study for years to find out I don't like the job (or even to find out that I could have got a better salary on Statistics). 

What do you think would be the best choice by financial criteria?",finance

We learned that we‚Äôll have a maintenance upgrade toward the end of October and then PAB a few weeks later. This is extremely important since it will finally allow for the last bits of dApp buildout. The PAB is already available on the tesnet. The test dApp the team is using is an NFT marketplace. The team is watching as we see high loads around events like NFT drops. But, the network is reacting as expected.

42. Now one of Cardano‚Äôs most highly visible critics is implying that the Cardano community has something in common with anti-vaxxers. Unfortunately for him, it was one of his pet blockchains that was down a few days ago while Cardano just kept healthily trucking right along.

48. After the Senate hearing on Tuesday September 14th, Gary Gensler (SEC Chairman) gave a quote to a crypto publication indicating that custodial lending and possibly even staking platforms might be considered securities. This is very relevant for Cardano since it has non-custodial staking whereas many of its competitors have the kind of custodial staking that Gensler may have been contemplating.

72. In late 2008/early 2009 it turns out Hal Finney was learning Haskell and trying to figure out how to reduce C02 emissions from a (future) widely used Bitcoin. That sounds a lot like Cardano.

74. Wow! It‚Äôs looking like Meld has landed a partnership with a mobile provider in Nigeria with nine million customers. Not many details out at this point (Sept 30).

77. The Wall Street Journal has dropped a video on stablecoins. A lot of the video surrounds the Tether dollar reserve controversy. It‚Äôs notable that Cardano‚Äôs Djed solves this.

79. Cardano users on twitter piece together that Charles was talking about visiting [u/Pezesha\_Africa](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pezesha_Africa/) (in regard to microfinance) in Kenya. This is big because Pezesha operates in countries with a combined population of over $300MM.

80. Crypto twitter users try to depict US Whitehouse comments out of context to fuel an economic doom narrative. However, if you listen to the whole press briefing, you will understand that these comments were based on a ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenario involving the US debt ceiling somehow not being raised.

82. Remember! There is no mobile Daedalus wallet. There is no browser extension version of Daedalus. These are fakes! They will steal your ADA. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1445380773096398853](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1445380773096398853)

84. Brazil is looking to follow the El Salvador example and accept crypto as legal tender with a new bill to be voted within days.

92. Representative Tom Emmer clashes with SEC Head Gensler over the direction of crypto regulation. However, it‚Äôs unclear how much Rep.

104. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce (cryptomom) gave a polite but scathing speech at the Texas Blockchain Summit where she laid bare all the problems with the SEC‚Äôs current approach to crypto. After her recent opinion piece and this speech, it‚Äôs fair to say that she and SEC Chairman Gensler are in open war over crypto. How this gets resolved will determine the regulatory landscape for Cardano and all of crypto going forward. Sadly, Gensler is in charge and not vice versa.

CryptoCurrency,What's the strangest crypto opinion you have?,"What opinion do you have that most people within the market would think to be unrealistic - or even seems unrealistic to yourself but you still believe to be possible?

Clearly over the years, many outlandish targets and predictions have been proven to be correct and all those (likely a large majority) who scoffed at them are now quietly crying in a corner.

Not many predicted the rise of BTC to begin with, and even fewer predicted the rise of an entire crypto market consisting of hundreds/thousands of different projects - then we have the 'meme' projects, and we all know how those are going despite endless ridicule.

What crypto opinion(s) do you have which would make people today laugh/ question/ dismiss, but you believe ultimately could or is even likely to occur?",cryptocurrency

It also forced me to be more self reflective and patient in life as well as in trading.

CryptoCurrency,The inevitable debate on the divinity of Satoshi Nakamoto,"A couple of months ago I had a crypto theodicy. In the end I reconciled my feelings on the nature of BTC and its reality as a separat entity from crypto. BTC isn't responsible for the actions of the Altcoin market. In fact it can be simply put that in the end 

BTC's ultimate goal is the subversion and dismantling of the state. While Alt-coins goals are the establishment of a new state. This evident in the prevalence of centralized foundations, pre-mining, unlimited supply, Proof of stake, ICOs, Venture Capitalism etc....

BTC has maintained nearly 50% market share fighting institutionalization. While Alts have gained 50% from BTC with it

If I were to compare our current prediction to anything it would be near the end of the Christian persecution in ancient Rome. The powers that govern our society have begrudgingly accepted they can not replace BTC with a ""new better religion"" such as Mithraism ( ETH/ BCH/ EOS/LTC) and now wish to assimilate BTC into the empire. Let us never forget that Christianity went from a crime punishable by death in Rome to the state faith. To this day the head of the Catholic church sits a few kilometres from where his predecessors where fed to lions 

So we are becoming the new  state religion. BTC is recognized as a national currency, a new asset class, ETFs, remittances, social  media integration, inflation hedged....the new international reserve currency. The writing is in the white paper 

However that is not the debate that will in the coming years be debated. No! The issue that will be spew from the mouth of the non-believer and devout alike will be "" who is our prophet?"" 

This may sound ridiculous now; but take a moment to consider the cults of personality that are around Elon Musk,  Charles Hoskinson, Vitalik, Gavin, Silvio that HEX asshole with the hat. This space breeds religious devotion 

Satoshi Nakamoto may have single handedly changed the global financial system. Maybe the coarse of the human race for decades to come. Even now his idea is the 7th most valuable currency in the world. With his wallet making him 18th richest man on earth at $61 billion. Yet we don't know his real name or face. Is he alive/ dead ? Is he a man or woman?. Is he black, white, asian? Is he a Muslim or Christian?  

Is he divine or is he man?",cryptocurrency

# [4 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-monday-oct-18.html)

*****

&gt; # 1. Wall Street set to start the week lower after Friday‚Äôs rally

&gt; * Dow futures dropped nearly 150 points Monday ahead of a busy week for corporate earnings against the backdrop of increasing U.S. oil prices and a tick-up in bond yields. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq rallied Friday and for all of last week.
&gt; * The Dow was less than 1% from its Aug. 16 record close. The S&amp;P 500 was nearly 1.5% away from its Sept. 2 record close. The Nasdaq was 3.1% from its Sept. 7 record close.
&gt; * The flood of earnings takes a pause Monday but picks back up Tuesday with Netflix, Johnson &amp; Johnson, United Airlines and Procter &amp; Gamble reporting.
&gt; * So far, 41 S&amp;P 500 companies have delivered third-quarter results, with 80% of them topping EPS expectations, according to data from FactSet.
&gt; * Taking into account those already out and estimates for the rest, third-quarter profit growth would total 30%, the third-highest quarterly profit growth rate for S&amp;P 500 firms since 2010, according to FactSet.

*****

&gt; # 2. WTI tops $83 per barrel; bond yields move higher

&gt; * U.S. oil prices, as measured by West Texas Intermediate crude, jumped another 1%, topping $83 per barrel, their highest level since October 2014. Behind the march higher are continued recovering demand as Covid-depressed business activity picks up, and as high natural gas and coal prices encourage a switch to fuel oil and diesel for power generation. WTI was already up three straight sessions and surged 3.7% last week for its eighth positive week in a row, the best weekly winning streak May 2015.

&gt; * The 10-year Treasury yield started the week moving back up toward 1.62%. Before topping those levels earlier this month, the last time it was that high was in June. The 10-year yield, which moves inversely to price, was boosted Friday after data showed that U.S. retail sales rose by 0.7% in September, versus an expected decline of 0.2%. Industrial production figures for September are out at 9:15 a.m. ET, with estimates calling for a 0.2% increase following a 0.4% jump in August.

*****

&gt; # 3. China GDP disappoints, third-quarter growth slows to 4.9%

&gt; * China‚Äôs third-quarter gross domestic product grew a disappointing 4.9% from a year ago as industrial activity in the world‚Äôs second-largest economy rose less than expected in September.

&gt; * Many factories had to stop production in late September as a surge in the price of coal and a shortage of electricity prompted local authorities to abruptly cut off power. The struggles of giant developer China Evergrande came to the forefront in August. Real estate and related industries account for about a quarter of China‚Äôs GDP, according to Moody‚Äôs estimates.

*****

&gt; # 5. Apple likely to finish transforming its MacBook lineup

&gt; * Apple is holding a launch event Monday to announce new products, likely including a redesigned MacBook Pro. The company has a chance to drive continued momentum to its Macs ahead of the holiday shopping season, especially since it‚Äôs expected to announce more computers that run on its own chips instead of Intel‚Äôs processors. Last month, Apple announced and subsequently released new iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches, leaving Macs as the remaining major product line that hasn‚Äôt been updated this fall. Apple is also likely to provide a release date for macOS Monterey, the latest version of Mac software, which was announced in June but has not yet been officially released.

stocks,The wealthiest 10% of Americans own a record 89% of all U.S. stocks,"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/the-wealthiest-10percent-of-americans-own-a-record-89percent-of-all-us-stocks.html

The wealthiest 10% of Americans now own 89% of all U.S. stocks, a record high that highlights the stock market‚Äôs role in increasing wealth inequality. The top 1% gained over $6.5 trillion in corporate equities and mutual fund wealth during the Covid-19 pandemic, while the bottom 90% added $1.2 trillion, according to the latest data from the Federal Reserve. The share of corporate equities and mutual funds owned by the top 10% reached the record high in the second quarter, while the bottom 90% of Americans held about 11% of stocks, down from 12% before the pandemic. The stock market, which has nearly doubled since the March 2020 drop and is up nearly 40% since January 2020, was the main source of wealth creation in America during the pandemic ‚Äî as well as the main driver of inequality. The total wealth of the top 1% now tops 32%, a record, according to the Fed data. Nearly 70% of their wealth gains over the past year and a half ‚Äî one of the fastest wealth booms in recent history ‚Äî came from stocks.


‚ÄúThe top 1% own a lot of stock, the rest of us own a little,‚Äù said Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow, Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. The growing concentration of wealth comes despite millions of new investors coming into the stock market for the first time during the pandemic, leading to what many have labeled ‚Äúthe democratization‚Äù of stocks. Robinhood added more than 10 million new accounts over the past two years and now has more than 22 million ‚Äî many of them held by younger, first-time investors. Yet while the market may be owned more broadly, the gains and wealth it creates are not being more widely distributed. Rosenthal said that while the army of new investors may be numerous, they are also still small, with the average account size at Robinhood at about $4,500. When markets rise, they will have far smaller dollar gains than wealthier investors with hundreds of thousands or even millions in stock holdings.


‚ÄúMany of the younger investors also bought in at higher prices, compared to bigger investors who have been in the market for years and see larger gains,‚Äù Rosenthal said. What‚Äôs more, many of the new investors have more of a trading mentality ‚Äî buying and selling stocks rapidly, with leverage, in hopes of quick gains. While the strategy can create big winners, others may see lower returns than those of investors who simply buy and hold for the long term. The top 10% saw the value of their stocks gain 43% between January 2020 and June of 2021, according to the Fed. The bottom 90% saw stock wealth rise at a lower rate ‚Äî 33%. ‚ÄúThey might account for a larger share of trading activity, but that‚Äôs different from ownership and wealth,‚Äù Rosenthal said.",finance

economy,Can the Fed actually raise rates very much?,"Please explain this to me like I am a child...I may be in over my head here.

I recently saw a video in which an analyst said (and I am paraphrasing)

""if you look at a 40-year chart of rates, you see this 40-year downturn because they're piling on so much debt that their incremental rate increases are ever more painful, for instance, 30 trillion dollars of debt at 5% it's 1.5 trillion.  The U.S. government took in 3.5 trillion of revenue the previous year in 2019 the best year ever before the pandemic. That would simply bankrupt the U.S Treasury the u.s government is really pinned in a corner""

Is there are relationship between soaring debt/raising rates...and the fed not being able to afford the ""cost""...for the lack of a better word?

My wife and I make 120k a year at our day jobs, file jointly, take the standard deduction, and have no tax deductible expenses outside of our cheap health insurance. We have both run some small self employed side hustles from time to time.

FICA - 15.3%

Kentucky State income Tax - 5%

Louisville Metro  Income Tax - 2.2%

Total: 44.5%

They all said I was insane and that's not how taxes work; ""You can't just add them all together"". Am I crazy? I know that our effective tax rate on our total income is lower, but when deciding whether or not the a side hustle is worth my time, I'd like to know how much of **that income** I'll keep.

personalfinance,Mortgage interest rate increasing even though closing before deadline,"Okay, so I [posted about this a few days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/q7jii8/interest_rate_going_up_significantly_because_of/) but found out more info since and I just want to check one last time before making a decision.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, I'm a first time home-buyer and am in the process of purchasing a house. During an inspection, water and termite damage was found and the seller has agreed to pay the $15k in repairs. This includes essentially replacing the bathroom, fixing mold damage + vapor barrier in crawlspace, and fixing the termite damage. Absolutely no issues with the sellers here.  


On the lending side, I locked a 2.875% interest rate (30 yr conventional loan), which is good until **October 28th**. Our closing date is **October 27th**. However, the bank is requiring the repairs to be completed before they will disburse the money. The repairs are expected to be completed November 4th, which is \_one week\_ too long, and will cause the locked in rate to expire.   


This also (presumably) means that the sellers aren't getting paid until after the repairs are finished - I don't know why they agreed to it, but I know they have a bridge loan (built a house) and this is probably the fastest way to the most money, as I offered over asking price when the market was higher.  


The (local, smaller chain) bank is requiring me to re-lock in the rate - it would be at least $5,000 to buy back down the rate to 2.875% - their current rate is **3.5%**. This seems astronomically high - checking the rate of a local credit union (online estimate, so not 100% reliable), their rate would be 3%. I've also seen other lenders offer a ""rate-lock extension"" that's like 0.5% to 1% of the loan amount, but they specifically said they cannot offer that.  


It feels like they're purposefully delaying disbursing the funds so that they can jack the interest rate up on me last minute on a technicality, without providing any kind of reasonable rate lock extension. They just told me that I would need to lock in the new rate TODAY, so I can't even wait to see if the repairs finish before closing on October 27th.  


Is this reasonable for the bank to do? Is there anything I can do in this situation? I'm sure it's too late to switch lenders, and the house is amazing and I'll have essentially a new bathroom, so I'm not inclined to back out at this point. I just hate having the rate change so dramatically last minute and really wish I had chosen a different lender.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**: Closing on October 27th, but bank not disbursing funds to seller until after repairs are done, which is expected to be November 4th. Current interest rate of 2.875% expires October 28th, new interest rate is 3.5% and would cost $5,000 to buy back down.

**Edit:** Forgot to mention, the bank has said they will not allow the money to be escrowed.

**Edit 2:** Thanks everyone! It seems they were hesitant to extend the rate lock because they thought the repairs would take much longer (no clue why). After asking about it again and sharing the progress in repairs I saw yesterday, they were able to confirm that significant progress had been made and offered a 30 day rate lock extension for about $1,000.",finance
personalfinance,Car refinance advice,"Hi guys,

Quick question. 

I have $24,088 left on my car with an interest rate of 4.1%, with interest being low I thought I could drop that to save some money. 

My monthly payments are $701 a month, and my loan maturity date is June 2024.

So I have 34 months (including October) left on my payments.

I was offered 2.8% interest rate, so my refinance would be about $500 for 54 months. 

However, when I use the refinance calculator it says that I would lose -$3,500 interest on this loan. 

That's a lot higher than I thought, but it is double the term almost...

Anyway, my plan wasn't to lower my monthly payments. 

I was going to get a Lower rate ($500) and pay an extra $200 (so back to my current monthly payment of $700). 

However this is where I get confused, I thought this would save me money? I'd effectively be paying $700 for nearly the same term, which with shaving off 1.3% interest, I'd save some money? 

However refinance calculator says I'm saving +$493 interest when over paying (vs the total interest incurred on the new loan).

So... The calculator is telling me that my current loans vs proposed loan, I lose -$3,500 making minimum payments, and on that I only save $493 by paying $700? Meaning compared to right now id actually lose about $3000 in interest? 

Am I missing something? Surely by paying the exact same as I am now, for nearly the same period of months, at an interest rate 1.3% lower than my current deal -  would mean I saved money? 

Maybe in a dumbass and missing something critical here.",finance

personalfinance,Anxious about buying a house,"Hello PF!  


I'm a long time lurker and have learned so much from y'all here. I would love a quick financial overview/recommendations as my partner and I begin buying a home.  


Background: I grew up in poverty with a single mom. I'm pretty sure this has skewed my views and anxieties towards finance, so I would love a more objective outlook.  


My (27F) partner (30F) and I make 180k a year combined. Our current rent is $1350 for a one bedroom apartment. After all utilities, parking spots, etc. it's around 1.7k a month. Between us, we have about 169k in cash/investments. Around 38k is cash and the rest is in 401k/Roth IRA/HSA/Brokerage accounts. We currently contribute 10-15% to our 401ks, but we plan on increasing this once we do buy a house. We max out our Roths/my HSA. We've had a lot of abnormal expenses this year such as a wedding and saving cash for a house. But I'm still hovering around a 52% savings rate. So as is, we would not have enough for a 20% downpayment without taking money from our investment accounts. Something I've heard is not advisable since you can't add that same amount of money back into the roth. I've also been reading that investing versus paying 20% is a better strategy right now with interest rates, but is this actually the case? We both have excellent credit, if it's needed for consideration.  


We do not have any debts (paid off car--although it's an old one and will probably need to be replaced in the next few years), we use our credit card for everything each month but pay off in full. We don't plan to have kids. But my biggest financial goal is FIRE.   


Our housing market is expensive. I know it is everywhere, but we were ranked within the top few spots of the most overpriced cities in the US. Most likely we will be aiming to buy a house around 500k (will most likely be a 2b2b home in this price range) and that number makes my stomach churn. I'm wondering if it's a realistic number or if by nature, we should aim for something lower due to FIRE goals. All in all, I can't shake the feeling that buying a house right now is a horrible idea.

cardano,Do not stake ADA on exchanges,"The use of cryptocurrencies places demands on users, who must take responsibility into their own hands and avoid centralized services. Everyone knows the phrase ‚Äúnot your keys, not your coins‚Äù. This also applies to ADA coin staking. Learn why it‚Äôs better to stake ADA coins from your own wallet. 

# Centralization is dangerous

People have bad habits because they use traditional banking. Therefore, they do not need to own their money and entrust it to banks. People believe that when they need money they can use it through credit cards or internet banking. In most cases, this works well. The problem is that people apply the same pattern of behavior to cryptocurrencies. They trust centralized exchanges to own the coins if they have them in their account. People assume that the legal system will protect their cryptocurrency wealth in a similar way that it would protect them in the case of fiat money. There are several problems with this thinking.

Centralization offers people convenient and easy-to-use services. However, this is probably the only advantage. Everything else tends to be disadvantageous for users. Centralized services represent a single point of failure. Remember when Facebook stopped working for a few hours? People basically couldn‚Äôt communicate with their environment. Exactly the same thing can happen with your money. You don‚Äôt have to have it available when you need it. Many exchanges may not be as well protected as banks. Hackers can attack them and steal cryptocurrencies. If this happens, the exchange will probably go out of business, but you may never see your cryptocurrency. In the past, we‚Äôve seen cases where the exchange owner himself has stolen cryptocurrencies and disappeared. Let‚Äôs not forget that regulations are still not completely friendly to cryptocurrencies in all countries. There could be a black scenario where cryptocurrencies are seized by the government. It is common for an exchange to unexpectedly announce maintenance and not allow you to send coins from the exchange. Or they charge fees that are more expensive than the current ones on the blockchain. Losing user data, misusing it, or even selling it on purpose is also not uncommon, and we‚Äôve seen this with the aforementioned Facebook.

In addition to these technical problems, there is also an ideological problem. Cryptocurrencies are here to rid us of these centralized centers of power. If we are serious about cryptocurrency adoption and paradigm shift, we must first and foremost change our established patterns of behavior. People need to educate themselves, install their own cryptocurrency wallets, and actually own cryptocurrencies by holding private keys. Simply put, anyone who does not have coins on their hardware wallet is not a cryptocurrency user but a speculator.

People must learn to own and use their wealth without relying on middlemen. Decentralized networks allow you to send coins and tokens anywhere in the world. Cardano will soon allow you to own not only coins and tokens but also your identity with all the associated data. It will even allow you to trade, take out loans, insurance, and use other financial services. All in a completely decentralized way. You won‚Äôt be able to take advantage of any of this unless you learn to own coins.

The decentralization of the Cardano network is based on the distribution of ADA coins among users. Whoever owns an ADA coin also owns a proportional part of the Cardano network. Coin ownership is thus quite crucial. A portion of the coins will always be on centralized exchanges because people want to speculate with them. That is what is counted on. People who want to hold coins for the long term should withdraw their coins from the exchanges to their own wallets. The important thing to say is that you can stake ADA coins from your own wallet and you don‚Äôt need the exchanges to do that at all.

# Stake from your own wallet is always the most advantageous

Cardano arguably has the best staking capabilities among the competition. Cardano staking does not lock coins for any time period. This gives you complete freedom to decide how to use and spend them. Do you want to lock coins in the DeFi service or buy something with them? You can do that at any time. Centralized exchanges often don‚Äôt offer you this option and require you to lock coins. The Cardano protocol does not require this. Exchanges do. As we mentioned, exchanges can be hacked. We believe you can protect your ADA coins better than exchanges. Cardano distributes rewards to all stakeholders every 5 days. Exchanges can do this over a longer period of time. In addition, Cardano does not charge any fees. The business model of the exchanges has to work somehow. Exchanges are always profit-oriented and will want to be paid somehow for the services they provide. If they offer you a higher interest rate than Cardano‚Äôs protocol, be interested in how it works in the background and if the model is sustainable in the long term. Cardano has a unique model that does not use slashing. This means that delegators will never lose coins due to pool operator misconduct. The Cardano protocol protects stakeholders as much as possible, so it makes no sense to expose yourself to danger through centralized exchanges.

In the Cardano ecosystem, there is not even a limit to the number of coins you have to own. People often use exchanges for staking just because some protocol forces them to own a certain amount of native coins. People who hold small amounts of coins, therefore, need to pool somewhere, and exchanges are happy to take advantage of this need. This is not the case in the Cardano network. All you need is a small amount of ADA coins and you can participate in staking. There is no need to find other people with small amounts of coins and pool the coins together to get the necessary amount for staking. A small amount of ADA coins can be delegated directly from your wallet to the selected pool. You don‚Äôt need to trust middlemen or anyone else in your area.

What‚Äôs best for you is also best for decentralizing the Cardano network. We mentioned the basic cryptocurrency lesson in the introduction. Not your keys, not your coins. You only hold the keys if you have the coins in your own wallet. If you have coins on the exchange, the exchange holds the keys. You only hold the passwords to log into the exchange, at best 2FA authentication. Many people have lost their cryptocurrencies just because they didn‚Äôt secure their access to the exchange well. This is another attack vector that is completely unnecessary in a world of decentralization. The Cardano network will become more decentralized the more users realize this and actively support it. The team has managed to beautifully align the needs of the network with the mission of the entire crypto industry.

# What does it mean to hold ADA?

Owning ADA coins is different than owning BTC coins. Leaving BTC coins on an exchange does not directly reduce the decentralization of the network. In the case of Cardano, the centralized exchanges are essentially intermediary owners of the network. From the perspective of the legal system, the owners of the ADA coins are the people that purchased them. From the perspective of being able to use the coins for staking, for example, to choose the pool to which the coins will be delegated or to vote in Catalyst, the centralized exchanges hold those rights.

Of course, you have to take into account the misuse of coins for a 51% attack. Centralization is always dangerous in terms of abuse of power. On the other hand, large exchanges have a vested financial interest in maintaining a profitable business. For example, if 10 centralized exchanges held say 15% of the coins used for staking, this would not pose a significant threat. 15% of the coins is insufficient for an attack, and it is safe to assume that a larger number of exchanges would not work together in terms of an attack. You could even say that 15% of the coins are well protected by teams that know how to do their jobs very well. It is unlikely that hackers would be able to hack 10 exchanges at the same time. The coins on the exchanges are kept in cold storage, so they are well protected. While it is always better to have multiple independent entities holding a given amount of coins rather than one large one, this is not necessarily as bad as many people think. With increasing adoption and awareness, it can be assumed that people will eventually transfer the coins from the exchanges into their wallets. If someone manages to hack an exchange, it can scare people and speed up the process.

Let us ask ourselves an almost philosophical question. Who actually owns the blockchain network? No one, because we are in a decentralized world? If no one owned it, someone would appropriate the network. If everyone collectively owned the network, we would have to ask what specific rights that give us. In the software world, there will always be someone who decides to modify the source code. At this point, decentralization can only work to a limited extent. Cardano gives you a voice through the ownership of coins. ADA coin owners can make decisions about the future development of the ecosystem and, in time, the protocol itself. People will thus be able to decide what modifications to the protocol will take place. The team will thus be fulfilling the contract of the majority of owners.

However, the protocol cannot be said to be owned by the team through the source code. The distributed network code itself is not worth anything. What has value are the people who run the client and are actively involved in running the network. What is valuable to the user is the ability to create, maintain, transmit, and otherwise use digital value or establish trust between participants. It is critically important for the network to be able to produce new blocks. Thus, the network could be said to be owned by all those involved in the process. In the Cardano ecosystem, the network is owned by the pool operators and delegators. ADA coins provide critical decision rights about who will operate the pool. If you have these decision rights, we can say that you are the owners or operators. Coins are a means of control over the network.

If we ask a similar question in the case of PoW networks, we get a slightly different answer. The means of control in PoW networks is electricity. ASIC miner operators can decide to which pool they delegate their computing power. Of course, they will choose a pool that behaves fairly and runs a version of the client that satisfies the power provider. Note that coins are not a means of control anyway, but only a means of reward.

Financial reward is very important as it is a strong incentive to behave honestly. In PoS networks, coins are a means of control but also a means of reward. If you participate in staking, you earn regular rewards. As a coin owner, you want to appreciate your wealth. You have a direct incentive to see that the protocol evolves, that blocks produce honest pools, and that decentralization is maximized.

In PoW networks, control is more about business than building an ecosystem with democratic principles. Of course, PoW miners also want the protocol to do well and develop. However, miners can only take into account their selfish interests and these may not be in line with the coin holders, i.e. the users of the network. What is unique about the Cardano network is that all users of the network can simultaneously be owners of the network if they want to. They can even profit from the success of the network through regular rewards. PoS allows the infrastructure to be decentralized at a very high level and pool operators and all delegators can participate.

If you own ADA coins, you are actively supporting the creation of a decentralized ecosystem that can be used by other people on the planet. Even those who don‚Äôt own ADA coins will be able to send stable coins, NFTs, or other tokens over the network. People should realize that holding coins on exchanges prevents the full development of the decentralization ideal.

# Trusted and untrusted delegation of power

In any decentralized ecosystem, there is the possibility to delegate decision-making power. This possibility is either directly supported by the protocol from the original design, or arises organically somehow. What does it actually mean to delegate decision-making power? In any network, there are a limited number of entities that produce blocks. It doesn‚Äôt matter if they are called pools or validators. What matters is that these entities must satisfy some protocol conditions and must have a certain size of a given resource. It doesn‚Äôt matter if they are coins in the case of PoS or energy in the case of PoW. Cardano has used the concept of pools from the very beginning. Bitcoin came to this organically over time and Satoshi doesn‚Äôt mention them in the white paper. Pools can decide whether to produce a block, what transactions to include in it, what block to continue on in case of a fork, and so on. Block producers make decisions that cannot be made by those who delegate power to these pools through coins or energy. You could say that delegators can only control the work of pools.

The delegation of decision-making power, or if you prefer, the delegation of control, is a very important process in terms of decentralization. We can divide this activity into two categories:

* A trusted delegation is one in which the choice of the delegator cannot be influenced or changed by a third party. This means that the delegator itself directly decides which pool it delegates coins or energy to. If there is any problem with a pool, the delegator can immediately change his choice. This weakens the rogue pool and strengthens another pool that is behaving fairly.
* An untrusted delegation is a delegation in which the owners of the resources use the services of third parties. This means that the resource owners do not have direct control over their choice. They may express their wishes, but the third party is one that carries out the will of the delegator and may or may not comply. If there is a sudden problem the delegators do not have full control over the delegation and cannot react quickly by delegating to another pool if necessary. Third parties may misuse the provided resource for an attack, the resource may be stolen, or the resource may somehow be prevented from being used.

Clearly, the ecosystem should support the existence of trusted delegation as much as possible. Untrustworthy delegation is a threat to decentralization. Let‚Äôs show examples.

Staking through a centralized exchange is a typical example of untrusted delegation. People entrust coins to the exchange and the exchange stakes the coins for them. Exchanges set up their own pools and use users‚Äô coins to do so. The exchange thus holds a lot of power in the network, but the skin in the game is still held by the owners of the coins, not the exchange itself. Even if a centralized exchange has an economic incentive to behave fairly, and we can imagine that some trouble with lawyers might result from an abuse of power, prevention is always the best defense against abuse of power.

PoW networks suffer from the same problem. People are not always able to get a good price for power and are forced to run their mining through third parties. Large third parties always have an advantage against small miners as they can negotiate better prices for energy as large buyers, also when buying ASIC equipment, and even smaller fees from pools. Cloud mining is therefore relatively widespread. Genesis Mining claims on its website that up to 2 million customers use its services. People pay for the hash rate through their bank account, but the cloud mining companies are the ones who decide what to do with the hash rate or whether to abuse this power.

In the case of PoW mining, people often do not have the option to use trusted delegation. This means that power is centralized in the hands of third parties. In the case of Cardano, however, there is nothing stopping people from delegating from their own wallets. It costs nothing to delegate coins, and it‚Äôs just the same expensive anywhere in the world. There is no rational reason for people to leave coins on exchanges. People just need to understand the basic rules of staking and delegation to do without exchanges and untrusted delegation entirely.

Sooner or later, strong players will dominate every ecosystem. The protocol must be well prepared for this eventuality and ideally support greater decentralization, even at the cost of major changes at the first layer. The Binance exchange has roughly a 10% share of power at the block producer level in both the Cardano ecosystem and Bitcoin. This is hard for the community to resist and it would be naive to somehow prohibit it. In the case of Bitcoin, the Binance exchange is likely to have its own hash rate, as what miner would delegate power to a pool of a centralized exchange? Many such people probably wouldn‚Äôt. In the case of the Cardano ecosystem, however, people can leave the exchange and run staking completely freely and independently of a third party. The Binance exchange certainly doesn‚Äôt own 10% of the ADA coins.

Let‚Äôs add that not every PoS network allows delegation of power to pools. If a certain high number of coins is needed for staking, exchanges or other more centralized solution is the only option for smaller holders. These networks can also slide towards untrusted delegation. Cardano has delegation built right into the protocol and you can literally delegate with a few coins. Thus, nothing stands in the way of decentralization.

# It is all about trust

The concept of decentralization is built on the distribution of trust. Instead of centralized entities, people can trust a large group of independent entities. For end-users, this means they trust the network, not anyone in particular. As decentralization begins to be explored more in the media, the number of pools or delegators in given ecosystems will be compared. As adoption grows, the demand for more decentralization will grow. This is logical if decentralized networks will have higher financial and social relevance. Decentralization must grow over time not stagnate or even decline.

If there are strong actors with a lot of power in a decentralized ecosystem, this will be a problem. Because there will be increasing pressure on these entities and many people will want to somehow control them, abuse them, or perhaps destroy them. The point of decentralization is about maximizing the distribution of power because that is the only way a given network can survive.

The success of the networks will be directly dependent on the network effect and the people who choose to use the blockchain network. The quality of decentralization will definitely be an important parameter in the decision-making process. Although we believe that decentralization is not the most important attribute from the users‚Äô perspective, it is still what differentiates Cardano or Bitcoin from centralized services. Let‚Äôs never forget that. Imagine if a network was in the hands of 3 large pools and 100 large delegators of power. How are you going to convince other people on the planet that the rules of the network won‚Äôt change? People need to be assured that the fundamental rules of the network will either never change, or only through a transparent majority decision. If people don‚Äôt have a vote, the decentralized network will end up just like a regular bank or a big IT company. Top management will make the decisions.

We can revisit our philosophical question about who actually owns the network. We said above that it‚Äôs largely about who controls the network at the consensus or source code level. For all users, the choice of the network will be an absolutely critical decision, as they will entrust their wealth to it. These users must have confidence that the network is either partially owned by themselves or, conversely, not owned by a few powerful players. If the network is abandoned by users, the network itself will lose its meaning. If the ‚Äúin code we trust‚Äù narrative is to succeed, users must be convinced that the network is truly decentralized and not in the hands of a few powerful actors. In other words, if a user sends a transaction, they must have 100% confidence that the network will process the transaction without delay. Any other outcome may be an indication of centralization.

# Conclusion

Decentralization is a moving target. Powerful actors will seek to dominate the network, whether for economic or other reasons. We have no historical experience of sustaining decentralization and we are only at the beginning. The Cardano protocol is designed to allow trusted delegation. That is, it allows you to delegate small amounts of ADA coins from your own wallet. This process is as simple and cheap as possible. You can delegate ADA coins from the Trezor and Ledger hardware wallet. There is no reason to leave coins on centralized exchanges. If you want to rely on exchanges, it is always better to split the coins across multiple exchanges so that they are not held by a single entity. However, you always risk losing your coins and there is a potential risk of misuse.

Third parties will always be happy to offer their services because they can profit from them. To profit, their economic model must be better than the decentralized network model itself. This is theoretically impossible without risking coins or misusing your data. Third parties will offer not only staking but also, for example, cheap sending of coins over centralized networks. Although it is user-friendly to pay with a crypto card in a store, be aware that this has its negatives in terms of the sustainability of the first-layer economic model. For the networks themselves, only those transactions that earn fees are useful. The fees are used to reward stakers or miners. Thus, teams must strive for technological advances that allow coins to be used in a completely decentralized way while achieving high user-friendliness.

personalfinance,Should I sign another year lease in crappy apartment? Or should I buy a house?,"Hello all, this is a throw-away account for personal safety reasons. I am looking for advice on housing. I am in a lucky spot where I have a few options and trying to decide the best way to proceed. This is all taking place in the U.S. by the way.

I have been living in the same apartment for three years and I would like to buy a house. The apartment is relatively inexpensive, especially for the area, but it is a shitty apartment, and I would like to leave. Just to give an idea of the issues here, the property management cut a hole in what would be the attic area if I had access, and now there is no insulation to keep the apartment warm/cold. I have asked them when this hole will be repaired, and they refuse to give a timeline. It has been open for at least 3 months now. They basically said that because the hole is not directly allowing the elements into my apartment it is not a priority for them to fix.

The problems are that the housing market is nuts right now, as I‚Äôm sure everyone is aware. And I don‚Äôt know how much longer I will live in this area. If I were to move to another apartment, I would likely pay at least $300-400 more per month. However, I have been able to save up some money and I could potentially pay in cash for a house that is a great size for me. Alternatively, I could put at least 20% for a down payment and take out a mortgage, assuming I get a low interest rate. Furthermore, the city I am in is expected to grow by approximately 1 million residents in the next decade, meaning the house could go up in value if I hold onto it, even if I don‚Äôt end up staying here.

My questions are:

1. Should I just suck it up and stay in this apartment until I have a better idea of how long I will be staying in the city or just wait to purchase until I know I will be somewhere long term?
2. If I do end up purchasing, is it wise to keep as much money in the stock market as I can and make a 20% down payment? Or should I try to pay in cash?
3. If I do stay in the apartment, should I sign another lease to keep my low rent?

My lease is ending in November, and I need to make a decision. This apartment has the option to pay month to month, but the rent increases by almost $400. I would like to go month to month until I purchase a house, which would hopefully be by the end of the year. I am hoping to be accepted into grad school here, and if accepted, that would keep me in the city for another 5 years or so. Following graduation, I would most likely need to move because there aren‚Äôt many jobs my field in this city.

I appreciate any advice anyone can give.

Edit for more context:

I should say that if I bought a house outright, it would use about half of my savings. So I would still be able to keep quite a bit in the stock market and have an emergency fund. However, I think I should wait to see if I am accepted into grad school. I suppose locking in the current rate at my holey apartment until I have a better idea of my future plans would not be the end of the world since I have put up with this property management for three years. Thank you for the opinions and advice.",finance

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, October 18, 2021. Please enjoy!!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 18, 2021**

The market carried on its incredible momentum, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) bouncing for the fourth straight day to add to gains after experiencing the first -5% decline all year. Technology stocks, which have recently been pressured by a rising Treasury yield, came back with a vengeance, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) jumping roughly 6% from October 4 lows. Market participants are encouraged by an unexpected uptick in retail sales despite a new report showing inflation rose once again in September amid widespread supply-chain disruptions. Looking ahead, market participants continue to digest corporate earnings report, with many notable companies like Tesla (TSLA), Johnson and Johnson (JNJ), Netflix (NFLX), and Intel (INTC) among many others reporting later this week. 

Not to toot my own horn, but as I have continuously said, I continue to see any dips in the markets as buying opportunities, including this latest dip and the recent bounce highlights why. While I acknowledge current risk factors that exist in the market (China, inflation, supply-chain issues, etc), these are all issues that have been known about and have been affecting the market for months. Just because we see a sudden uptick in ‚Äúdoomsaying‚Äù headlines from mass media, doesn‚Äôt mean the fundamentals of the bull market in US equities have shifted (remember they are paid for you to engage with the content). Until something fundamentally changes (like inflation forcing the Fed to suddenly hike the interest rate), I continue to stick to my plan. Just be sure to be prepared for any eventuality, I do this by having zero-margin in my long-term account and adhering to stop losses in trades.

A strong start to earnings season, with big banks handily beating estimates last week, helped fuel optimism that corporate profits held up better than anticipated despite widespread supply-related disruptions. Big banks from Morgan Stanley (MS) to Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) handily topped estimates in their third quarter results last week. As a reminder, consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP. 

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DPCERE1Q156NBEA](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DPCERE1Q156NBEA)

Victoria Fernandez, Chief Market Strategist at Crossmark Global Investments said, ‚ÄúWe started off this week really strong. The banks have done great ... That started to relieve a few people's concerns, especially when you had the CEOs of the bank saying the consumer looks strong. And that, I think, is going to be the key for the market going forward. If the consumer is there and they're willing to spend ‚Äî which we've seen in the month of September \[when\] retail sales started to come back a little bit ‚Äî then I think that gives a little more optimism to the market that as we continue to reopen, as earnings are strong, the consumer will be there, and the equity markets will continue to trend higher.""

Last week, The Department of Commerce released their monthly report on retail sales, which showed an unexpected rise in consumer spending in September despite supply-chain constraints. Retail sales for the month increased by 0.7%, against the Dow Jones estimate for a decline of 0.2%. Compared with a year ago, sales were up 13.9%. Still despite robust consumer spending, economists warn that supply bottlenecks will increase heading into the holiday season, as demand increases. Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets said,  ‚ÄúThe solid retail sales report reflects both consumer resilience and escalating prices. The main concern now is that supply-chain disruption and micro-chip shortages appear to be spreading, limiting selection and tamping down goods demand.‚Äù 

As of Friday, the expected earnings growth rate for the S&amp;P 500 was 30%, according to FactSet. That figure ‚Äî based on both actual earnings from companies that have reported so far and expectations for future results ‚Äî represented an increase from the prior week, when the anticipated earnings growth rate for the third quarter stood at about 27.6%.

**Highlights**

* Apple (AAPL) unveiled new versions of its Macbook Pro laptops that use their proprietary M1 chip, making them more powerful than the predecessors that used Intel (INTC) chips.
* Optimism among U.S. homebuilders posted a surprise jump in October, with strong demand for homes helping offset ongoing supply chain and labor issues in the housing market. The National Association of Home Builders' October Housing Market Index jumped to 80 in October from 76 in September. This index, which tracks confidence among domestic homebuilders, was expected to fall to 75 in the latest reading, according to Bloomberg consensus data.
* Alibaba (BABA) is reportedly planning to build its own in-house chip using a 5nm wafer designed using Arm architecture in a bid to strengthen its position in the cloud computing market.
* Arm, which is the midst of a potential $54 billion take over by NVIDIA (NVDA) announced new tools aim at cutting the development time of connected devices by up to 40%. Arm on Monday released tools that it hopes will let makers of ""internet of things"" devices, from connected traffic control lights to smart home appliances, develop their chips and code at the same time, shaving two years off the typical five-year timeline to create a device. Arm is one of the most important tech companies, I recommend everyone read up on them. 
* Amazon (AMZN) hired 150,000 seasonal workers as the holiday season, the busiest of the year, kicks off.

personalfinance,(UK) How to decide between these two job offers?,"I decided a while ago to start looking for a new job after 3 years at a UK fintech startup with zero progression opportunities and no chance of a pay increase.


After hours of life-draining interviews at various unsuitable companies, I happened to hit upon two great roles at two different fintech startups, and have progressed fairly quickly through the interviewing stages for both. 


About 10 days ago I received an offer for one of these roles (lets call this 'Job A') and after waiting several days with no response from the other (Job B), I accepted. Today, out of the blue, Job B has also reached out and made me an offer, and whilst this is great news, I'm now more confused than ever! 

To sum up both roles/packages: 

**Job A**

* M - F, 9am to 6pm

* ¬£32k salary, 2 days a week in the London office (I live around 2.5 hours train ride away) and the other 3 days remote 

* They've offered me this higher salary as I will need to pay for my train and hotel myself 

* 33 days holiday 

* 60 days per year 'work from anywhere' 

* Health insurance 



**Job B**

* M - F, 7am to 3pm

* ¬£28k salary 

* Almost fully remote, one day in the London office per fortnight 

* Hotel stay night before my day in the office and train fare to London and back covered by company (I can't physically get to London for 7am from where I live, hence the hotel)

* 33 days holiday   



The 'work from anywhere' benefit of Job A is of huge appeal to me as I previously had this benefit in my current job before it was taken away, but the extra salary being eaten up by having to pay for a hotel and train every week is a big negative. 


The shorter working day at Job B is amazing, this is 20 whole hours a month I can devote to my hobbies or exercise or time with my friends/family, but generally I think I am slightly more excited about the role and company at Job A. 


Importantly, I've also already signed my contract with Job A for a start date in roughly 4 weeks time, so technically this could cause some issues, but it does seem most companies are unlikely to take action from what I've read here, or is this not the case?


From speaking with friends it's clear I could likely try and negotiate a higher salary for Job B by using my higher offer from Job A which I obviously have in writing should they ask to see it, but I have NO idea how to go about leveraging job offers against each other, and I'm terrified of ending up with 0 offers instead of 2!

personalfinance,How to put 30% down?,"Hi all, new to Reddit and have found this sub fascinating. I‚Äôll keep this brief. 

Fianc√© and I rent in NYC, and we have an accepted offer on a little condo in FL we want to buy as a second/vacation home. We‚Äôre both 35. 

Condo does not meet all Fannie Mae requirements. (It doesn‚Äôt have adequate reserve. That said, we know several owners and are 100% comfortable). 

Lender wants 30% instead of 20% down. Diff of $25K. That‚Äôs a big difference. We can afford it, but not without liquidating some non-retirement investments and paying capital gains. 

Any finance strategies to mitigate this? 

We thought about asking for a sellers concession for closing costs which would bring down the cost to settle. I am a first time homebuyer (fianc√© is not, previously bought and sold, we are financing jointly) so not sure if there‚Äôs anything there. We‚Äôre pretty sure the seller would work with us but lowering the contract price won‚Äôt help too much. It would have to be some other means like a concession on closing costs. 

Or do we just take out the money and pay the capital gains? I mean that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs there for. We‚Äôre just feeling a little sticker shock since we thought we had all this worked out. PS interest rate is good.

personalfinance,Am I being too risk averse?,"A couple of years ago, my wife and I sold the house we were quickly outgrowing, and bought a piece of land to build a new house on with the equity.  This year, we had plans drawn up and gave them to our contractor to bid.  That bid came back approximately $150,000 more than I had anticipated ($550k vs $400k).  Understandably this was due to inflated costs of lumber, other building materials, and labor.

My father-in-law then offered to help us with the difference so that we could get into the house with the understanding that they money would need to be paid back as we deem ourselves able, and any balance at the time of their deaths, would be deducted from our inheritance.  Fast forward to today, and he sends us a contract with those terms, which I am fine agreeing to.

But it turns out that this money he said he will give to us is borrowed against his line of credit and is variable based on Libor rates.  So obviously, the repayment plan has this attached to it.  The rate is currently at 2.85%.  I understand why he is structuring it as such, because the debt is cheaper than his returns on that money.

I felt pretty good about this money with the assumption that it was a) interest free and b) had no specific structure of repayment.  And honestly, if we never paid him a dime back, he wouldn't hold it against us.  I have two HUGE concerns with this.  The first is that the fed is going to start increasing rates, so that 2.85% rate will be short lived.  The second is that while he wouldn't hold it against us, in the event that we struggle to pay it back, that interest is going to increase the balance owed.  That money will eat at any future inheritance at potentially thousands of dollars per year.

With all of that said, I am massively uneasy about accepting any money from him with those terms.  A variable rate on that kind of money is not an enemy I care to meet.  Am I over reacting to this thinking that those rates could quadruple in the coming years?  Money is cheap right now, but it hasn't been in the past, and almost certainly won't be at some point in the future.

To be perfectly honest, I would rather accept a gift of $150,000 and deduct $200,000 from our future inheritance amount, and never have to worry about repayment or interest thereof.

Cliffs: Father-in-law offered to help our house purchase with a $150,000 no-hassle non-specific loan repayment that has a variable interest rate attached to it.  I'm worried that future rates will completely erode the inheritance we stand to receive in the next 15-20 years if we can't repay it.",finance
personalfinance,Emergency early withdrawal from Traditional IRA - can I avoid tax if total income is $12550 or less,"Due to current issues with the economy I haven't worked in 2021 so haven't earned any income.  If I take an early distribution from my traditional IRA (I'm not 59 yet) and keep the amount at $12,550 or less (standard IRS deduction, filing single), will I effectively only pay the 10% early withdrawal penalty and get back any taxes withheld when I file?  And would that apply to both federal and state income tax?  I know it's a bad idea, but I've gone into debt in 2021 and getting ~10K would help, and only paying the 10% penalty seems less awful than also paying taxes on top of that. And would it make sense to take the withdrawal as close to the end of the year as possible to shorten the time between paying the taxes when they cut the check and filing in 2022 and getting my refund?",finance

21. Only 5 more days to Alonzo (as of Sept. 7)!
22. Despite all the negative posting about Cardano smart contracts on eUTxO, it ironically looks like some in the ETH community are actually trying to build ETH L2 on UTXO. [https://twitter.com/matiwinnetou/status/1434570158853529606](https://twitter.com/matiwinnetou/status/1434570158853529606)

25. Charles releases a new video on the Alonzo Update Proposal (on Aug. 7) being submitted so that we can go live on the 12th. He also gives some hints as to his thoughts on the short-term planning of some ‚Äúflavor of the week‚Äù blockchains vs. the long term planning of Cardano. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhujKbMpTEA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhujKbMpTEA)
26. Weiss Crypto lays down yet another very positive thread about Cardano. They acknowledge that they can‚Äôt see the future of Cardano, but they vehemently reject a lot of the anti-hype.

27. Coinbase reveals they received a Wells Notice from the SEC on their crypto loan product. This is relevant for Cardano loan projects.

29. Messari has updated its ‚ÄúInitial Token Distribution‚Äù chart to include a previously missing project and Cardano is still among the very best in the Gen 3 space in terms of broad public coin ownership. [https://twitter.com/CryptoIRELAND1/status/1435708439951552513](https://twitter.com/CryptoIRELAND1/status/1435708439951552513)

33. A Weiss Crypto analyst calls the smart contract launch an alleged event and also doesn‚Äôt realize we already have NFTS. The Cardano community was quick to correct the analyst. Weiss was then also quick to apologize. [https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436369016545857566](https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436369016545857566) [https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436402039085576193](https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436402039085576193)

36. One of Cardano‚Äôs biggest competitors is once again suffering network problems. This time it started out as just being characterized as (more) ‚Äúinstability‚Äù, then they started saying that something had caused the blockchain to ‚Äústart forking‚Äù. This followed their September 2 ‚Äúinstability‚Äù and ‚Äúperformance degradation‚Äù event. It‚Äôll be interesting to see how well their community tolerates this in the future if it‚Äôs happening with their planned slashing model in effect.

42. Now one of Cardano‚Äôs most highly visible critics is implying that the Cardano community has something in common with anti-vaxxers. Unfortunately for him, it was one of his pet blockchains that was down a few days ago while Cardano just kept healthily trucking right along. [https://twitter.com/spudiot1/status/1438402783040790532](https://twitter.com/spudiot1/status/1438402783040790532)

45. Smaug gives us a rundown of how many actual Plutus scripts (19)are running on mainnet vs. timelock scripts (21k) as of Sept 17 and explains simple definitions for both.

47. Now the TX and NJ state securities regulators are after Celsius for crypto loans (BlockFi already got this treatment). Cardano loan projects should probably take note.

48. After the Senate hearing on Tuesday September 14th, Gary Gensler (SEC Chairman) gave a quote to a crypto publication indicating that custodial lending and possibly even staking platforms might be considered securities. This is very relevant for Cardano since it has non-custodial staking whereas many of its competitors have the kind of custodial staking that Gensler may have been contemplating. [https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/117675/crypto-lending-staking-custody-gensler-sec](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/117675/crypto-lending-staking-custody-gensler-sec)

personalfinance,How much should I finance for my car?,"I am purchasing my sister‚Äôs 2014 Cadillac CTS Luxury with 49k miles for $19,000. 

Basically, I have enough money to buy the car in cash, but it would set me back on some savings goals; as I am hoping to potentially buy my first house in the next 4-12 months.

However, I secured a low apr loan of 2.14% for up to 5 years. This rate is the same no matter how many months I choose; with no early repayment penalty. 

I would like to follow the 20/4/10 rule, with 10% of NET income being the max I spend for insurance + car payment. Insurance for full coverage is $89/month. 

At this time, I only have $105 in debt each month for student loans, and make $50,000 a year. So my current DTI is very good!

So‚Ä¶

Option 1:
Buy the car in cash, and not affect my DTI ratio at all. However, it will set my home buying schedule back a few months.  

Option 2:
Down payment of $7,000, borrow 12,000. This would end up at $211 a month, plus 89 in insurance, for $300/mo (10% of my net take home)

Option 3:
Down payment of $10,500-12,000, finance the rest. This would give me a $123-$150 a month car payment. Keeping me well under the 10% rule. However, then I will be spreading myself a little thin financially. 

I am very debt adverse, and I don‚Äôt like to borrow money. However, with a low interest rate of 2.14%, part of me is willing to disrupt my DTI ratio a little bit, since it‚Äôs borrowing money at such a cheap rate. I figure having extra cash on hand might be wise when I start looking for a mortgage. On the flipside, it might be nice to keep my DTI ratio as low as possible, even if it sets my down payment back a bit.

Also, I am for sure buying the car. I have already confirmed that.",finance
stocks,(10/19) Tuesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Tuesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Tuesday, October 19th, 2021-

*****

# [Dow futures jump 160 points as investors bet strong profits will continue to lift market](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures gained on Tuesday as major companies continued to report strong third-quarter earnings, easing concerns that persistent Covid cases and rising costs would derail corporate America‚Äôs profit recovery.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed about 164 points, or 0.5%. S&amp;P 500 futures added 0.5% and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.4%.
*****
&gt; The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 come into Tuesday both sitting about 1% from record highs.
*****
&gt; Dow member Travelers saw its shares gain more than 3% in the premarket after the insurance company‚Äôs quarterly earnings report topped expectations.
*****
&gt; Fifth Third Bancorp shares ticked up in early morning trading after its profit and revenue beat Wall Street estimates.
*****
&gt; Procter &amp; Gamble continued the bullish trend with better-than-expected earnings, but its shares dipped more than 1% in premarket trading. The consumer products giant said it is raising prices to cover rising commodity and freight costs and warned that inflation may continue.
*****
&gt; Johnson &amp; Johnson also beat third-quarter earnings expectations by 25 cents per share, but saw its shares dip in early morning trading.
*****
&gt; Elsewhere, Walmart shares gained around 2% in the premarket after Goldman Sachs added the big box retailer to its conviction buy list, saying the stock could rally nearly 40%.
*****
&gt; As of Tuesday morning, 82% of S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported earnings beat expectations, according to FactSet. Taking into account those reports and estimates for those to come, third-quarter profit growth will come in at 30%, according to FactSet.
*****
&gt; Other major reports after the bell Tuesday include Netflix and United Airlines.
*****
&gt; On Monday, the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite notched their fourth day of gains. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.34%. The Nasdaq was the relative outperformer, gaining 0.84% as Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet all closed higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 36 points, dragged down by a 3% drop in Disney‚Äôs stock.
*****
&gt; While reports have been strong, investors are looking for commentary from corporate America about supply chain issues and inflation.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe financials got earnings season off to another strong start, but let‚Äôs be honest, COVID and supply chain issues aren‚Äôt going to impact this group. Now it gets very interesting to see what other industries will have to say about the health of the economic recovery,‚Äù said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial.
*****
&gt; Netflix could set the tone for technology earnings this season. Three months ago, the streaming giant forecasted paid net subscriber adds of 3.5 million, while analysts expect about 3.84 million, according to StreetAccount. Analysts are also forecasting fourth-quarter subscriber guidance of 8.5 million, which would be the highest outlook since the first quarter of 2019.
*****
&gt; Shares of Netflix have traded lower on six of its last seven earnings releases.
*****
&gt; Earnings from United Airlines should give investors a gauge on the travel recovery from the pandemic and Procter &amp; Gamble earnings could show how strong the consumer is in the goods sector.
*****
&gt; Stocks are coming off of a winning week but have been volatile since September. Morgan Stanley‚Äôs chief U.S. equity strategist Mike Wilson ‚Äî who has been calling for a correction in the broader market ‚Äî told clients on Monday that although fundamentals are deteriorating, the market seems to be resilient to a bigger pullback.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúWhether we end up getting this finishing move at the index level this year or not will depend largely on retail participation, the message that 3Q earnings brings from a guidance standpoint, and the path of PMIs into year end,‚Äù said Wilson.
*****
&gt; Economic data from China weighed on investor sentiment after it reported low GDP and industrial production for September that fell short of expectations. Industrial production in the U.S. also fell for September as supply constraints continued to hinder manufacturing, the Federal Reserve reported Monday.

personalfinance,Mortgage rates projected to rise; how should this affect my planning?,"We have 4 young kids and live in a home that isn't huge.  It's not tiny, but I can definitely see us wanting to move into something larger in the within next \~5 years.  

House prices have spiked in my area, which I'm not too worried about since I'll be both buying and selling in the area, and I figure it will come out as a wash.

What I am more worried about is the fact that interest rates are really low right now, but won't stay that way forever.  I'd rather not move anytime soon, but I worry that if we don't take advantage of the rates while they are low we will end up paying thousands of dollars extra on the life of the loan.

I tried to look into whether my lender allows porting a mortgage, but couldn't find any information (it's a 30 year fixed).  Even if they do allow porting, if the new interest rate is blended it could be a lot higher if rates continue to climb.  

I'd really prefer not to move in the next year or so, but I'm worried if rates climb a lot we may end up being stuck in the home when we're finally ready to move.  Am I overthinking this, or is it something we should seriously be taking into consideration?",finance

stocks,Thinking about shorting my first stock. Have a couple questions.,"For just shy of ten years my investment strategy has been 99% buy long and hold and 1% swing trading to scratch that ""what are the markets doing today"" itch. 

I *think* I have identified a semi-significant shorting opportunity (a bit more research is needed, but it has potential), however I haven't done anything aside from basic-bitch buying long before. I understand the premise of shorting (borrow shares with intrest, sell, hope it drops, buy, return shares) but am not 100% sure on how it works functionally. What determines the interest rate at which I borrow those shares?  Is shorting as simple as selling shares in TD that I don't own (sell to open, then buy to close)?  I understand that shorting has limited gains and unlimited losses by nature, so I'd imagine there are ways to limit that exposure with stop orders?  Is there anything else obvious you feel I'm missing?

If I miss out on this trade it won't make it break me. But either way I'd like to take the opportunity to learn more about shorting in practice for the future. 

Thanks.

MachineLearning,[R][P] OpenFL: An open-source framework for Federated Learning,"Federated learning (FL) is a computational paradigm that enables organisations to collaborate on machine learning (ML) projects without sharing sensitive data, such as, patient records, financial data, or classified secrets. Open Federated Learning (OpenFL) is an open-source framework for training ML algorithms using the data-private collaborative learning paradigm of FL. OpenFL works with training pipelines built with both TensorFlow and PyTorch, and can be easily extended to other ML and deep learning frameworks. Here, we summarise the motivation and development characteristics of OpenFL, with the intention of facilitating its application to existing ML model training in a production environment. Finally, we describe the first use of the OpenFL framework to train consensus ML models in a consortium of international healthcare organisations, as well as how it facilitates the first computational competition on FL.

The main goal of OpenFL framework is provide an easy-enough tool to deal with FL training jobs. To start working with OpenFL, you could use *pip*, *Docker*, or *source code* installation:

PyPI:

    pip install openfl

Docker:

    docker pull intel/openfl

CryptoCurrency,Things I‚Äôve learned during 6 months in crypto.,"I confess I got into crypto originally through doge and then branched out into the cryptosphere, here are some things I‚Äôve learned that I hope can benefit others:

1. 3 Commas, a bot trading platform that links to Binance, Kraken, or KUCOIN. They offer 1 bot FREE!!!! I used to try trading manually and now that I have this bot I feel manually trading is Stone Age! Highly efficient and amazingly simple to use.
2. Osmosis Lab / The DEFI World - entering Liquidity pools, the UI for this website makes you feel majestic, and APR‚Äôs that reach up to 190% (high interest rates and very low gas fees, fractions of a dollar)
3. The Coin Perspective - Coming into the crypto sphere there were so many new coins that grabbed my attention, but choosing the right one as an investment was highly dependent on its future potential, using the coin perspective helped me find the ones with a good market To price ratio, to choose which ones were worth while. Learning about market cap was a very important idea to learn to understand how it was highly unlikely, impossible for Shiba Inu to reach $1. It did however help me find realistic goals to set for certain tokens.
4. Telegram - through the coin perspective I found links to different tokens‚Äô websites and most importantly found out about telegram. learning about the community behind the token or coin helped me understand how serious the topics behind the coin were taken, what the goals were and what the community values as important. of course things like the project timeline certain deadlines and releases are always talked about in telegram.
5. Diversifying your income - hopefully if the crypto sphere works out well for most of us this is considered another revenue stream, it is extremely important to have when you‚Äôre on a budget or you need to have things saved up so you‚Äôre not having all eggs in one basket.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,In want of other perspectives - student loans,"Hello all - I recently graduated back in May and am trying to get some more opinions on how I should structure my repayment method for my two student loans:

1. My personal federal loan - $25,684 @ 4.75%
2. Parent Plus Loan (that I am taking ownership of) - $21,186 @ 7.6%

I confirmed with both providers that COVID forbearance, which mandates 0% interest until January 31, 2022, and payments not due until March 2022, applied to my loans. I still plan to make monthly contributions between now and then (about $1,000 per month).

I plan to refinance the Parent Plus loan with SoFi (my company gets a modest, but existent, .25% rate discount) at the end of the forbearance period to get rid of the 7.6% interest rate. I realize that rates could rise by March 2022. However, I am optimistic that they will not raise close to 7%. 

My main question is what makes the most mathematical sense when it comes to structuring repayment. I am able to repay $1,000 a month towards my student loan debt and I am trying to find the most efficient balance to do so. 

I am keeping in mind that after March 2022 each loan will have a minimum that I must abide by. The two parts of my question are 1. What should I be putting the 1k a month towards until March 2022? And then 2. What are the right amounts to be allocated after that, given the minimum monthly payment for my personal student loan will be around $177-200 and that I am not sure what the minimum for the PP loan after refinancing will be around but I am guessing it‚Äôll be similar.

My current game plan is what the wiki mentions with the ‚Äúavalanche‚Äù method - paying the minimum towards the lower interest rate loan and paying the remainder of the $1,000 a month towards the higher interest rate loan. After around 2 years, I‚Äôll have the higher interest rate paid off and can shift the full $1,000 towards the second loan. In addition, I will try to put annual bonuses towards this effort when I can. However, I am in my first year of work and don‚Äôt have a clear picture of when/how much that‚Äôll look like. 

Thanks for any suggestions.

On a side note, the wiki mentions ‚Äúloans held in the parent(s) name and cannot be transferred to the student under any circumstances‚Äù. I am not sure whether if this is also referring to the option of using a private provider like SoFi because it‚Äôs technically not transferring, just a private provider paying off the PP loan and then me taking it on as a private loan.",finance

personalfinance,Home buying vs interesting,"I live in California and have saved for years for my down payment for a home. My issue is that home costs are outrageous and my rent is extremely cheap, currently about 1k under market value.  When I do the Zillow rent vs buy calculator it says buying will never be cheaper than renting.  

The money is sitting in a savings account which wasn‚Äôt a big deal when it was generating a decent interest rate, but now it‚Äôs not. The amount I saved is substantial since I would probably buy a million dollar home. I have a 20 percent down payment saved as well a large reserve. 

I was debating on investing the money, but if for some reason the landlord decided to dramatically increase the rent or sell my place then it would be in my best interest to buy. So would investing that money be smart if that were to happen during a down market?

My other thought was to leave the down payment in savings and lean towards 95-100 percent stock investments, since bonds aren‚Äôt really producing good returns right now. The cash in savings would replace the bonds I usually invest in.

investing,What is your strategy for the coming rising interest rate environment?,"I am a fairly new investor, I began in 2017. It has obviously been a stellar few years, did covid even happen?

I have a close relationship with an old professor of mine (he has a doctorate in finance and has amassed serious wealth) who teaches investments at the college level, we often chat. He was a derivatives trader for 20 years back in the 80s and 90s.

He swears and insists that when rates begin to rise the market is going to absolutely eat shit, and most if not all valuations will drop. He says that the market has been hooked on the feds liquidity since ‚Äò08 and the withdrawals will be severe. He has been slowly divesting the past few months.

I see where he is coming from, and he is obviously much wiser than me. In class he would always preach about if a stock falls 50% you need 100% gain to make your money back, therefore avoiding downside is much better than missing a little upside, which I also agree with.

What I am not so sure of is that rising rates will spell doom for the markets. The most I could see is maybe slowed growth? But if rates steadily climb to around 4% on the 10 year that would actually be GOOD For the economy.

Thoughts on this? Inb4 ‚Äúlong term time horizon I never sell‚Äù

Edit: following up due to traction. This guys worst year was 2000 where he made -2%, which still massively outperformed the market. I understand the never sell mentality, but look at the facts: rates are at rock bottom, QE is off the charts. There is literally only ONE direction the fed can go. I predict rates will begin to rise (slowly) at some point next year. If you had a chance to miss massive downside, would you take it? Can you use logic to make prudent investment decisions or are you locked into never mitigating risk? I am actually beginning to consider slowly exiting.

PS: I still have no idea why we use tether btw as it has crazy swings and cost a lot. USDC seem a much better option.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Closing Costs, lender credit, and refinance pros/cons?","Hi all, 

I am looking for some perspectives on an option for financing our home. We are in contract for a new home build that will (hopefully) be completed in December. The purchase prices is just over $1m, and closing costs look like they will be between $23-25k ($14k is city/county transfer tax). The plan has been to put down 20% to avoid PMI and pay the closing costs up front with an interest rate of 2.875%, however, in discussing our options our lender mentioned another potential option where we take a higher rate (3.375%) and the lender will pay the closing costs. We would then refinance to a lower rate. My lender stated refi rates tend to be .125% higher than that on newly originated loans, but closing costs tend to be significantly lower. If we were to get a loan at 3% once we refinanced then the difference between that and the 2.875% rate for a new loan pencils out to about $50 a month, which seems worth it given the potential massive savings on closing costs. The obvious risk here would be an increase in interest rate. That isn't insignificant, but rates have been fairly steady for the past 6 months and I don't see any obvious indication of a major climb upcoming. Has anyone taken this approach before? I'm always skeptical of deals that seem this obviously beneficial, but don't want to let that skepticism keep me from a good deal. Would love to hear the case against this or anything to look out for. Thank you for the input!",finance
energy,Universal Nuclear Industrial Estates,"This is a post just outlining a few ideas in relation to where nuclear energy can really be theoretically of most use to a typical modern developed country.

Firstly, I envisage that due to low cost of renewables (when available) nuclear power from next gen reactor systems is better used for industrial cogeneration - heat and electrical requirements, and supporting themo-chemical processes, and integrated with TES and load shedding *as a peaking rather than base load system* to take advantage of, and support the expansion of, renewable electricity as a high percentage of generation on the grid.

It will actively assist grid stability by load shedding and using peaking power plants with thermal energy storage, and at the same time using variable production capacity, industrial processes can use more renewable electricity when it is cheapest and in surplus, thereby raising revenue to renewable producers.

So nuclear power where more of the energy is used, in a way that is integrated into industrial processes and TES to support the grid as a peaking system to respond to fluctuations in grid stress.

Industrial processes are neglected and it makes little sense for developed economies to off-shore industry to countries that have not even committed to CO2 reduction.

And its not only about energy, its about increasing recycling and reducing waste and pollution, which requires energy and more vertically integrated industries. Taken together, this approach may be thought of as a Nuclear Renewable Green economy, or NRG economy.

What I am also suggesting is that developed countries share common industrial, material and energy needs because consumers around the world have very similar material and energy needs, and so do economies, and that co-gen nuclear power (produces both electricity and heat, at various grades, for a multitude of industrial applications) could be integrated into a common group of industrial requirements that may be designed to a standardised blueprint that can be used in each country, to support a variety of the needs we all share in each economy. In this way standardised industrial parks built around energy systems makes sense. For example, recycling of plastic, glass and metal wastes, processing and production of raw materials, in refining metals from ores, in synthetic fuel and plastic hydrocarbon production (for example via nuclear powered hydrogen production, with atmospheric or process waste CO2 capture), ammonia fertiliser production, and in each of these modular park designs waste heat would also be used to heat at the periphery high value intensive agricultural greenhouses and photo-bioreactors to reduce food miles and provide nutritious foods from greenhouses that reduce the land area required.

*Just as federations of nations have cooperated on such activities as building weapon systems (Eurofighter, JSF), this would involve a multinational consortia that brings together all the big technology players to design and implement a more or less universal design of Industrial Estate. Lets call this UNIE (Universal Nuclear Industrial Estates).*

I would advocate two nuclear systems that would be used, a medium grade thermal heat source and a high grade heat source (above 700 degrees C), which may operate serially or independently in parallel.

The medium grade heat source (say 500 degrees C) would be used by some industries but primarily for powering a turbine such as the CO2 Supercritical Turbine, which should be available on the timescale of the nuclear reactor development, which provide electricity at high efficiency (around 45%), and the waste heat from this can be used in some applications like food processing, paper production, and in intensive agriculture. It can also support CO2 capture from regenerative adsorbents which need around 100 degrees C, comparable to the temperature in district heating systems. Or more conventionally, a steam turbine. Steam is also useful to transfer heat in an industrial district heating system which would likely be used, at various temperatures to support a variety of industrial applications.

The two heat sources would be of modular reactor designs, such as -  [GIF Portal - Home - Generation IV Systems (gen-4.org)](https://www.gen-4.org/gif/jcms/c_59461/generation-iv-systems)

In addition, a Thermal Energy Store (TES) would be deployed with this along with, in the case of CO2 Supercritical Turbines, a deliberately installed overcapacity. Each UNIE would be designed so that at times of grid stress, it can not only supply its own electricity, sparing the grid, but sell it at peak demand periods when the electricity is most valuable. Some industrial partners may agree to shed load also if it is profitable, and building a slight overcapacity in industrial plant makes it easier to take energy from the grid when in excess and cheap, and to shed it at other times. Having process overcapacity is not a bug but a feature of the UNIE design. This allows for higher renewable levels on the grid. For example if a high temperature reactor was to supply heat for a TES system, this was rated at 2.2GWh thermal, using molten salt or aluminium as a heat storage medium would require in the order of 10,000 Tons of this material (more if using cheaper materials), and run through a supercritical turbine via a heat exchange medium this would yield around 1GWh electricity, which assuming in the US a premium value at periods of peak demand of $0.15 / kWh, at peak times each day and $0.10 of that was profit, then the UNIE would make $100,000 each day for cycling it just once. It might be able to do that more than once, and in addition gain some kind of payment for load shedding.

Reactors would be be small to medium sized for the most part and modular.

Waste heat from industrial processes would be channeled into other processes requiring lower temperature heat, or recovered to provide electricity at a lower efficiency, but in the case of CO2 Supercritical Turbines what is interesting about them, apart from extremely high power density is that they have higher efficiency at considerably lower temperature that comparable Rankine or Brayton turbines, so they can make use of some process waste energy.

Vertical integration of various industrial process waste chemicals should also be considered to reduce waste and pollution.

I envisage for example that waste plastic recycling might involve gasification and the need to convert to these products into standard plastic feedstocks, upgraded with hydrogen or carbon monoxide which may be nuclear-thermally of electrolytically generated. There have been prototypes of waste processing systems that use supercritical water to degrade all plastics, biomass, food, forestry, agricultural and garden waste and sewage, these create solid carbon, liquid hydrocarbons and gaseous hydrocarbons,mainly methane, this can all be processed with H2 to make any hydrocarbons you want including common ingredients for a range of plastics. This process requires heat at the temperatures a nuclear reactor will readily operate at (&lt;500 degrees C).

Since hydrocarbons are a key building block of our industrial economy and there are many material uses of these, a UNIE could be envisaged that supplies standard chemicals like H2, CO, carbon black and CO2 (from atmospheric capture and electrolysis, recycle it from waste by other plants at the site) for local industrial needs as well as process heat and electricity. Nuclear generated chemicals could also be stored, so that when power needs exporting, such energy needs can be shed to support the grid without necessarily affecting industrial consumers at the park.

So the nuclear power plant would supply the key ingredients for our industrial economy, efficient nearly lossless recycling of materials, which would be blended into these chemical feedstocks, and integrate with the fluctuating demand / supply profile of a renewable intensive electrical grid, whilst supporting intensive greenhouse agriculture at the periphery for local food. District heating systems could be incorporated to heat housing estates for local workers nearby from waste heat.

Hydrogen

In seasonally fluctuating grids excess renewables may be turned into hydrogen via electrolysis. I have described how over-capacity in industrial processes can make use of some excess energy, but hydrogen storage is also a possibility. I do not consider hydrogen as attractive for storage of electrical energy, as the round trip efficiency is not great with hydrogen fuel cells. 

I also consider that distribution infrastructure costs can be avoided by using the hydrogen in industrial processes where it is made, generating it via the electrical grid, and that in this application all the hydrogen is used. 

Storage of hydrogen is possible in metal hydrides. The most promising is MgH2, but it needs a high temperature to release the hydrogen, although this has been lowered by making MgH2 into nanoparticles  [Realizing 6.7 wt% reversible storage of hydrogen at ambient temperature with non-confined ultrafine magnesium hydrides - Energy &amp; Environmental Science (RSC Publishing)](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2021/ee/d0ee03160g) 

As either solution still needs heat, it makes sense to store hydrogen near industrial processes with distributed heat transfer systems to make use of waste heat.

Reversible endothermic and exothermic reactions make sense in an integrated industrial chemical systems where the heat can be used efficiently and exchanged. 1kg of MgH2 carries 2.23 kWh (at 6.7% H2 by weight), so 1 ton is 2.23 MWh, and 1000 tons is 2.23 GWh equivalent of hydrogen stored. Hydrogen used for chemical purposes is much more efficient than used to generate electricity.

Advantages -

Nearly 100% of nuclear energy is used - for both electricity, thermo-chemical &amp; thermal process needs in various processes, and then to agriculture and district heating and CO2 capture. Tri-gen.

Load shedding with thermal energy storage and chemical storage (such as electrolysis hydrogen in metal hydrides, carbon monoxides as formic acid) and using thermal storage provides peaking supply of power for the grid, which supports a higher fraction of low cost renewables on the grid

Overcapacity is installed in key energy consuming parts of industrial processes, so industrial users can take advantage of low-cost renewable electricity, and at such times divert nuclear thermal output from electrical power generation to industrial thermal and thermo-chemical process requirements

Optimisation of parks to use chemical and material byproducts of each industrial user at the park, reducing wastes, and optimised to recycle the quantities of typical waste streams of developed economies to the relevant industrial grades and meet the material and chemical needs of the same developed economies, to reduce the need for raw materials, with very little waste, and reduce the distance travelled of various materials used domestically.

Recycle building wastes using new methods, maybe possible with nuclear power or nuclear powered chemical products (such as  [Sika Achieves Breakthrough in Concrete Recycling by Developing a Ground-Breaking New Process](https://www.sika.com/en/media/media-releases/2021/sika-achieves-breakthrough-in-concrete-recycling.html) )

Modular nuclear reactors, components and district heating systems, including very high temperature heat transfer systems, allows for a variety of industrial users to collocate at these sites. Meets some or all of the thermal energy requirements of most industrial and chemical industries that would locate at these UNIE

Associated with these modular power sources, would be thermo-chemical and electro-chemical processes for creating of industrial chemicals like hydrogen, carbon monoxide and upgrading wastes such as plastics

Synfuels, thermo-chemically and electro-chemically synthesised using hydrogen, waste and atmospheric CO2 and biomass, thermally nuclear powered

Maximises value of products, such as high value agricultural products at the periphery of the site, sells electricity at peak times (rather than when it is least valuable like most base-load nuclear, which makes it uneconomic), gains value out of waste streams, brings relevant waste together for remanufacture

Each UNIE would typically be sited at ports and have rail terminals, since rail is the most efficient way to move materials around the economy. Rail terminals also bring in waste for recycling.

Major industrial players like Seimens, Dupont, Cryogenic Gas producers (like BOC), Metal producers, Rolls Royce, Lafarge and cement manufacturers, refinery specialists and oil companies (who want to transition) nuclear reactor developers and so forth would be asked to work together to create this. It is intended to be approximately able to meet the needs of the average economy, and modular enough to adapt to unique requirements. For example, a standard UNIE might support 1 to 3 million typical consumers.

Ideally the reactor types would be thorium, but stepping stones may be taken.

I don't believe any country has the expertise to do this all itself, except China and maybe India in the near future. We should be collaborating towards this kind of technology that solves several problems in an integrated and very energy and material efficient way.",energy
CryptoCurrency,Tether Fined $41M over 'Misleading Statements',"[Tether Fined $41M over 'Misleading Statements' | Alexandria (coinmarketcap.com)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/tether-fined-41m-over-misleading-statements) 

 Tether has been fined $41 million for making ‚Äúuntrue or misleading statements‚Äù concerning its stablecoin.

According to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, USDT was not fully backed by U.S. dollars across a period from June 2016 to June 2019.

Tether is a stablecoin that‚Äôs designed to be worth $1 ‚Äî and at the time, the issuer said every USDT in circulation had ‚Äúthe equivalent amount of corresponding fiat currency‚Äù that was ‚Äúsafely deposited in its accounts.‚Äù

The CFTC alleges that the company failed to disclose that unsecured receivables and other non-fiat assets were in these reserves ‚Äî and falsely claimed that routine, professional audits were going to take place.

Data from the regulator suggests that Tether only had sufficient fiat reserves to back USDT for just 27.6% of the time over a period spanning 26 months.

The CFTC‚Äôs acting chairman, Rostin Behnam, said:

**‚ÄúThis case highlights the expectation of honesty and transparency in the rapidly growing and developing digital assets marketplace. The CFTC will continue to take decisive action to bring to light untrue or misleading statements that impact CFTC jurisdictional markets.‚Äù**¬†

## Tether Under Scrutiny

Although the fine won‚Äôt reflect well on Tether, it could be argued that it amounts to a slap on the wrist given that more than 69 billion USDT are currently in circulation.

Despite the CFTC‚Äôs case focusing on the period between 2016 and 2019, questions surrounding the funds that Tether holds in reserve have not gone away.

Earlier this month, Bloomberg Businessweek released a scathing report that asked the question: ‚ÄúTether is supposed to be backed by real U.S. dollars. So where‚Äôs the money?‚Äù¬†

Zeke Faux‚Äôs report went on to claim that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen summoned the heads of the SEC and the Federal Reserve to discuss Tether, amid fears it had ‚Äúgotten so large that it threatened to put the U.S. financial system at risk.‚Äù¬†

Tether reacted furiously to the in-depth feature and claimed that it was based on ‚Äúinnuendo and misinformation.‚Äù",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,First bitcoin futures ETF rises more than 4% in trading debut on the NYSE,"Shares of the first U.S. bitcoin-linked exchange-traded fund rose in their trading debut Tuesday.

The [ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BITO), ticker ‚ÄúBITO,‚Äù jumped 4.8% to close at $41.94. The fund tracks CME bitcoin futures, or contracts speculating on the future price of bitcoin, rather than the crypto itself.

That means investors in the ETF should expect the price and performance of the shares to differ somewhat from the price of bitcoin itself. This isn‚Äôt ideal for existing investors; many of them take a long view on cryptocurrencies and had hoped for an ETF that would track physical bitcoin that investors could buy and hold.

The price of [bitcoin](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BTC.CM=) jumped more than 4% Tuesday to $64,206.51, according to Coin Metrics, about 1% from its all-time high from April 14 of $64,899. Bitcoin futures gained about 4% as well.

The launch highlights the remarkable growth of the ETF industry, Will Hershey, CEO of Roundhill Investments, told CNBC.

‚ÄúTrading volumes are exceptional,‚Äù Hershey said of BITO‚Äôs day one trading activity. ‚ÄúBITO has traded in excess of $700 million notional. That puts its first day well ahead of retail ETF favorites like BUZZ and ARKX when compared to their respective launch days earlier this year.‚Äù

He noted that when the SPDR S&amp;P 500¬†ETF debuted in 1993 it traded about $40 million on its first day. By the end of the trading session BITO had traded about $984 million in volume.

ProShares is the eighth-biggest ETF provider by assets, according to ETDB.com. The firm is known for its funds that use leverage to track moves in certain indexes multiplied by a certain amount. ProShares executives rang the opening bell at the NYSE, where the ETF trades. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.95%.

The crypto industry has been longing for a bitcoin-related ETF for many years. In about 2017, asset managers began applying to launch spot bitcoin ETFs but their proposals were rejected by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which maintained none were able to prove market resistance to manipulation. The rush of applications for futures-based ETFs came this year shortly after Chairman Gary Gensler took the helm of the agency.

‚ÄúWhat you have here is a product that‚Äôs been overseen for four years by the U.S. federal regulator CFTC, and that‚Äôs being wrapped inside of something within our jurisdiction called the Investment Company Act of 1940, so we have some ability to bring it inside of investor protection,‚Äù Gensler said of the new ETF on CNBC‚Äôs ‚Äú[Squawk on the Street](https://www.cnbc.com/nail-the-number-squawk-on-the-street/)‚Äù on Tuesday. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still a highly speculative asset class and listeners should understand that underneath this, it still has that same aspect of volatility and speculation.‚Äù

Some argue the impact of an ETF, particularly one tied to futures contracts, is lessened by adoption of crypto by companies and fintechs. Investors have many ways to get indirect exposure to bitcoin without actually owning it, through institutional-grade funds, financial apps like PayPal and Square‚Äôs CashApp, or crypto-related equities like Coinbase and mining stocks.

‚ÄúThe launch of the first bitcoin-linked ETF in the U.S. will bolster the broader crypto market and help an entirely new investor class experience the benefits of bitcoin as a legitimate asset,‚Äù said Anthony Bertolino, VP of growth at iTrustCapital. ‚ÄúHowever, a derivatives-based bitcoin ETF is not where we want to be long-term. One of the most attractive aspects of bitcoin is that it‚Äôs a bearer asset with a highly liquid 24/7 spot market. Investors will almost certainly come to desire a spot based, physically backed bitcoin ETF and 10 years from now, I would even expect some of the bitcoin ETFs to allow physical redemption for those that want it.‚Äù",cryptocurrency

dogecoin,The Doge crew maintains a resistance latter whose purpose isn't just to stabilize doge but to give it TEETH. This made it simple to track the looting. So what's going on?,"Yesterday the day before yesterday's rally we gathered as many as was available to help watch and then did a quick attack on btc to warn everyone what was actually happening and what would follow. That's why the posts were targeted and weren't meant to make sense, we just needed to reach out to those who were already aware.

Agter the warning it immediately began its routine.

All we did was a quick attack on btc to show the mechanics of what would happen:

http://imgur.com/gallery/8p0Y5qM

When you force btc down you end up fast forwarding time, the routine to loot from doge was already set so all we did was force it to show itself. There's no way it could have been natural because we were the only ones who knew when we'd attack btc and what would happen and the reaction was as instant as it was predetermined. So like only 5 minutes after the warning post the bots did what they always do.

Read the bottom caption. It describes the mechanics of what caused this.

http://imgur.com/a/1jKunSt


I stopped posting for a while and have just been lurking but then learned about the planned supposed ""doge rally"" so figured it was a good opportunity to to start up live demos again. It doesn't happen very often so you use whatever you get when you can. 

Last time we covered this same exact thing was back in September when we tried to push btc down into a death cross and it reacted extremely aggressively and the same exact routine was triggered. 

http://imgur.com/a/aAHuqif

The chance to achieve a death cross is always worthwhile because it forces them into a catch 22. They have to either let the graph ""predict the future"" as the expectancy effect plays out, and they have to let btc crash, but obviously they wouldn't be willing to do that. This is the game of chicken we refer to, since we don't have anything to lose compared to them and all the world to gain and the future we all want if we win. 


The technique of flooring something below where they'd want it is the same technique used here when we crashed etc since at the time etc was the closest correlation which was verified by coinbase. Btc dominance is both a nonsense cover story that's just repeated until it seems legit, when it's just systematic looting and economic warfare. So forcing etc down and holding it at a floor they wouldnt be willing to drag doge down to forced them to react just as aggressively:

http://imgur.com/a/sP7VSLZ

My first intro post was a planned 15 to 20 percent dip I warned about the same night it would happen relying on people being skeptical to such a tall claim to do a follow up post where I'd cover how the manipulation works and now to recognize it in real time.

After the exodus a ton of my posts got shadow deleted so I screen shot the etc one since I can still see everything, that's what makes shadow banning and block listing effective. You don't know it's happening and most people would begin to presume people just magically lost interest when we used to have a growing crew openly tracking and running live demos right here, then we resorted to discord and other channels and would coordinate with /r/dogecoin since it was a useful platform to broadcast a message to a leaderless p2p movement.

The looting isn't just from other cryptos to maintain the illusion that btc is the best one because ""look, number is big."" Courtesy of the same psychological trick the big G employed when they set the trend to never split their stock since you know, the big g is a typo of the highest named number. Their MO is always the same. They love their puns from the Nexus being used as a dev kit after xda was taken over to crowd source aosp development I. E. A nexus is a unification gateway, while also crowd sourcing the open hand alliance, to the pixel offering unlimited photo uploads as a feature, because you know, the more pixels the clearer the picture as each upload fed image data to refine their image processing engine: something you'd need a ton of standardized cameras and a multitude of people feeding data through those cameras

The btc bots don't descriminate, the big 3 meme stonks are equally looted from as well:

http://imgur.com/a/3tdS9JN

Corporations are the new banks and ceos are paid in stock so they can spend the hype of their own evaluation, then report something ""bad"" and buy it back for cheaper.

You can literally see the flow being rerouted. When companies are taken over by BTC bots it effectively bribes them while at the same time holding them hostage like they are currently doing to Musk via Tesla. What if your company randomly shot up 1000 percent and you know it was all just bots? Would you blow the whistle? Where, YT? So everyone just plays the game which also keeps things civil.

Their MO has always been to gain control of everything they can monopolize; engage in astro turfing or taking over internet communities to crowd source and create front runners to hide behind; the manipulation of perceived value via number gaming, meme stocks are basically the trending section of YT which replaced the most popular sections after acquisition its acquisition. They own search rankings for print and video info and control the numbers.

These tracks are all bots designed to allow them to collapse the price. 

http://imgur.com/a/WX0c94W

Which ends up looking like this:

http://imgur.com/IK3v8Sq

That picture is really old and was the first clue what doge was and why it was so important. It was the most liquid of all the cryptos which is why stabilizing it and creating a resistance latter was helpful.

The bottom two pictures are sequential, you can plainly see the bot spam vanish from the left column to the right after its finished its looting of MP, the most crucial source or REEs on the planet right now, and the only one on the western hemisphere.

The bots run on an android core can split into as many instances as they need courtesy of the equifax hack that stole 140 million American IDs SS# and all. 

So when the big G spored off AlphaBet, clever pun for ace gamble and the play on what's next to be monopolized, letters like GME etc it needed chips to gamble with. In the typical crowd source, copy, aquire, monopolize while hiding behind fronts routine, the work of Satoshi was copied twice, one slow enough to work as a computing platform while crowd sourcing people then another copy openly made by people working for the big G that'd be fast enough for day to day transactions. Both were oddly unnecessarily dusty but that's the bit part of bit coin, the decimals allow the dust itself to be used as a whole ascii set and to be interoperable with any software. And all the ""work"" solving those puzzles isn't just to make btc so slow as to be useless as an actual currency and literally a threat on our power grids while attacking sources of the very things you'd need to electrify or even maintain nevermind advance electronics REEs like Myanmar cutting off China if it's last reserves, and MP crippling our own ability to spark another Wakandan style electronics revolution.

[BTC is Turing complete, it's only not considered so for trivial reasons that happen to be exactly what you'd want an AI to piggy back off of, I e. It doesn't end and loops just die while the redundancy prevents crashing / halting to continue to sprawl with the majority already monopolized, a max cap and painfully slow overhead to keep it under control and to prevent it from splitting I. E. Deliberate or accidental 51% attacks.]

BTC is destined to fail. The question is how much harm will it cause before it reaches its predefined max cap? And BTW what currency has ever needed a max cap? The only things that have ever used artificial scarcity to control value are cartels like de beers, opec, etc. And what currency has ever needed to be effectively infinitely divisible? This trick is meant to be another play on the perception of scarcity since there is nothing scarce about fighting over carbon dust in hopes you can someday have a diamond. As it reaches its cap its only going to get more hostile and hunger gamesy as it has all the btc maxis competing all the while they work to further enrich those who created the game and what groups have put all their resources into processing power over innovation?

Those peaks are only peaks because they are constantly looted, diverted into btc. 

In the past we've tried several things, suppressing it to flush out the bots, and tighten it up against true demand worked well and it steadily rose but that wasn't something that was sustainable. If we pump it you know what will happen.

I love it. Those glitched out graphs are because crypto is so rapid that there's really no reliable way to determine which points to sample and so it'll typically just smoothen it by shifting the granularity which is kinda like sampling rates or frame rates. 

If you had the raw data down to the microsecond it'd look like white noise until you zoomed out enough. Connecting the dots in white noise is not very scientific and graphs aren't proofs of anything, they can only work as maps for comparison. They're more of the used for the expectancy effect aspect which everyone kinda plays along with where I think most of us know everyone is just messing with the x and y axis and choosing what section to emphasize to present anything you want.

AlphaBet plays on overwhelming people with letters while playing off of fud and fomo using a cross between poker ai and the same thing that determines search ranking your YT auto Q. Knowing you're playing a game in itself helps you because nothing about this is random.

Pacman Champs know that the ghosts are not randomly chasing pac man, they operate under 4 different rule sets while just moving toward or away. They juke the stick to control all 4 ghosts while slowly manipulating pac man to a power pellet then eat all 4. 

The illusion of AI is that its really powerful and will be Einstein in 10 years or whatever as of Einstein is somehow the smartest person on the world. Ai has been around for longer than I've existed lol. It sure ain't Einstein. And we are still pac man. If you want to learn to play dm me. We're considering starting up more discords. The plan was to not do it twice since obviously it'd be way more infiltrated and we only rely on trust, faith that most people are inherently as benevolent as they will involuntarily smile when shown a happy dog--a complete selfless act in itself, to be happy just because something else is happy is all the proof I need to know the majority of people are good and that majority is what gives us the edge and what allowed the tag 1√ò√ò√òx1&lt;1x1√ò√ò√ò that I'd always drop as a clue to eventually lead to this:

Which was the first time we proved we had the critical mass needed to win. The hardest part is that we as a rule are decentralized with no hierarchy, only a multitude from every walk of life with various skill sets. It's also our strength since we are everywhere and everyone while being no one in particular. We do work for various fields which gives us access to everything. The illusion of power is the most powerful illusion and if the people only knew how much power they had right now we'd take back the world. But first we have to stop letting them divide us.

The hardest people to awaken are the ""enlightened centrist"" types in my experience since it's expressed as radical nihilism. But the entire point of convincing people they have no power is to disempower them which neutralizes their effect anyway. Even straight up neo Nazis once shown how chances are they are descendants of those who rejected segregation and were punished for it and how just as the celts are trying to revive their culture after hundreds of years of genocide, guess why the shamrock is being conflated with the swastika and who really thought that was a good idea?

**TLDR**:

Understanding the two terms of APR  
 and APY  
 becomes even more important in DeFi today, as nearly all protocols with yield farming fields display these numbers. Knowing them well is not only for understanding and executing different strategies and calculating real profits.

General Conclusion

APR and APY are used in many yield farming programs in DeFi protocols. However, they are not the same thing! We, the participants in the market, are not only investing but actively receiving yields by farming and staking DeFi tokens. So these basic terms are not only important, but they are also information that helps you to invest more effectively.

Both are related to returns. But how are they different? Why are they not interchangeable? We discuss that in today's newsletter.

# Definition

APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It is the actual annual rate of return, **NOT** taking into account the effect of compound interest.

APY stands for Annual Percentage Yield. It is the actual annual rate of return, taking into account the effect of compound interest.

Who uses what? APY is better to calculate your returns on investment while APR is more common in lending.

&gt;Quick math: which do you think is higher? APY, the one that considers compounding.

# What Are They Different?

## APR

For example, a yield farming program offers an APR  
 of 100%/yr. You use $1000 to join this program. One year later you will receive $2,000, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1000 is APR  
.

Once you see the APR, it is possible to immediately calculate how much profit will be earned at the end of the period. This profit comes from your staking or farming, so just join at the beginning to get the result for APR interest.

### Formular

APR = r x N

Where:

r: The interest rate of the year;

N: Interest period (N = 1, means 1 year).

## APY

APY is another way of calculating the percentage of real profit you will receive.

&gt;What will you get if you receive profit every day from staking and you will add that to your principle and earn interest on that **every day**?

If you have an APR  
 of 100%/yr with getting daily profit, you have to divide APR  
 by 365 days to calculate the interest received daily (0.27%). Then reinvest this interest continuously every day. The amount you get is $2,714.57, where $1000 is the initial capital and $1714.57 is APY  
.

Assuming you participate in farming pairs on Solana's Raydium application, I also combine Step Finance to know the APR  
 and APY  
 of these farming pairs. Typically, I am staking $RAY on Raydium (current project APR is 35.33%), with $1,000 you farm at the beginning of the year to the end of the year, the total income will be $1,423.51.

### Formular

APY = (1+r)\^n - 1

In which:

r: The interest rate of the period;

n: Interest period (n=1 means 1 day).

# Awareness

As such, today's projects often offer 2 ratios of APR and APY to show users what the rate of return is currently available. However, some projects that give daily, 7-day interest rings directly provide APY. This has two implications:

* First, displaying APY  
 will produce a larger percentage than APR  
, making brave people feel that they will receive more profit.
* Secondly, the APY  
 interest is only true if the user reinvests (restake, refarm) continuously in the allowed period (e.g. when receiving rewards, immediately stake).

Today we see a lot of aggregator protocols already using this ability to increase profits, continuously reinvesting within the capacity of the original protocols. This is really good if the transaction costs are not significant. Hopefully, we can find those solutions in Layer 2.",cryptocurrency

algorand,Where is the Boston Fed CDBC paper?,"The Boston Fed CBDC document was supposed to have come out in June, then pushed to July, then late summer, then early October, and now late fall. The whole purpose of the paper is to document the findings and submit their solutions for a CBDC. Why is the FED paper being delayed? Perhaps it is due to infighting and pushback. The former and disgraced Boston Fed Chair Eric Rosengren stated a blockchain would not be part of the FED plans. (How can you have a CBDC without a blockchain to ensure security and throughput?)

personalfinance,"""Free Money"" and following flow chart","Hi everyone. I'm trying to figure something out re: the flowchart. It says that moderately high interest rates 5ish(?)% should be paid down before targeted savings.

I have a house project that my wife and I have been saving for. We have the money liquid in a low interest savings and have enough to pay for the project in cash. Through some financing platforms, I found that I could borrow money relatively cheap (high 4s%). If I move that money into a low expense rated index mutual fund, wouldn't I be better off financing at least part of the project?

I am super risk averse so I would set up a timing mechanism ($x per week) to move the money in and avoid timing volatility. 

The 2nd part of this question is, if the above is a good assumption, would it make sense to just fund a backdoor IRA instead of a general investment account?  I max out my 401k, and we would presumably have other projects to save up for, but of money is cheap, not sure what the benefit of having a general investment fund over a mega backdoor IRA is.

Thanks in advance for your input.",finance
CryptoCurrency,Differentiate crypto based problems and external factors,"I decided to make this post as most new people on the sub and some long timers still can't separat what is a problem within crypto and one that is external 

The best examples would be 

Internal: Scalability, Security and  Decentralization 

External: environmental concerns, governance and profitability 

Internal issues can be solved by just the code. These are the issues developers must focus on only! BTC has succeeded more than any other crypto project by simply focussing on these 3 issues. While it is slow and may be counter to ""normal"" thinking BTC's layer 2s such as Lightning are the only crypto technology now being utilized on an international and national level. Through Twitter and El Salvador. Liquid another layer 2  is being integrated slowly into equities markets 


BTC is doing this all as a Proof of Work (POW). Not Proof of Stake (POS). No marketing department. No ICO, no foundations with in perpetuity control.No lock up, no deflationary burn;  no smart contracts, no rewards for users....

This is because this asset, which is 50% of the market is once again addressing crypto issues not external ones. 

POS was initially implemented via Peercoin nearly 10 years ago. Both as a new governance mechanism and for environmental concerns. However no crypto code is going to stop global warming . This is an external issue for energy markets and governance in a truly free crypto market is decided by the market. Not the largest holders of the asset 

As a result all POS assests create a centralized point of failure by having ""governing councils"" e.g in DOT, SOL and unfortunately now more in ETH. This has been amplified by pre-mined assets to create ""community reserves"" that only guarantee the devs and Venture Capitalists in perpetuity control of the network. 

Lock ups and burns as well arn't designed to address core crypto issues but ""pumpermentals"". E.g HEX and various Safe coins. These just trap capital or artificially inflate prices by reducing supply without increasing utility or market share. This is central bank level monetary policy to strengthen an asset; in alleged decentralized crypto projects! 

There is only one major crypto project attempting a middle road and we are seeing the results in both price action and sentiment. ADA! 

Because ADA is both trying to play the base issues game while developing a monetary policy and product that attracts new investors. It's now stuck between a rock and a hard place. Hopefully Charles will hold out through the hate and insults. I saw posts and his video of people now screaming ADA needs deflationary burns 

ETH has completely gone on the external issues direction that I feel this may be its last bull run as #2. As the things that made it stick out and survive are being eroded to make it more similar to its market competitors.",cryptocurrency

I don‚Äôt know what the percentage of the population is that holds crypto but I‚Äôd guess it‚Äôs probably less than 5% of all technologically savvy countries. Now think a few years ahead when cryptocurrency will hopefully be normal to most and being used daily by up to 50% of the people in those countries even just for replacing banks for the better interest rates. 

What will your portfolio look like then? Will we laugh and joke about all those shitcoins we bought in the hope of mooning or reflect back on that one coin you bought $20 worth for a laugh and is now worth $200,000?

21. Only 5 more days to Alonzo (as of Sept. 7)!
22. Despite all the negative posting about Cardano smart contracts on eUTxO, it ironically looks like some in the ETH community are actually trying to build ETH L2 on UTXO. [https://twitter.com/matiwinnetou/status/1434570158853529606](https://twitter.com/matiwinnetou/status/1434570158853529606)

He also gives some hints as to his thoughts on the short-term planning of some ‚Äúflavor of the week‚Äù blockchains vs. the long term planning of Cardano. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhujKbMpTEA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhujKbMpTEA)
26. Weiss Crypto lays down yet another very positive thread about Cardano. They acknowledge that they can‚Äôt see the future of Cardano, but they vehemently reject a lot of the anti-hype.

27. Coinbase reveals they received a Wells Notice from the SEC on their crypto loan product. This is relevant for Cardano loan projects.

29. Messari has updated its ‚ÄúInitial Token Distribution‚Äù chart to include a previously missing project and Cardano is still among the very best in the Gen 3 space in terms of broad public coin ownership.

33. A Weiss Crypto analyst calls the smart contract launch an alleged event and also doesn‚Äôt realize we already have NFTS. The Cardano community was quick to correct the analyst. Weiss was then also quick to apologize. [https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436369016545857566](https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436369016545857566) [https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436402039085576193](https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436402039085576193)

36. One of Cardano‚Äôs biggest competitors is once again suffering network problems. This time it started out as just being characterized as (more) ‚Äúinstability‚Äù, then they started saying that something had caused the blockchain to ‚Äústart forking‚Äù. This followed their September 2 ‚Äúinstability‚Äù and ‚Äúperformance degradation‚Äù event. It‚Äôll be interesting to see how well their community tolerates this in the future if it‚Äôs happening with their planned slashing model in effect.

42. Now one of Cardano‚Äôs most highly visible critics is implying that the Cardano community has something in common with anti-vaxxers. Unfortunately for him, it was one of his pet blockchains that was down a few days ago while Cardano just kept healthily trucking right along. [https://twitter.com/spudiot1/status/1438402783040790532](https://twitter.com/spudiot1/status/1438402783040790532)

45. Smaug gives us a rundown of how many actual Plutus scripts (19)are running on mainnet vs. timelock scripts (21k) as of Sept 17 and explains simple definitions for both.

47. Now the TX and NJ state securities regulators are after Celsius for crypto loans (BlockFi already got this treatment). Cardano loan projects should probably take note.

48. After the Senate hearing on Tuesday September 14th, Gary Gensler (SEC Chairman) gave a quote to a crypto publication indicating that custodial lending and possibly even staking platforms might be considered securities.

[https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/117675/crypto-lending-staking-custody-gensler-sec](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/117675/crypto-lending-staking-custody-gensler-sec)

personalfinance,"Modern portfolio theory, working a problem and calculating the portfolio beta relative to the market as a whole.","Bob invests 150% of his money in an index fund that invests in shares on the stock exchange. The risk-free interest rate is 5% and all investors can borrow and lend unlimited amounts at this rate. The expected return on the market index is 15% with a standard deviation of 20%.


I calculated the expected return of the portfolio to be 20%, and the standard deviation of the portfolio to be 30%.

The problem asks for the portfolio beta relative to the market as a whole. 


I know that the portfolio beta is the weighted sum of the individual asset betas. 

The beta of the borrowed money is zero because there is no correlation between the asset and the portfolio. 

The beta of the other investment can be calculated fromm (correct me if I am wrong), 

contr_2/(var_p) = x_2 cov_(2,p)/(cov_p)^2 = x_2 beta_2

Calculating the contr_2

contr_2 = x2[x2 var2 + x1 var1] = x2[x2 var2 + 0] = 0.09

Thus

contr_2/(var_p) = 0.09/0.2^2 = 2.25

Which gives us beta2

beta2= 2.25/x2 = 2.25/1.5 = 1.5 


So the portfolio beta should be 

x1 beta1 + x2 beta2 = -0.5*0 + 1.5 * 1.5 = 2.25

--------------------------------

But in the solution, it is only written 

-0.5 *0 + 1.5 * 1 = 1.5

Also, I am confused by the part of the question 'in relation to the market as a whole'. 
I suspect this is the root of my problem. 

How do I calculate this more efficiently?",finance

Bitcoin,ANOTHER FROZEN PAXFUL ACCOUNT WITH OVER $65K IN FUNDS,"This post is meant to be:

1. An informative post

2. An attempt to get the attention of the PAXFUL admin whom can provide answers and a resolution. (NOT the generic AI BOT that they consider ""customer support"")
I DON'T NEED ANOTHER SUPPORT TICKET!!!!

Background on my account: I have been registered on PAXFUL for 3 years (but kept small amount of funds as I had another wallet).  I recently transferred more from my other account ( about 1.5 btc) in order to trade more frequently due to the current spike in Bitcoin.  I am FULLY verified (ID check, address check, phone number check, etc.).  I have over 200+ POSITIVE FEEDBACK as buyer and seller, and ZERO negative feedback.  I'm in the US, I don't sell gift cards, and I carefully screen whom I buy/sell with as I don't want to jeopardize my financial accounts.

Is anyone noticing the spike in FROZEN or RESTRICTED accounts on multiple platforms in general?!  Okay, I'm beyond livid and frustrated.  There seems to be NO end (going on 2 weeks) to how long my account will be frozen until.  After frantically researching ""PAXFUL FROZEN ACCOUNT"", it was 10000x worse than my worst case scenario üò≥üòì. As I read NUMEROUS reviews of those whose account had been frozen as mine and are still awaiting a resolution, UP TO 2 YEARS LATER!!!

 The notification that my account has been ""temporarily"" frozen implied that it was a security check to determine if I abided to the TERMS OF SERVICE (TOS). To those whom aren't familiar, there are 3 levels in which your account can be inaccessible: 

1. FROZEN ""temporarily can't buy/sell, can't withdraw funds"". (""Constitutes a warning... temporarily frozen due to ongoing account review""..) basically, NOTHING has been determined or discovered.

2. Suspended (restricted from using account)

3. Banned (permanently restricted, but can do a 1 time withdrawal of funds).

Yea, so being ""BANNED"" is more severe, but you can withdraw funds?!?!? I requested them to just BAN my account, to no avail.

Not only do the dreadful reviews from other victims in my position cause me to worry, but so does the statement they made in the email response:

""...We do not have an exact timeframe as to when the review will be completed. Nothing to worry about, you will be notified as soon as the review is done.""

And again in their ""TOS"":

""In the event that we suspend your account or access to your Wallet, we will remove the suspension as soon as possible once the reasons for the suspension no longer exist, however we are under no obligation to notify you as to when (if ever) such suspension will be removed"".

Like when? Tomorrow, next week, next YEAR, NEVER?!
  

First off, PAXFUL is not a financial institution.  They have specific rules that they need to abide to in order to market what they conduct/offer on their platform.  They have less regulations than a bank.  And what's SUPER MISLEADING is what is right on Paxful's GENERAL INFORMATION PAGE.  Below are a few inserts:

""We give the users complete control over their money. Along with our escrow system and our dedicated 24/7 customer support, Paxful is also extremely secure..""

""The peer-to-peer system of Paxful removes borders and limits. You can think of your Paxful account as your very own financial passport.""

""A lot of big problems in the world revolve around money, specifically earning it and transporting it. Sending money around the world is not fast or cheap in any way, but Paxful changed that.""

After much anxiety, sleepless nights, unpaid bills, etc.  I decided to contact those whom were in the same position and got their account unfrozen (mind you, there are only about 2-3 amongst 100's that I read). 

 Here are the recommended authorities to file a claim/submit complaint/submit review/ etc. (IF PAXFUL SUPPORT IS READING THIS, YOU CAN STILL STEP IN TO RESOLVE, BUT I'M NOT HOLDING MY BREATH SO I WILL PROCEED AND POST MY SUBMISSIONS)

CryptoCurrency,"That's not a knife, this is a recent Australian Senate Report, with recommendations for changes to Cryptocurrency Regulations and Policy","The Federal Parliament Senate Committee on Australia as a Technology and Financial Centre has released its final report on regulatory and policy recommendations for cryptocurrency, Defi, mining and CBDC.

##Found here:
https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Financial_Technology_and_Regulatory_Technology/AusTechFinCentre/Final_report

The first few pages are a quick read covering the recommendations and executive summary. Some would be very welcome moves especially no.6.

##The recommendations are:

**Recommendation 1**
6.16 The committee recommends that the Australian Government establish a market licensing regime for Digital Currency Exchanges, including capital adequacy, auditing and responsible person tests under the Treasury portfolio. 

**Recommendation 2**
6.22 The committee recommends that the Australian Government establish a custody or depository regime for digital assets with minimum standards under the Treasury portfolio. 

**Recommendation 3**
6.28 The committee recommends that the Australian Government, through Treasury and with input from other relevant regulators and experts, conduct a token mapping exercise to determine the best way to characterise the 
various types of digital asset tokens in Australia. 

**Recommendation 4**
6.36 The committee recommends that the Australian Government establish a new Decentralised Autonomous Organisation company structure.

**Recommendation 5**
6.41 The committee recommends that the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing regulations be clarified to ensure they are fit for purpose, do not undermine innovation and give consideration to the driver of the Financial Action Task Force 'travel rule'.

**Recommendation 6**
6.51 The committee recommends that the Capital Gains Tax (CGT) regime be amended so that digital asset transactions only create a CGT event when they genuinely result in a clearly definable capital gain or loss.

**Recommendation 7**
6.56 The committee recommends that the Australian Government amend relevant legislation so that businesses undertaking digital asset 'mining' and related activities in Australia receive a company tax discount of 10 per cent if 
they source their own renewable energy for these activities.

**Recommendation 8**
6.61 The committee recommends that the Treasury lead a policy review of the viability of a retail Central Bank Digital Currency in Australia.

**Recommendation 9**
6.72 The committee recommends that the Australian Government, through the Council of Financial Regulators, enact the recommendation from the 2019 ACCC inquiry into the supply of foreign currency conversion services in 
Australia that a scheme to address the due diligence requirements of banks be put in place, and that this occur by June 2022. 

**Recommendation 10**
6.76 The committee recommends that in order to increase certainty and transparency around de-banking, the Australian Government develop a clear process for businesses that have been de-banked. This should be anchored around the Australian Financial Complaints Authority which services licensed entities.

**Recommendation 11**
6.79 The committee recommends that, in accordance with the findings of Mr Scott Farrell's recent Payments system review, common access requirements for the New Payments Platform should be developed by the Reserve Bank of Australia, in order to reduce the reliance of payments 
businesses on the major banks for the provision of banking services.

**Recommendation 12**
6.84 The committee recommends that the Australian Government establish a Global Markets Incentive to replace the Offshore Banking Unit regime by the end of 2022.

CryptoCurrency,Money Is a Good Servant Only if You Are the True Master. Buy Bitcoin To Take the Power Over Your Life,"Money is something that most people fantasize about. If you pass ten people on the street and ask them what their goal in life is, probably eight to nine will tell you that their goal in life is to become rich.

So it's not surprising that the media is full of people who have had overnight successes that make them a lot of money.

This is a good way to sell because everyone dreams of knowing the magic formula to achieve such success. In this article, I am not going to try to reveal any magic formula, since I am convinced that there is none.

But I would like you to ask yourself what you would do with all that money. Do you think you would be able to use it as you wish at any time in your life?

The banking system imposes a lot of archaic constraints on you
Let me give you a simple example.

Your brother is stranded on the other side of the world. It's Saturday night, it's 6 pm. He calls you from Hong Kong while you are in Los Angeles. He needs $15K urgently. You have earned a lot of money by working hard. So you can help him.

He is your brother, and since the situation is urgent, you intend to send him this money.

Now you're in for a rude awakening. The first thing is that your bank is closed on weekends. The banking system does not work on weekends. You will have to wait until Monday at best to make your transfer to Hong Kong. You already lose almost 36 hours.

It is Monday. You want to make this transfer. The online interface of your bank does not allow you to do so, because the amount is too high. So you have to go to the branch. In the branch, you are told that given the amount, you must justify this money transfer with documents.

What is it? It's your hard-earned money, and you don't have the right to use it whenever you want?

The answer is no. Why not? Simply because it's not your money. It is money that belongs to you only if you comply with the rules of the current monetary and financial system. These arbitrary rules, most of which are against the interest of individuals.

The current system no longer meets the needs of today's world, and even less those of tomorrow's world
So you will waste several more hours, if not days, justifying this money transfer. The fact that your brother needs help on the other side of the world is not a sufficient reason. The bankers will want to know what he plans to do with the money there. If you refuse, you will be censured. That's a certainty.

Even if you accept, there is a good chance you will be censured. The banks don't like it when you raise so much money to send it out of the country. It does not suit them.

At best, you will be allowed to make the money transfer on the following Friday. You have already lost 6 days. Since an international bank transfer takes 4 to 5 days via the SWIFT interbank payment system, your brother will have the $15K he was urgently waiting for at best after 10 to 15 days.

You may think that I am exaggerating on purpose to reinforce my point. Unfortunately, thousands of people experience this type of situation every year.

In the current system, you are not in control of your money
This should give you pause. The money you thought was a means to do what you wanted in your life is not such a good servant when you are not its master.

In the current system, you are not the master of the fruits of your labor. You are at the mercy of private bankers who can censor you at any time and who will be intrusive when you want to use your funds for your purposes.

Governments can also censor you.

Finally, central bankers will hurt your money through monetary inflation. Indeed, central bankers spend their time printing fiat money out of thin air. This absolute power that has been given to them since the current system was established in August 1971 is hurting the wealth of the majority of the world's inhabitants, but they don't care.

It is necessary to continue to save the current system.

Bitcoin allows you to take back the power and act as you wish at any time
On your side, you need to look for a way out of this vicious cycle of widespread impoverishment. That's where Bitcoin comes in. Bitcoin gives power back to the users by offering them unique guarantees in a world as uncertain as ours.

A programmatic monetary policy that protects you from the arbitrariness of humans, as well as their natural inclination to corruption. A limited supply of 21 million units no matter what. No leader can censor you. The fruits of your labor in the Bitcoin network are truly yours.

You can use it however you want at any time. You are in control.

Best of all, Bitcoin works all the time. So you can respond to your brother's request on Saturday at 6 pm. In a few minutes, he'll have the amount of money he asked for. You will be able to help him in the difficult time he seemed to be going through.

This is something that the current system cannot allow you to do.

With Bitcoin, you will finally be able to enjoy your hard-earned money, because you will be the real owner. Money will be just a means to an end for you, and a true servant that you will put to use in your life.

You will then be able to live your life on your terms.

I was originally going to put 5% down on the $265k sale price to get a \~3% ish interest rate 30 year mortgage, but now (after our first closing date has passed), the lender says I may not qualify for a Fannie Mae/Freedie Mac loan and that I may have to get a non-qualified mortgage.

She is going to draw up some plans and talk to her contractor so we can get a range of costs and options.

I haven't talked to my husband yet. I want have all my information before I do, he hasn't ever bought a house or really ever had to do much with interest rates/mortgages/loans and I think he gets a little overwhelmed.

personalfinance,"Saving for Downpayment 50% ETFs, 50% HYSA?","Hello,

Looking to buy a home in the next 1-3 years. With interest rates rising over the next few years, the market being at or near ATM, and inflation being high for who knows how long, would it be wise to have 50% of my down payment fund in a HYSA and the other 50% in an index fund such as VTI? 

If I put all my savings in a savings account inflation will eat at it a bit, and if I put all my down payment savings in an ETF, market volatility could significantly negatively affect it when I need to use it. However, I feel like a good balance might be 50% in savings and 50% in an ETF in my taxable account, that way if there is a draw down in the market it wont impact my timeline as much as if my whole down payment fund were in it, and yet if the market goes up or stays steady than I will get a slight benefit. Perhaps a 60/40 or 70/30 HYSA/ETF split could be more conservative.

**TL;DR** Put 50% of down payment fund for a house in HYSA and 50% in VTI instead of putting 100% in savings (losing to inflation) or 100% in an ETF (putting fund at risk due to market volatility).

My credit card however... A nightmare.   
First - because I had to have my BBVA Amex replaced a month before transition, the PNC card I received was deemed ""lost/stolen"" and they overnighted me a replacement. No big deal, bad timing.  
Second - This weekend, I receive a fraud alert for an iTunes transaction that I made.. Called, the department was closed for the weekend... Like what? 

Today's development: On my statement close date of the 17th, PNC reported my account was closed to Transunion. I received an alert today. Checked everyone else, still open. I had used it since the statement date, and I validated it worked after seeing the credit notification. Tried to call, but the ridiculous hold times are impossible.

personalfinance,Both me and my spouse changed jobs this year and my spouses situation is rather complicated. How do we set up her W4.,"Hi all, 

Sorry for the long wall of text. Haven't heard of anyone in a similar situation so I tried to include all the information necessary. We are looking to get some advice on how to fill out my spouses new w4 and our situation is very confusing (for us at least). I'll start with my less confusing situation:

May 1st I worked in CA (U.S Salary) and made $25,324 gross and paid $5,142.62 in total taxes (can give a deeper breakdown if needed). Starting May 10th I started with my new company in NV (U.S Salary) and have been there since. So far this year at my new company I've made $46,040.46 gross and paid $10,406.26 in taxes (including Medicare and SS). Very straight forward on my end......

Now for my spouses complex situation......

In 2019 my wife was working for company A and we just noticed she never updated her w4 to say married filing jointly so we need to update this W4. Anyways, midway through 2019 she found a job at company B and left company A. However, she did not completely leave company A and has worked there remotely part time ever since (hourly still W2). Both company A and B are in CA. In May (2021) she informed company B that we would be moving to NV and they told her should could not work there full time and be out of state (UC system). They were able to make her an exception, but there were uncertainties so my wife looked into other options while still working both jobs. Last month, Company A reached out and offered her a new full time hourly position that is fully remote and won't ever require her to live in CA and offered her a raise. Basically her paycheck for company A looks exactly the same, just more money and 40 hours per week (guaranteed). My wife missed working full time at company A and quickly accepted the offer. Her latest pay statement for September company B has gross YTD of $7,517.10  and paid $1,469.45 in taxes (includes fed, state, ss and Medicare taxes). This gross includes her first 2.4 weeks of working at the higher hourly rate and her part time hours that she has worked since the beginning of the year.

So my main question is, how the hell should we go about updating company A's W4. We have no kids, dependents or deductions so we skip to step 4. When we go to the withholding IRS calculator I enter all our current and past jobs in 2021 it says we owe $7,854. We owed about $5,000 last year which was not pleasant so I would like to adjust our with holdings to prevent that. However, I think the confusion regarding company A may be inflating what we owe (incorrectly) in the calculations. When filling it out I made sure to enter in only fed income tax so that shouldn't be the issue.  

Now for another curveball.....company B is going to hire her as a 1099 contractor for as needed part time work with an agreed upon rate. She is still waiting on the contract and details to be ironed out, but she is currently helping them out and keeping track of her hours to be back payed. Once this is done we will be setting aside the appropriate amount for when taxes are do. 

Any advice on what we should do would be greatly appreciated. I am even open to hiring a tax professional to set everything straight because this is becoming very stressful.",finance

There is a problem. A real problem. Not a ""this will go away problem"". This problem is massive rising wealth inequality and devaluation of currency. I am seeing it everywhere, and now people are starting to notice it. My friends making $120k can't afford a house. In the next 5 years we are going to have a MASSIVE amount of old people that are homeless or the debt explodes higher. Many people have zero retirement.

We are at the first stage of a generation between 18-40 REJECTING the current system. It is becoming clear that are leaders are not clowns, but instead very smart and massively corrupt. Fed members day trading and Nancy Pelosi being a super investor is showing people how corrupt America is. The things we thought happen in 3rd world countries are happening here. They are happening now. I went to school and got a bachelors degree in economics and barely learned how things work.

I am also seeing a lot of pride and EGO from people I know about bitcoin and it's price going up. I can only control what I can do, but to me I am starting to get scared. Bitcoin rising might be signaling that a lot of people are starting to wake up. They are starting to realize something is wrong.

While thinking of this, I realized that my 2019 return had been sort of bungled and stayed bungled for a pretty good while. I had forgotten to attach a form that showed my Healthcare Market Place insurance for the first 4-5 months. Then, the IRS had trouble verifying me. I never knew I bungled my tax return, just that it never really seemed to complete. Some time way into 2020, I finally called the IRS and they told me of both problems. So then I had to verify, and sometime many months later, I finally got the letter which explained everything. I took it to an accountant, and after several months, it got resolved.   


The issue is when I filled out my FAFSA, I did the ""Transfer from IRS"" option, and I did not manually enter my tax info. I can't tell if everything imported properly, or if my taxes were in disarray. The correction form simply has ""Transferred from IRS"" in grayed out boxes. I would like to manually input my corrected 2019 information in, and just see if I can get a different result, but I am unsure how, and their website does not seem to have a ""I think my FAFSA is wrong"" button.",finance

[China Evergrande set to collapse potentially causing US-style GFC | news.com.au ‚Äî Australia‚Äôs leading news site](https://www.news.com.au/finance/economy/world-economy/china-evergrande-set-to-collapse-potentially-causing-usstyle-gfc/news-story/b55e3aad71c50ea6a733d664f4943d98)

Its been teetering on the brink of collapse for weeks but China Evergrande, the country‚Äôs second biggest property developer, could be facing up to doomsday as it admitted it may not be able to meet its financial obligations.

With more than $A400 billion in debts, the property developer is dealing with several looming deadlines to pay up, as attempts to save it fall through.

An offshore bond payment that China Evergrande initially missed on September 23, but got a 30-day grace period on, is set to expire on Saturday with $110 million owing.

There‚Äôs another $60 million interest payment too, which wasn‚Äôt paid when due on September 29, and the grace period is also set to run out.

Discussions for a $A7 billion deal for Hong Kong-listed Chinese developer Hopson to take a majority stake has also fallen through.

Credit rating service Moody‚Äôs has basically given the property developer a junk rating, warning that there are ‚Äúweak recovery prospects for Evergrande‚Äôs creditors if there is a default‚Äù.

Experts believe that China Evergrande‚Äôs collapse is all but inevitable.

üì∑In 2015, Evergrande real estate acquired four super large projects in Haikou, Wuhan and Huizhou, with a total construction area of nearly 4 million square meters and a total amount of 13.5 billion yuan. Picture: Getty Images

The Chinese government has been reluctant to bail out the ailing property developer and the People‚Äôs Bank of China governor Yi Gang has claimed the risk to the economy could be contained.

Yet there are 70,000 investors in Evergrande, which has also paused construction on homes for more than 1 million home buyers.

**Alarming drop in house prices**

Clifford Bennett, chief economist at ACY Securities, warned that China has moved further along the US style global financial crisis (GFC) pathway.

China uses the property market to prop up the economy with nearly a third of gross domestic product coming from the industry. Recently, two other Chinese developers, Sinic and Fantasia, have also defaulted on payments.

In further bad news, home prices in China dropped in September for the first time in six years, while real estate investment has also tanked for the first time since last year.

Evergrande said real estate sales plunged about 97 per cent during peak home-buying season, with the developer selling just $US571 million since September, a tiny fraction of the $US22 billion it recorded in the same period last year, reported [*Bloomberg*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-20/evergrande-ends-talks-on-hopson-deal-asks-to-resume-trading?srnd=premium-asia).

If Evergrande‚Äôs properties flood the market, due to its collapse, it would further drive prices down across the market causing more problems.

üì∑A state crackdown on China's colossal property market has helped send one of its biggest developers to the brink of collapse, and analysts warn the fallout could lead to the bursting of a bubble that has been building for more than two decades. Picture: Noel Celis / AFP

While the Evergrande situation was already a crisis, Mr Bennett predicted things will get much worse if property prices were to experience even greater drops.

‚ÄúThere are the very first signs of that actually happening with prices in the 70 largest cities just reported to have fallen 0.8 per cent. Not a big deal, except they used to rise steadily and impressively. Something is happening that is more profound than a short term situation of one or two large developers being in trouble,‚Äù he explained.

‚ÄúThey are the canary in the mine. They are faltering because the easy win path of the incredible China boom of past decades, is beginning to settle back into a more typical pattern of a mature capitalist economy.‚Äù

**Situation continues to unravel**

Mr Bennett added that China, the world‚Äôs second largest economy, could well be having a US style property speculation bubble burst experience.

‚ÄúIn the original GFC, high lending to all kinds of construction and property investment (in the US) lead to a global financial crisis. China was actually the backstay then to the global economy,‚Äù he noted.

He added that China‚Äôs continued strong growth during the GFC and the impact that had on all of Asia and Australia, certainly supported the region during the severe USA and European downturn.

So China‚Äôs potential downturn could spell bad news for Australia considering it makes billions from the relationship, despite the trade relationships being frosty at times.

To add to that the US economy is in the grip of a serious slow down with US mortgage applications suffered another severe contraction, he added.

‚ÄúWe should pay attention to any further decline in Chinese property prices, and be particularly concerned should the boom in US prices begin at any stage to slow or reverse,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMortgage applications, are as I have said for some time, a major warning sign.‚Äù

During the October 5 meeting, Evergrande was specifically mentioned seven times, indicating the situation was a key consideration.

The potential downfall of Evergrande, along with a significant slowdown of the Chinese real estate sector more generally, has been a serious cause of concern for Australia especially, given our reliance on China when it comes to iron ore.",cryptocurrency

personalfinance,Salary Negotiation,"Hello,

I currently work for the federal government and have interviewed with a contractor and am mulling an offer and need some advice.

I currently make just over $100k, but have a pension as well that I have calculated as being worth about $15k per year and increasing by year. Additionally my total leave per year is just under 8 weeks between sick and vacation.

Their offer was for $120k, but I had submitted a salary requirement of $140k to leave the feds. They basically want a yes or no, and I'm concerned that if I try and go back to them they'll just counter at like $2500 more or back and forth me up $5k when they're not much more than my current pay with none of the job security.

So should I just take it or leave it with them at my minimum, or should I even bother trying to negotiate since we're so far apart?",finance

48. After the Senate hearing on Tuesday September 14th, Gary Gensler (SEC Chairman) gave a quote to a crypto publication indicating that custodial lending and possibly even staking platforms might be considered securities. This is very relevant for Cardano since it has non-custodial staking whereas many of its competitors have the kind of custodial staking that Gensler may have been contemplating.

58. The Hoskinson Center for Formal Mathematics has been established at Carnegie Mellon.

72. In late 2008/early 2009 it turns out Hal Finney was learning Haskell and trying to figure out how to reduce C02 emissions from a (future) widely used Bitcoin. That sounds a lot like Cardano.

77. The Wall Street Journal has dropped a video on stablecoins. A lot of the video surrounds the Tether dollar reserve controversy. It‚Äôs notable that Cardano‚Äôs Djed solves this.

79. Cardano users on twitter piece together that Charles was talking about visiting [u/Pezesha\_Africa](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pezesha_Africa/) (in regard to microfinance) in Kenya. This is big because Pezesha operates in countries with a combined population of over $300MM.

80. Crypto twitter users try to depict US Whitehouse comments out of context to fuel an economic doom narrative. However, if you listen to the whole press briefing, you will understand that these comments were based on a ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenario involving the US debt ceiling somehow not being raised.

82. Remember! There is no mobile Daedalus wallet. There is no browser extension version of Daedalus. These are fakes! They will steal your ADA. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1445380773096398853](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1445380773096398853)

84. Brazil is looking to follow the El Salvador example and accept crypto as legal tender with a new bill to be voted within days.

92. Representative Tom Emmer clashes with SEC Head Gensler over the direction of crypto regulation. However, it‚Äôs unclear how much Rep. Emmer‚Äôs solution (his Securities Clarity Act bill) would solve the problem given that it only relieves issuers of securities regulation burdens after they have already complied with the ‚Äúregistration or exemption‚Äù hurdle.

104. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce (cryptomom) gave a polite but scathing speech at the Texas Blockchain Summit where she laid bare all the problems with the SEC‚Äôs current approach to crypto. After her recent opinion piece and this speech, it‚Äôs fair to say that she and SEC Chairman Gensler are in open war over crypto. How this gets resolved will determine the regulatory landscape for Cardano and all of crypto going forward. Sadly, Gensler is in charge and not vice versa.

We learned that we‚Äôll have a maintenance upgrade toward the end of October and then PAB a few weeks later. This is extremely important since it will finally allow for the last bits of dApp buildout. The PAB is already available on the tesnet. The test dApp the team is using is an NFT marketplace. The team is watching as we see high loads around events like NFT drops. But, the network is reacting as expected.

CryptoCurrency,Get more Crypto,"As the world of crypto grows and evolves, there are different ways to earn rewards for holding, learning or interacting with decentralized finance (or DeFi) apps.  

1. Coinbase Earn

If available in your country, the easiest way to start generating crypto rewards  is through Coinbase Earn. In exchange for learning the basics about certain cryptocurrencies, you can get some to try for yourself. 

2. Stake some of your crypto

Many currencies now use a ‚ÄúProof of Stake‚Äù consensus mechanism ‚Äî which is a way their decentralized networks can ensure that all transactions are verified and secured without a bank or payment processor in the middle. 

With such cryptocurrencies, you can earn rewards simply for contributing to the security of the network ‚Äî by ‚Äúlocking‚Äù some of your holdings into a staking pool for a certain timeframe. In exchange, you‚Äôll earn rewards. This is an excellent option if you were planning to hold onto the crypto for a longer period ‚Äî instead of having it sit idle, you can put it to work for you. 

Some offer as much as 10% apy. 

3. Turn your dollars into stablecoins

One potential downside of staking rewards is that they‚Äôre paid in the native cryptocurrency, which can be volatile. But you can earn rewards simply by buying and holding dollar-pegged stablecoins like Dai and USD Coin (USDC).

In the current era of vanishingly small interest rates, it‚Äôs no longer possible to hold dollars in a traditional savings account and safely earn meaningful yield. But stablecoins have made a very similar proposition possible. A growing number of centralized finance (or CeFi) products have emerged that provide compelling yield for keeping some of your crypto holdings in stablecoin form.

If you‚Äôre comfortable with higher potential risks for higher returns, you can experiment with lending some of your crypto via DeFi apps. (DeFi remains an emerging technology, so make sure not to invest more than you can afford to lose if you decide to experiment with these protocols.)

DeFi can enable transparent, peer-to-peer lending for potentially higher yields than traditional financial offerings. Investors that supply their cryptocurrency to DeFi lending protocols receive rewards in the form of interest that is charged to borrowers. You need a crypto wallet that is compatible with DeFi apps.",cryptocurrency

Bitcoin,Seven GOOD things about the Futures-Based ETF,"**EDIT: THIS IS NOT A RECOMMENDATION TO BUY THE FUTURES ETFs. THIS IS JUST A LIST OF REASONS OF WHY BITCOIN PRICE CAN ULTIMATELY BENEFIT FROM HAVING THEM COMPARED TO NOT HAVING THEM AROUND.**

We have seen in the last few weeks a lot of bashing on the recently approved ETFs (so far, ProShares, which has been launched, plus Valkyrie and VanEck, which will launch tomorrow and next week respectively). I do not disagree with any of the arguments around (apart from occasional ""duh they gonna suppress price through paper BTC"" argument, which is simply wrong - I explain that in my first point in the following). Now I proceed to list a few GOOD things about a futures ETF in comparison to a spot ETF, mostly because I've seen no one mentioning those so far. Again I stress that **I agree with the arguments for why spot &gt; futures**. **No need to repeat them and say that futures is shit and spot is good because I agree with that.** I am just presenting a silver lining here given what we have in the markets now.

I) The Futures ETF, by not requiring the ETF issuer to hold bitcoin but just future contracts from a particular exchange, is **more easily auditable**. The daily open interest on bitcoin futures at the CME can be checked at [https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin/bitcoin.volume.html](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin/bitcoin.volume.html), making it very difficult for the ETF issuer to increase the ETF shares supply without going long on the futures contract. With a spot ETF, you need to trust the issuer (or the custodian) holds the bitcoins because they very likely will not reveal the address where the bitcoins are (for either security reasons or regulation reasons, or both).

II) With the Futures ETF, there is **ZERO risk the coins can be stolen, confiscated, or lost**, because they hold no coins. By holding a contract that provides exposure to the underlying, the ""carrying risk"" is held by those buying spot and shorting futures to capture the premium. One of the main sources of this premium (in addition to the time value of money), which is not small and is the main disadvantage of the futures ETF) is precisely having to manage the security by your own.

III) With the Futures ETF, you can **benefit in the short term by a rapid increase in BTC prices**. While a spot bitcoin ETF would ideally perfectly track the bitcoin price, the Futures ETF track future contracts. The futures premium over spot can increase over short time periods, providing a higher return than simply holding bitcoin spot.

IV) With the bitcoin futures ETF, you can **benefit from shifts in interest rates**, should them ever occur. If the interest rates go down, the new future contract will trade at a lower price than they would otherwise. When rolling them, the ""contango bleed"" (the loss by selling a close to spot futures to buy an above spot futures expiring at a later date) will be reduced. If the interest rates go up, those holding the ETF will instantly benefit as the futures premium increase. Over time though, they will lose as the contango bleed increases. Admittedly, this is a very limited benefit because it goes away over time.

V) **If there is a big crash, you can benefit from an ""inverse contango bleed""/carrying premium** as futures may trade at a lower price than spot. For those holding the ETF through the crash event though, their losses can be magnified (although not necessarily: the futures price might decrease less than the spot price). This is not necessarily an advantage as it has a good and bad side but, with the futures ETF you have the possibility to have, at some point, a carrying premium. With a spot bitcoin ETF, this cannot happen.

VI) **Many institutional investors are restricted from taking positions in foreign-traded ETFs either by regulation or by mandate, so the futures ETF is all they have**. Same for some individuals. Again, not exactly an advantage over spot, but an advantage over nothing nevertheless. An hypothetical advantage over spot in that regard is that some institutional investors might be restrained from investing in some ""riskier"" ETFs, which in terms of security as explained in I) might be the case of the spot ETF but not the futures ETF. I admit however that this is a very speculative reasoning.

VII) Due to the return on the cash holdings (a futures ETF typically holds cash/treasuries and go long on future contracts), **a futures ETF might offer a lower effective total expense ratio/management fee than the spot ETF** (particularly if interest rates rise one day). Even if they do not rise though, a small return will be earned in the cash, which is not the case of the spot ETF. Additionally, due to competition with spot ETFs in the future, the futures ETF issuers might be able to reduce their fees even further, capturing some market share from spot ETF issuers and benefiting investors.",cryptocurrency

For State, based on this article, I would get charged 7% plus $550. So, $676 total for state.

So total I would get taxed $1072 out of the $1800 profit=58% in taxes.

I am attempting to calculate what my quarterly tax payment will be and am quite confused, i feel like I'm getting different answers everywhere I go on the internet. I have a normal W2 job that i will make \~125k from this year. I also work on the side as a sole proprietor (1099-NEC) and have received 30K in this quarterly tax pay period (Sep 1 to Dec 31) as well as cashed out some investments with \~7k of long term capital gain. I only received \~10k last year as a sole proprietor so I know that covering 100% of the tax from the previous tax year will mean i'm in the clear from a potential penalty perspective if i underpay into the quarterly tax on this years sole proprietor income but looking to just generally understand how to calculate this

So my question is, on the 30k of 1099-NEC income do I owe Sole Proprietor tax (15%) + Federal (24% for my estimated tax bracket) + State Tax %? So say State is 5% id owe 44% in taxes on that income? 

And If I end up receiving say another 10K of 1099-NEC income before the end of the year, should I calculate that federal income tax on the assumption of my year end total income (ie. \~163k) meaning it would be 32% federal for a total of 52% tax (that seems really high) or should i do it on my YTD income?

Know thats a lot, but any resources or info from others who deal with W2 + 1099-NEC would be greatly appreciated",finance

CryptoCurrency,Don't Get Overzealous with the FOMO,"We've now reached the ""nothing can go wrong phase"" of a bull-run, where pretty much anything/everything you put your money in is making money.


I'm here to tell you to please take a step back, both from the discussion threads and the general subreddit/crypto sites/channels to temper expectations and stop feeding into the FOMO and circlejerking over random coins mooning. I know many of you are thinking this is it and Bitcoin isn't stopping until it hits 100k and you need to throw all your life savings in coins right now. Please don't. 3 months ago the suicide hotline links were posted because of the crash. Might we have one again in a month, 3 months, a year? Who knows; I cannot provide any financial advice but for the purposes of your mental health and sanity, just slow down. If anything, I recommend DCA'ing in, maybe more so at the next mega-dip, and yes there will be another dip, and a lot of money will be lost. I know some of you despise fiat and working at your fiat-mining operations daily, but if you're going to go the crypto route might I recommend some stable coins as well that you can stake so at least you're not getting neutered by .01% interest rates in your savings accounts? That way, WHEN the market crashes (again I don't know when but at some point it will) you still have an emergency fund of stable coins that you can convert back to fiat to pay for expenses if needed.


Am I a soothsayer? No, I've been in Bitcoin and Ethereum since 2017; I've seen my fair share of bull runs and crashes and EVERY single bull run EVERY discussion always devolve into ""THIS IS IT WE'RE GONNA BE RICH OFC MY INVESTMENTS ARE MOONING I'M AN INVESTMENT GOD"" followed by suicide hotline links. Just DCA at your regular intervals and leave the rest the fuck alone. It's been a godsend for my own well-being by just fucking off and not worrying about the charts every five minutes and I suggest for those of you prone to gambling tendencies to consider these options as well because you run a risk of over-leveraging yourself or getting too high risk looking to hit it big.

personalfinance,Eleminated most of our debt and looking forward but concerned I will fall back to same habits.,"In 2017 I took a job with a 10K a year paycut because I knew it would be the best thing for my family in the long run. I had gotten as far as I could go in my field/company and this place offered growth and stability. Well, that came with a bit of struggle and kept us from paying off some old debts as well as going into a bit more debt to cover the difference. We had just had a son when I made the change and I knew we would struggle for a little bit.

Fast forward to mid 2020 and we buy our first home, still paying minimums on our credit cards and never getting closer to getting out of debt. We were excited to have our first house and our second baby was born shortly after. At this point I made incredible progress at work and began to make 10K more than I made before the switch.

Recently I paid off most of my credit card debt and decided to do a cash out refinance on the home to pay off the rest of our high interest debt since the value of the home has jumped so drastically in the last year. Also, the refinance will get rid of the pesky PMI. I managed to get a .5% reduced interest rate as well as the money necessary to pay off everything except my student loans and half my wife's. Total that is around 10K. There is still plenty of equity in the house in case of emergency and my monthly payments are going down by about $120. No credit card debt, so instant savings there and no more car payment.

I feel that I did the right thing by only taking out what I needed to pay off that never ending debt cycle that are credit cards. I have a little bit of money set aside from before that I want to build on for our emergency fund. I want to see it grow, I was afraid that if I cashed out any more from my home that it would be to easy to see it there and be tempted to spend it. I want to be proud of that number going up because it's something I've worked for, not something just there.

I guess I wanted to know, how have some of you kept from going back into the same cycle of ongoing debt that catches many of us? What are some strategies that I should employ to make sure that this is the pivot point for my family's financial future?

TLDR; In debt, took on more debt for a job that would offer growth and stability. Paid down a lot of debt. Did a cash out refi to eliminate PMI plus eliminate most debt. Now what?",finance

**Platform Reviews**

**88mph (MPH)**

88mph is a decentralized protocol that acts as a yield optimizer for liquidity providers. Liquidity pools in 88mph collect deposited base assets from liquidity providers and deploy them onto lending platforms to earn interest. However, unlike other yield aggregators, 88mph aims to differentiate itself through the introduction of floating-rate bonds.

One of the biggest issues that yield farming pools face is the effects of impermanent loss. Liquidity providers may lose out on value when the market price of their deposited assets is lower than when it was initially deposited. Through floating-rate bonds, 88mph aims to provide better exposure to yield farmers by providing a complementary financial product that mitigates the associated risks of pooling deposits. 

88mph acts as an intermediary between liquidity providers and lending protocols. Through adaptors, the 88mph protocol will automatically deploy its liquidity pools to the highest-yielding lending protocol at a given interval. Liquidity providers may supply 88mph‚Äôs liquidity pools at any given time which have to be locked for at least 7 days. Assets may be staked for up to a year. 

However, because 88mph employs a floating interest rate, if the floating interest rate‚Äôs APY drops to a very low value and stays there for a long period, deposits made when the floating interest rate‚Äôs APY were still high would be unable to generate sufficient interest to cover the original interest payouts. 

In order to mitigate the risk of insolvency, 88mph also offers floating-rate bonds which immediately fills up the debt of one or more of the deposits. In return, the bond-purchaser would receive the yield generated by those deposits. At the time of writing, the yield received by bond-purchasers is 75% of the initial floating interest rate APY. 

The idea behind this system is that floating-rate bonds effectively doubles up as both a risk mitigation tool for liquidity providers, and operates as a financial product which allows users to long the interest rates of lending protocols.

88mph relies on the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the underlying yield protocol's APY (which roughly spans over a month), and offers 75% of the EMA as the fixed rate. Floating-rate bonds act as a supporting tool to guarantee the interest rates by paying lenders in the event the EMA drops significantly.

**Our Opinion**

This investment is not for your grandma, not even you tech savvy one. Yes it sounds like an interesting innovation but the attractiveness is very much based on the underlying viability of the MPH token. There is a mismatch between its TVL of $33 million compared to its market cap of $45 million. It‚Äôs 24 hour volume of $5 million is a good sign for investors however. Liquidity being key to all these platforms. This platform is one worth investigating but if you don't understand it avoid it.

**Centric Swap**

Centric Swap is a Binance Smart Chain-based token that serves as the Centric Network on- and off-ramp. Centric Network itself is a dual-cryptocurrency payment network.

CNS can be traded freely on cryptocurrency exchanges and offers users access to Centric Rise (CNR) along with liquidity. A decentralized protocol governs the exchange between these tokens and self-regulates the supply to meet the changes in demand.

The vision of Centric is to alleviate what they see as the largest obstacle to the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies, which is price volatility. The Centric Foundation was established to advance the adoption of Centric Rise (CNR) and Centric Swap (CNS).

Centric has a dual-token model that rewards adoption and stabilizes over time due to its self-regulating supply. The idea behind the model is that, when a user purchases Centric Swap from a trusted cryptocurrency exchange, they can convert it to Centric Rise and benefit from its hourly growth.

This leads to the fact that at every moment when the Centric Rise is worth slightly more than Centric Swap, the user can convert CNR back to CNS and reap the rewards. This dual token system creates the conditions for a synthetic stable currency and can regulate the supply of Centric Rise to drive the market price of Centric Swap towards $1.

Holding Centric Rise grants a user predetermined hourly earnings on their investment in Centric Swap, ensured by the fact that the value of Centric Rise is constantly increasing in relation to Centric Swap. CNR trades at a predetermined price that is enforced by the Centric protocol and increases every hour when the protocol self-balances. 1 CNS will always convert to CNR at a fixed exchange rate of $1 USD of CNR.

In other words, Centric Rise (CNR) stores value, is a transactional currency, has a deflationary supply and an inflationary price and an hourly yield. Centric Swap (CNS) has liquidity, is traded on exchanges, has an elastic supply and a demand indicator. The Centric Protocol governs the token exchange, regulates the supply, is immutable, is censorship-resistant and is independently audited.

**Our Opinion**

Our first negative is it‚Äôs tokenomics. A fully diluted market cap 20 times higher than its current level is not a good start. So let‚Äôs turn our attention to the platform. This unfortunately doesn't leave us with much confidence either. It is not easy to navigate and without creating an account a user can‚Äôt see what APRs are available or the platform‚Äôs TVL. There are better platforms to focus on in our opinion.

Through floating-rate bonds, 88mph aims to provide better exposure to yield farmers by providing a complementary financial product that mitigates the associated risks of pooling deposits.

88mph acts as an intermediary between liquidity providers and lending protocols. Through adaptors, the 88mph protocol will automatically deploy its liquidity pools to the highest-yielding lending protocol at a given interval. Liquidity providers may supply 88mph‚Äôs liquidity pools at any given time which have to be locked for at least 7 days. Assets may be staked for up to a year.

However, because 88mph employs a floating interest rate, if the floating interest rate‚Äôs APY drops to a very low value and stays there for a long period, deposits made when the floating interest rate‚Äôs APY were still high would be unable to generate sufficient interest to cover the original interest payouts.

In order to mitigate the risk of insolvency, 88mph also offers floating-rate bonds which immediately fills up the debt of one or more of the deposits. In return, the bond-purchaser would receive the yield generated by those deposits. At the time of writing, the yield received by bond-purchasers is 75% of the initial floating interest rate APY.

The idea behind this system is that floating-rate bonds effectively doubles up as both a risk mitigation tool for liquidity providers, and operates as a financial product which allows users to long the interest rates of lending protocols.

88mph relies on the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the underlying yield protocol's APY (which roughly spans over a month), and offers 75% of the EMA as the fixed rate. Floating-rate bonds act as a supporting tool to guarantee the interest rates by paying lenders in the event the EMA drops significantly.

**Our Opinion**

This investment is not for your grandma, not even you tech savvy one. Yes it sounds like an interesting innovation but the attractiveness is very much based on the underlying viability of the MPH token. There is a mismatch between its TVL of $33 million compared to its market cap of $45 million. It‚Äôs 24 hour volume of $5 million is a good sign for investors however. Liquidity being key to all these platforms. This platform is one worth investigating but if you don't understand it avoid it.

**Centric Swap**

Centric Swap is a Binance Smart Chain-based token that serves as the Centric Network on- and off-ramp. Centric Network itself is a dual-cryptocurrency payment network.

CNS can be traded freely on cryptocurrency exchanges and offers users access to Centric Rise (CNR) along with liquidity. A decentralized protocol governs the exchange between these tokens and self-regulates the supply to meet the changes in demand.

The vision of Centric is to alleviate what they see as the largest obstacle to the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies, which is price volatility. The Centric Foundation was established to advance the adoption of Centric Rise (CNR) and Centric Swap (CNS).

Centric has a dual-token model that rewards adoption and stabilizes over time due to its self-regulating supply. The idea behind the model is that, when a user purchases Centric Swap from a trusted cryptocurrency exchange, they can convert it to Centric Rise and benefit from its hourly growth.

This leads to the fact that at every moment when the Centric Rise is worth slightly more than Centric Swap, the user can convert CNR back to CNS and reap the rewards. This dual token system creates the conditions for a synthetic stable currency and can regulate the supply of Centric Rise to drive the market price of Centric Swap towards $1.

Holding Centric Rise grants a user predetermined hourly earnings on their investment in Centric Swap, ensured by the fact that the value of Centric Rise is constantly increasing in relation to Centric Swap. CNR trades at a predetermined price that is enforced by the Centric protocol and increases every hour when the protocol self-balances. 1 CNS will always convert to CNR at a fixed exchange rate of $1 USD of CNR.

In other words, Centric Rise (CNR) stores value, is a transactional currency, has a deflationary supply and an inflationary price and an hourly yield. Centric Swap (CNS) has liquidity, is traded on exchanges, has an elastic supply and a demand indicator. The Centric Protocol governs the token exchange, regulates the supply, is immutable, is censorship-resistant and is independently audited.

**Our Opinion**

Our first negative is it‚Äôs tokenomics. A fully diluted market cap 20 times higher than its current level is not a good start. So let‚Äôs turn our attention to the platform. This unfortunately doesn't leave us with much confidence either. It is not easy to navigate and without creating an account a user can‚Äôt see what APRs are available or the platform‚Äôs TVL. There are better platforms to focus on in our opinion.

**PolyDragon (DGOLD)**

Staking and yield farming platform which is a fork of PancakeSwap.

**Our Opinion**

This is one of those metoo platforms that offers an attractive APR to entice users. Its headline APR is 10,000% however the market cap is a lowly $7,000 with a TVL of $20,000. This is one to avoid.

CryptoCurrency,"US/Biden admin annonces ban on crypto effective next week, what do you do?","Hypothetical:

Crypto has become a threat to taxation in the US. The government is having a hard time tracking money and taxes and decide its easier to ban it. They are threatened by the concept and effectiveness of things like monero. The administration announces this under a ""fair tax act"" to prevent persons from hiding money from government taxation. The administration announces they belive money transactions should be reserved for banks that are tried and true.

They decide to launch a three prong attack on crypto. 

1. They shut down all trading apps that facilitate crypto Via Apple and Android. These apps can retain basic stock trading but not crypto. Any attempts by app makers or providers to bypass these regs will result in fines fees or punishable criminally. 

2. Any company that accepts crypto as payment OR facilities payment will be subject to fines, fees, additional taxes and punishable criminally. Further any companies who are suspected of violating this new law will be subject to yearly IRS audits for no less than 5 years. 

3. Any individual who is suspected of manipulation of crypto in any way can be punished by federal laws criminally and subject to IRS audit. 

You wake up and see this, what will you do?? You have a week to decide. Do you sell it all? Will this cause a revolution? Would you just bend over and take it? 

Obviously this is highly hypothetical, but, with the way some of these proposed tax laws have been coming across, it doesn't seem like to much of a stretch to think they wouldn't consider it.",cryptocurrency

Responding to a growing controversy over investing practices, the Federal Reserve on Thursday announced a ban on officials owning individual stocks and limits on other activities as well. The ban includes top policymakers such as those who sit on the Federal Open Market Committee, along with senior staff. Future investments will have to be confined to diversified assets such as mutual funds. Fed officials can no longer have holdings in shares of particular companies, nor can they invest in individual bonds, hold agency securities or derivative contracts. The new rules replace existing regulations that, while somewhat restrictive, still allowed members to buy and sell stocks. ‚ÄúThese tough new rules raise the bar high in order to assure the public we serve that all of our senior officials maintain a single-minded focus on the public mission of the Federal Reserve,‚Äù Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a statement. Under the new rules, the officials will have to provide 45 days‚Äô notice in advance of buying or selling any securities that are still allowed. They also will be required to hold the securities for at least a year, and cannot buy or sell funds during ‚Äúheightened financial market stress,‚Äù a news release announcing the moves said.

The rules come on the heels of disclosures that multiple Fed officials had been buying and selling stocks at a time when the central bank‚Äôs policies were designed to improve market functioning, particularly during the Covid crisis. Regional presidents Robert Kaplan of Dallas and Eric Rosengren of Boston both resigned shortly after disclosures that they had engaged in trading of individual securities last year. In Kaplan‚Äôs case, the moves occurred in large-dollar allotments. Vice Chairman Richard Clarida also had been featured in the reports. Powell also sold securities last year, though they were exchange-traded funds that tracked market indexes.",finance

personalfinance,Why contribute to an IRA if you make too much money to deduct?,"I am in a fortunate position where my wife and I make too much money to deduct IRA contributions after maxing out 401k. I'm trying to figure out what the benefit is of contributing after-tax money to an IRA versus a traditional brokerage account.

My gut reaction is to go with the brokerage account because you're paying taxes on both contributions and withdrawals in either scenario, and brokerage gives you more flexibility if you need the money before retirement.

However, I saw an article that had this write up and can't figure out the math on this:

&gt;Despite the fact that the contribution to a traditional IRA isn‚Äôt tax-deductible, the plan still offers the opportunity for you to accumulate [tax-deferred investment income](https://www.moneyunder30.com/profit-from-tax-loss-harvesting). That‚Äôs no small advantage.  
&gt;  
&gt;If you earn an average 10% return in an investment brokerage account, and you‚Äôre in the [combined federal and state marginal income tax brackets of 30% ](https://www.taxact.com/tools/tax-bracket-calculator.asp), then the return on your investment will be just 7%. But if the same 10% return were being earned in a tax-deferred traditional IRA account, you would get the full benefit of the 10% return.  
&gt;  
&gt;Let‚Äôs do a quick calculation:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- If you have $10,000 invested in a taxable brokerage account, invested over 30 years at an average annual after-tax return of 7%, the account will grow to a value of $76,125;  
&gt;  
&gt;\- If you have the same $10,000 invested in a traditional, tax-deferred IRA account, invested over 30 years at an annual return of 10%, the account will grow to a value of $174,491

How would an IRA grow by 100k more than a brokerage if it's funded by after tax money and you pay taxes coming out, just like a brokerage account?

Why does it grow at 3% more than a brokerage if you're paying taxes on money in and money out?",finance
stocks,Reading the FT and WSJ from 100 years ago each week leading to 1929,"# October 17-23, 1921

This week, the FT coaches investors on the stock market's seasonal gloom and France reveals German attempts to game war reparations.

Quick Stats:

* DJIA: 70.77 (Today: 35,295)
* Shiller PE Ratio: 5.5 (Today: 38.1)
* Federal Reserve Bank of NY Discount Rate: 5.0% (Today: 0.25%)
* GBPUSD: $3.92 (Today: $1.37)
* Price of The Wall Street Journal: $0.07 (Today: $4.00)

Market-Moving Themes:

* High taxes, soft business conditions, and elevated interest rates are negatively impacting investor sentiment (equity, debt markets)
* Wartime raw material shortages are easing, paving way for price stability (commodity markets)
* European post-war debt payments are causing a strong dollar as gold flows to the United States (currency markets)

Executive Summary:

* Markets are driven by both fundamentals and sentiment. As readers head into the heart of fall, the FT reminds readers about the impending gloom. The Dow has been mired in a range between 65 and 75 since the spring. Any perkiness in the summer was quickly sold off. Investors should brace themselves for some negative movements, but not get too defensive because the current bear market seems to have plateaued.
* Bankers criss-crossed the nation a few weeks ago and are eager to share their findings. East Coast blues were met with West Coast bliss. One banker didn‚Äôt realize how nice the weather is in Los Angeles. He thinks that part of the issue with ongoing market weakness has more to do with psychology than anything else. He encourages readers to get some fresh air.
* France calls out Berlin for monetary fraud. The French government illustrates the complete suicide of the German mark, which has gone from record low to record low this year. The monetary games need to stop, France warns. The appraisement of the mark is no longer governed by the valuation of Germany‚Äôs creditworthiness or her resources, but by the question of her honesty in the execution of the Treaty of Versailles.
* Rumors of Royal Dutch Shell exiting Mexico send shockwaves through the press. Some sources claim that Royal Dutch has sold down its Mexican subsidiary, but brokerages across London have not seen any evidence of this. Shares of Mexican oil companies get slammed. Is Royal Dutch planting these claims to get something from the Mexican government? One former Standard Oil executive turned private investor thinks so. If not, he‚Äôd happily sink his entire life savings into Mexican oil fields.
* The prominent German industrialist Hugo Stinnes suggests a fringe dictatorship might seize power because the poorly drawn up armistice extracts too great a toll on the Teutonic nation. He reckons that one of the infant right wing parties could take power some day. Whatever the case, trouble is brewing.

personalfinance,How to account for taxes when splitting finances?,"Update: Been asking this question in a few different places, including to a certified financial planner. Since everyone on the thread was mostly hating on the fact that I was trying to split expenses and not actually helping, here is what we determined:

Divide pre-tax expenses in half, decrease my 'cost' by the amount of the tax shield. Add that reduced cost to wife's half of the contributions made to the joint account. Also, use effective tax rate, with both federal and state taxes to calculate the tax shield. 

Another illustrative example: 
* $200 in pre-tax expenses 
* $100 is my cost 
* effective tax rate of 25% 
* Reduce my 'cost' by this shield - Net $75 
* Wife pays an additional $75 to the joint expenses account

******

My wife and I split our finances 50/50 and our budget works really well. I've been paying for our insurance and HSA contributions through my work and I've been trying to figure out the best way to account for the cost of this health insurance and the deferred taxes when we contribute to the joint account.

Illustrative:   
* we both make $1000 a paycheck  
* it costs me $200 to pay for health insurance, HSA etc  
* Assuming a 10% marginal tax rate I pay $80, she $100 in taxes  
* my take home is $1000-200-80 = $720  
* hers is $1000-100 = $900  
* difference in our take home is $180 so she could give me $90 and we're equal at $810 each  

So some questions:   
* should it be marginal or effective tax rate?  
* we don't make the same so the calculation is not that straightforward. How do I back into this number using how much the insurance costs, how much we should be contributing jointly to accounts, and the correct tax rate?  
* should I use the Total Cost of health insurance? Or just the difference in cost to have her added onto mine?  
* What other considerations need to be made for taxes on the back end?",finance

**PART 2 - Why has it been trash since?**

Well if we look at our marketcap chart, it wasn't doing too bad, until about May of this year. There's been a few reasons why it's been underperforming the rest of the crypto market to date:

1. They launched on Aave - (but ONLY as a borrowing pool, i.e. you can't use AMPL as collateral yet). What this means it it's been easier to profit by shorting Ampl. How?

* Borrow AMPL and sell for USDC
* Deposit USDC as collateral
* Borrow more Ampl and short again
* Run it back, rinse and repeat

1. Aave has had UI problems that's been displaying incorrect interest rates‚Ä¶ until [today](https://twitter.com/evankuo/status/1451262330080137241). This is actually across all markets, not just AMPL. For AMPL, it's been showing interest rates of \~500% APY, when it reality it was in the 1000s%. In fact, at the time of writing this, the current APY on AMPL is 100,000%. That's not a typo. I may not know how to read, but I do write.

Shorties have been borrowing and shorting with the upper hand, but it's possible some of them haven't even known how much interest they've been accruing.

**PART 3 - Short Whales**

Our buddy over [here](https://twitter.com/PepeSoros/status/1451058251819204608) shorted 600k AMPL at $1.15, and now AMPL is finally above it's price target so it's drawing some attention (along with cross chain initiatives). As a result, people have also been withdrawing their AMPL from the liquidity pool so that they can keep the supply growth. This has effectively made it so that our shorty whale buddy can't borrow any more. And he's paying an interest rate of [112,000%](https://app.aave.com/#/reserve-overview/0xd46ba6d942050d489dbd938a2c909a5d5039a161-0xd46ba6d942050d489dbd938a2c909a5d5039a1610xb53c1a33016b2dc2ff3653530bff1848a515c8c5) at the time of writing to keep it going.

&amp;#x200B;

[Oh. Have I got your attention now?](https://preview.redd.it/w96z8xrvzxu71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5c2c9e978f7bd958d247c6976468363851f71a42)

**FAQ-1: WUT DO?**

As long as AMPL is above it's price target, this shit will literally go parabolic‚Ä¶ again. If you really want, you can also deposit you AMPL, collect some of that sweet interest while depositing the liquidity tokens into their vault at [geyser.ampleforth.org](https://geyser.ampleforth.org/) to collect EVEN MORE AMPL.

Meanwhile- our whale buddy keeps accruing interest owed - he'll eventually NEED to buy back [800k](https://etherscan.io/token/0xf013d90e4e4e3baf420dfea60735e75dbd42f1e1?a=0x814611f0eb8c0befb5b6892ca836e51784e9b9b4). If everyone holds to keep their supply increases, price only go up. Leading to more supply increases. Literally cannot go tits up unless EVERYONE sells.

**FAQ-2: But TheWhackBateman, what about the fundamentals?**

Fundamentals? Bruh, the fundamentals on AMPL have never been stronger.

1. Ampl is the original non-collateralized rebasing token, and it's the only one to have survived this long (since 2019). There's been at least 40 hard forks of AMPL, all have failed. (\*cough\* YAM \*cough\*)
2. The foundation has burned the [admin keys](https://cryptobriefing.com/ampleforth-removes-upgradeability-decentralizes-into-community/) earlier this year, making it fully decentralized along with a separate governance token.
3. AMPL has began entering it's application phase. Up until now, AMPL has just been an experiment on the market with smooth-brains alike. It's shown that it can stand the test of time, and now it's starting to be used in actual DeFi applications. More on that below.

**FAQ-3 How do I know this ain't a scam token?**

Bruh. The investors in the foundation include [VC's like Huobi and Pantera](https://www.ampleforth.org/about/). Oh and did I mention, [BRIAN ARMSTRONG](https://www.crunchbase.com/person/brian-armstrong). Yes, THE BRIAN ARMSTRONG that's CEO of Coinbase. And he invested in AMPL out of his personal pocket too. Oh. And did I mention that he went to Yale with Brandon Iles who co-founded AMPL with Evan Kuo? Our boi's were literally [coding](https://newsletter.thedefiant.io/p/all-the-dizzying-ways-people-are) with each other back in the day. These names are too legit.

**FAQ-4 I don't like ERC-20's. Gas be high.**

AMPL is chain-agnostic. They've been working on getting onto all the hot chains. They're already on [BSC](https://bscscan.com/address/0xFd55eBc7bBde603A048648C6eAb8775c997C1001). They're technically already on [Matic](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xc67238827da94b15f6ba10f3d35f690809919f75)\- but are waiting on UI updates. And recently, they just got onto [AVAX](https://cchain.explorer.avax.network/address/0x027dbcA046ca156De9622cD1e2D907d375e53aa7/transactions). They haven't even announced AVAX yet because it sounds like there's some juicy stuff coming up. The team has also mentioned L2s like Arbitrum and Optimism in the discord server.

**FAQ-5 Wtf are the applications about?**

One of the applications on [testnet](https://test.borrow.prl.one/borrow) is called [Mooncake](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VKMAuro2NZEgiD-hvI3Scy5fmHcaoOObC8qKu0GdcZU/edit#). The group working on it is called [PRL](https://www.prl.one/) which is being led by ja boi [Manny Rincon-Cruz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manuelr5/) from Stanford (also an AMPL advisor), who's basically been studying money &amp; finance his whole life. Basically it's a lending app that will make it so that you can:

* Deposit your AMPL as collateral to borrow up to 50% of it in USDx
* NO LIQUIDATIONS, and you technically don't even need to pay it back
* This mean you can get TFT (Tax Free Tendies)
   * When you want to sell just deposit into Mooncake and get 50% as USDx
   * At the end of your loan you get 50% of your original AMPL back.
   * Deposit into mooncake again.
   * Run it back.

You aren't selling if it's a loan. üß†üß†üß†

Basically the way this works is it takes your AMPL and slices it up so that when the supply expands or shrinks, half of it gets reserved for b00mers that want steady value, and the other half goes to degens like me who are trying to get leveraged to the tits. If you didn't know already, this is basically how [Wall Street](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-10-07/matt-levine-s-money-stuff-looking-for-tether-s-money) makes MBS's. Our modern economy runs off of shit like this. And this is just the beginning, you make a whole stew of different slices for different products. Just like WallStreet. Except it's the free market.

Oh. Also, they're doing a workshop with AMPL as a part of ChainLink Hackathon next week.

Did I also mention [wAMPL](https://ampltools.com/wamplwatch/)? Wtf is wAMPL you ask?

Well turns out, the crypto-space is soooo smooth that the supply fluctuations got us moon-bois shook when the balance in our wallet changes. So they made this wrapped version of AMPL, that represents a fixed portion of the supply so us degens don't need to worry about the balance changing - but still keeping the base underlying tokenomics to be the same.

JK JK - although that probably played a role in this token's creation - the bigger reasons are:

1. Makes AMPL easier to integrate with other projects since supply won't be changing. Imagine a DAI collateralized by AMPL.
2. Makes it easier to list AMPL on CEX's. One of the major reasons AMPL has struggled to get onto CEX's is because of the moon-boi failure mode I described. wAMPL will fix this. Not to mention, our boi Brian Armstrong [listed the AMPL governance token](https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1384991075970998282?lang=en) (FORTH) at the drop of hat, making it one of the fastest tokens to ever get listed on CB. Oh. And CB institutional [tweeted about AMPL](https://twitter.com/CoinbaseInsto/status/1445431280724627459?s=20) a while back. Maybe so it can give their WallStreet buddies a heads up that there's another space they can do their slicing and dicing. I'll let you decide. Ok ok one more. Richy, who used to be part of the AMPL team (and is still an advisor) [recently changed roles to work for CB](https://twitter.com/richy_qiao/status/1443357901402173441)...

**TLDR:**

* Whales [shorted AMPL](https://twitter.com/PepeSoros/status/1451058251819204608) well below it's fair value, because you can't use it as collateral anywhere yet.
* Now they're trapped paying up to [181,752%](https://app.aave.com/#/reserve-overview/0xd46ba6d942050d489dbd938a2c909a5d5039a161-0xd46ba6d942050d489dbd938a2c909a5d5039a1610xb53c1a33016b2dc2ff3653530bff1848a515c8c5) until someone sells. Whales possibly haven't been aware of interest accruing until today, when [Aave fixed their UI](https://twitter.com/evankuo/status/1451262330080137241).
* If AMPL stays above it's price target, shit will literally go exponentially to the moon
* Even if it doesn't the long term fundamentals on AMPL are so strong, that it's arguably the best buy for MC &lt; 300M
* PRL is going to launch a [lending app](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VKMAuro2NZEgiD-hvI3Scy5fmHcaoOObC8qKu0GdcZU/edit#) that will let you sell 50% of your AMPL tax-free, and/or get leveraged to the tits with the remaining 50%
* AMPL is going cross chain onto [Matic](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xc67238827da94b15f6ba10f3d35f690809919f75), already on [BSC](https://bscscan.com/address/0xDB021b1B247fe2F1fa57e0A87C748Cc1E321F07F), [AVAX](https://cchain.explorer.avax.network/address/0x027dbcA046ca156De9622cD1e2D907d375e53aa7/transactions) and talks of Arbitrum and Optimism too",cryptocurrency

3. Charles releases a new video on the Alonzo Update Proposal (on Aug. 7) being submitted so that we can go live on the 12th. He also gives some hints as to his thoughts on the short-term planning of some ‚Äúflavor of the week‚Äù blockchains vs. the long term planning of Cardano. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhujKbMpTEA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhujKbMpTEA)
4. Weiss Crypto lays down yet another very positive thread about Cardano. They acknowledge that they can‚Äôt see the future of Cardano, but they vehemently reject a lot of the anti-hype. [https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1435261343456768005](https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1435261343456768005)

7. Messari has updated its ‚ÄúInitial Token Distribution‚Äù chart to include a previously missing project and Cardano is still among the very best in the Gen 3 space in terms of broad public coin ownership. [https://twitter.com/CryptoIRELAND1/status/1435708439951552513](https://twitter.com/CryptoIRELAND1/status/1435708439951552513)

11. A Weiss Crypto analyst calls the smart contract launch an alleged event and also doesn‚Äôt realize we already have NFTS. The Cardano community was quick to correct the analyst. Weiss was then also quick to apologize. [https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436369016545857566](https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436369016545857566) [https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436402039085576193](https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436402039085576193)

14. One of Cardano‚Äôs biggest competitors is once again suffering network problems. This time it started out as just being characterized as (more) ‚Äúinstability‚Äù, then they started saying that something had caused the blockchain to ‚Äústart forking‚Äù. This followed their September 2 ‚Äúinstability‚Äù and ‚Äúperformance degradation‚Äù event. It‚Äôll be interesting to see how well their community tolerates this in the future if it‚Äôs happening with their planned slashing model in effect.

18. In macro news that could impact Cardano &amp; all of crypto, it has been announced that China‚Äôs Evergrande Group will not be able to make interest payments on its loans in a few days.[ https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/1438143063306690560](https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/1438143063306690560) [https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-09-15/evergrande-gives-china-an-impossible-equation-to-solve-with-its-liquidity-crunch](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-09-15/evergrande-gives-china-an-impossible-equation-to-solve-with-its-liquidity-crunch)

20. Now one of Cardano‚Äôs most highly visible critics is implying that the Cardano community has something in common with anti-vaxxers. Unfortunately for him, it was one of his pet blockchains that was down a few days ago while Cardano just kept healthily trucking right along. [https://twitter.com/spudiot1/status/1438402783040790532](https://twitter.com/spudiot1/status/1438402783040790532)

23. Smaug gives us a rundown of how many actual Plutus scripts (19)are running on mainnet vs. timelock scripts (21k) as of Sept 17 and explains simple definitions for both. But, he also mentions down below how many Plutus scripts (213) are reportedly running on ‚Äúthe main testnet‚Äù not counting ‚Äúother Alonzo testnets‚Äù. [https://twitter.com/SmaugPool/status/1438816898234343432](https://twitter.com/SmaugPool/status/1438816898234343432)

25. Now the TX and NJ state securities regulators are after Celsius for crypto loans (BlockFi already got this treatment). Cardano loan projects should probably take note.

26. After the Senate hearing on Tuesday September 14th, Gary Gensler (SEC Chairman) gave a quote to a crypto publication indicating that custodial lending and possibly even staking platforms might be considered securities. This is very relevant for Cardano since it has non-custodial staking whereas many of its competitors have the kind of custodial staking that Gensler may have been contemplating. [https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/117675/crypto-lending-staking-custody-gensler-sec](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/117675/crypto-lending-staking-custody-gensler-sec)

57. Cardano users on twitter piece together that Charles was talking about visiting [u/Pezesha\_Africa](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pezesha_Africa/) (in regard to microfinance) in Kenya.

58. Crypto twitter users try to depict US Whitehouse comments out of context to fuel an economic doom narrative.

70. Representative Tom Emmer clashes with SEC Head Gensler over the direction of crypto regulation. However, it‚Äôs unclear how much Rep.

82. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce (cryptomom) gave a polite but scathing speech at the Texas Blockchain Summit where she laid bare all the problems with the SEC‚Äôs current approach to crypto. After her recent opinion piece and this speech, it‚Äôs fair to say that she and SEC Chairman Gensler are in open war over crypto. How this gets resolved will determine the regulatory landscape for Cardano and all of crypto going forward. Sadly, Gensler is in charge and not vice versa.

personalfinance,IRA Focused Conversion Question,"I‚Äôm 42, currently in grad school and unemployed (I worked the first half of the year).  I‚Äôve worked the last couple decades, and decided to change careers (hence school).  I‚Äôd like to withdraw from my IRA and keep enough money on-hand so I can ensure I have living expenses in case of prolonged unemployment.  I‚Äôve made about 4 distributions from my rollover to cover tuition (which I understand is qualifed).  

Aside from a SEPP which I don‚Äôt want to do, I was thinking I could do a one-time focused conversion and put a portion in my roth (I‚Äôve had the roth since I started working two decades ago).   Then I could withdraw the contribution, thus only be taxed at my normal rate.

Is my understanding, correct?  Is this feasible if I‚Äôm unemployed since it‚Äôs a roth ira contribution?  If so, how long does my money need to be in the roth before i can withdraw?",finance

If I were to lock a rate in today, I could get 2.65% for an up front fee of $1860, or I could pay no fee and lock in a rate of 2.871%. 

I ran a calculation to see what the difference would be in my monthly payment and it looks like about $44. It would take 3.5 years to break even if I take the lower rate and pay the fee, but over the life of the loan I would save about $14,000. I am not sure if I will actually be in the house for 30 years though. Probably not since its my first home. I have a feeling I wont be there for more than 5-10 years. Do you think it is worth it? Are there any down sides to this?

Both rate locks would be good until the original estimated closing date at the end of next month.",finance

CryptoCurrency,This is why banks and governments don‚Äôt want the crypto to succeed,"1. **Loss of Control Due to Decentralization**

stocks,10-year Treasury yield edges lower ahead of speech by Fed‚Äôs Powell,"U.S. Treasury yields edged lower in choppy trade Friday morning, with investors awaiting the final speech of the month from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell ahead of the central bank‚Äôs policy meeting on Nov. 2-3 when it is widely expected to announce the process of reducing its bond purchases.

**What‚Äôs driving the market?**

The fixed-income market is watching for comments from Powell, who will deliver a speech at a Bank for International Settlements conference at 11 a.m. Eastern Time. The Fed chief‚Äôs speech will be the final comments from the policy makers until the policy meeting in two weeks, and Powell‚Äôs comments may hold particular significance given investors have seen yields on the 2-year rise to the highest level in over 18 months and the 10-year touching heights not seen since early May this year. In overnight trade the benchmark 10-year hit around 1.70%, FactSet data show.

Yields have been climbing over the past week as investors bet that inflation will remain elevated in the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, which has helped cause supply-chain bottlenecks and labor shortages as economies attempt to normalize after the 18 month long pandemic. 

On Thursday, Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Raphael Bostic said those factors coupled with consumer demand, could keep inflation elevated into next year. ‚ÄúI was thinking late third, maybe early fourth quarter for 2022,‚Äù Bostic said during a CNBC interview Thursday afternoon. ""Part of the ultimate answer to how long this will take will be how quickly we resolve some of the coronavirus issues as well as some of the supply chain challenges that are happening at a global level,‚Äù he told the business network. The IHS Markit flash U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers index, or PMI, dropped to 59.2 in October from 60.7 a month earlier, while the services PMI rose to 58.2 in October from 54.9. A reading of more than 50 indicates expansion in activity.

**What analysts are saying**

‚ÄúTen-year yields held the 1.7% area overnight where we believe buyers surfaced however at some point the high yield of 1.774% will be tested shortly as the quarter pushes on,‚Äù wrote Thomas di Galoma, managing director and head of Treasury trading at Seaport Global Holdings.

personalfinance,Time between auto refi and trade-in,"Howdy folks. I‚Äôm sure this has come up before but I scrolled for a while and didn‚Äôt see it.  

I want to buy my ‚Äúdream‚Äù car (it‚Äôs a moderate dream) for about $35k sometime around the middle of next year but my current car loan interest rate is extremely high. I‚Äôve already discussed refinancing with a bank without an inquiry being done and they said they could easily cut the interest in half, given my much higher credit score than when the original loan was created, saving me a significant amount of money.  There won‚Äôt be much equity in the current vehicle because I overpaid and have high interest, both symptoms of bad credit, so trade-in value will be negligible.  

The question: should I refinance now, saving probably $1,000+ in interest alone in the next 7-9 months, or will the refi mess with my ability to get good terms when I want to trade it in?  Or better yet, will the refi make it hard to trade in the car?",finance

My dad moved out and my fiance moved in. We're at the point where we will be buying my dad out of the house and are meeting to discuss the mortgage next week with professionals. My dad agreed to keep the amount to 150k with closing costs included in that amount. I just want to know if you went through something similar and how you proceeded.  


I know I can refinance for 460 (I've paid 10k in principle) and she and I can pay it as a joint asset. Probably the easiest way to do it. However, I'd be refinancing into a larger interest rate than when I first bought, especially with interest rates rising. Would it be possible to have my fiance take out 150k to buy my dad out, we just pay everything together anyway and then refinance into one mortgage down the road?

personalfinance,"Healthcare provider not even trying to submit a claim to my insurance, despite me giving them the insurance info three times. Do I need to do anything else?","Don't know if this is relevant, but this is in DC and I have BlueCross BlueShield Basic option for Federal employees. 

Story: I got surgery on my toe in August and gave my insurance info and copay at the front desk (yes, I double checked to make sure this provider accepts my insurance). 

Get a bill in September for the procedure, check my insurance and see no claim (accepted, denied, or pending) in the system. Call the provider billing office, they don't have my insurance info, so I give it to them again over the phone.

 Get another bill for the same amount in October. Check insurance again. Again, no claim has been filed. Tried calling a couple of times, but goes to voicemail after no agent answers. No one calls back after I leave voicemails. I then send an email to the billing department so we have this issue in writing (as well as a copy of my insurance card sitting in their inbox). Automated reply says they'll get in touch in two business days. It's been more than a week now and still no response and STILL no insurance claim has been filed. I sent another email today.

I have not paid the bill and I have no intention of paying until they file a claim and I get an Explanation of Benefits from my insurer. I am kind of worried that they may send to collections or report that I've defaulted on a debt to the credit bureaus. 

Is there anything else I should be doing?

UPDATE EDIT: They finally billed my insurance and it went through smoothly. Now all I owe is the copay for surgery ($150.00) minus the specialist copay I already paid ($40.00) ($110.00 total).

stocks,Roku: The Biggest Bubble in ARKK Investing?,"I am sure each of you know Roku. For those of you who don‚Äôt, Roku is a device that sells hardware products to help costumers stream to their favorite devices. They sell TVs, wireless speakers, and sticks/boxes. Roku currently has a massive share in the United States for streaming devices, taking up roughly 37% of the market. With that huge share of the market, Roku can now turn those devices into revenue machines with the use of advertising. Currently hardware accounts for 17% of Roku‚Äôs revenue while 83% comes from advertising/other platform profit. So of course, this is an amazing company that should be worth a lot of money for its strategic advantage. The thing is‚Ä¶ It shouldn‚Äôt be worth $40 billion, or even near that amount.

**Roku is the dominant** ***US*** **player**

Roku is currently the leading CTV (Connected TV) company in the country, by taking a strong command on users switching to cord cutting methods. They use low margin devices to capture their audience then push them towards their high margin ad platform. Obviously, this was a great idea as they have been growing rapidly for years. But how much can this grow keep sustaining. From a device side, they are not growing well at all and are losing global market share, currently Amazon sells double the amount of devices worldwide (CTV devices) compared to Roku. In the United States they have been able to maintain their market share but not grow it as FireTV has rapidly snatched up market space, it will be interesting to see if users begin switching from Roku. This is unfortunate for them because the United States is not growing users like the rest of the world and Roku is struggling currently in building up its market share worldwide. Currently US viewing is only up 18% and I imagine that will shrink as we see Covid slowly go away. Based on their current market share trend they most likely will just increase their market share based on their growth with the US since market share hasn‚Äôt changed. Their current revenue growth looks extreme due to their transition to becoming an ad revenue-based company (which was a fantastic move) this will more than likely slow rapidly as they don‚Äôt pick up more viewers

**Globally, not so much**

Compared with the rest of the world South America had viewing grow by 240%, Africa grow by 149%, and Europe grow by 122%. Sadly, Roku has no more than an 8% share in those other markets.

This means that Roku is rapidly missing out on these fast-growing segments. Whereas Amazon and Samsung have taken over the market share in other areas. As these countries keep growing it will keep getting harder and harder for Roku to build up a considerable market share, to capture those viewers and their important ad revenue. These growth metrics aren‚Äôt by devices sold but by *viewing* hours on each device and outside of North America, Roku is struggling to keep up. Roku has lost total global market share with their total viewing time market dropping from 33% in Q1 of 2020 to Q2 of 2021. And remember as an advertising company that market share is crucial to maintain and 3% means a lot. Roku is attempting to gain ground as they just released in Brazil, Germany, and other places in the past few months.

**Google might be harder to get rid of than expected**

Roku‚Äôs current biggest partner for their Smart TV‚Äôs is the Chinese company, TCL. TCL has become a rapidly growing company in the United States and sells great devices. If you look up Roku TV‚Äôs, you‚Äôll see an overwhelming amount of TCL‚Äôs. Well TCL, which since 2014 has exclusively sold to Roku, is now selling Android TV‚Äôs as of late last year. The partnership will most likely last a while as TCL is now producing android powered smart phones. This puts Roku in the crossfire of possibly losing market share in TCL TV‚Äôs hence reducing its total sales of TV‚Äôs. Especially because a large reason individuals buy TCL TVs has nothing to do with Roku but because of the quality of the TV. So, although google has fallen behind with Chromecast, the android TV could cause increased competition and a direct hit at Roku TV market share. Although losing TV doesn‚Äôt affect profit that much, it does lose costumers which can lead to future lost ad revenue.

**We are no longer in a pandemic**

The US is factually getting out of covid, and more people are getting out. Although this might be good for devices being bought (although with the chip shortage this could change) it is horrible for ad revenue especially with new users expected to slow so much in the US. 

Roku will most likely settle out as users lower their viewing habits, abet not as low as pre-pandemic levels but enough not to sustain the insane levels of growth priced into Roku stock. This won‚Äôt just affect Roku, but it will affect them more than other companies due to their lack of global market share. I would expect to see viewership growth to slow down over the coming years.

**Chip Shortages**

Chip shortages have decreased margins considerably on Roku devices as their CEO has committed to not raising prices, this makes sense because remember Roku needs to get individuals their devices to get ad revenue from them, so they are willing to take heavier losses on their players. I wouldn‚Äôt expect Roku devices to change considerably as input prices continue to increase. Gross margins turned negative for player items, and my assumption is that it has only gotten worse. Not to mention other input prices and shortages.

**Amazon is Closing in, in the United States**

Amazon this year has officially sold as many devices (CTV specific) as Roku and as far as number of users‚Ä¶ Amazon will have caught Roku by 2023 and will have over 100 million users by the beginning of 2022, rapidly catching Roku. Roku in my opinion has zero moat. Their success has really been due to the success of TCL. I personally, and I have no data to back this up, don‚Äôt know anyone who goes out to specifically buy a Roku TV, most individuals want a smart TV and TCL provides a quality TV for a cheap price. Competitors such as Amazon and Google have a moat since users of other google or amazon devices benefit from using their ‚Äúhome‚Äù system whereas Roku is just used as a TV servicer. Amazon will most likely not lose customers because as people integrate amazon into their home, they are much more likely to keep their FireTV. Roku has no reason really for users to stick with their product if a better one becomes available. I believe this is why FireTV will actually start eating away at Roku‚Äôs market share especially as other bigger cable servicers start offering similar services such as Comcast (who just recently launched a plan to sell CTV devices giving away peacock on those devices to pull in customers). So, although Amazon is the only competition right now, I think it will get more competitive in the future and Roku does not have much to fight against that competition.

**Yeah, Roku is a bubble, a pretty big bubble.**

 Roku has blown up since the beginning of 2020, going up roughly 400% (1200% over the past 3 years) in their stock price which is intense. The reason is due to the huge gains in their high margin category of platform revenue. At current prices they would have to average 75%+ gains in net income and FCF to warrant a valuation of 40+ billion dollars. It just doesn‚Äôt make sense for them to continue to average gains like that when they just introduced their ad revenue (so obviously it would get a big initial boost), their user growth will most likely slow down, and interest rates along with tapering are set to rise. When the Fed shows any sign of pulling back M2 the market will pull back significantly because everything is in a bubble. A bubble acts as a Ponzi scheme, so right now at current valuations, investors are making money based on the fact that future individuals will keep buying, nothing to do with business fundamentals (this is pretty universal in any ARKK holding). So when the Ponzi scheme runs out of new money (M2 decreases, from tapering, or interest rates, etc.) then like most Ponzi schemes, everything immediately falls apart and it‚Äôs not pretty. Right now with a 40% increase in free cash flow over the next 10 years (which isn‚Äôt really reasonable when you account for the risk and lack of moat associated with Roku) then you get a share price of a whomping $62!!! The current share price as of this writing is $344. Of course, Roku has a nice to cash to debt ratio because it sold 4 million more share this year then it did the previous year (more than a 40% increase) since the stock price is insanely high. This was obviously a good move but it makes their balance sheet look a little less healthy. Overall I think something closer to an average of 25% in FCF increase is much more reasonable to Roku over the long run and that gives a share price of roughly $20. With shortages, competition, and Fed reduction money supply (or inflation just causing interest rates to increase) this will all cause devaluation of Roku over the next year or 2. There is also the new risk of what happened with Apple's privacy and advertisers, if this starts becoming more common place this could reduce the effectiveness of Rokus Ad Platform (we see what happened with $SNAP), although Apple has been historically protective of user privacy compared to other companies.",finance

*****
&gt; An earnings avalanche is coming in the week ahead that could put the stock market‚Äôs recent gains to the test.
*****
&gt; Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon ‚Äî the biggest of big cap tech ‚Äî are among the 30% of the S&amp;P 500 companies reporting. A third of the Dow also releases results, including Caterpillar, Coca-Cola, Merck, Boeing and McDonald‚Äôs.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúNext week is the real test,‚Äù RBC head of U.S. equity strategy Lori Calvasina said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting a little bit in every sector.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Of the companies that have already reported, nearly 84% beat estimates. Earnings are so far expected to be up 34.8% over last year, based on actual reports and estimates, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe tug-of-war in good versus bad earnings reports has landed in favor of the market with the S&amp;P hitting an all-time high [Thursday]. That may run into difficulty next week,‚Äù National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said. ‚ÄúWe may finally be seeing some cracks in the earnings season.‚Äù
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average notched fresh records this week, and the indexes have solid gains for the week. The S&amp;P 500 gained 1.6% to 4,544, while the Dow ended the week up 1.1% at 35,677, the first record close since Aug. 16. Some strategists view the return to those highs as a signal the market is on track for a year-end rally.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq Composite was also 1.3% higher for the week, but it was down 0.8% on Friday as tech stocks declined.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre going to learn a lot from this reporting season,‚Äù Calvasina said. ‚ÄúSo far, so good. Better than feared, with no change to underlying demand. Companies are still managing through for the most part. Investors are punishing companies that aren‚Äôt, but they‚Äôre not punishing the whole market. The market seems very rational right now.‚Äù
*****
&gt; For instance, Intel shares were pummeled, falling more than 11.6% on Friday, after the company‚Äôs sales missed expectations. Intel warned an industry-wide component shortage hurt its PC chip business. But other semiconductor stocks did not get pulled down in the decline. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF was down about 0.8%.
*****
&gt; But Snap sent an industry-wide warning Thursday when its quarterly revenues missed expectations. The company reported that Apple‚Äôs privacy changes introduced earlier this year affected its advertising business. The company also said that advertisers were holding back due to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages.
*****
&gt; Facebook‚Äôs earnings on Monday will be closely watched for any similar comments, as will reports from Alphabet and Twitter Tuesday. The three stocks fell Friday as Snap plunged 26.6%. Facebook lost more than 5%.

&gt; ‚ÄúFacebook has been the more broken name. It had the Instagram problem. It had the kid problem. It‚Äôs had a hard time going up post-earnings. It will be interesting to see if all these problems are priced in or does it go even lower,‚Äù T3Live.com chief strategic officer Scott Redler said.
*****
&gt; Redler said the Snap news was a big surprise, since traders viewed social media as immune to supply chain problems. Even though social media was under pressure as a whole Friday, he said stocks have been able to diverge within sectors recently.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúTesla was able to make a new high, and Netflix is at an all-time high. Every group has winners and losers, but overall the participation is better than it‚Äôs been in a while. Five stocks aren‚Äôt driving the S&amp;P to the all-time highs,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bunch of stocks in every sector.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Traders are now watching the Russell 2000, since a breakout in small caps would be a positive for the overall market, he said. Redler trades the the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) which closed slightly lower at $227.41 Friday. ‚ÄúIf the IWM gets above the $230 to $234 area, it could be a signal for more risk on at the end of the year,‚Äù he said.
*****
&gt; Redler said the market could be challenged in the coming week. ‚ÄúYou just had a big 10-day move up. You would think there will be some digestion,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to chase the market here. It feels like we could rest a little bit next week. If it could digest here, and we could get some individual stock movement, that would be healthier than the pain trade, which is straight up.‚Äù
*****
&gt; There are a few important economic reports in the week ahead, including durable goods Wednesday; third-quarter GDP Thursday and personal consumption expenditures Friday. Friday‚Äôs data includes the PCE deflator, the preferred inflation gauge watched by the Federal Reserve.
*****
&gt; # Higher interest rates
&gt; The closely watched 10-year Treasury yield continued to edge higher in the past week, touching 1.70% before falling to 1.64% Friday. Market pros are watching to see if the yield will reach 1.74%, the closing high from March, and whether it will begin to worry stock investors. The 10-year yield hit this year‚Äôs intraday high of 1.776% on March 30.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI would say over the next week or two, it‚Äôs possible we test it, but I would be a little surprised at this stage if it sustainably breaks through,‚Äù NatWest Markets‚Äô John Briggs said. He noted that yields have been moving higher, as investors now anticipate the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates next year and as the market anticipates more inflation.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúI get a sense that people are more interested in buying here rather than selling,‚Äù he said. Bond yields move inversely to price. It could be a busy week in the market, as investors adjust for the end of the month
*****
&gt; Briggs notes the front end, or the 2-year note yield, has moved faster than the longer end. He said that reflects the market‚Äôs increased expectation for rate hikes next year, with two hikes expected by the market in the second half of the year.

&gt; # 9 Charts We Are Watching

&gt; Here are a handful charts that caught our attention recently.

&gt; Yesterday was the 34-year anniversary of the Crash of ‚Äô87. To this day market pundits still don‚Äôt quite agree on what caused the crash. As only Art Cashin can scribe, here were some of the worries at the time that lead to the more than 20% one-day crash on Black Monday: a historically overbought market (the S&amp;P 500 Index was up more than 40% for the year in August); worries over a currency war with Germany; a historic storm in London that closed markets the Friday before the crash, concentrated selling on the New York Stock Exchange; First Lady Nancy Reagan possibly being admitted to the hospital with breast cancer; and even potential worries over engaging with Iran. At the end of the day, stocks up more than 40% for the year in August was likely much of the trigger, as that is a very stretched rubber band.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.20.21-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 finally pulled back 5% a few weeks ago, after not doing so for nearly a year. But remember, the great majority of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 have already corrected at least 10%, with many down even more. This rolling correction has done a number on overall investor confidence though. According to the Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey, managers were the least bullish they‚Äôve been since October 2020 and cash levels hit the highest level in 12 months. ‚ÄúIt might be clich√© to say, but many managers moved to cash on the 5% pullback, leaving plenty of cash on the sidelines to eventually push stocks higher again,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.20.21-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, historically the S&amp;P 500 forms a major low near the end of October and has a nice rally to end most years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Blog-chart-3-10.20.21.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Building on the late October period, remember that the last few days of October and first few of November are historically one of the most bullish periods of the year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/blog-chart-4-10.20.21.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; A post-election year tends to see stocks bottom a tad earlier in late September. So far, this year is following this template nicely.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.20.21-blog-chart-5.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; November is quietly one of the best months of the year. In fact, it is the best month since 1950 and over the past decade. The past 20 years it is the second best month and in post-election years it ranks second as well. ‚ÄúNo matter how you slice it, November is known for turkeys, but maybe it should be known for bulls as well,‚Äù exclaimed Ryan Detrick.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.20.21-blog-chart-6.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is less than half a percent away from its first new high since September 2. Remember, it has made a new high every single month so far this year. Should it make another new high in October it could remain on target to join 2014 as the only year to have a new high every single month.

&gt; (Trivia stat ‚Äì The S&amp;P 500 peaked on September 2 in 2020 before a near 10% correction over the following weeks. This year it also peaked on September 2, but it is looking like 5% may be the most we‚Äôll see to the downside this time.)

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.1.21-blog-chart-7.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Speaking of new all-time highs, the S&amp;P 500 has made 54 so far this year, one of the most ever. The record of 78 appears to be safe, but with a late year rally this year could go down as the second most ever.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.20.21-blog-chart-7.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; As we noted at the start of the month, stocks have historically done quite well in October during an odd numbered year‚Äîyears without an election around the corner and no pre-election jitters. Well, 2021 is following suit once again, as the S&amp;P 500 is already up nearly 5% for the month, which would be the best month of October for the index since 2015.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.20.21-blog-chart-9.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; So there you have it, 9 charts we are watching closely as we wind down 2021.

&gt; # An Impressive 2021 So Far, But Flows Are Slowing

&gt; Yesterday the Investment Company Institute updated weekly fund flow numbers for the US mutual fund and ETF industry. As shown in the chart below, total mutual fund flows were positive this year but compared to the performance of ETFs, the inflows have been only modest at best. ETFs have logged more than $700bn in inflows, and while mutual funds avoided a fourth straight net outflow, their $66bn in inflows wasn‚Äôt that impressive. Across mutual funds and ETFs, bonds have been the massive winner this year, with more than $500bn in inflows. Equity funds record outflows over time as a mechanical result of equity retirements, but this year inflows have been the largest since 2014 with more than $210bn in buying across mutual funds and ETFs. About a quarter of total equity fund inflows so far this year have been dedicated to funds buying the domestic stock market. That‚Äôs the best year for domestic equity fund flows since 2014, and breaks a string of five consecutive years of outflows, though net flows have been stable for months now.

&gt; This analysis was first published last night in The Closer, Bespoke's end-of-day macro note.

&gt; # Late October Is the To Time Buy Stocks

&gt; As it is written in the 2021 Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac on October 21 on page 97, late October is the time to buy depressed stocks, especially techs and small caps. In the chart here taken from page 112 of the 2021 Almanac we divide daily data for the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks by the Russell 1000 index of the largest stocks since July 1, 1979, and then compress into a one-year seasonal pattern from July to June. When the graph is descending large caps are outperforming small caps; when the graph is rising, small caps are moving up faster than large caps. This year has been rather typical.

&gt; You will remember the November 2020 was a month for the record books for the Russell 2000. And then R2K topped out in March 2021 and has been lagging the big cap indexes since spring. Over the past couple of days the R2K appears to be perking up right on schedule. We just released a new small/mi-cap stock basket to subscribers in order to take advantage of the ‚ÄúBest Months‚Äù of the year (November through April/June) for stocks on the heels of our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal.

&gt; # Road and Rail Soar Above Air Freight

&gt; One major economic trend of the past several months has been supply chain constraints including logistics issues. Now in the throes of earnings season, earnings of companies related to supply chains and logistics (whether that be people or parcels) are beginning to roll in with four such names reporting in the past day alone: Kansas City Southern (KSU), United Airlines (UAL), Marten Transport (MRTN), and Knight-Swift Transportation (KNX). In the table below, we show all the S&amp;P 1500 Transportation Industry stocks that have reported since late September. Most of these stocks have beaten estimates on the top and bottom line with a few exceptions. While it is the one furthest in the rearview now, FedEx (FDX) was perhaps the worst of these missing EPS estimates and lowering guidance. KNX, on the other hand, reported a triple play this morning; one of the first companies to do so thus far in earnings season.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102021-TRAN-Earn-1.png))**

&gt; Two more transportation names, CSX (CSX) and Landstar System (LSTR), are also set to report earnings after the closing bell today, and over a dozen other names will follow up in the next week alone. These names could potentially be interesting areas to look for anecdotes regarding broader supply chain issues pressuring the economy, but turning to the stock price reactions, Saia (SAIA) has averaged the largest single-day gain on earnings averaging a 2.5% move across its 60 past earnings reports. Old Dominion (ODFL), Echo Global Logistics (ECHO), Hub Group (HUBG), and XPO Logistics (XPO) are the only others that have averaged greater than 1% gains in reaction to earnings. C.H. Robinson (CHRW) and Avis Budget (CAR), on the other hand, have historically averaged the worst reactions to earnings of this industry.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102021-TRAN-Earn.png))**

&gt; While there are still plenty of companies within the industry left to report providing plenty of catalysts for moves, since the closing low on September 30th, the transports have seen solid performance with an 8.79% gain through today. That move has not only lifted the industry above its 50 and 200-DMAs but it has also broken the downtrend that has been in place since the spring. Currently, the group is still down 6.1% from its 52-week high.

&gt; # 1-Year After 7-Month Winning Streak‚ÄìS&amp;P 500 Gains 6.37%

&gt; Going back to 1950, S&amp;P 500 has enjoyed 15 streaks of consecutive monthly gains lasting 7 or months. The most recent streak came to an end with September‚Äôs full-month decline. The longest consecutive monthly winning streak lasted 11 months and occurred twice, from September 1953 to July 1954 and from March 1958 to January 1959. S&amp;P 500‚Äôs average gain during these monthly winning streaks has been a solid 25.86%. The smallest gain was 9.09% ending March 1993 while the largest was a whopping 53.53% ending in April 1983. When past streaks ended, S&amp;P 500 performance following tended to be mixed and rather tepid compared to its performance during the winning streak. The month after the streak ends, 3-month, 6-month and 1-year after performance appears in the table above.

&gt; # Sentiment Surge

&gt; Over the past couple of weeks, the S&amp;P 500 has reversed higher, and the index is now only a few basis points away from the September 2nd closing high. With the rally, sentiment has taken a sharp turn towards optimism. The AAII reading on bullish sentiment rose for a second week in a row, climbing 9 percentage points to 46.9%. That is the highest reading on bullish sentiment since the week of July 1.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102121-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; While this week's increase was large, it comes on top of a double-digit rise last week. In total, bullish sentiment has climbed 21.4 percentage points in the past two weeks alone. That is the first time since November of last year that bullish sentiment has risen by at least 20 percentage points in two weeks. Going through the history of the survey, there have only been 17 other periods in which there were similar moves without another occurrence in at least six months. Overall, these instances have consistently seen the S&amp;P 500 move higher in the following weeks and months with larger than normal average and median gains. That is except for one year out in which performance has been slightly worse than the norm.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102121-AAII-20-pp-1.png))**

&gt; With the big jump in bullish sentiment recently, bearish sentiment has pulled back to 27.8%. That is the lowest reading since September 9th and the third week in a row in which bearish sentiment has moved lower.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102121-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; With inverse moves to bullish and bearish sentiment, the bull-bear spread stayed in positive territory for the second week in a row as bulls outnumber bears by the widest margin since the first week of July.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102121-AAII-Bull-Bear.png))**

&gt; Big gains to bulls also borrowed heavily from neutral sentiment as that reading fell from 30.3% to 25.4%. Similar to bearish sentiment, that is the lowest reading since early last month.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102121-AAII-Neutral.png))**

&gt; As for some other readings on sentiment, the NAAIM Exposure index measuring investment managers' exposure to US equities has also made a significant move higher this week. Readings in this index range from -200 to 200 where (-)200 would indicate responding managers are leveraged long (short), (-)100 would be fully invested long (short), and a reading of zero would be market neutral. At the end of last month, the reading fell to a low of 55 which was the weakest level since May. While the past two weeks only saw modest improvements, this week there was a surge all the way up to 98. The 33.6 point increase ranks as the fifth-largest week over week moves on record in the index dating back to 2006.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks. :)",finance
CryptoCurrency,"Friendly reminder that unless you got a 5.4% raise, you actually got a pay cut this year.","This pay cut comes at a time where billionaires' wealth increased by 2.1 Trillion dollars during the pandemic and politicians received millions of dollars in lobbying. Moreover, banks are also screwing you off. If you've deposited any amount of money for an interest rate lower than 5.4%, you are actually paying banks to keep your money and lend it to others for a higher interest rate. Crypto offers double digit interest rates, while banks will give u the bare minimum of 0.1%.

And no matter how much they'll try to convince you that inflation is ""transitory"", it isn't. The US for example, in the last 60 years has only had one inflationary year (-0.36%). That too in 2009 when the average person had to suffer the most. Inflation is out of control, and Crypto is the only way out.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,New Job - Attempting to calculate net paycheck amount.,"Good evening!

I have accepted a job with a significant pay raise and am attempting to calculate how much my net pay checks should be in order to avoid a surprise when it comes time to do my 2022 taxes. I've tried to use the IRS Tax Withholding Estimator but it doesn't seem to support changes in the future or estimating future withholdings, nor do any of the calculators that I've found online. I'm sure I could pay a professional to figure these numbers out, but I believe this is simple enough to get a ROUGH estimate myself. If you have a moment, please check over these calculations to see if my understanding of the US tax system is correct!

Relevant background info that I can think of:

 - My new salary will be $145,000/yr
 - I will be married filing jointly
 - My partner has no income
 - I plan on taking the standard deduction
 - I have 1 dependent
 - I live in Texas

Now for the numbers!

Pre-tax deductions:

- $8,700 in 401(k) contributions for the year
- $16,900 in healthcare premiums (health, dental, vision) for the year

This leaves $119,400 of taxable income.

FICA taxes: 7.65% of the above ~= $9,134.

Edit: FICA does not care about 401(k) contributions, meaning the total should actually be $9,800. Thank you u/blakeh95!

Federal income tax: 
I'm using the 2021 tax brackets as I don't think the 2022 tax brackets have been finalized. The projections appear to be in my favor so this should be safe if my goal is to avoid a tax bill in 2023. $119,400 - $25,100 for the standard deduction leaves $94,300 to be taxed. Filling out the lower tax brackets costs $9,235, then the amount of taxed owed on income above 80250 comes out to 22% * (94300 - 80250) = $3,091, meaning I should owe $12,326 in federal income tax. Subtract the $2,000 child tax credit, my total federal income tax owed is $10,326.

My total tax responsibility (FICA + Federal Income taxes) should be $20,126.10. $119,400 - tax means I should have a net income (post all deductions) of $99,274.90 for the year.

I am paid bi-weekly, so I should hope to see a per-paycheck amount of ~$3,818.

I think this is close to accurate, but I've never tried to do this math to this degree before. Did I miss anything obvious? Thanks for your time if you've got this far! I appreciate any feedback on my understanding. If there's anything that I've missed please let me know! :)",finance

**TLDR**:

Recently, the cryptocurrency market has become more and more exciting because of the rapid increase in the number of new participants. In the current situation of extremely low bank interest rates, more and more people with a demand for ""fixed interest rate loans of 10% a year"" will step into this market.

Applications like Outlet, Linus, Dharma, BlockFi, Celsius have developed user interfaces to meet this need, with liquidity coming from centralised liquidity pools or from Compound and Aave. Therefore, users' attention to decentralised fixed-rate products will be even greater.

# General Conclusion

Bonds are one of the most in-demand financial products to date. According to [Icmagroup](https://www.icmagroup.org/Regulatory-Policy-and-Market-Practice/Secondary-Markets/bond-market-size/), the total bond market is over $128Tn and the terrain is open for blockchain projects to penetrate the market.

Many new DeFi projects are looking at concepts found in traditional finance, such as:

* Fixed interest;
* Decomposing fixed income assets into principal and interest;
* Leveraged yield.

DeFi protocols are beginning to address basic concepts and meet the needs of many classes of users that TradFi cannot, because of crypto's nearly frictionless composability.

These protocols were born with the primary goal of uncertain and often volatile returns received when staking or depositing tokens for lending (Aave, Compound), trading (Curve) or actively farming (Yearn, Harvest).

# Traditional Bond

## Definition

A bond is a security issued in connection with a debt arrangement. The borrower (the seller) issues a bond to the lender (the purchaser) in return for some cash. A bond is an ""IOU"" (I Owe You) of the borrower. A typical coupon bond requires the issuer to make predetermined payments.

When the bond matures, the issuer repays the debt by paying the face value of the bond. The bond's interest rate determines the interest payment. The annual payment amount equals the bond's interest rate multiplied by the bond's face value. The coupon rate, maturity date and par value of the bond are part of the bond indenture agreement, which is a contract between the issuer and the holder of the bond.

## Types of Bonds

* Government bonds  
This is a type of security issued by a government for the purpose of raising medium and long-term capital for the government. Revenues from bonds can be used to make up temporary shortfalls of the state budget, to implement national construction projects, or to finance other government purposes according to the budget allocation plan. books every year.
* Local Government bonds  
These are bonds issued by the People's Committees of provinces and centrally run cities to raise capital for local investment projects and works.
* Government-guaranteed bonds  
This is a bond issued by enterprises, financial institutions, credit institutions, and policy banks of the State subject to the provisions of the relevant laws and guaranteed for payment by the Government.
* Corporate bonds.  
Debt securities are bonds issued by companies or financial institutions in order to raise capital for business activities.

personalfinance,Tips for handling renters insurance after devastating fire? Trying to help my partner not get screwed.,"My boyfriend had been living in a single family home that was turned into a duplex. Very old house (probably about 100 years old). Yesterday early morning, we got a call while at my place from his roommate that the entire upstairs portion of the house was engulfed in flames. Unfortunately, one of the roommates up there died in the fire. It was a devastating fire that destroyed the entirety of the upper unit. 

The bottom unit (my boyfriend and his roommates) had a burned wall, but the majority of the damage is water due to the fire hosing. It is pretty much flooded while the ceiling showing bad distress in certain areas. Lots of electronics, bedding, and various belongings are damaged.

KEY FACTS:
- Fire dept. has yet to release official report. Cause of fire is being investigated. There is a lot of speculation as to whether it was the landlords fault or something in the unit caused it.
- Partner filed a claim today with his insurance 
- Partner waiting to hear from an adjuster.
- We‚Äôve moved a lot of his stuff into my apartment 
- His insurance is getting him a hotel tomorrow
- They still need to investigate his policy
- His roommate has also started the claim process

solar,Help with Solar Quote - Michigan,"Hi Folks,

Reposting with the exact information related to our new Solar Installation!

Solar System size (8.74KW ‚Äì 103%) ‚Äì Current avg monthly electric bill $125

Solar Panels 23 - Silfab Elite Series 380W with Power Optimizers

We are not buying a battery/power wall as currently, we have net metering with our electric company (They buyback at full price).  The Total Cost is $23500. Federal Tax Credit 6K and Electric Company Rebate 2K on top of that. Final Price ‚Äì $15500

The cost will go up by around 2K if we install a SolarEdge Energy Hub inverter for an EV (Planning to buy a Tesla soon).

Not planning to go with Microinverters and top of the line LG panels as I think there is not that much more benefit to them, and there is a significant price increase.

What do you think of the setup? Also, should I go with the EV charger upgrade, or should I just have the slightly cheaper Tesla Charger installed?  With 125$ average monthly bill, does it really make economic sense to go with solar?

solana,Building a new housing system on Solana,"We‚Äôre building a new housing system where we provide the flexibility of renting plus wealth building of homeownership. 

A brief introduction to our solution. We implement 30 year rent-to-own contracts, where you obtain ownership of the home after paying rent for 30 years. Kinda like a mortgage but there‚Äôs no obligation to continue renting if you don‚Äôt want to. So if you wanna move house you can cash out part of your monthly payments kinda like the equity you would‚Äôve built up with a mortgage. If you move to an affiliated house and have been paying rent for say 5 years at the previous house, you can transfer this 5 year progress and only need to rent for another 25 years to get ownership of the new house. And during the period that you‚Äôre renting, there‚Äôs no landlord to deal with and you can renovate it however you like. You‚Äôll have to pay for maintenance. It‚Äôll be kinda cool to have that flexibility of renting but still get a home at the end of the contract.

We get the money to buy homes from selling stablecoins that work similarly to DAI but instead of being backed by Ether it‚Äôs backed by homes. Of course, we can only mint as much stablecoin as there are people who want to buy homes with us. There‚Äôs downside volatility so we need to compensate stablecoin holders with a savings rate. You can think of the savings rate as the interest rate that you get monthly just from holding it, no need for extra protocols. This comes from the monthly payments of the rent-to-own contracts. To add another layer of stability, renters make their monthly payments in the stablecoin so if it falls below $1, it incentivises them and arbitrageurs to buy it back. To further stabilise the price, we also have a governance token that‚Äôll be minted to buy back the stablecoin until it reaches $1. Supporters hold onto governance tokens for the long term as a portion of renters‚Äô monthly payments are used to buy and burn these tokens. So it‚Äôll go up in price as the supply decreases. We‚Äôll also have a reserve that overcollateralizes the stablecoin, funded initially by the sale of governance tokens. And finally there‚Äôs the house itself that we can sell as a last resort. All these are financed by the monthly payments that renters make. This is possible due to varying home price to rent ratios over the country. For example, a 200K home bought with a mortgage at 3% interest costs about 1K a month over 30 years. But a similar home would cost 1.5-2K a month to rent! This means we can pay stablecoin holders a 3% savings rate and still have left over money for operations, burning our governance tokens and building up reserves!

We‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts be it on the rent-to-own scheme or overcollateralization ratio! Any features or specifics that you think we‚Äôd might have missed out on? Do leave your comments below or dm us!",cryptocurrency

My country Australia is one of the few developed nations with a federal blanket ban on nuclear power generation implemented in 1999. The  *Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Commonwealth)* specifically states that:

&gt;The Minister must not approve an [action](http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/epabca1999588/s528.html#action) consisting of or involving the construction or operation of any of the following [nuclear installations](http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/epabca1999588/s528.html#nuclear_installation):

These bans are part of the reason why Australia is heavily reliant on coal for both electricity generation and export while other countries are transitioning away from fossil fuels.

In my previous post here, I suggested that I should leave the country to pursue a nuclear career and it appears that, while it is doable, it is highly difficult. Is it worth somehow fighting against these bans or should I indeed move overseas. An alternative idea I am thinking of is to join the Australian defence industry, in particular firms involved with the AUKUS submarines as it appears there is an exemption for those boats.",energy

2) Do you think a lender would be willing to settle on a lower amount such as this? 

3) Since this is a federal student loan, will they be able to know that I have and large sum saved up that I can easily use instead of settling for lower?

stocks,Chart-traders weekend update for swing-traders (totally TA based),"Dear traders/investors,

It looks like exciting times are ahead.

As always r/stocks does not allow me to post pics so I have to explain what I see. If interested in seeing the corresponding charts just ask for it in the comment section. I  don't want to get banned for providing free TA on major indices. Not worth it.

More investors need to understand that TA is not witchcraft and that one can make money simply based on chart patterns. My weekly updates should help with that.

Where do we start?

Let's start with tech

NDX 100: I was mocked, laughed at and whatever when I posted allover reddit hat the NDX100 put a short-term bottom in the last weeks. I had explained that the MACD readings were as low as in March and May 2021 and both times a 10% rally happened. I am not too invested longterm in tech because I think that we will get rising interest rates which will hurt the NDX100 but as a swing trader I had to pounce and bought a leveraged ETF (TQQQ) when the NDX100 was at 14600 on average. I closed out that position this week with a 15% gain simply because I think that we will shift back to a reopening trade again.

SOXL: The same happened for the Semiconductor trade. A double bottom was placed on 10-12 and confirmed 10-13 (position was opened) with the leveraged SOXL and the position was closed yesterday with a 17% gain.

Disclaimer: I own only long-term QQQ for my portfolios
I think interest rate hikes are bad for tech and therefore I only recommended the above short term investment.

But where do I think more money can be made until the end of the year? The Russell 2000. 

Russell 2000 broke the downtrendline in the daily chart and confirmed the breakout yesterday by bouncing right off.
The weekly chart had several candles resembling hammers before creating 2 green weekly candles. I expect an acceleration once people realize that more money can be made in the Russell 2000. I expect 10-15% from here.

Disclaimer: I own URTY and IWM

It is no coincidence that the DJI and S&amp;P plus financials made new all time highs this week. More indices will follow.

FEZ: The Eurostoxx 50 bounced nicely from the 200 day average and this week closed above the 50 day average again despite rising Covid cases in Europe. I expect FEZ to make new ATHs by the end of the year.

FXI: China made me some significant money. When the news were all over Evergrande and bashing China I posted here and in other subreddits that charts suggest the end is near. Guess how badly I was mocked that TA is garbage and China is bad etc.... Turns out charts were right. China rallied 10% since then and consolidates at this point around previous lows. If we can break above current levels $47 for the FXI should be possible (which is my exit point).

Disclaimer: I own FXI

On a side note. Since September 21 HSBC (Hong Kong based bank) rallied 20%. September 21 was also the latest low in the Russell 2000 because for some reason the Russell 2000 and international indices go together. September 21 was also the time where Forbes, BI, CNBC were most negative on China. After HSCB rallied 10% Morgan Stanley came out suggesting China is an investment opportunity.....
My portfolios also rallied 20% since September 21 and therefore the goal is to unleverage. That's why TQQQ and SOXL were sold this week.

EWZ (Brazil): Brazil is in chaos right now but like in China it might be a great investment opportunity because the news are as negative about Brazil as they were for China. Brazil dropped more than 10% last week. It broke below a trendline with high volume and made a hammer candle yesterday with again higher volume. We will need confirmation but if it stabilizes 10-20% are easily possible.

Disclaimer: I own EWZ plus options on EWZ.

Trading is fun if you have some guidance with TA. Sure TA is not 100% right but it can give you an edge when the news are either too negative or too positive.

Happy trades. Remember we are entering the best period for stocks soon.

personalfinance,Spacing out charitable giving to make use of the tax deduction,"The next few years we plan to do \~30k of charitable giving each year, but because the standard deduction is around 25k (married filing jointly), we will only be saving around 2k per year extra in taxes (40% - marginal tax rate - of 30k-25k=5k). I had the idea of stacking the charitable giving into one year - so 90k for three years instead of 30k each year. This way, I'd get a deduction of 90k one year, and save around 26k in taxes (40% - marginal tax rate - of 90k-25k=65k). Total amount of money saved would be 20k.

Two questions. First, is there anything wrong with that logic? Second, are there any other deductions that may affect this equation? I had heard of a deduction on federal taxes equal to the amount of state taxes you paid - is this a thing? I've never dealt with these things because I've always used the standard deduction.",finance
Electricity,Entire light string burned out but fuses intact.,"I have a halloween decoration lit with 2.5v xmas bulbs that suffered all bulbs burning out (interior blackened). I replaced the bulbs, tested inside, then put the decoration back outside. The wires and plug are water proofed. No rain or sprinklers. But they all burned out again overnight, to the last bulb.

The string has two fuses, both intact. What would cause the bulbs to burn out but not the fuses?

The decoration lasted for weeks, so I think the problem started when I switched to a new cord that is connected to my dusk/dawn sensor that turns on all my other decorations. I'll be reverting the one decoration back to a dedicated extension cord, but the underlying question is what would cause the entire string to burn out and not the fuses; and would being in a circuit with all the other decorations when dusk illumination resumes be different than being on a dedicated manually turned on connection?

Added pictures. You can see the cluster of bulbs in the wrists and skull.

I always assumed xmas lights were the same. Didn't expect the specs to be different. (but why did the originals all burnout (unless they were using the wrong bulbs, too?)

CryptoCurrency,Mega bullish: Japanese have 10 bank accounts per adult on average and their banks started going negative interest rate!,"Lately several central banks in Europe have implemented a negative interest rate policy aka NIRP on excess bank reserves in the financial system. Japan is the next country that will be affected with the NIRP. 

For a country where there are 7 national banks operating and many, many other megabanks and postal banks, residents are estimated to have as much as 8-10 accounts per adult on average. This is mega ultra bullish. Not resident but adult, keep that in mind. 

I used to live in Japan in my youth and people store insane amount of money across several different banks in order to get those sweet returns. And crypto is far from popular there. US and EU is years ahead in terms of adoption compared to Japan where its still almost unheard of to be holding crypto. People think Japan is super ahead of others when it comes to tech but its quite the opposite. Fax machines are still the king of sending the documentation and important data in banks. 

According to the data from Bank Of Japan, there are approximately 920,000,000 reported bank accounts in Japan. Given that there are about 125 million people in Japan and about 13% are children this brings you to about 10 accounts per adult on average. 


According to the latest [Statista report](https://www.statista.com/topics/7629/banking-industry-in-japan/#topicHeader__wrapper) the banks assets in Japan are worth above 18.5 trillion dollars. Coinbase knows that and thats exactly why they decided to go in Japan now. They see this opportunity of a lifetime.

CryptoCurrency,"Nobody went to jail for the 2008 recession: This is why crypto exists, this is why we are here.","TL;DR: A rant about banks and how ridiculously corrupt financial services are today.   


In the early 2008s, a bunch of wealthy banks decided it was a good idea to sell unbacked, sub-prime mortgages. This was the practice of giving mortgages to individuals that had so bad credit scores/ low income, it was nearly impossible for them to pay it back. To compensate for this 'risk', these *subprime* *mortgages* charged higher interest rates, which were FAR more profitable than the *prime mortgages* they were used to selling. As more and more banks piled on this train and the subprime bubble grew, it only would take a few defaults to set off an explosion. And that it did.

After the US banks bailed out these banks, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, just to name a few, were fined **fractions** of their profits. Only 54.4 billion dollars were fined from the largest banks involved, their crimes which had cost the global economy **30 trillion dollars of wealth**. Over 9 million Americans alone lost their jobs, or 6 % of the total workforce, but that wasn't even the worst of it. 

After these banks screwed up subprime mortgages, they used the bail-out money to robot foreclose MOST mortgages, which ended up in one of the worst real-estate dumps, and as a result, 13 trillion dollars worth of homeowner net worth was wiped clean. Robo-foreclosure is the extremely lazy, indiscriminate practice of EVICTING a homeowner and then LIQUIDATING their home to cover the bank's portion of the mortgage, without even considering the mortgage's quality or status. 

**And the crazy part of this all? NOBODY, NOT A SINGLE BANKER WENT TO JAIL FOR THIS.** 

All the youngster's still reading, you think this was bad? Research fractional reserve banking, the practice where banks routinely credit lend your deposited money for interest farming and then pay you a small surplus of what they earn. That's how banks earn most of their money, through lending. And oh my god, does it reak havoc. 

When your deposit of 100$ is blended to another bank at an interest rate, the credit present in the world nearly doubles. Banks are required to secure at least 10% of the original deposit, but the other 90% are lent out, creating 100$ of ghost money in your account, and another 90$ of real money in a loan borrower's account. And this happens successfully, 90$ gets loaned into 81$, and that gets loaned into 73$... Suddenly, an additional 144$ was created out of thin air from your deposit! 

Now when you withdraw your 100$, in a linear world, the 144$ of loan ghost money is suddenly wiped. Now think what would happen if more than just a few people took out their money. Does anyone here still remember the Greece Euro financial crisis? Everyone withdrew their money until all that was left was ghost money. BILLIONS of the inflated economy LOST in seconds. 

And here's just a list of atrocities banks have:

\- The fact that, by policy, your deposited money is not owned by you, but becomes the property of the bank, and that you have ZERO right to that money. 

\- The fact that over 35% of the US dollar's entire existence was printed from February 2020 to 2021. Don't believe me? Look below:

\- The fact that just like any other 'speculative asset', does the US dollar also have restricted liquidity. You probably wondering, if 35% inflation is backed up in a single year, why isn't everything on fire? Due to low distribution since the Pandemic has lowered spending, money doesn't exchange hands fast enough as of right now to fully distribute 35% inflation.

Bitcoin,I would like to tell you about my Simplex registration story...,"1. Completely buggy image verification system. I sent my passport in vain thirty times literally (only to find out that instead of national - that is, my civil passport (is written on the website clearly: ""please attach the national identification document"") , it turns out that a foreign passport is required (!!) and this is indicated by support in a letter a week later! ...

In general, I wonder why require a foreign passport ... I'm not obliged to have one as a citizen of the Russian Federation. Is this something that should somehow hinder the crypto operations via Simplex? Okay, so be it, a week later I started loading my foreign passport ...

&amp;#x200B;

2. Every time I attach documents, the system writes that photos are blurry, glare detected - I actually tried to attach it 30 times, I took pictures from the 8th iPhone, from Samsung, from different angles, under different light conditions, I even asked another person to take a picture of these documents instead of me (I thought it was from maybe my hands are crooked), the result is the same - blurry! ... idiocy, the system simply does not accept documents and that's it. This identification is not really well tested and instead of simplifying the verification of documents, it's just torturing people who want to register !! Passports always contain glowing security features, and they will always be blurry and make glares!

&amp;#x200B;

3. By some miracle, after completing the ""attach pictures"" exercise, from the attempt number 31, having lost faith in humanity, and also receiving robotic replies in Simplex chat - I proceeded to the window, which stated that photos I have uploaded are on ""manual verification""... This window just hung for another week without any changes. After this week of ""manual verification"" I was simply asked to try again uploading pictures to the buggy system ... Dear Simplex, where is logic?  I even mailed them already by that moment all required documents in high quality - all the same, they send only formal replies and asking you to perform clearly according to the algorithm, like robots ... In a response to my letter, they just repeated me a link, to upload all photos to this moronic system as if I have just registered.

So what do you think? I opened that link and saw a window which stated that ""manual verification"" is being carried out and there were no forms for uploading a photo ... Then there were 2 more iterations of useless correspondence with robots and their formal replies in chat and by mail, in style ""we will fix it now"", ""everything will be ok"" ... and another week of my time has gone...

&amp;#x200B;

4. After some time I again managed to upload all the documents and froze for another week on ""manual verification"". Deja vu... I wrote to them about all this in their chat, they promised to speed it up. As a result, thank you, they ""speeded it up"" ... Another week has passed and I receive a new request:

1. Certificate of criminal record (it takes up to 30 days to receive this paper from the police!)
2. Extract from all bank accounts, where I spent how much and how muck i have earned for 3 months (is this really necessary to open a simple banking account??? What will Simplex do with all my McDonnalds spending checks?)
3. Am I a politically engaged person? (Oh Really? They haven't googled that I am the former president of Russian Federation after a month of registration??)

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, In total, it has already been already 5 weeks since I started my registration in Simplex ... In fact, the account has not yet been opened, I continue sending and sending all new documents ... My requests, to somehow speed up this process, are replied with formal robotic answers that are in fact don't help much.

By today, I have sent an the statement from Sberbank with all my income and spendings for 3 months. Now I am waiting for the readiness of a certificate of no criminal record from the police (I have never ever been asked such document in my life, Simplex is the first company that asked me this shit).

&amp;#x200B;

If you want to lose a month of your life, chat with robots and achieve nothing, then apply for registration in Simplex. I wouldn't recommend Simplex to anyone, it's a terrible service. It would be easier to open an account in the most ordinary bank!

PS. I will by all means get them to open an account. I need it, because without it, you cannot issue a COTI debit card. Up to now it is 1 month that has passed in vain. I will write on how things are developing!

personalfinance,Homebuying or two rentals before moving - good idea or not ? Thanks in advance !,"I am planning a move from MCOL (Oregon) --&gt; HCOL (Seattle-ish) location to be close to my spouse. I have started applying for positions and am reasonably confident (but not 100% sure obviously) that I will land something in the next 6-8 months. Current and future positions for both of us are hybrid (30% onsite - 70% WFH) Here is my current financial situation.

For past 1 year we have been paying rent \~1200 in MCOL for myself, and another \~$2000 in HCOL where my spouse works = total \~3300 in just rent. To me it seems foolish to throw away this much money in renting when I can own a decent starter home (\~600K) for the same amount in HCOL - where I plan to move sooner or later anyways. This will be our starter home (5-7 years max).

I've two options -

1. Continue to spend 3500+ in rent (newer leases are much higher now ) and wait until I am settled in the new job/location - this will push home buying by year. This is double whammy - since I will throw away \~40k in rent alone and the home prices are predicted rise by 10-15%  (60-90K) accompanied with possible mortgage rate hikes. Conventional wisdom is to do it this way, so that I am actually settled in a new position and have a better idea of my workload and my commute. Based on the bump in TC and stock grants, I may also be able to afford more, but I could very well be priced out by then.

2. Second option is to take the plunge and settle in a home in HCOL NOW with locked low interest rate. Dollar-wise, this is a better option - but is a ""cart before the horse scenario"" - it runs the risk of me taking longer to find a job (i.e. longer duration for double rent/mortgage payments ) - or the rare chance of not being able to move at all. In this case, I can reduce my rent in MCOL by sharing apartments for some time. 

I am looking for experiences from folks who have done this as well as general perspective on the two options. You are welcome to poke holes in either plans or propose another one as well. Thanks in advance !",finance
personalfinance,401k vs PMI when buying a house,"My spouse and I are planning to buy a house in the $400k range. Our combined salary is $190k and we have enough saved for about a $40k (10%) downpayment + closing costs + emergency fund. 

I'm wondering which of these options would be best:
1) 401k loan to get to 20% - It is my understanding that my plan would NOT require me to immediately repay my loan if/when I change employers. Regardless, I do not plan to change employers in the next few years. I have $200k in my 401k at age 31. 
2) Eliminate the PMI asap - Contribute to employer match, and aggressively pay off mortgage to get to 20% paid down. I believe we would be able to do this in the first year, barring any unforseen expenses (big if, I know).
3) Prioritize maxing out our 401k contributions over eliminating PMI. This would likely take us at least 2 years to get to 20%.
4) Piggyback loan (80/10/10) - Avoid PMI while continuing 401k contributions. But would the higher interest rates/payments be worth it? I believe we would be eligible based on credit score, income, and debt.

When I say dollar it‚Äôs actually a CPI dollar in 2019 so actually it presently targets around $2.05. This makes it perfect money as it will keep ahead of inflation and if there was a currency collapse it would simply readjust. So in time an Ampl dollar will be worth more like a few bucks. 

It‚Äôs chain agnostic and can run across any chain. It‚Äôs completely decentralized now. Name a better way to store your wealth long term. 

The big innovation is Ampl is about to be composable so a stable version of Ampl will be minted and can be used anywhere from defi to exchanges.",cryptocurrency

financialindependence,Pay Down Debt or Invest? I Bonds as a Risk-Free Hedge.,"# Intro

A very common question in the daily discussion thread is whether to accelerate payments toward low-interest debt or invest the money in the market. Mathematically, if the market is *expected* to have a higher after-tax return than the debt, then it's optimal to invest in the market to get the higher returns and then apply those higher returns to repayment of the debt as late as allowable. The volatility of the market means that you have to be willing to take the risk the market may underperform in the relevant time period, making your bet a loss.

I bonds are currently a risk-free option to delay repayment of low-interest debt. **I bonds purchased in October 2021 and sold in January 2023 will have a guaranteed return of around 5.33%.**

****

# I Bonds Explained

[Series I savings bonds](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds.htm) are a unique bond offering by the US Treasury. The [Bogleheads wiki](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/I_savings_bonds) does an excellent job of walking the new user through the relevant mechanics, but I will summarize the high-yield points below.

* **I bonds can only be purchased through the Treasury.** The most common way to purchase them is electronically through the Treasury Direct website linked above.
* **I bonds are guaranteed never to lose money.** The will, by design and by law, return the principle amount invested plus an adjustment for inflation such that the minimum real return (before taxes) is 0%.
* **The typical purchase limit for I bonds is $10,000 per person per calendar year.** You can buy $10k in I bonds in Dec and buy another $10k in Jan. 
* **You cannot sell I bonds within the first year of purchase**, and if you sell within the first 5 years you forfeit 3 months' worth of interest.
* **I bond interest is composed of a fixed rate and a variable inflation-adjusted rate**, the latter of which is adjusted every 6 months.
* **I bond interest is taxed federally and state- and local-tax exempt.** 

I bond rates are set every six months in May and November, and no matter when you buy you will get 6 months' worth of interest at the prevailing rate at the time of purchase:

Issue month of your bond | New rates take effect
---|---
January | January 1 and July 1
February|February 1 and August 1
March|March 1 and September 1
April|April 1 and October 1
May|May 1 and November 1
June|June 1 and December 1
July|July 1 and January 1
August|August 1 and February 1
September|September 1 and March 1
October|October 1 and April 1
November|November 1 and May 1
December|December 1 and June 1

****

# I Bonds as a Risk-Free Hedge

From the above, I hope it is now plain that if I bonds are offering a nominal after-tax return that's higher than your low-interest debt, you can put up to $10k per year into I bonds, hold them for as long as the return is higher than your debt, and sell them for a profit. If you have the cash to put an extra $10k into your mortgage or student loan at 3% you could instead put that $10k into I bonds for 12-15+ months. **As long as the after-tax return on I bonds exceeds your other debt, you come out ahead with zero risk.** 

****

# Buy Now or in November? 

You may have heard that the annualized interest rate on an I bond is currently 3.54%, and will jump up in November to 7.12%. Should you buy now (in October), or wait for November? The key here is to realize that you always get 6 months of whatever the prevailing rate was when you purchased the bond, and you always get the future rate increases just offset. 

If you look at the table above, buying in October means your rates are set and reset in October and April each year. This means that if you buy now, you will get the 3.54% annualized rate from October '21 to April '22. In April '22, you will start getting the 7.12% annualized rate from April '22 to October '22. Starting in October '22, you will get whatever the rate was when it was reset in May '22. 

If you buy in November, you immediately get the November '21 rate of 7.12% (annualized). This lasts until May '22, when you start getting the rate that's set in May '22. If you buy in November or May of any year, you are ""on cycle.""

**If you will sell in October 2022** (and thus forfeit 3 months of interest from July-September at the Nov '21 rate of 7.12% annualized), wait until November '21 to purchase because by purchasing in November you will immediately start at the 7.12% annualized rate and the interest you forfeit will be whatever the May '22 rate is, which is almost certainly lower than 7.12% annualized.

**If you will sell Jan 2023 or later**, it is *likely* better to buy in October '21. You will get the 3.54% rate until April '22, then the 7.12% rate until Oct '22, then whatever the May '22 rate is until April '23. If the May '22 rate is lower than 3.54% annualized, you'll forfeit 3 months of that lower rate and come out ahead. 

****

# Other Miscellany

Remember to factor in federal taxes on your interest. If you get the guaranteed 5.33% interest highlighted in the Intro, remember you will pay federal taxes on this. If your federal marginal tax rate is 22%, you will have an after-tax return of 4.15%. This is still better than any other guaranteed money in 1 year and beats many low-interest loans out there. What I would recommend is that once you see the after-tax I bond rate drop below your debt interest rate, hold it for 3 additional months (i.e. the months you'll forfeit) and then sell. 

You can time the purchase and sale of I bonds to reduce the forfeited interest to 2 months and a few days. When you purchase an I bond, the sale is backdated to the first of the month and you are credited for interest for the entire month. So an I bond purchased on October 31 will give you interest for the entire month of October and act as if it were purchased on October 1. When you sell an I bond, you get no credit for a partial month, so it is in your interest to sell at the beginning of the month. So if you purchase on October 31, 2021 and sell on October 2, 2022, you will have owned the bond for 11 months and 2 days. You will get credited interest for 9 months (forfeiting the last 3 months), losing out on only 2 months and 2 days of interest.",finance
CryptoCurrency,"2008 financial crisis post is misleading, 47 bankers have been jailed, half of them just on Iceland.","Forty-seven bankers were sentenced to jail time for their role in the financial crisis, Financial Times research has found, dispelling the myth that no one was held personally accountable for the financial sector‚Äôs catastrophic failures.

The FT searched records and news reports from across Europe and the US to uncover how many bank employees and directors recieved jail sentences for issues directly linked to the crisis or the collapse of their institutions.

The data does not include traders and other bank staff jailed for their role in interest rate rigging, like the two [Deutsche Bank traders jailed](https://www.ft.com/content/c970a0c0-8b53-11e8-b18d-0181731a0340) for interest rate rigging earlier this year, or for rogue trading not directly linked to the crisis or a bank collapse, like UBS‚Äôs Kweku Adoboli, who is now [facing deportation](https://www.ft.com/content/3c77180c-a1a6-11e8-85da-eeb7a9ce36e4).

Iceland had far and away the highest incidence of jailing, accounting for 25 of cases. The country seized control of its banks in October 2008 and imposed capital controls which ran for eight years to stave off chaos.

Chief executives, account managers, traders and chairmen from four banks were sentenced to term of between six months and five and a half years for everything from market manipulation to ‚Äògross breach of fiduciary duty‚Äô.

Luckily for them, Iceland has some of the [plushest jails](https://grapevine.is/mag/articles/2011/09/27/doingtimeiniceland/) in the world, with an ethos framed around rehabilitation rather than punishment. Prisoners are allowed flat screens TVs up to 26 inches, personal computers and games, and can apply to leave as often as once a month after they have served a third of their sentence.

Eleven Spanish bankers were sentenced to jail time for issues relating to Spain‚Äôs 2012 banking collapse, [most notably Rodrigo Rato](https://www.ft.com/content/7f93082e-f9ed-11e6-bd4e-68d53499ed71), the former head of the International Monetary Fund who chaired Bankia in the run up to its collapse.

Ireland, where the ‚Ç¨67bn bank bailout bill forced the country into a sovereign bailout, jailed seven, but convictions of two bankers ‚Äî Bernard Daly and Tiarnan O‚ÄôMahoney ‚Äî¬†were later quashed.

The most controversial was the case of Aoife Maguire, a former assistant manager at Anglo Irish Bank who was convicted of ordering the deletion of records relating to the accounts of former chief executive Sean FitzPatrick. Ireland‚Äôs Court of Appeal ultimately found her eighteen month sentence was ‚Äúunnecessarily severe‚Äù, and shortened it to nine months, four of which were suspended.

The US, ground zero for the financial crisis, has jailed just one banker for issues relating to the crisis. Former Credit Suisse trader Kareem Serageldin was sentenced to thirty months in prison for artificially inflating the price of subprime mortgages, a financial product at the very heart of Wall Street‚Äôs unravelling.

personalfinance,Pay up-front or finance?,"I'm saving up for some renovations next year, targeting ~$50,000. I'm currently putting all of that money into S&amp;P500, acknowledging that I may have to delay the renovations if the market tanks.

I'm applying for a HELOC at the moment at a 2.24-2.99% interest rate. It's a variable rate, so I expect it may increase some over the next few years. That said, I will have 30 years to pay it off.

My question: By the time I'm ready to start paying for the renovations, I expect to have the $50k in my brokerage account. At that point, I face a choice: do I sell my S&amp;P500 equity or do I tap my HELOC?

I'm leaning HELOC:

* I would be borrowing money towards improving the value of the collateralized asset (the house). So I should recoup at least some of the money (expect &lt;50%), which decreases my risk.
* I will also have additional collateral (the $50k that I will have saved up), which I could sell to pay off the HELOC. Note that there is some risk due to market volatility.
* Finally, my household income can pay for any interest and principal. We're able to save enough today to fund the project with cash. We can just redirect that towards paying off the loan.

By my calculations, I should expect to pay in the low tens of thousands in interest for the HELOC over the next 30 years. But the money in the market should earn me high tens of thousands in returns over the same period.

solar,Advice on the solar quotes and panels,"Tesla vs REC Alpha BLK 365W vs QCell G10+ 400W vs SPWR X22 360W

I am trying to go solar in Austin, TX. Around 5.8KW system DC. I got quotes from SPWR in Feb and the sales guy was quoting me for E327 Panels. 15 E20 327 panels for $21,313 ($13,711 post FTC). I have been negotiating with him and got fed up and spoke to another sales guy recently and he quoted $19,265 ($13,255 after FTC and rebates), all cash for 15 X22 360w AC panels ($24K for 20 years 0.99% APR), 8530KWh annual prod.
Added $1.5 more when asked to add 1 more panel.
I got another quote from another company IES and they asked for $18,528 for 14 400W QCell G10+ panel with 12 years 2.49% APR ($13,711 after FTC), 7846KWh annual prod. and $19,709 ($14,585 after FTC), 2.49% 12 years for 15 REC Alpha 365W Black, 7979KWh Annual production. 
I should‚Äôve asked for all cash quote from IES, but SPWR quotes looked good to me until I saw a post on Reddit from 2 years ago where someone paid the same cost per watt for X22 360 panels.
IES is boasting they have the latest panels and good service while SPWR is giving ‚Äúsame as cash‚Äù option to pay for the full system in 18months.
I am trying to understand if I should compare the cost based on the annual production or the system DC size as DC size of SPWR is less, but annual production is more. 
I fought with IES guy for quoting me at $2.5/W after FTC for QCell based on the DC size and it seemed higher to me in Texas.
What is everyone paying and how do you guys calculate the cost/watt? I have scheduled another meeting with an IES rep this Friday and will take all cash quotes from him.",energy

Very little to do with conspiracies or paranoia, It's mostly a principled stance, where we've seen how incompetent our leaders are, and how they've completely failed at every step of this pandemic, and yet now, after all those failures, they are going to turn around and look you in the eye, and stick a needle in your fucking arm, and tell you; ""this is for you own good, this is the only way.""  
Meanwhile if I've gotten this far without getting sick, and nothing has changed except now 60% of people are fully vaccinated and another % has natural immunity, so my odds have only gone down. So why would I inject myself with a foreign substance produced by a corporation I barely trust, mandated by another organization, which I'm fully aware is incompetent? Well basically the only way I would consider it is if it's life and death, which is how the people pushing it like to frame it; Either you get the vax or you get the virus. What if I keep doing what I'm doing, and I get neither, and you leave me the FUCK alone?!

personalfinance,Best way to help friend?,"I have about 100k available to help out a friend - we‚Äôll call them J. I already have a reliable mid six-figure income, near-perfect credit score, and plenty of my own retirement savings and investments. I‚Äôd like to use this money to help improve J‚Äôs quality of life in a lasting way as much as possible.


About J
- $2200 monthly income after taxes
- single parent of one 3-year-old
- $70k debt in high interest loans between federal student loans, car loan, and medical bills
- $900 monthly rental in affordable housing complex for 2BR 
- $100 monthly daycare with federal assistance
- $300 monthly car loan payment 

J‚Äôs Goals
- pay off debt
- move to better neighborhood
- improve credit score 


**Debt**

I understand the typical advice for someone with low cash-flow would be to pay off the high interest loans, but I think that it is possible we could instead refinance with me as a co-signer to bring down the interest rates below 4% and pay them off more gradually. This way J could improve their credit score and still have effectively no debt. We could use more of the remaining money on other expenses. The majority of the debt is from federal student loans.
**EDIT**: Whatever debt I co-sign, I intend to pay the full amount myself. I am just considering this as a way to remove the debt from J's plate quickly without negatively affecting J's credit score.

**Housing**

The better neighborhood would mean about $1400-$1700 monthly rent for the amount of space J needs. I believe they should qualify for Section 8 benefits but I am unfamiliar with how that works. I‚Äôm considering either co-signing on a rental or buying a condo unit and renting it to J at a price they can afford. Also looking into setting up a rent to own contract so J can build some assets. It is a good area and I would expect the value to increase over the next 15 years. A condo unit would likely cost about $180k for this neighborhood and I could probably get around a 3% interest rate on a mortgage. I do not know the details on how owning a rental property might affect my taxes, particularly if I rent below market rate.

**Income**

J is a CNA. I‚Äôm not very familiar with nursing degrees but would love to discuss options with J about affordable schooling options or other methods to increase their earning potential. J has started running a small cleaning business on the side, but I don‚Äôt think they have considered any tax implications for this yet or how it might affect their current assistance benefits.

**Child**

Moving to the better neighborhood should help J‚Äôs child a good amount with a better school district and more safety. I could start funding a 529, but I‚Äôm concerned this might affect the child‚Äôs access to financial aid in the future. i don‚Äôt know the details of J‚Äôs current childcare assistance, but I would also be willing to contribute to those costs if it meant finding a higher quality option. 

**Investing**

I‚Äôm not sure whether it would be more beneficial to move a portion of the cash to an investment account and give it out more slowly. J really needs some increased means more quickly, though.

**Assistance**

I don‚Äôt want to leave money on the table if it is otherwise available. I plan to look more into Section 8, childcare benefits, and educational scholarships. I‚Äôm not sure what else to consider in terms of existing student loan debt and other general assistance. 

**Professional Consultation**

I‚Äôm not sure what kind of professional I should be looking for. Would they be willing to meet with me without J present? How much of J‚Äôs financial details should I expect to show them? Currently I have a credit report from J but not sure how much other information I should try to gather beforehand.

Thanks in Advance",finance
investing,Are there any asset classes from which one could expect positive real returns in a scenario of rising rates to contain inflation?,"Let's say the FED starts rising rates to contain inflation at some point in the future, which would hurt stocks. If this happens I want to have some exposure to asset classes that would benefit from an increase in rates. What would be the best options for this? Bonds are the first thing that comes to mind, but I can see some drawbacks, specially if we're talking about an inflationary scenario:

- Even with a rise in rates, nominal yields will likely stay below inflation on treasury bonds, yielding negative real returns. I don't see the FED rising rates to 3%+ anytime in the near future.
- I would have to hold the bond until maturity, selling it would be bad if rates keep rising because price is inversely correlated to yield. 

Are these assumptions correct? If so, are there better alternatives? TIPS does not sound like an alternative, its yield being bond yield minus inflation, so if bonds are below inflation so will TIPS (which is the current scenario, TIPS having negative yield). Gold price is inversely correlated to yields so it's a no-go. Crypto is high risk and I expect it would behave like so, with prices also falling, though it's hard to say. Are 1-2y bonds or CDs the best option here if I don't want to hold bonds for 10y?

Is there any asset class from which one could expect positive real returns in a scenario of rising rates?",finance
CryptoCurrency,Having issues with Pancake Swap / network fees and wondering if someone could explain what I'm doing wrong?,"Hey guys, a while back I used BNB on Pancake Swap to buy a poocoin called WIFEDOGE. I did it purely to experiment with how to use the app and didn't put much money in at all, but I still managed to turn $15 into like $4.

Last month I decided to convert it back to BNB, so I approved the transaction and then on the confirmation screen it indicated that after network fees I should have walked away with abkut $2.50 in BNB... but the final transaction amount under my history in Trust Wallet is $0. Not sure if it was a scam, if i did something wrong, or if there wasn't enough liquidity, but the $2.50 just vanished. I even pulled it up on BSCScan and it showed the $2.50 supposed value but then at the bottom said $0 as total value after the transaction processed. 

Even stranger is I noticed today while importing my data to Koinly that I still have some WIFEDOGE left in my trust wallet balance (even though I had told pancake swap to ""sell"" / swap the max amount possible when I did the transaction last month). 

So I was going to try to do another conversion to BNB to totally clear out the remaining balance of this shitcoin and get it off my portfolio, but it's showing $0.56 in network fees and a total earning of $0. I am so confused. Here are screen shots:

http://imgur.com/a/ohdFSDM

If my total value is $0, then where is the network fee being taken from? If I don't have any value for the transaction, where is it going to pull the $0.56 from? Because to me it looks like there is nothing to deduct it from? 

And my other question...Is there *any* way to get rid of the remaining WIFEDOGE or is this some kind of liquidity issue / do I just have to let it sit there in my account?

Very grateful and appreciative for any answers to the above questions, I feel like I'm missing something obvious here but none of it is making sense to me. I still can't even figure out why my first transaction netted $0 when I should have gotten $2.50.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Compound interest or how to earn money,"A lot of you might noticed that you can earn an interest if you stake or lend your money.

You might ask how long would it take to double the amount of your coins since that's something we all want, am I right?

Let me introduce the Rule of 72 to you then. According to that rule, to get an approximate time it'll take to double your investment is to divide 72 by the annual interest rate.

Now some examples to see it more clearly:

If your interest rate is 5 percents, it will take 15 years to double your coins.

With 8 percents, it would take app. 9 years.

Do you want to be faster and double your coins in 5 years? The rate should be then 14.4 percents.

Should you use compound interest on your coins? Definitely! Should you expect to double your $100, $1000 or $10000 in few months just from compound? Definitely not.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Something to note for those poor and wanting to get into using bots in the USA,"Long story short, this was the first year I was able to use bots. I wanted to see how well they would do vs natural trading.

What I found is it does make money, but unless if you have a ton to start with then it honestly isn't worth it. With tax tracking software, trading fees, and fees for the bot. It basically isn't worth it unless if you can make a ton of money with about a 5% ROI per month. (basically its a good tool for the rich. Not so much the poor)

Now here is where it gets nasty. If you're poor like me, then you can't afford a $40k CPA. This means you're stuck using some tracking software and that is it. The problem comes in with them being universal with LIFO or FIFO. From my under you can switch from LIFO to FIFO to LIFO sell to sell. But since the tracking software is universal this means you now have to pick one or the other. And sadly you have to stick with it or sell everything at the end of each year.

Selling everything automatically resets the long term timer (which you need to hold something for 12 months or longer to get into that anyways).

(FIFO is first in first out. It basically says what you're selling is reflected of your oldest stuff. So if you bought 100 something in 1990 and 100 now. Then sold 150 something tomorrow it will say 100 of that is from 1990 and the rest now. Which means 100 of that is long term tax bracket and the rest is short term. It basically is the reverse for LIFO last in first out.)

Anyways where the problem comes in is when you buy a given coin to hold. You later set a bot on the coin. With FIFO you could be seen as taking massive losses and gains. Since you can only deduct $3k in loss a year this means you will have to pay massive taxes gains you don't actually have due to how the bot and FIFO mesh. Running it through LIFO fixes this.

So where the big problem comes in is if you stake, mine, etc and you decide to sell. It would be mark under short term gains. This in the USA is automatically a higher tax amount and with the USA if you made less than $40k a year in long-term then there is no federal tax. So this means while you're paying less in taxes now. You also pay more later for normal stuff.

So why quit using the bot at all? Here is where the big kicker is. Tracking software tends to cost more per transaction. Meaning you will have to spend at least w cents per sell on tracking software if you use Koinly, you have to pay the trading fees, you have to pay taxes, and so on. And when you're gaining about 10 cents to 20 cents per trade. You're cutting it extremely close. And the profits between that and just normal trading. Normal trading always pays a lot more.

IMO bot trading isn't worth it unless if you're trading with something like $100k or even $1m to put into the bot. Like even if you don't make any mistake in oh you use a bot on a coin you already bought at a higher value (which still you will run into this problem with the nature of things). You realistically need to make $40k a year just to pay a CPA because if you ever get audited. It will be a nightmare for someone in poverty to get audited over 10k transactions or more.

Note it might become worth it if the tax system ever exclude crypto to crypto swaps. 

TLDR bots are a rich person toy.

Note I'm not a financial or tax advisor. This is just from my experience

CryptoCurrency,Regulatory ECHO - IMF and SEC do not want bitcoin ban,"As Bitcoin continues its October rally, news from the regulatory world is also creating bullish sentiment. Neither the SEC nor the IMF are calling for a crypto ban; instead, both organizations are advocating regulation. Good news is also coming from Germany and the President of Ukraine remains a crypto friend as well. Last week's Regulatory ECHO.

**SEC chief opposes crypto ban....**

After China's crypto ban, the guardians:inside of the US financial system have to take a stand. Because after the head of the U.S. central bank Fed, Jerome Powell, already spoke out against a ban on cryptocurrencies, Gary Gensler followed suit last week. At a hearing before the U.S. Congress on October 5, the head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) distanced himself from the approach of the government in Beijing. 

According to Gensler, regulatory efforts rather have an integrative task. It is important to ensure that the crypto space is integrated into the financial system, for example in terms of consumer protection and tax law. A ban on Bitcoin is also not within the SEC's remit.

Not only the SEC, but also the International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently took a stand on cryptocurrencies. On October 3, the organization published a report discussing crypto-related opportunities and risks for developing countries. On the one hand, the IMF acknowledges there that Bitcoin and blockchain technology open up potential for more inclusive financial services. 

However, according to the report, increasing adoption could also threaten financial stability in developing countries in the future. For example, if citizens prefer Bitcoin to local currencies that are weakened by inflation. In the long term, this would undermine the respective central bank and open up loopholes for tax evasion. To counter such capital outflows, the IMF calls for international standards in crypto regulation.

CryptoCurrency,No bans? Russia does not want to follow in China's footsteps,"Russia has no plans to follow in China's footsteps and ban cryptocurrencies completely, says Deputy Finance Minister Alexey Moiseev.

Russia does still have a law in place that effectively bans cryptocurrency payments. This has been in effect since January. Nevertheless, there are probably no plans in the country to completely ban crypto trading at the moment. This is according to a report published by local news agency Interfax on October 12. In it, Alexey Moiseev, the Deputy Finance Minister of the Russian Federation, comments. 

Accordingly, Moiseev believes that Russian citizens will still be allowed to buy and use cryptocurrencies on foreign exchanges. They would not have to expect any legal consequences as a result. Only crypto payments in Russia itself are currently prohibited. However, the purchase of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and others remains permitted.

Moiseev is not alone in this opinion. Some Russian officials, meanwhile, have floated the use of a digital ruble issued by the Russian Central Bank. This would not carry the same financial risks as BTC and other cryptocurrencies. 

For example, Anatoly Aksakov, chairman of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets in Russia, is of this opinion. He said last year that a Russian Central Bank digital currency could become an integral part of national settlements by 2024.

The Turkish currency Lira continues to plummet in value, it has lost almost 30% of its value in 2021 alone, and 80% of its value since 2012. In simpler terms, for someone holding Lira since 2012, their money has lost almost 80% of its purchasing power. Such a scenario is unthinkable for most people in advanced industrial economies.

[Dollar vs Lira charts](https://preview.redd.it/ui4b3d1sjgv71.png?width=2650&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1859da8888470d5a9a2b81272708b6546f1d596)

As per the latest central bank policy documents, inflation in Turkey is around 20%, while interest rates are around 18%. Turkey's  debt ratings all remain in junk grade. 

This is what flawed central bankers and terrible economic policy can do to your savings - all your money saved up in bonds and deposits can lose a huge % of value over time. 

Despite their failing currency, the Turkish central bank have ban crypto payments earlier in the year, terming the risks from crypto as ""too big"". Specifically, they blamed risk of ‚Äúnon-recoverable"" losses arising out of the usage of crypto, and banned companies from offering crypto transactions.

personalfinance,Putting $0 down on a car with a 1.9% rate,"We are in the unfortunate position of needing to buy a car in this crazy car shortage environment. Although I'm sure most would advise going with a used car, we have settled on a new car, so please put that kind of advice aside. We have ruled out leasing since our approach to cars is to own them until they die (aiming for at least 10 years but as many as we can get). The good news is we got $17,700 for our sadly totaled 8 year old prior car, way more than we had anticipated, enough to put a sizeable down payment on the new car. However, we qualified for 1.9% interest financing (60 months) even at $0 down due to our high credit scores. We budget tightly so working in a high monthly payment is not an issue for our cash flow. We have enough extra cash accessible to us that we could almost buy the car outright without touching our separate emergency fund which is 6 months of income and sizeable. This is all factored after maxing retirement contributions of $19,500 each in employer 401k equivalents and $6,000 each in Roth IRAs. If we invest the $17,700 in a taxable account over the 60 months it's more likely than not that we'll earn more on that money than we'll lose in interest with the 1.9% rate. Over the past ten years my investments have averaged over 10% earnings, but even if they only earned half of that we'd still be in the green a good amount. Plus the loan terms allow me to pay it off early or make extra payments as desired.

I realize the main downside is being upside down on the car loan, owing more than the car is worth. We might want to go for gap insurance. But even factoring in those costs, since we have the cash to cover it if it happens I'm not sure why it hurts more to pay the difference later in the event of an accident than it does to pay it now. The total I have to pay doesn't change, only the interest rate effects that, and in the meantime I could be earning more with my money invested. Am I missing something here? To me it seems like a trade off between the value of incoming new savings (which are forfeit to the higher monthly payment) vs the value of invested existing cash and the potential earnings on it.

personalfinance,Physician vs. conventional mortgage?,"Dual physician couple (30M/33F) looking to buy our first home in 6ish months. We currently make combined 280k for the next three years while my wife finishes training, will then be making \~500k. We are looking at houses costing \~500k and plan to live in it for at least 6-7 years. By time of purchase we will have 150k in a HYSA (emergency fund + house downpayment).  While we technically have enough for the full 20% down, I worry 50k left might be a bit tight for closing costs and an adequate emergency fund (esp as new homeowners).  My understanding is the main perk of a physician mortgage is you don't have to pay PMI, so our overall cost wouldn't be that different (obvs higher monthly payment because higher loan amount, but with less upfront cost it would even out).  **Does it make more sense for us to put 20% down with a conventional mortgage OR do something like 10% down with a physician mortgage?** ""Leftover"" money if we only put 10% down would go to emergency fund and then potentially invest some, since investment growth would likely outpace mortgage rate.

Other probably relevant details:

* Current retirement savings: 90k across various accounts (roth IRA/403b/457b) - just started making 280k this fall, before that was 120k, hence the relatively low retirement. 2022 budget includes maxing all eligible retirement funds (\~80k/yr)
* Combined student loan debt 670k. All federal loans on income based plans, we'll pay combined 900/month once repayment resumes. We are both on track for PSLF in 6 years.
* With our budget we can comfortably afford up to $3500/month for housing
* Excellent credit (780+)

Bonus question: I know that aside from no PMI the other big perk of physician loans is they won't hold our student loans against us. Would we even qualify for a conventional mortgage given our hefty student loans? Any other factors I should be considering?",finance

So why would someone had lent out more than one million shares and why someone had borrowed it at 50%+ interest rate... I would be curious to hear from people who understand the short interest better than me on why is it happening. 

I have never seen such a discrepancy in other stocks, so it puzzles me. I just cannot shake off a feeling there is a storm brewing under the surface of low liquidity trades and anemic price action.

stocks,The Weekly DD - Upstart (UPST) Full Stock Analysis: A potential FAANG?,"# UPST at a glance

UPST is a risk management company specialized in loans and financing. Their core product is a machine learning model which calculates risk which they tout as being more effective than traditional credit risk scores such as FICO. In an internal (biased to some degree) study, replicating the business models of three traditional banks, UPST was able to show 75% lower default rates and 173% more approvals at the same loss rate. With this core product, UPST is able to offer three services:

&amp;#x200B;

* Personal loans: UPST offers personal loans automatically through their online platform. Anyone can apply for a loan and get automatic approval/denial. Over two-thirds of their loans are approved automatically without any need for human intervention.
* Risk management score: UPST offers banks the ability to use their machine learning algorithm to perform credit worthiness assessments to either supplant or usurp FICO scores. Their lending program, when compared to traditional banks, approve 26% more borrowers and yields 10% lower average APRs for approve loans.
* Auto dealership loans: With the acquisition of Prodigy, UPST offers automobile dealers the ability to really quickly offer financing options to their clients. With UPST, dealers are able to save on average 90 minutes per deal as well as achieve higher PVRs (gross income per vehicle retailed) of up to 59%.

# The lending industry

**Personal loans**

Personal loans are individually requested loans for such things as paying off credit cards, starting a new business, refinancing vehicles, or paying off large expenses. The global personal loan market was estimated to be $47B in 2020 but to grow to $719B by 2030 with a CAGR of 31.7%. While the personal loan market slowed down during the COVID pandemic, it is expected to pick back up as the effects of COVID go away. This massive growth rate is driven in a large part by lower interest rates and higher borrowing limits especially within developing countries. In 2020, nearly 12% of all USA consumers had a personal loan and the median personal loan amount per family has more than doubled since the 1990s. As of 2021, commercial banks had given out $1.5T in consumer loans in the United States alone.

&amp;#x200B;

**Auto loans**

Auto loans are loans requested either by an individual or by a dealership for financing automobile purchases. The global automobile loan market was estimated to be $245B in 2020 and expected to grow to $394B in 2028 with a CAGR of 7.1%. This is driven primarily by a couple of factors. The demand for vehicles is growing in both developed and developing countries while access to finance has grown as well. Within the US, the average auto loan amount has reached a record high of $32K while volume has also reached an all time high with over 85% of new cars sold being financed through an auto loan. Auto loans are the third highest source of debt within families behind mortgages and student debts. Within the previous decade, auto loans has grown by over 80%.

&amp;#x200B;

**Consumer credit reporting**

Credit bureaus and rating agencies are responsible for providing data and scores about an individual‚Äôs ability to repay loans. In 2021, the revenues of this industry increased 4.1% to $12.7B with the four largest firms accounting for 60% of this revenue. This market is expected grow to $14.2B by 2024 with a CAGR of 4.3%.

&amp;#x200B;

# The financials

**Income statement**

UPST‚Äôs income statement follows the mold for a fast-growing company. Their revenues have nearly doubled every year with 2021 being no exception. This growth comes from their ‚Äúnon-interest income‚Äù which points to the fact that their personal lending program is not growing at the same rate as their risk management score program. In fact, within their own presentations, they talk about how 97% of their revenues take upon no risk as they are simply providing a risk score to banks, getting revenue from that service, and not necessarily offering loans themselves. This points to their primary focus being on expanding their credit risk machine learning model service rather than their own personal lending program.

Their selling and marketing costs have also increased same as their revenues, but it is increasing at a slower rate which is nice to see.

&amp;#x200B;

**Balance sheet**

UPST has a healthy balance sheet with $320M of cash equivalent assets and only $40M of current debts. The only significant callout on their balance sheet is that their total assets and liabilities have drastically decreased since 2018. You can see that in 2018 and 2019, they actually had more liabilities than assets which they have been able to pare down since then. So, while UPST has a healthy balance sheet, this is a more recent development and most likely largely due to the injection of cash and other assets they received through their IPO.

&amp;#x200B;

**Statement of cash flows**

UPST has a phenomenal statement of cash flows. Their operating cash flow has really picked up this year as well as their financing cash flow, which makes sense given their IPO (much of which was realized in 2021 rather than 2020). In general, they are building increasing cash positions through the years while reducing their cash loss from other activities. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Where UPST stands

**The bull case**

UPST is trying to disrupt FICO scores which are used by 90% of the US‚Äôs top lenders and they have a good case for doing so. As mentioned previously, their lending program, when compared to traditional banks, approve 26% more borrowers and yields 10% lower average APRs for approve loans. Furthermore, they have found themselves a sweet spot with near-prime consumers (consumers with a FICO score between 620 and 660) where their model approves 95% more consumers while reducing interest rates by 5.4% compared to traditional models. They are able to achieve all this while reducing failure rates on those loans. With this model, UPST and the banks they partner with are able to offer more competitive loan packages to more people, granting a broader population access to credit while reducing their overall risk profile. This combined with an already rapidly expanding personal loan market and UPST is in a good position for future growth.

&amp;#x200B;

**The bear case**

While UPST is certainly a growing company, their $27B valuation is extended. To put that in perspective, Transunion, one of the largest credit bureaus in the US has a valuation of $22B. Transunion has a 2020 revenue of $2.7B while UPST has a 2020 revenue of $227M. While UPST is growing much more rapidly than Transunion, it still has an absurd valuation in comparison. Proponents of UPST argue that they have various business models to generate revenue, but 97% of their revenues come from fees from banks or services with no credit exposure. This means that while technically they do more than credit reporting, that ‚Äúother‚Äù accounts for 3% of their revenues. Furthermore, 60% of their revenues comes from a single entity, Cross River Bank while 53% of their loan originations come from Credit Karma. Cross River Bank is always able to seek out different services and Credit Karma‚Äôs parent company Intuit can very feasibly expand into this area as a competitor. Basically, while they do have a best-in-market product currently, that is not guaranteed and a few key players can crash UPST‚Äôs business. Lastly, nearly all metrics and statistics regarding UPST versus traditional banking loan programs were self-procured and funded. There is very little independent research with their credit underwriting product and it is difficult to discern fact from marketing.

&amp;#x200B;

# The verdict

As UPST stands, I believe that they are overvalued after a 200% run to the upside in just 3 months. I completely support their business model and believe that they are a best-in-market company. However, even with their current rapid growth, they are fighting against decades of history with FICO scores and other traditional credit metrics. The banking industry is more known for stability than disruption and rapid change. While UPST is exerting pressure by offering their own loan program, it is obvious that this loan program is not a priority, for them it‚Äôs low growth with low investment. The scenario that justifies their currently valuation is if they very quickly join the big three credit bureaus (TransUnion, Experian, Equifax) while expanding very quickly within the auto loan industry. Their expansion into this business is still very early and its hard to predict whether or not it will work out. However, I do not believe that UPST will be able to penetrate into the big three credit bureau status due to the entrenched nature of FICO scores within banking.",finance

**TLDR**

We are creating dynamic systems and integrating the financial infrastructure into this new system. And this new system can integrate the current policies in place like fractional banking and reserve banking with capital efficiency. The innovation it brings now is dynamic monetary policy and reduced time lag in monetary response. We see an increasing number of papers being written on more robust monetary policies by central banks. They seem novel and to implement them to rewrite the current monetary system is difficult. But with algorithmic stablecoins we can experiment with these designs and study the empirical evidence of their efficiency. In this way we can build better monetary models for the future.

# What Is Stablecoin?

Stablecoins are crypto assets that try to reduce volatility by pegging the value to another asset. Thus, it is stable with respect to the asset. For example, the value of the stablecoin will often be anchored to another type of stable asset such as central bank money (USD, CHF, RMB, SGD) or a commodity (gold, silver, precious metals).

# Why We Need Stablecoin

&gt;Stay tuned for our algo stablecoin research paper coming out! It is a collaboration between Economics Design, Lemniscap VC and Bocconi University.

*TLDR: easy access to this new digital crypto space.*

Stablecoins appear to solve the biggest problem in the current cryptocurrency market, volatility. For traders or investors, they can convert assets to stablecoins to avoid cryptocurrency volatility without necessarily converting to fiat.

For stores, it is difficult for a company to accept payment with a cryptocurrency when there is a fluctuation of 20-30% in value in a short period of time. This makes the broad adoption of cryptocurrencies much more difficult.

Therefore, stablecoin is important as a bridge between the electronic market and the traditional financial market. The transition from fiat to cryptocurrency has been a lot easier since the advent of stablecoins.

As Erik Voorhees, CEO of Shapeshift said:

&gt;‚ÄúStablecoins are important in the same way that a bridge is important. You may not care much about the bridge, but without it, the beautiful land beyond is much harder to get to‚Äù.

# Types Of Stablecoin

How are these stablecoins created? Via various mechanisms which can be broadly classified into fiat-collateralised, crypto-collateralised and algorithmic.

## Fiat-Collateralised Stablecoin

This is the most popular form of stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market at the moment. The value of these stablecoins is often pegged to the value of real money at a 1:1 ratio.

The main feature of this type of stablecoin is that the total supply of it on the market must be worth the equivalent of the amount of money stored by the issuer.

To ensure the truthfulness of that, the issuers will be inspected, managed and audited by a reputable financial institution such as a bank or financial audit company.

The risk of this type of stablecoin is the risk that the issuer of the stablecoin cannot prove that the reserve amount is of equal value to the value of the stablecoin circulating in the market.

Some typical fiat-backed stablecoins: Tether ($USDT), TrueUSD ($TUSD), USD Coin ($USDC), Paxos Standard ($PAX).

## Crypto-Collateralised Stablecoin

Like fiat-backed, crypto-backed stablecoins are stablecoins that are collateralised by a crypto asset.

However, the difference between these two types of stablecoin is where the collateral is stored.

With fiat-backed, collateral is stored off-chain by reputable third parties such as banks or auditing firms.

With crypto-backed, collateral is stored immediately on blockchain (on chain) which is locked in by means of a Smart Contract. This brings transparency as well as decentralisation.

The risk of the form of stablecoin collateralised by crypto is the fluctuation of the price of the crypto coin that is collateralised.

To minimise that risk, these stablecoins have to increase the value of the collateral to a very high level to ensure that price fluctuations do not affect the stability of the stablecoin.

In case the value of the collateralised crypto is lower than the issued stablecoin, the smart contract liquidates the collateralised assets to ensure the stability of the stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins: MakerDAO ($DAI), Bitshares ($BitUSD), Celo, Reserves ($RSV).

## Algorithmic Stablecoin

This type of stablecoin is not collateralised by any kind of asset. Instead, to maintain stability, these stablecoins use an algorithm-based supply-demand elasticity mechanism.

The working nature of this stablecoin is similar to how central banks work with fiat money.

When the value of a stablecoin is too high due to increased demand, the issuer will bring to the market a quantity of stablecoins until the value of the stablecoin is stabilised.

And vice versa ‚Äî when the value of the stablecoin drops too low, issuers will issue bonds bought with stablecoins to attract speculators to buy stablecoins. This increases the demand for stablecoin which brings its value back to a stable level.

The risk of this form of stablecoin is that when speculators no longer buy bonds, that stablecoin will collapse. A prime example of this collapse is the Basis Stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins of this type: Carbon, Steeem Dollar, Bitpay Officical, Nubits.

The main feature of this type of stablecoin is that the total supply of it on the market must be worth the equivalent of the amount of money stored by the issuer.

To ensure the truthfulness of that, the issuers will be inspected, managed and audited by a reputable financial institution such as a bank or financial audit company.

The risk of this type of stablecoin is the risk that the issuer of the stablecoin cannot prove that the reserve amount is of equal value to the value of the stablecoin circulating in the market.

Some typical fiat-backed stablecoins: Tether ($USDT), TrueUSD ($TUSD), USD Coin ($USDC), Paxos Standard ($PAX).

## Crypto-Collateralised Stablecoin

Like fiat-backed, crypto-backed stablecoins are stablecoins that are collateralised by a crypto asset.

However, the difference between these two types of stablecoin is where the collateral is stored.

With fiat-backed, collateral is stored off-chain by reputable third parties such as banks or auditing firms.

With crypto-backed, collateral is stored immediately on blockchain (on chain) which is locked in by means of a Smart Contract. This brings transparency as well as decentralisation.

The risk of the form of stablecoin collateralised by crypto is the fluctuation of the price of the crypto coin that is collateralised.

To minimise that risk, these stablecoins have to increase the value of the collateral to a very high level to ensure that price fluctuations do not affect the stability of the stablecoin.

In case the value of the collateralised crypto is lower than the issued stablecoin, the smart contract liquidates the collateralised assets to ensure the stability of the stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins: MakerDAO ($DAI), Bitshares ($BitUSD), Celo, Reserves ($RSV).

## Algorithmic Stablecoin

This type of stablecoin is not collateralised by any kind of asset. Instead, to maintain stability, these stablecoins use an algorithm-based supply-demand elasticity mechanism.

The working nature of this stablecoin is similar to how central banks work with fiat money.

When the value of a stablecoin is too high due to increased demand, the issuer will bring to the market a quantity of stablecoins until the value of the stablecoin is stabilised.

And vice versa ‚Äî when the value of the stablecoin drops too low, issuers will issue bonds bought with stablecoins to attract speculators to buy stablecoins. This increases the demand for stablecoin which brings its value back to a stable level.

The risk of this form of stablecoin is that when speculators no longer buy bonds, that stablecoin will collapse. A prime example of this collapse is the Basis Stablecoin.

Some typical stablecoins of this type: Carbon, Steeem Dollar, Bitpay Officical, Nubits.

CryptoMarkets,Why Is Algorithmic Stablecoin Important?,"We provide over 100+ FREE crypto articles on our SubStack! :D (Link on our profile)

**TLDR**

We are creating dynamic systems and integrating the financial infrastructure into this new system. And this new system can integrate the current policies in place like fractional banking and reserve banking with capital efficiency. The innovation it brings now is dynamic monetary policy and reduced time lag in monetary response. We see an increasing number of papers being written on more robust monetary policies by central banks. They seem novel and to implement them to rewrite the current monetary system is difficult. But with algorithmic stablecoins we can experiment with these designs and study the empirical evidence of their efficiency. In this way we can build better monetary models for the future.

# What Is Stablecoin?

Stablecoins are crypto assets that try to reduce volatility by pegging the value to another asset. Thus, it is stable with respect to the asset. For example, the value of the stablecoin will often be anchored to another type of stable asset such as central bank money (USD, CHF, RMB, SGD) or a commodity (gold, silver, precious metals).

# Why We Need Stablecoin

&gt;Stay tuned for our algo stablecoin research paper coming out! It is a collaboration between Economics Design, Lemniscap VC and Bocconi University.

*TLDR: easy access to this new digital crypto space.*

Stablecoins appear to solve the biggest problem in the current cryptocurrency market, volatility. For traders or investors, they can convert assets to stablecoins to avoid cryptocurrency volatility without necessarily converting to fiat.

For stores, it is difficult for a company to accept payment with a cryptocurrency when there is a fluctuation of 20-30% in value in a short period of time. This makes the broad adoption of cryptocurrencies much more difficult.

Therefore, stablecoin is important as a bridge between the electronic market and the traditional financial market. The transition from fiat to cryptocurrency has been a lot easier since the advent of stablecoins.

As Erik Voorhees, CEO of Shapeshift said:

&gt;‚ÄúStablecoins are important in the same way that a bridge is important. You may not care much about the bridge, but without it, the beautiful land beyond is much harder to get to‚Äù.

# Types Of Stablecoin

How are these stablecoins created? Via various mechanisms which can be broadly classified into fiat-collateralised, crypto-collateralised and algorithmic.

It's really confusing looking at all these different options for buying points to lower rates, different closing costs and escrows, lawyer fees, etc. I've been researching for a week or so and my head is spinning. 

When you talk to a bank they of course say they're the safest and cheapest. You talk to a broker, they say the same thing.

If you aren't able to play the game, don't bother loading it up. If you can't be arsed to not run to the bathroom during matchmaking or decide to start cooking dinner, or whatever it is you decide to do which causes you to either time out, do us all a favor and just don't play. Let that spot fill with someone who will actually play the game.

If you plan on quitting the match because you don't like how it's going, don't play either. I'd rather you at least try and give it your all or just not play... You never know how the matches will go.

Let's go...

Newly covered today: 

1. Interesting small thread on how further stumbles by the Chinese economy could affect the global economy which in turn might impact crypto and Cardano. [https://twitter.com/i/events/1452290004433125378](https://twitter.com/i/events/1452290004433125378)
2. Here‚Äôs a very nice overview of the Maladex Whitepaper by ADA Whale that breaks down the hidden strengths of eUTxO for DeFi including programmable swaps composability. [https://twitter.com/cardano\_whale/status/1451835809913470986](https://twitter.com/cardano_whale/status/1451835809913470986)
3. The Cardano ecosystem maps are getting so big and dense that they can‚Äôt even display logos for the projects anymore. [https://twitter.com/Meapool1/status/1450576470133379072/photo/1](https://twitter.com/Meapool1/status/1450576470133379072/photo/1)

5. Check out this medium article explaining the validator underlying the Spacebudz Market. It‚Äôs very elegantly and concisely explained if you have no Haskell/Plutus understanding. It‚Äôs even more interesting if you have a tiny bit of understanding of Haskell.

3. Charles releases a new video on the Alonzo Update Proposal (on Aug. 7) being submitted so that we can go live on the 12th. He also gives some hints as to his thoughts on the short-term planning of some ‚Äúflavor of the week‚Äù blockchains vs. the long term planning of Cardano. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhujKbMpTEA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhujKbMpTEA)

14. One of Cardano‚Äôs biggest competitors is once again suffering network problems. This time it started out as just being characterized as (more) ‚Äúinstability‚Äù, then they started saying that something had caused the blockchain to ‚Äústart forking‚Äù. This followed their September 2 ‚Äúinstability‚Äù and ‚Äúperformance degradation‚Äù event.

20. Now one of Cardano‚Äôs most highly visible critics is implying that the Cardano community has something in common with anti-vaxxers. Unfortunately for him, it was one of his pet blockchains that was down a few days ago while Cardano just kept healthily trucking right along. [https://twitter.com/spudiot1/status/1438402783040790532](https://twitter.com/spudiot1/status/1438402783040790532)
21. Cardano is still crushing it in terms of daily transaction volume. [https://twitter.com/Eilert/status/1438521555638644746](https://twitter.com/Eilert/status/1438521555638644746)

23. Smaug gives us a rundown of how many actual Plutus scripts (19)are running on mainnet vs. timelock scripts (21k) as of Sept 17 and explains simple definitions for both. But, he also mentions down below how many Plutus scripts (213) are reportedly running on ‚Äúthe main testnet‚Äù not counting ‚Äúother Alonzo testnets‚Äù.

After the Senate hearing on Tuesday September 14th, Gary Gensler (SEC Chairman) gave a quote to a crypto publication indicating that custodial lending and possibly even staking platforms might be considered securities. This is very relevant for Cardano since it has non-custodial staking whereas many of its competitors have the kind of custodial staking that Gensler may have been contemplating.

36. The Hoskinson Center for Formal Mathematics has been established at Carnegie Mellon.

57. Cardano users on twitter piece together that Charles was talking about visiting [u/Pezesha\_Africa](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pezesha_Africa/) (in regard to microfinance) in Kenya. This is big because Pezesha operates in countries with a combined population of over $300MM.

58. Crypto twitter users try to depict US Whitehouse comments out of context to fuel an economic doom narrative. However, if you listen to the whole press briefing, you will understand that these comments were based on a ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenario involving the US debt ceiling somehow not being raised.

60. Remember! There is no mobile Daedalus wallet. There is no browser extension version of Daedalus. These are fakes! They will steal your ADA. [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1445380773096398853](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1445380773096398853)

62. Brazil is looking to follow the El Salvador example and accept crypto as legal tender with a new bill to be voted within days.

70. Representative Tom Emmer clashes with SEC Head Gensler over the direction of crypto regulation. However, it‚Äôs unclear how much Rep. Emmer‚Äôs solution (his Securities Clarity Act bill) would solve the problem given that it only relieves issuers of securities regulation burdens after they have already complied with the ‚Äúregistration or exemption‚Äù hurdle.

82. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce (cryptomom) gave a polite but scathing speech at the Texas Blockchain Summit where she laid bare all the problems with the SEC‚Äôs current approach to crypto. After her recent opinion piece and this speech, it‚Äôs fair to say that she and SEC Chairman Gensler are in open war over crypto. How this gets resolved will determine the regulatory landscape for Cardano and all of crypto going forward. Sadly, Gensler is in charge and not vice versa.

89. We got a nice Triple H update from Harrison/Hemsley/Hammond joined by Jan M√ºller in the October mid-Month Dev Update. We learned that we‚Äôll have a maintenance upgrade toward the end of October and then PAB a few weeks later. This is extremely important since it will finally allow for the last bits of dApp buildout. The PAB is already available on the tesnet. The test dApp the team is using is an NFT marketplace. The team is watching as we see high loads around events like NFT drops. But, the network is reacting as expected.

95. In the Cap Innovation &amp; Technology Initiative Fireside Q&amp;A, Charles mentioned he is talking to Colossol Labs about the possibility of having the Mammoth DeExtinction Project take place on his bison ranch. There are probably some obvious NFT or tokenization use cases there.

personalfinance,Going Insane Trying To Budget For My Future,"Graduated last year and finally got a job in field a couple months ago, now I'm trying to budget everything after doing my benefits for next year and I'm going mad looking at these numbers.

I'm 25, single, in metro Atlanta, no dependents.

I'm going to be ignoring my signing/retention bonuses for the sake of simplicity and just looking at 2 paychecks/month, but total income will be \~74.5k. Some numbers are estimated and I'll try to estimate on the high side. Parents pay for my phone since family plans are so much cheaper.

Income :

||bi-weekly|monthly|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Income|2670|5340|
|Taxes|500|1000|
|401k (10%)|267|534|
|Roth IRA (half goes to a self-directed account, half an automated chase account)|250|500|
|HSA|135|270|
|Benefit Premiums (medical/dental/vision/life insurance/etc.)|93|186|
|Net|1425|2850|

There is an ESPP but I don't plan to be here super long and their 5 year is not great, I figure throwing some cash into random stocks makes more sense

So the extra 2 checks + bonus (after tax) = 6k

Expenses :

|Rent + Utilities|\~700|
|:-|:-|
|Renters + Auto insurance (paid lump)|150|
|Car|350|
|Gas|100|
|Food|300|
|Student Loans (all federal, not sure on the actual payment but I owe 50k so I figure 1% makes sense)|500|
|Remainder (shopping/cash savings)|750|

I keep all my credit cards paid off (big purchases go to a chase sapphire since the MyPlans are \~10% APR), credit score \~760.

I just want a sanity check if these numbers make sense. Should I save more or am I good to buy dumb shit and vacation? I tend to throw spare cash into robinhood to try to grow it but keep easy access. My parents aren't great with money and my friends either make less or aren't as attentive to the future (like one saves way more than me but leaves it all in his bank account), so I don't have anyone to talk to about this. If I have done some basic math properly, between the HSA/401k/Roth I have 16.5k/year locked away in retirement accounts, plus throwing chunks of my bonus and the 2 extra checks into normal investment accounts, so \~20k or \~25% per year

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR Am I money-ing right?",finance
personalfinance,Just got my first paycheck and I think I'm paying too much in taxes. Can someone help me figure this out? (CA),"Hi, I'm a single person with two jobs (one full time, salaried job and one part time barista job). I just checked my pay slip for my full time job, which I started a month ago, and I'm paying a LOT in taxes. I claimed 1 dependent on my state tax form, and I get paid once a month.

CryptoCurrency,Do people still believe in Compound (Comp)? Or has peoples preference switched to AAVE?,"I was on Coinbase and saw the little spot where you can get the crypto for free by watching some videos. I thought the Compound information was very interesting so I decided  to look into it further. 

Ive seen the whole thing where compound had a glitch that sent millions to different people and then the CEO was trying to intimidate people to give it back. Of course all of that bothered a lot of people. 

I have also seen a growing popularity around AAVE. 

Having looked through recent posts most are just talking about the compound glitch and not necessarily the long term of the project.

So what do you degenerates think about compound in the long term? Is AAVE just the better move with its variable and stable interest rates?",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,Waiting for my house to sell to buy some coins,"Hey everyone!

First time posting on /r/Bitcoin and on reddit in general so it's a big step for me üòÖI've been on the bitcoin wagon since 2017. I have never made any big purchases, just every now and then when I had some money I could spend. But couple of months ago I bought *The Bitcoin Standard* after *Saifedean Ammous* and while reading it and finishing it recently I've been doing a lot of thinking and reflecting.

So the thing that hit me the most is inflation bubble we live in. How there is actually no real value behind our current money standard and since we wen't of the gold standard between the WWI and 1971 we've been forced to spend more ""thanks"" to Keynes and his theories on how an economy should be built and run.

Anyway I've been wanting to move away from debt for a couple of years and never as much as now. Therefore I'm in the process of selling my house, cashing out some money to buy some coins as well as getting rid of my huge debt. It's a slow process and I'm a bit impatient while watching the price pr. coin going up. Kind of hoping for a small dip soon lol.

I just wanted to share this, don't know why but have a great day and embrace your self for the future üöÄ

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

EDIT: I can see here many are saying that you need to drown your self in debt to be able to generate wealth. While that is true it makes no sense to me from an economic standard and it builds on top of Keynes theory which is absurd.

I am familiar to the real estate business since I know some people who've made a living off of it. To me it makes no sense that I can borrow money for a house that increases in value by 20 - 30% over a period of two years since I'm gaining 100-200% on the money I put in as a down payment. Let's take an example:

* I buy a house for 500K, where the downpayment is 20% of the listed price, so 100K.
* I sell the house two years later for 700K.
* Over a period of two years I've generated 200K just from owning a home. That is 200K in money being printed in a simplified way.
* I could go on now and buy a house with my downpayment of 300k. Meaning that I can buy a house for 1.5M since I only need 20% downpayment.

This example is not me just playing with numbers, it's real life example. I know there are a lot of factors that come into play like paying off loans etc. But If I was to rent out that house that means I can charge higher rent.

This is how the rich get richer while the poor get poorer because the world continues to accumulate debt that is never ever going to be paid. I genuinely believe that this is a bubble that cannot continue on the same path.

I'm not saying that you should sell you home and buy bitcoin. It's a matter of personal interest where you wanna put your money and how much you trust in it.",cryptocurrency
stocks,"Big Investor Bought Tesla, Plug Power, Nikola, and XPeng Stock","A large asset manager recently increased bets on the electric-vehicle industry with changes in its U.S.-traded stock investments. In the third quarter, DNB Asset Management increased investments in EV giant Tesla (ticker: TSLA), and tripled holdings in Plug Power (PLUG), a maker of fuel cells that run on hydrogen. It also initiated positions in embattled electric and hydrogen trucking firm Nikola (NKLA) and Chinese EV maker XPeng (XPEV). The bets appear to be mostly paying off, as three of the shares are comfortably ahead of the market so far in the fourth quarter. DNB Asset Management, a unit of Norway‚Äôs largest financial-services firm DNB, disclosed the trades, among others, in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

DNB, which manages more than $70 billion in assets, didn‚Äôt respond to a request for comment on the transactions. DNB bought 23,403 more Tesla shares to end September with 146,516 shares. Tesla stock managed to gain 9.9% in the first three quarters of 2021, compared with a 14.7% rise in the S&amp;P 500 index. But Tesla shares have surged 17% so far in the fourth quarter, topping the 5.5% rise in the S&amp;P 500. 

Tesla‚Äôs fiscal third-quarter earnings set a record, and analysts raised price targets. The company has been having an impressive run in China. Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently taunted [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos over who had a higher net worth. Tesla stock itself set a closing high on Friday.

DNB Asset Management bought 1.2 million more Plug Power shares to end the third quarter with 1.6 million shares. Plug Power stock slipped 25% in the first nine months of 2021, but so far in October, shares have surged 28%. Plug Power‚Äôs second-quarter sales beat expectations, and investors looked past its wider-than-expected losses, as the company is focused on growth. We noted earlier this month that Plug Power hasn‚Äôt been lacking catalysts. CEO Andy Marsh has talked up the company‚Äôs partnerships.

DNB bought 188,606 Nikola shares in the third quarter. It hadn‚Äôt owned any at the end of the second. Nikola stock tumbled 30% in the first nine months of the year. In July, Nikola founder and former CEO Trevor Milton was charged by federal prosecutors with making misleading and false statements to the company‚Äôs investors. Milton, who resigned from the company in 2020, denied wrongdoing at the time of the charges. The company is trying to distance itself from the charges, noting that the government actions are against Milton individually, and not against Nikola itself. The charges stem from Milton‚Äôs alleged actions from November 2019 to September 2020, while he was CEO. Nikola become a publicly traded company by merging with a special-purpose acquisition company, a transaction completed in June 2020. This month, however, Nikola stock rose after the company reached a lease agreement for 100 vehicles. Shares have lost half a percentage point so far in October.

The asset manager also initiated a position in XPeng, buying 12,060 American depositary receipts. XPeng ADRs slid 17% in the first nine months of the year, but so far in October it has surged 21%. XPeng, along with other publicly traded Chinese companies, face sregulatory risk at home. Yet China also holds potential, as seen by XPeng‚Äôs strong deliveries. Last week, XPeng announced an investment in flying cars.

CryptoCurrency,I'm hearing a lot of talk about NFT gaming and how it's the future of gaming. Let me tell you why that's false,"I've been a gamer since 1997, I also like my crypto. For those of you who like crypto (particularly NFT's), but aren't gamers, here's a friendly bit of advice. Don't hold your breath for NFT gaming to happen. It will never happen, and here's why. It's pretty simple, really. Gamers fucking *hate* microtransactions. Period, full stop. But to explain how this came to be, you have to understand what video games are, and why people play them. Once you understand that, you will know why NFT's don't mix with video games. 

On May 15, 2012, the long awaited Diablo 3 game came out. This is one of the most popular and well-known video game franchises in the world, with it's successor having released 12 years earlier in 2000. Diablo fans had been waiting for this game a very long time. This game came out in 2012 with an in-game auction house, where players could buy and sell their gear for fake in-game gold, or real life hard currency, those greenbacks. This completely destroyed the game, and made national news headlines at least in the US. The game's developer and publisher were publicly flamed mercilessly on the internet by Diablo players until the developers decided to remove the auction from the game. This was such an outrage to gamers that this fiasco transcended the Diablo universe and enraged players who had never even played a Diablo game. The backlash against this had never been seen before, or since. That was a painful lesson for Diablo's developers and publisher, and was more or less the equivalent of a public execution in the town square for what's now commonly known today as microtransactions in video games. 

Since then, every time a game developer put microtransactions in their video games, they were publicly humiliated by the gamers that play those games, with countless lawsuits and even federal laws and regulations being put in place to prevent certain kinds of microtransactions. This is all public knowledge at this point, 9 years later, so you can PreSearch microtransactions in video games or Diablo 3 auction house to your heart's content.

For your own sake, I don't recommend investing in gaming NFT's. There's a long and bitter history of microtransactions in video games, and if that shit fiat currency can't even make it work, NFT's aren't going to fare any better. 

This is not financial advice, just the memory of a bitter Diablo fan",cryptocurrency

I think this could slow growth drastically, but we'll see what things look like in a few months.¬†

SPY is trading just under 454, and we could once again see some resistance up near ATH levels. This could make for some choppiness in the morning, I'll be watching the 454 resistance level.

QQQ¬†is trading just over 375. It's seeing some consolidation below ATH levels, if it holds up over the next few days, I'll be expecting a push through to new ATH.

personalfinance,Taking a higher interest rate on 30 yr mortgage?,"TLDR: Is there ever a scenario where taking a higher rate to get a lender credit makes sense?

So our current rate on our first home we are closing on is 2.75%

Our loan officer  brought up the idea of increasing the rate to 3.25% which increases our monthly payment by $222 but gets us a 14k lender credit to offset closing costs (bringing closing costs to zero).

The loan officer says that getting the lowest rate is not always best as you could put that extra cash to use on the house right away or to invest.

After 30 years we would be either paying the following in interest:

$386,067.30 at 2.75%
$465,862.54 at 3.25%

$79,795 difference over 30 years, the life of the loan 

14k invested over 30 years at 6% return (market average last 20 years) = $66,000 (plus the 14k initial investment so 80k) 

$79,795 - $66,000 = $13,795.00

Unfortunately the math is not as simple as above doesn‚Äôt account for the interest reduction  or taking the 14k to make a home improvement then having the home appraised next year. 

We currently have 88 Loan to Value (LTV). Our house appraised at purchase 82 LTV. So it‚Äôs likely that next year if the market stays strong, we pay down some of the mortgage, make some home improvements we can get below 80 and then get rid of our PMI.

We are on the fence.

Any guidance is greatly appreciated!! Thanks üôè",finance
CryptoCurrency,Unpopular Opinion: The current economic situation will screw cryptocurrencies really hard in the winter.,"TLDR: inflation and energy costs are going to hurt crypto mining and households will probably lack liquidity, so we might look at a potential sell-off in the winter, before we finally finish this cycle next year.

&amp;#x200B;

I am overall seeing a fairly positive outlook for crypto in the next few months, but while I think November should be a great month for crypto, I think there is cause for concern for the upcoming winter. I'm not here to spread FUD, just trying to remain level headed and realistic, and that's why I've added in my sources. Please do comment below your opinion on this.

I think before I give a bit of a road map for where I think bitcoin is headed, let's review the current economic situation.

**Inflation:**

Inflation has already been drastically increasing in the west especially with the current limitations of the supply chains, and the quantitative easing due to corona. More money being thrown in, means higher demand, and therefore prices and add on top what is now being termed: ""the great resignation"", where in July alone more that 4 million Americans resigned from their jobs, leading to companies working understaffed, resulting in inflation.

(increased demand leads to shortages - The Economist)\[[https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/10/09/the-world-economys-shortage-problem](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/10/09/the-world-economys-shortage-problem)\]

**Rising energy prices:**

Energy. Today we are reliant on electricity for everything we do. From mining bitcoin to calling your loved one, to working. However last year's very cold winter, and the COVID pandemic meant that a lot of the energy companies used up their stocks of oil, gas and coal, and most importantly DID NOT REPLENISH THEM THIS PAST YEAR DUE TO LACK OF INVESTMENT UNDER COVID. This means today we are faced with a situation, where with the economy kickstarting back to life, the demand for electricity and energy products in general is soaring but the supply cannot follow. This means higher energy prices, which will not get any better in the winter due to even higher demands. In an other situation, local governments could forcibly cut the electricity at some points during the day or to specific less ""economically valuable"" sectors.

\[Hidden Bitcoin Risk?\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rex-h4vkELs&amp;ab\_channel=CoinBureau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rex-h4vkELs&amp;ab_channel=CoinBureau))

**How does this affect crypto?**

Boy oh boy, in so many ways... First and foremost, let's talk mining. Please bear in mind I am no expert on this matter, and if someone wants to complement what i say in the comments, please do feel free! Anyway, mining today requires of course energy to find that famous 60 digit (?) number needed to mine a block. With energy prices soaring, this could lead to a lot of companies first and foremost stopping mining bitcoin because it isn't profitable anymore, or even forcibly being cut off from electricity due to the lack of ""economic value"" that is perceived to be created from bitcoin. This will drop the hash rate, and make processing transactions slower, probably deterring new investors from coming in. Then with the situation of inflation and the energy crisis, well, it will probably lead to households lacking liquidity in the short term until the government can put in place some contractionary policies, and until the winter is over, and thus the demand for energy products lowers. Needing more liquidity, will mean taking money out of investments, crypto will inevitably be included.

&amp;#x200B;

Knowing this, we have to turn to some bitcoin analysis because anyway we know that it will dictate what the asset class does. There are different theories as of now on the direction for bitcoin in the upcoming few months, but the main theory is that the market cycle is not in. Moreover, some analysts have noticed the similarities between the 2013-14 market cycle and the current one. But basically the general consensus seems to be a double peak cycle like the aforementioned one. The key difference in consensus is for example CryptoCrewUniversity  saying the market cycle top could come this upcoming month, and Benjamin Cowen talking about a much longer market cycle that could extend into next year.

\[Bitcoin price prediction - CryptoCrewUniversity\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wECZvQ5twzc&amp;t=3s&amp;ab\_channel=CryptoCrewUniversity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wECZvQ5twzc&amp;t=3s&amp;ab_channel=CryptoCrewUniversity))\[Bitcoin The Beauty of Mathematics - Benjamin Cowen\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIrLzZMxthA&amp;list=PL-094UzhjjyywsqlHcL-JyyuwRsxfI7bA&amp;ab\_channel=BenjaminCowen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIrLzZMxthA&amp;list=PL-094UzhjjyywsqlHcL-JyyuwRsxfI7bA&amp;ab_channel=BenjaminCowen))

I would like to therefore propose a theory that would take into consideration all of the aforementioned information and merge it into one.

Bitcoin price over the next few months would look something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

[\*\*POTENTIAL\*\* Bitcoin price action in the next 9 months](https://preview.redd.it/lgar0l6lnlv71.png?width=1813&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e62c237ae5990f955dc6bc2957b45aafe97d2f88)

I would like to propose the triple cycle top theory. Let me explain it.

First and foremost, we take from CryptoCrewUniversity's theory that the market cycle top is going to come in in November, however, I will argue that we will get rejected before reaching it by the same bitcoin logarithmic growth band as in April this year (which would then be at 100k, a level which anyway could provide resistance since it is a massive milestone). This would be the second peak. Such a rejection would also be fuelled by the inflation and the energy crisis that is inevitable, and could cause a drop until basically 40k in my opinion. This level would correlate with both the logarithmic band that held as support in July and is the level we held support at in September before we went on the current move to 69k (nice.) . Anyway that would probably mean that in early March the situation might slowly start to clear up with lower demand for energy coming out of the winter and the governments finding solutions to the inflation. We could then finally do another repeat of the move in august to now, with the same move to the middle log band, down to the bull market support band, and then finally the final rally to 150k and above, being the third and final peak, which could correlate then with the longer market cycle theory put forward by Benjamin Cowen.

I'm able to refinance with a bank who will give me 2.25%. The caveat is that it's technically not a loan; it's a line of credit. 

Would this negatively affect my credit score and therefore my ability to qualify for a home loan down the line? My thought is that a credit line is revolving credit, so my revolving credit utilization will suddenly look very high. My current credit score is \~780-800, FYI.

Buying a house in the next few years is a huge priority for me, so if this line of credit structure would make me less likely to get a home loan then I'll probably just hold off.

cybersecurity,Combining Orgs,"As mentioned in a previous post, I've recently joined a non-federal government entity as their first security hire. I'm starting to get my head around initial requirements, but I've encountered a unique challenge. The entity that hired me was recently created as a combination of several other disparate organizations. Each operated independently for decades with their own 1 or 2 person IT helpdesk.   


I've targeted CIS v8 for regulation compliance, but I have no idea how to generate any kind of uniformity between the legacy organizations. Some log, some don't. Some asset tag, some don't. Even where there is compliance, different groups have different solutions for compliance. Despite being a single entity for more than a year, everyone still treats the network as if nothing has changed.   


So... baby steps. CIS control #1 is inventory management. Do I start from scratch with a uniform solution, or do I somehow try to use what currently exists? Do I choose an extant solution in use by one group and uniformly implement it across the new org? How do I choose one solution over another? Any recommendations?",technology
CryptoCurrency,"How are ""reflections"" accounted for on taxes?","I've been deep diving into crypto tax to prepare myself for next year, since this is the first year I've actively traded. Most of what I do is just buy-and-hodl, but there are times where doing this requires some token swaps (which are considered taxable events since you're selling one coin of value for another), so I decided to try out Koinly based on recommendations here.

It does work pretty well for the major exchanges, at least at first glance, although closer to tax season I do intend to look over it with a fine-tooth comb to make sure everything looks good.

However I am confused about one thing, which is the concept of coin reflections. I have barely used Trust Wallet/DeFi at all, but decided to test it out by purchasing three tokens that all offered reflections -- Baby Doge, WifeDoge, and EverRise.

What this means (as far as I understand it) is that you're rewarded for holding the coin by receiving additional distributions of coins over time. However, unlike with staking rewards I don't think they show up as a separate transaction.

So in the case of BabyDoge, for example, Koinly shows that I purchased about 5 billion tokens months ago, but my overall balance now shows 5.3mil tokens because I guess I've received 3 million for free just by holding. But there's no way to see these payouts, and the data isn't imported into Koinly, so on paper it still looks like I have 5bil, not 5.3bil.

So, I'm kind of confused how we are supposed to account for this sort of thing at tax time. I really doubt the value is high enough as of now for it to raise any red flags and I'm sure as long as I account for the amount purchased it would at least show that I tried to do the right thing if it ever became an issue in the future (and I'm sure plenty of people are in the same boat as me with relying on Koinly and probably not even realizing there's a discrepancy), but it would still be nice to know for future reference and for total peace of mind that everything has been accounted for. If I were fortunate enough to ever have a coin that really increased in value over time and became the next meme coin, and those reflections are suddenly worth a lot of money, it would be difficult to explain where they came from / what the cost basis was since there's just no record for that on the blockchain (as far as I can tell).

personalfinance,Cannot Access Equifax Report Online - Who Can I Contact?,"I pull my credit reports for all 3 reporting agencies (TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian) yearly, spread out throughout the year. Experian and TransUnion work perfectly; I can download a PDF of my credit report on the first try, every single time. Equifax, however, refuses to work. I haven't been able to get a credit report from them online in nearly 4 years.

When requesting a report online, Equifax asks 4 security questions to verify your identity. Things like ""You may have opened a bank card around July of 2017. What bank was it with?"" Makes sense, except Equifax bundles the questions and answers for these security questions with 1) your family members 2) people who share your name (and _NO_ other information - just your name) and 3) people who live at or have lived at any address that you live at or have lived at. 90% of the time, they ask about accounts that you have no possible way of knowing about, because they aren't your accounts and never have been. And clicking ""I don't have an account like that"" isn't an option because it's not the *correct* answer. Again, they're often (usually, but not always) asking about an account that *does* exist and *is* tangentially tied to you in some way, eg that account was opened by the person who lived at your current address, in 2006.

They give you two tries before they lock you out of requesting your credit online indefinitely. They still ""technically"" fulfill the federal requirements because you can request a report by phone or by mail. That would be fine, except then I end up with a 60+ page, double sided stack of papers crammed into a regular envelope that I have to manually scan to encrypt and back up on my PC.

Oh, and is it hard to get my report via phone? Do they ask tough questions to make sure your report is secure before sending it off? Nope, of course not. They ask for your name, address, and social. That's it. Report mailed.

If you make a MyEquifax account, they give you access to your credit report 6 times a year. Great, except the report is given page by page. There is no way to download it as a PDF, or even any way to view the entire thing on one page. Want to see the information on a credit card? You have to go to a new page. Want to see the record of payments for that credit card? New page. It's not possible to download or keep a backup of your report like this. Oh and the security for setting up a MyEquifax account is just about as useless as requesting a report by phone - name, address, last 4 of social, and boom you have access to the entire credit history, just in an extremely inconvenient format.

Federal law allows a weekly credit report until I believe April of 2022. I'm about to start calling them every week to have them physically mail me a report, purely out of spite, because this is such a pain in the ass to deal with. I just want a PDF. That's it. It's literally less work than mailing me paper, and I cannot find any way to contact them to fix this.

nuclear,Judgment of the Belgian High Health Council (HGR) on nuclear power,"&gt;Global warming caused by greenhouse gases is undoubtedly one of the most important  
&gt;  
&gt;problems and risks that need to be addressed urgently at the global level. Against this  
&gt;  
&gt;background, nuclear energy is regularly presented as an ideal and unproblematic  
&gt;  
&gt;alternative to fossil fuels in the generation of electricity, as part of an  
&gt;  
&gt;energy mix, because nuclear power plants emit almost no CO2 during operation, which is an  
&gt;  
&gt;undeniable advantage. However, the reality is more complex. Nuclear power has its own  
&gt;  
&gt;risks and raises serious questions, including the issue of very long-lived radioactive  
&gt;  
&gt;waste (several tens of thousands of years), the risk of serious accidents with consequences up to  
&gt;  
&gt;long distance and in the long term that can affect several generations, the risk of  
&gt;  
&gt;terrorism, the links to nuclear energy for military purposes and the proliferation of  
&gt;  
&gt;fissile materials for military use.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;It is currently recognized that the risk of a serious nuclear accident cannot be excluded  
&gt;  
&gt;not excluded, even in the best nuclear power plants, and Belgium is particularly vulnerable in this regard  
&gt;  
&gt;due to the characteristics of the sites concerned: close to major cities and international  
&gt;  
&gt;thoroughfares, saturated road network and high population densities. The HGR considers  
&gt;  
&gt;that, given the particular vulnerability of the Belgian sites, the continuation of this risk  
&gt;  
&gt;for another 10 or 20 years raises environmental, health and ethical questions.  
&gt;  
&gt;A major and inescapable weakness of nuclear power is the destination of spent  
&gt;  
&gt;fuel and radioactive waste and its potential impact on the health of  
&gt;  
&gt;future generations. According to the current state of knowledge, there is no  
&gt;  
&gt;alternative than deep geological disposal. Deep geological disposal entails the need for monitoring of the health of future generations.  
&gt;  
&gt;generations the need for monitoring and preservation of knowledge and memory,  
&gt;  
&gt;a burden they are likely to bear for a long period of time, possibly thousands of years.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Consequently, this solution must be considered difficult to accept from an ethical point of view  
&gt;  
&gt;considered difficult to accept. However, in the current situation, the other proposed solutions lead to an  
&gt;  
&gt;even heavier burden on future generations. As a result, the current generation is  
&gt;  
&gt;forced to adopt this problematic solution as the most ethically justifiable one.  
&gt;  
&gt;adopt. However, the HGR recommends that Belgium explore the possibilities of cooperation  
&gt;  
&gt;with neighbouring countries for the geological disposal of spent fuel. The HGR  
&gt;  
&gt;recommends drafting a national policy on spent fuel that clearly  
&gt;  
&gt;defined how (reprocessing or deep geological disposal) and when it will be  
&gt;  
&gt;treated; to establish the national policy on intermediate and high-level long-lived waste (B and  
&gt;  
&gt;C wastes) by deciding to place these wastes in deep geological repository  
&gt;  
&gt;repository, with particular attention to safety and accurate knowledge of the physicochemical characteristics of the waste; to improve the legislative framework for provisions  
&gt;  
&gt;matter of ensuring that they are adequate and available to Belgium at the right time; and finally to establish a societal framework for the management of the waste.  
&gt;  
&gt;available at the right time; and finally to establish a social governance that guarantees  
&gt;  
&gt;sound and transparent decision-making processes. The HGR also draws attention  
&gt;  
&gt;to the fact that it is essential to give a status to the spent fuel.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Without such a statute, it cannot be managed and the financial burden is  
&gt;  
&gt;transferred to future generations. It is also necessary to avoid a policy  
&gt;  
&gt;be pursued of unlimited storage at the sites of the power plants, which in the long run  
&gt;  
&gt;cannot be considered safe.  
&gt;  
&gt;The HGR emphasizes that the technologies known as Gen IV (Generation IV  
&gt;  
&gt;reactors) and which rely on permanent recycling of the spent fuel in order to recover the  
&gt;  
&gt;plutonium and uranium to be reused, with or without transmutation of long-lived  
&gt;  
&gt;radionuclides (lower actinides, but not fission products), are not a solution to the  
&gt;  
&gt;present radioactive waste and generate new types of waste and spent fuel  
&gt;  
&gt;for which no reprocessing processes currently exist at the industrial level. In this context  
&gt;  
&gt;the HGR recommends reflecting on the long-term objectives of the research that is  
&gt;  
&gt;carried out at SCK CEN (Belgian Nuclear Research Centre), in particular concerning the  
&gt;  
&gt;the Myrrha project).  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The HGR is also aware that an accelerated development of new  
&gt;  
&gt;technologies is underway, with the goal of developing smaller and safer reactors with  
&gt;  
&gt;less waste and less proliferation risk. Most of these are still in the development phase  
&gt;  
&gt;and thorough evaluations, including on safety, are still needed. Even though these  
&gt;  
&gt;even if these developments could create future perspectives, these reactors do not, in any case, offer a  
&gt;  
&gt;offer no solution to the current choices Belgium will have to make by 2035. Moreover, their use for  
&gt;  
&gt;Moreover, their use for military purposes casts a shadow over their compatibility with the principles of  
&gt;  
&gt;of sustainable development.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Regarding the risks associated with terrorism, the HGR recommends and supports the development  
&gt;  
&gt;of a comprehensive contingency plan for such situations. The HGR highlights the need to  
&gt;  
&gt;establish and maintain sufficient stocks of pharmaceuticals to mitigate the  
&gt;  
&gt;consequences of internal radiation contamination and to ensure that they are rapidly  
&gt;  
&gt;available to the emergency services, hospital services and the affected population. The  
&gt;  
&gt;HGR additionally draws attention to the specificities of terrorism  
&gt;  
&gt;caused by radiological accidents and on the need to properly  
&gt;  
&gt;properly trained and equipped. The HGR further notes that some terrorist  
&gt;  
&gt;acts are less concerned with killing people than with causing panic and confusion in  
&gt;  
&gt;society. Thus, the necessary means of communication must be  
&gt;  
&gt;prepared and deployed to try to prevent such panic.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The HGR further judges that the medical response capability in the event of a nuclear  
&gt;  
&gt;explosion of a nuclear weapon (either accidentally or in the event of a terrorist attack or war)  
&gt;  
&gt;would be completely exceeded. According to the HGR, the elimination of all nuclear weapons is the  
&gt;  
&gt;only way to avoid disaster. This objective is enshrined in the Treaty  
&gt;  
&gt;on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which Belgium has ratified, and recently even more  
&gt;  
&gt;clearer and more urgent in the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (2017), which 122 countries  
&gt;  
&gt;was negotiated and approved. Such as the World Federation of Public Health  
&gt;  
&gt;Associations, the World Medical Association and the International Committee of the Red Cross  
&gt;  
&gt;(ICRC) have done previously, the HGR recommends that Belgium seriously consider also signing the  
&gt;  
&gt;Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;There are misleading statements circulating in which it is claimed, in the name of science, that no effects can be  
&gt;  
&gt;claim that no effects can be ""attributed"" to ionizing radiation  
&gt;  
&gt;below a dose of 100 mSv (i.e., for most populations exposed to  
&gt;  
&gt;exposed to ionizing radiation after a nuclear accident or as a result of fallout from  
&gt;  
&gt;atmospheric nuclear bomb tests). The HGR emphasizes that such claims are inconsistent  
&gt;  
&gt;with current biological and epidemiological data (which undermine the scientific  
&gt;  
&gt;character of the prudent approach of the International Commission on  
&gt;  
&gt;Radiation Protection confirm a linear relationship without a threshold between exposure  
&gt;  
&gt;to ionizing radiation and the risk of cancer and hereditary effects) and lead to a  
&gt;  
&gt;minimization of the risks to be taken into account in policy-making.  
&gt;  
&gt;consideration.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The HGR also draws attention to the fact that new data on the effects of exposure to ionizing radiation have appeared in recent years.  
&gt;  
&gt;effects of exposure to ionizing radiation have appeared, which call for a  
&gt;  
&gt;re-evaluation of the risks of ionizing radiation at low and medium doses. These include  
&gt;  
&gt;are non-cancer effects, such as cardiovascular disease, effects on the brain and  
&gt;  
&gt;cataracts, through mechanisms of a new type not considered until now  
&gt;  
&gt;(epigenetic, mitochondrial and inflammatory effects as well as premature aging).  
&gt;  
&gt;Given the many lingering uncertainties and the implications of these new data for  
&gt;  
&gt;health, especially in children and unborn babies, the HGR recommends that policies to  
&gt;  
&gt;protect the public from the hazards of ionizing radiation should be guided by a  
&gt;  
&gt;precautionary approach. In particular, the HGR recommends that nuclear  
&gt;  
&gt;emergency plans include measures specifically aimed at protecting  
&gt;  
&gt;of children and pregnant women and that, as soon as the situation permits, these measures be implemented in  
&gt;  
&gt;all phases of a nuclear accident be implemented. Given the potential implications of  
&gt;  
&gt;these new data, the HGR also recommends that appropriate support be given to further  
&gt;  
&gt;scientific research on these effects and mechanisms.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The HGR notes that despite the progress made in Belgium in recent years,  
&gt;  
&gt;many challenges remain to make emergency plans more operational and effective at  
&gt;  
&gt;all levels of the different emergency services. He emphasizes that this is true both during the  
&gt;  
&gt;operating period of the nuclear power plants and in the period thereafter. The HGR points to a  
&gt;  
&gt;particular aspect that the corona crisis and the legal disputes that have  
&gt;  
&gt;emerged, namely the lack of a legal basis for the  
&gt;  
&gt;introduction of mandatory procedures or for imposing or supervising the adoption of  
&gt;  
&gt;measures that restrict individual freedoms in the public interest (such as, in the case  
&gt;  
&gt;of nuclear emergencies, evacuation or relocation).  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;As a result of all these elements, the HGR judges that from an ethical, environmental and  
&gt;  
&gt;health points of view, nuclear fission energy, as currently used, cannot be said to comply with the principles of sustainable development.  
&gt;  
&gt;is currently used, meets the principles of sustainable development.  
&gt;  
&gt;The feasibility and consequences of the shutdown of nuclear power plants in the context of the  
&gt;  
&gt;current energy transition at the Belgian and European level for the generation of electricity  
&gt;  
&gt;have been the subject of numerous analyses. The HGR concludes from the studies of, among others  
&gt;  
&gt;EnergyVille and the Federal Planning Bureau, among others, that an exit from nuclear power is possible for Belgium  
&gt;  
&gt;for Belgium, at a relatively limited cost, also in terms of CO2 impact. The Council also  
&gt;  
&gt;also wishes to emphasize that, regardless of whether or not 2 GWe of  
&gt;  
&gt;nuclear energy in Belgium beyond 2025, the transition will require a determined political will on the regional  
&gt;  
&gt;Belgian and European levels in order to ensure the necessary technological  
&gt;  
&gt;and industrial developments as soon as possible. One of the priorities is to have in place in good time  
&gt;  
&gt;combined cycle gas power plants in time and to plan the transition to blue hydrogen  
&gt;  
&gt;(produced with fossil fuels, but capturing the emitted CO2),  
&gt;  
&gt;which requires significant CO2 capture and storage or use capacities (per tonne of  
&gt;  
&gt;hydrogen is emitted 8 tons of CO2 - Proost, 2021).   
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; Investments will also be needed  
&gt;  
&gt;in the areas of energy storage, network management, the interconnections, the development of the  
&gt;  
&gt;hydrogen sector and the lifecycle and recycling of resource-critical  
&gt;  
&gt;consumer goods. The HGR also recalls that the majority of CO2 emissions  
&gt;  
&gt;emissions do not come from electricity production (barely 14% of the total), but from the  
&gt;  
&gt;heating of buildings (especially in the tertiary sector), transport and the use of  
&gt;  
&gt;in heavy industry and manufacturing, and that in these sectors  
&gt;  
&gt;these sectors, the necessary efforts will have to be made and more selective  
&gt;  
&gt;investments will be made. More specifically, transportation alone causes almost a  
&gt;  
&gt;quarter of total greenhouse gas emissions. Agricultural practices and intensive  
&gt;  
&gt;livestock production (coupled with an in addition excessive meat consumption, see the  
&gt;  
&gt;dietary recommendations of the HGR) also play a significant role in the production of  
&gt;  
&gt;greenhouse gases.  
&gt;  
&gt;Wat de modaliteiten van de uitstap uit de kernenergie betreft (onmiddellijke algehele uitstap  
&gt;  
&gt;of geleidelijke uitstap, voor zover de mogelijkheid van een geleidelijke uitstap nog steeds  
&gt;  
&gt;actueel is), concludeert de HGR dat er argumenten zijn voor en tegen de eventuele verlenging  
&gt;  
&gt;van twee kernreactoren na 2025 maar dat er geen markante elementen zijn die een keuze in  
&gt;  
&gt;de ene of de andere richting zouden ""opleggen"". Elke optie houdt risico's in, die weliswaar van  
&gt;  
&gt;verschillende aard zijn en verschillende implicaties hebben op economisch en ethisch vlak,  
&gt;  
&gt;op het vlak van de energievoorzieningszekerheid, van het leefmilieu en van de  
&gt;  
&gt;volksgezondheid.  
&gt;  
&gt;The HGR points out that after the (immediate or gradual) shutdown of the nuclear power plants, the  
&gt;  
&gt;nuclear safety risks will continue to exist and must be subject to the necessary  
&gt;  
&gt;controls and measures: temporary storage of spent fuel, nuclear research installations  
&gt;  
&gt;spent fuel, nuclear research installations (SCK CEN), industrial and medical sources  
&gt;  
&gt;and their production (IRE, BR2, cyclotrons), transport of sources, decommissioning of  
&gt;  
&gt;nuclear installations. The issue of nuclear waste management and its financing  
&gt;  
&gt;remains a heavy legacy. In particular, the HGR recommends that a decision be taken in the near future  
&gt;  
&gt;on the geological disposal of high-level waste. Considerable attention is still needed  
&gt;  
&gt;to nuclear emergency plans, both for our nuclear power plants while they are in operation and  
&gt;  
&gt;for the risks posed by foreign nuclear power plants located near our borders.  
&gt;  
&gt;borders. The risks of terrorism and cyber-attacks will also continue to exist, and one will  
&gt;  
&gt;be able to cope with them. Important points of attention in this regard   
&gt;  
&gt;will be maintaining sufficient nuclear expertise (including the training  
&gt;  
&gt;of experts needed in the future) and adequate funding of the  
&gt;  
&gt;Federal Agency for Nuclear Control, whose federal character must also  
&gt;  
&gt;be safeguarded.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The HGR would like to conclude by emphasizing that the necessary energy transition underway in  
&gt;  
&gt;Europe (Green Deal) and elsewhere must remain compatible with the principles of  
&gt;  
&gt;sustainable development and must not lead to new imbalances and new risks,  
&gt;  
&gt;particularly for the most vulnerable populations in Europe and around the world. There will be  
&gt;  
&gt;multiple (ethical, economic, sociological, etc.) challenges in terms of  
&gt;  
&gt;policy integration: respect for the environment, protection  
&gt;  
&gt;of water resources and water quality, attention to the health of workers  
&gt;  
&gt;and populations in mining countries, here and elsewhere, circular economy (extraction, design  
&gt;  
&gt;combating rapid obsolescence, recycling), concern for equity within and between  
&gt;  
&gt;generations (reasonable management of resources while ensuring access to raw materials for  
&gt;  
&gt;future generations), as elaborated in the SEPIA report (VUB,  
&gt;  
&gt;2011)..., .  
&gt;  
&gt;The HGR believes that this will only be possible:  
&gt;  
&gt;\- by accepting, in a spirit of critical modernity and fairness, that the paradigm  
&gt;  
&gt;of unlimited growth is called into question,  
&gt;  
&gt;\- by developing, at individual and collective levels, processes of innovation in the management of the  
&gt;  
&gt;public good.  
&gt;  
&gt;\-and by reflecting on a new economic paradigm not linked to  
&gt;  
&gt;consumption, as well as on creative processes of social equity and positive reinvention  
&gt;  
&gt;of lifestyles.

personalfinance,Student Loan Debt Soon Going to Report on my Credit,"So to get right into it, I have just under 4k student debt that has already been sent to collections from my school. (Long story how I got there in the first place). The collections agency has said that if the debt is not paid in full by Nov. 21st, that the debt will be reported on my credit. I make enough money to where I think that paying about 300 a month to have this paid off in a year is completely doable for me. My credit is hovering around 750, so i would hate to see that decline, though i know that most of my options will hurt it at least temporarily. 

I see a few options for myself:

1. I bank with Chase, and could pull out a personal loan from my Credit Card, with a 11% interest rate over 18 months. This would avoid any new hits on my credit. 
2. Open a new Credit Card that has 0% APR for at least a year, which would allow me to pay off this debt without paying any additional fees. This would open a new line of credit though, and hurt my credit age. 
3. Last option i can think of is a personal loan. The little bit of research ive done so far shows i can get a loan probably in the range of 8+%, depending on the length i believe. 

  
Have I missed options? What is the best choice here? If a personal loan is best, are there lenders that you recommend I look into for the best rate possible for a 12-18 month loan?

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, Oct 25, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 25, 2021**

The market continued its remarkable rally, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) recording a new intraday high for the second consecutive day, as market participants continue to digest third-quarter corporate earnings, which have so far largely come in better than expected. This week will be a massive one for earnings, with tech mega-caps Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG), among many other very important companies, reporting earnings.

Last Friday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed that the Fed is ‚Äúon track: to begin slowing the pace of quantitative easing, signaling that the US economy has recovered enough to sustain reduced Fed stimulus starting as soon as next month. I have been saying for months that I expected tapering to begin either November or December or this year. He said, ‚ÄúI do think it‚Äôs time to taper, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs time to raise rates.‚Äù This is music to my ears, I have also been saying for months that I remain bullish until the Fed begins discussing the possibility of raising interest rates.

In the September meeting minutes, the Fed noted that ‚ÄúParticipants generally assessed that, provided that the economic recovery remained broadly on track, a gradual tapering process that concluded around the middle of next year would likely be appropriate. 

Market participants are encouraged that despite persistent supply-side disruptions, which have only intensified as the holiday season kicks off, and labor market imbalances stemming from the pandemic. Participants noted that if a decision to begin tapering purchases occurred at the next meeting, the process of tapering could commence with the monthly purchase calendars beginning in either mid-November or mid-December.""

As of Friday, about 23% of S&amp;P 500 companies had reported actual results for the third quarter, and of these, 84% topped Wall Street's expectations for earnings per share (EPS), according to data from FactSet. The estimated earnings growth rate for the S&amp;P 500 was 32.7%, based on actual results and expectations for companies still yet to report as of last week. If maintained through the end of Q3 earnings season, that would mark the third-highest earnings growth rate posted for the index since 2010.

CryptoCurrency,If your in the USA would you also be OK if the IRS told us what we owe?,"I'm mostly doing this to rant, but after spending such a long time figuring out my tax situation since I'm in poverty and affording a CPA is out of the question. 

If you're in the USA would you give the IRS your wallet addresses and what not so they could tell you how much you owe?

&amp;#x200B;

This is mostly coming up because I'm looking at a bunch of different tax software (Cointracker, Koinly, etc). In short, my average year I get maybe $1k-$2k a year outside of investments. I'm disabled, working is pretty much out of the question, and I've tried many many many things over the years to get myself into a better life. But it is something when the gov (federal and state) says you don't owe taxes because you're too poor. 

I got into this a while back thinking it will help, and I honestly can see a path. But because the tax system is so screwed up and how I have to basically pay something to keep track of things like staking, transfers, etc. This means I must use some tracking software. In short I came down to finding the 2 best ones is Cointracker and Koinly. The problem with Cointracker is price. When you get above a transaction amount Cointracker cost more. Now where the problem really kicks up is depending on the plan with Koinly I found it cost between $0.10-$0.01 per transaction. This means when my staking rewards are 1 cent. I'm automatically spending more money than it cost to cover any fees, taxes if I end up owing, transaction cost, and so on. And since I'm in poverty. Every cent counts (which is why I post educational stuff on here to get moons once in a while. Everything counts to an extremely high degree.)

&amp;#x200B;

The only solution to all of this is if Koinly or the others give a massive discount which I can see as crypto does become mainstream and more competition is out there.  (Maybe even free ones that makes you the product like how FB does. And poor people like me would eat that up because of what I said above hint hint to any company looking into this and wants to have an extreme dataset of trading info to feed the AI.)

That or something like you just hand over everything to the IRS and let them figure out how much you owe. And like other countries you just agree to it or dispute it.

personalfinance,Multiple Incomes Tax Question- W4,"Hi all,

 Thanks for taking the time to read and respond.  So...I am a little confused by the new w4 form.  There are no exemptions like in the past.  We used to always just put one or a zero for exemptions and would get a small refund in April but nothing overly large.  I have two jobs and my wife just started a new job.  So in total we have 3 jobs and married filing jointly.

 We filled out the w4 for her new job and we needed to complete the Multiple Jobs Worksheet.  The results are having her withhold an additional $880 per pay period.  She gets paid bi-weekly so this seems like a large amount to withold in addition?  

 Also we assumed my job was the highest paying for the worksheet calculations but we were using my salary before any pre-tax deductions which might have been a mistake.  I am making 72,000 annually but we just started to have 24,000 put into 401k/457.  If we subtract the 24,000 then my salary would drop below my wife's new salary and she would be the highest job for the worksheet calculations.  Is this what we should do for the w4 form is subtract the 401k deductions and use that number for the salary? 

To add to the confusion just this month we started the 24,000 into the 457/401k ($2000/month) and my federal taxes for this pay period on my paycheck for my highest paying job were zero dollars? I also just changed my w4 to married filing jointly this month as well.

We want to make sure we do not have a huge tax bill come April but also $880 a paycheck seems like a large amount for additional withholding.  Maybe when married filing jointly one spouse has the majority of taxes taken out of their paycheck and the other has little (my recent paycheck had 0 dollars withheld for federal taxes and $82 for state).

I am so confused by how this all works.  Thanks for the help!",finance

personalfinance,Thoughts on my Personal Loan(s),"Hi PF,

I have been browsing and taken away good pointers, haven‚Äôt done a deep dive but feel like I better off then I was before I joined this sub. With that said‚Ä¶I would like to ask advice on a situation I have- most of you will have better insight than I do. 

Background: My wife and I upgraded our timeshare by adding points and of course buying in another $30k into the program. Express your comments and all that about timeshares but the deed is done and I use it to my advantage. I want your advice on how my credit could be effected and how I could impact it. 

So two weeks ago my credit got a inquiry when the time share finance company looked into financing the 30k. They looked and we got the 30k at 13%. 

A week and half later I went to my credit union and refinanced that 30k for a lower interest rate. I‚Äôm pretty sure the loans (timeshare + credit union) are separate hits but my question is how it effects my credit. 

Since I will get funded the 30k from my credit union to pay off the timeshare loan and they show as two separate loans on my credit report will it benefit me (credit score-wise) to let my timeshare loan cycle a month or two and then pay it off or is that not a thing? 

Asking because my friends credit card company told him to pay off his credit card, charge something for a month‚Äôs cycle, and then pay it off again to satisfy home loan lender/underwriters.  

Appreciate any constructive input!

3. Charles releases a new video on the Alonzo Update Proposal (on Aug. 7) being submitted so that we can go live on the 12th. He also gives some hints as to his thoughts on the short-term planning of some ‚Äúflavor of the week‚Äù blockchains vs. the long term planning of Cardano. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhujKbMpTEA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhujKbMpTEA)
4. Weiss Crypto lays down yet another very positive thread about Cardano. They acknowledge that they can‚Äôt see the future of Cardano, but they vehemently reject a lot of the anti-hype. [https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1435261343456768005](https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1435261343456768005)

7. Messari has updated its ‚ÄúInitial Token Distribution‚Äù chart to include a previously missing project and Cardano is still among the very best in the Gen 3 space in terms of broad public coin ownership. [https://twitter.com/CryptoIRELAND1/status/1435708439951552513](https://twitter.com/CryptoIRELAND1/status/1435708439951552513)

11. A Weiss Crypto analyst calls the smart contract launch an alleged event and also doesn‚Äôt realize we already have NFTS. The Cardano community was quick to correct the analyst. Weiss was then also quick to apologize. [https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436369016545857566](https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436369016545857566) [https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436402039085576193](https://twitter.com/WeissCrypto/status/1436402039085576193)

14. One of Cardano‚Äôs biggest competitors is once again suffering network problems. This time it started out as just being characterized as (more) ‚Äúinstability‚Äù, then they started saying that something had caused the blockchain to ‚Äústart forking‚Äù. This followed their September 2 ‚Äúinstability‚Äù and ‚Äúperformance degradation‚Äù event. It‚Äôll be interesting to see how well their community tolerates this in the future if it‚Äôs happening with their planned slashing model in effect.

20. Now one of Cardano‚Äôs most highly visible critics is implying that the Cardano community has something in common with anti-vaxxers. Unfortunately for him, it was one of his pet blockchains that was down a few days ago while Cardano just kept healthily trucking right along. [https://twitter.com/spudiot1/status/1438402783040790532](https://twitter.com/spudiot1/status/1438402783040790532)

25. Now the TX and NJ state securities regulators are after Celsius for crypto loans (BlockFi already got this treatment). Cardano loan projects should probably take note.

26. After the Senate hearing on Tuesday September 14th, Gary Gensler (SEC Chairman) gave a quote to a crypto publication indicating that custodial lending and possibly even staking platforms might be considered securities. This is very relevant for Cardano since it has non-custodial staking whereas many of its competitors have the kind of custodial staking that Gensler may have been contemplating. [https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/117675/crypto-lending-staking-custody-gensler-sec](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/117675/crypto-lending-staking-custody-gensler-sec)

36. The Hoskinson Center for Formal Mathematics has been established at Carnegie Mellon.

50. In late 2008/early 2009 it turns out Hal Finney was learning Haskell and trying to figure out how to reduce C02 emissions from a (future) widely used Bitcoin. That sounds a lot like Cardano.

52. Wow! It‚Äôs looking like Meld has landed a partnership with a mobile provider in Nigeria with nine million customers. Not many details out at this point (Sept 30). But, that certainly sounds like it could be gigantic. [https://twitter.com/MELD\_labs/status/1443548879966949382](https://twitter.com/MELD_labs/status/1443548879966949382)

55. The Wall Street Journal has dropped a video on stablecoins. A lot of the video surrounds the Tether dollar reserve controversy. It‚Äôs notable that Cardano‚Äôs Djed solves this.

57. Cardano users on twitter piece together that Charles was talking about visiting [u/Pezesha\_Africa](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pezesha_Africa/) (in regard to microfinance) in Kenya. This is big because Pezesha operates in countries with a combined population of over $300MM.

58. Crypto twitter users try to depict US Whitehouse comments out of context to fuel an economic doom narrative. However, if you listen to the whole press briefing, you will understand that these comments were based on a ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenario involving the US debt ceiling somehow not being raised. [https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1445059673401528328](https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1445059673401528328)

62. Brazil is looking to follow the El Salvador example and accept crypto as legal tender with a new bill to be voted within days. While the crypto in question is BTC and not ADA, we can hope that the biggest market cap project is just our gateway drug.

stocks,Important CCI data out today,"CCI data will be out in just over 3 hours along with US housing data. This is important as due to recent movements in CCI.

Gold is also likely to run bullish if this shows to be lower than the forecasted level. Coupled with the US housing data also out today there could well be some moves elsewhere in the markets due to the inflation and interest rate implications. If the index over performs the forecast (IMO unlikely due to the increase in energy, inflation and general economic concerns over the last month) then this could indicate an increase in demand for certain consumer products.

defi,Hedge crypto market corrections with defi borrow,"Is this possible ? (Apologies in advance if this has already been asked, I searched and could not find it)

Say deposit the crypto as collateral that  you want to hedge , borrow say dollar stable coins against that and close the borrow after the crypto  market corrects ? The dollar loan offsets the crypto loss with absolute capital value and not just some interest rate differential. Ie.  Have you effectively swapped crypto for dollars to mitigate a crytpo market crash ?

Additional question : as the crypto corrects the collateral shrinks but the dollar coin appreciates against the collateral, does the dollar coin appreciation protect the dwindling crypto collateral from a ""margin call"" ?",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Bear Market,"So this is my first cycle, been here since March, and I'm curious about the drop off. Is there a series of indicators when the Bull stops? Or is it just an Armageddon style sudden elimination?

My only experience is in the world of stocks, where the Fed keeps things pumping. 08 being an exception, but even then there were weeks of signs. People were trying to keep markets alive, others were trying to capitalize until the whole thing went down.

In crypto things seem to work differently, on a major scale. The West goes to sleep with a19% down market. The East wakes up to a buying opportunity. Seeing that I can see why some people think the Bull will never end. I think that's an impossibility, even for crypto.

So I would say the Bear starts when everyone what? Takes profits? Government crackdowns? Industry layoffs? All of the above? Not a lot of history to take in to account, I get that. I would like to know what sort of things to look for though.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,The amazing opportunities of stable coin staking and compound interest,"I've been thinking a lot about what my end game could be one day. I want to retire early, and even though I'm in crypto I'm still not the biggest risk taker. ( I'm sure some people would disagree)

Before I got in crypto I was in stocks, and I generally stick to low cost index funds. Not exciting, but fairly safe and steady. Stick money in them every month and come back in 30 years.

Now when you project index funds growth , you can use the historic average of 7%. Not bad, certainly better than any savings account these days.

But adding a few % extra can make a huge difference.

Enter stable coin staking / interest. Here we're looking at 8.88%(eg Celsius) to 12%(Crypto.com with caveats) , and even 20% (Anchor Protocol).

As I'm slightly risk averse, I'd stick with something like Celsius or Crypto.com, although there are still many risks here.

So anyway, lets say you make 100k on your crypto (after tax of course right) , and now you want to put that away for your future. 10 years is a good time frame. So what would each option get you? (for the sake of simplicity each example assume weekly compounding)

* SP 500 7% - Total in 10 years: 201,280.50 (101,280.50 interest earned)

* Celsius 8.88% - Total in 10 years: 242,842.44 (142,842.44 interest earned)

* Crypto.com 12% - Total in 10 years: 331,553.01 (231,553.01 
interest earned)

* Anchor Protocol 20% -  Total in 10 years: 736,076.36 (636,076.36 
interest earned)

So we see what a huge difference the interest rates make. Obviously the 20% is huge, but even between 8.88% and 12% there's a almost 100k difference in interest

It just shows that even a small difference can make a huge impact over a number of years

The other advantage is that for now, these returns are fixed, unlike the stock market which can fluctuate wildly. I won't pretend to know the state of stable coins and crypto in 10 years, but there's always risk

Hope this helps show that even if you exit a position in crypto, there are still ways you can make good gains to help provide for your future self",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,"Higher rate, higher down payment assistance?","I have always heard it is better to use the banks money than your own but I am not sure if that applies in this instance. We are building our first house and have to use FHA for the loan. We have decided to use Metro down payment assistance to keep some of our savings intact and it is also fully forgivable after 3 years. It comes with the below options. 

1. 3.5% interest rate with 3% assistance
2. 3.75% interest rate with 4% assistance
3. 4% interest rate with 5% assistance 

The question is, do we take the 5% assistance, which keeps the most amount of our own money in savings, free to invest etc, knowing that the payment is higher and we will pay more over the life of the loan.

CryptoCurrency,"Vitalik Buterin created ethereum after developers weakened his ""beloved"" World of Warcraft character.","Interesting article how centralized services can be bad. And why Vitalik created Ethereum. 

*Vitalik Buterin created ethereum, the technology behind the cryptocurrency ether, after World of Warcraft developers weakened his prized character.
According to his about.me page, he played World of Warcraft from 2007 to 2010 but decided to quit after game maker Blizzard nerfed his ""beloved warlock's Siphon Life spell.""*

*""I cried myself to sleep,"" he wrote, ""and on that day I realized what horrors centralized services can bring.""*


*In 2011, after quitting the game, Buterin became interested in bitcoin and co-founded Bitcoin Magazine, he told Insider previously. Eventually, Buterin, who was born in Russia and grew up in Canada, dropped out of school at the University of Waterloo to focus on crypto full-time, according to his bio.*

*""I went around the world, explored many crypto projects, and finally realized that they were all too concerned about specific applications and not being sufficiently general - hence the birth of Ethereum, which has been taking up my life ever since,"" he wrote on his bio, which also said his political affiliation as ""intellectual hipster meta-contrarian.""*


*In 2017, he revealed to Wired his idea behind ethereum, the community-run technology powering the cryptocurrency ether (ETH). ""I saw everything to do with either government regulation or corporate control as just being plain evil. And I assumed that people in those institutions were kind of like Mr. Burns, sitting behind their desks saying, 'Excellent. How can I screw a thousand people over this time.'""*

*Buterin was just 21 when ethereum launched in 2015 with the help of seven other founders, whom he likened to JRR Tolkien's ""Fellowship of the Ring."" As in the book, the so-called fellowship eventually split, with a couple cofounders developing their own cryptocurrencies, including Cardano and Polkadot.*

personalfinance,Fixed index annuities,"I'm inheriting four non qualified annuities and two traditional iras. Getting prepared to roll them into my name. Two of the annuities have low cost basis, so those will need to be stretched over lifetime.  I'm 46. The other two annuities have a higher cost basis and I plan to withdraw those down to cost basis in 5 years, then pull out entire remaining amount tax free and reinvest elsewhere. Traditional iras will be withdrawn over 10 years, but if a correction hit the markets, I would pull more out earlier. I do not want to withdraw everything at once as I'm already in a higher tax bracket.

Question is, I do not feel very optimistic about the current economy with covid, inflation, supply shortages, gas prices, rising interest rates, and home values out of control. To be honest, with everything happening in the economy, I don't see why the markets are doing what they are doing???  Looking at putting annuities into a 5 year fixed index annuity for the time being as I would hate to have everything riding on the stock market and then a correction would wipe out half of everything my parents worked so hard for.  Then, if a market correction did hit, I could pull 10% out of each annuity, pay the tax, and put that into the stock market.

personalfinance,Best low/mid risk place to put money I will need in 3-5 years.,"My wife and I currently own a small starter home but would like to upgrade to a larger house in 3-5 years when we start having kids.  Right now we are putting away a few hundred dollars a month into the stock market towards a future down payment on our forever home, but I'm looking for a lower risk place to put our money as the date that we will need it gets closer.  

All the traditional avenues (CD's, bonds, high yield savings accounts) have interest rates so low they don't seem worth bothering with right now.  We also recently refinanced our house to a 15 year mortgage at 2.375%.  I don't want to spend the money paying of our current mortgage early because our interest rate is lower than the current rate of inflation.  We are also considering using our current house a rental property in the future and may not have the equity in the house to put towards a future down-payment. The stock market seems like the only place where we can get a return above inflation, but the stock market also seems overvalued at the moment and I'm concerned about losing the money we have saved there.  I'm okay with some risk as losing some money would just mean we wouldn't be able to make as large of a down payment, but we obviously need to have enough to make the down-payment in the first place.  

Any suggestions on low/mid risk places to put money in 3-5 years would be appreciated.",finance

stocks,Twitter User ‚ÄòAlexander Delarge‚Äô Charged for Hyping Penny Stocks,"(Bloomberg) -- The man behind a popular Twitter account that promoted penny stocks was criminally charged for touting securities while simultaneously dumping shares, the latest sign that authorities are setting their sites on the social-media frenzy that‚Äôs invaded U.S. equity markets.

&amp;#x200B;

Steven Gallagher, 50, was taken into custody in Ohio Tuesday for running a pump-and-dump scheme that netted him more than $1 million through the Twitter handle, AlexDelarge6553, according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan. Gallagher, who has touted at least 60 companies since the end of 2019, continued the manipulative conduct even after his brokerage firm closed his account, the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged in a parallel civil case.

&amp;#x200B;

Gallagher traded over-the-counter stocks, including SpectraScience Inc, SPO Global Inc. and Alpine Holdings Inc.. Prosecutors say he amassed large positions, took to Twitter to promote the companies and then secretly sold his positions as other investors piled in. All the while, he publicly claimed he was in for the long haul.

In the SpectraScience trade, for example, Gallagher allegedly coordinated with other traders to buy shares in the defunct company, which hasn‚Äôt filed SEC financial statements since 2017. Gallagher acquired more than 20 million shares of the penny stock and touted it in a series of colorful tweets, showing purported screenshots of his brokerage orders, according to the criminal complaint filed by Manhattan federal prosecutors. He sold while continuing to promote the shares, writing: ‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt sold a share yet!‚Äù

CryptoCurrency,The stablecoin scare is coming again. And it infuriates me.,"*The text was written as an answer to a post over at* /r/MakerDAO*. OP asked what security measures maker should take against the pending ""SEC crack down"" on stablecoins. We should all relax and think before we act.*  
*Todays scaremonger is Bloomberg Crypto:* [*https://twitter.com/crypto/status/1452964460918890501*](https://twitter.com/crypto/status/1452964460918890501) 

I feel this is overhyped and the ""crack down"" slang is lurid and missleading.

The fact: Stablecoins, as well as DeFi, is regulatory-wise uncharted territory. This can be a problem for authorities (think money laundring prosecution) as well as customers (i.e. lack of stability due to lack of reserves).

It is not per se illegal to operate in uncharted territory. If something is not clearly prohibited by law, then it's allowed. The legal basis for that in most democracies is ""Economic Freedom"".

Practical example: Henry Ford did nothing illegal when he started manufacturing his cars, even tough there was almost no car regulation in the law at that time.

There are rules that prevent a govt agency to ""crack down"" on businesses out of the blue. ""Crack downs"" are for players that violated laws.

What HAS and IS going to happen before a ""crack down"" is even on the table:

1. Somewhen next week a Treasury Report will outline the alignment of responsibilities between the treasury and the SEC.
2. Then the respective authorities will establish a set of regulations for participants in the crypto market. I.e. how stablecoins have to be backed and how this backing is to be reported. (I guess Tether will have to create a more exact spreadsheet than now :-) )
3. This regulations will be established with a grace period (that's a legal requirement). This grace period might be short in some cases (i.e. reporting) but can be years long for other issues (like raise of reseve requirements).
4. If the grace period expires and a company does not fully fulfill the regulatory, they get an extended grace period and maybe a fine.
5. If a company behaves malicious or does intentionally not follow regulatories THEN a crack down will happen.

By now we're at least a six to 12 month away from the important deadlines in step 4. And no stablecoin issuer has so far objected to being regulated. Furthermore the absence of the SEC only indicated a lack of federal regulation in the US. In reality most stablecoins already operate under some regulation, either by US states or foreign-to-the-US countries.  
For example FINMA in Switzerland put their first crypto regulatories in 2018, so did Singapore. USDT was ""working with"" NY attorney general.

And regarding USDC: Also consider that there is only an absence of CRYPTO regulatories. Circle plans to go public. Doing so they have to follow regulatories involving reporting and transparency. This already does a lot to prevent them from overdeclaring reserves.

There's a chance that Bloomberg Crypto knows something we dont, but then they should bring the news so we can trade it. Otherwise stop being so annoyingly sensational.

**TLDR**: There is no legal basis for a ""crack down"" as there are no regulatories regarding stablecoins. Bloomberg Crypto is maybe baiting, maybe scaring the market in hope it will move.",cryptocurrency
stocks,"Cathie Wood disputes Jack Dorsey‚Äôs hyperinflation warning, says prices will fall after holidays","Innovation investor Cathie Wood on Monday rebutted Twitter and Square founder Jack Dorsey‚Äôs theory on hyperinflation.

The founder and CEO of Ark Invest took to Twitter to expound upon her contrarian theory about deflation after Dorsey tweeted Friday evening that ‚ÄúHyperinflation is going to change everything. It‚Äôs happening.‚Äù Wood estimates that her hypothesis will start to play out sometime after the holidays.

‚ÄúIn 2008-09, when the Fed started quantitative easing, I thought that inflation would take off. I was wrong. Instead, velocity - the rate at which money turns over per year - declined, taking away its inflationary sting. Velocity still is falling,‚Äù Wood said in a tweet.

‚ÄúWhen costs and prices decline, velocity and disinflation - if not deflation - follow. If consumers and businesses believe that prices will fall in the future, they will wait to buy buy goods and services, pushing the velocity of money down,‚Äù she added.

‚ÄúNow we believe that three sources of deflation will overcome the supply chain-induced inflation that is wreaking havoc on the global economy. Two sources are secular, or long term, and one is cyclical. Technologically enabled innovation is deflationary and the most potent source,‚Äù Wood said in the Twitter thread.

‚ÄúAs a result, once the holiday season passes and companies face excess supplies, prices should unwind. Some commodity prices - lumber and iron ore - already have dropped 50%, China‚Äôs crackdowns are one of the reasons. The oil price is an outlier and psychologically important,‚Äù Wood said.

The COVID-19 vaccine rollout is restoring consumer confidence. India has navigated the pandemic well despite dire forecasts. After what has been dubbed the harshest lockdown in the world, the economy has bounced back more quickly than expected.

 Various sectors of the economy have begun to normalize. Manufacturing activity, export orders and property and vehicle sales have all improved.

India recently unveiled a production-linked incentive program to encourage foreign manufacturers of mobile phones, pharmaceuticals and medical devices to set up shop in the country and for domestic producers to expand. The just-released central government budget for the 2022 fiscal year, with its focus on infrastructure spending and growth, has further buoyed sentiment.

The nascent recovery, coupled with low-interest rates, could start a virtuous cycle for the Indian economy. We GDP could reach double-digit growth in the 2022 fiscal year and could stabilize in the 6% to 8% range in later years.

CryptoCurrency,Study - one-third of the super-rich interested in crypto investments,"Reasons for and against crypto investments: this is what the super-rich say, according to a recent study.

In a study conducted in June/July 2021 by research agency CoreData Research, the researchers surveyed 600 professional investor:s in Europe who collectively manage assets greater than ‚Ç¨400 billion. These were players from the wholesale, financial advisory, asset management and family office sectors. The survey focused on reasons for or against investing in cryptocurrencies, the increase in riskier products and the information situation of customers. The client was the WisdomTree Investment, Inc. company. This is a product sponsor of exchange traded funds (ETF) and exchange traded products (ETP).

German professional investor:s stated that the strongest argument for not allocating to cryptocurrencies as an investment was the volatility (34 percent) of the crypto space. Thirty-three percent cited a lack of regulation as a reason, while 29 percent said it was due to a lack of confidence in digital currencies. Still, more than half of this group (55 percent) say demand for riskier investments has increased since the Covid 19 pandemic began. A third (32 percent) see it differently - in their eyes, demand has remained the same.

In Germany, almost half (45 percent) of advisors:inside are convinced that ""digital assets can be used as diversification in the portfolio due to the low correlation."" In addition, 20 percent believe that the returns that can be achieved using cryptocurrencies are above the market average. For example, four out of five of the professional Investor:ins would have discussed crypto investing with their clients. In addition, 29 percent of the clients would intend to invest in crypto independently of the advisors.

Overall, the study found, awareness of digital assets and investment in the asset class has increased in recent years. In addition, many of the professional investor:s are familiar with the role in portfolios of digital assets, it said. Among the overall group of respondents, 34 percent find an allocation to cryptocurrencies of one to two percent ""appropriate."" That said, 47 percent also agree that demand for riskier investments would have increased since the pandemic began. Possible reasons for this could be rising inflation or low interest rates.

CryptoCurrency,U.S. FDIC Could Help Banks Hold Cryptocurrency,"- Jelena McWilliams, Chairman of the FDIC, says that the regulator is developing a cryptocurrency roadmap for banks.

- Those rules will likely concern how banks can use crypto in custody holdings, loan collateral, and balance sheets.

- Some banks are already working with crypto, but these regulations aim to provide a comprehensive framework.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is examining ways for banks to hold cryptocurrency, according to Reuters.


**A Crypto Roadmap for Banks**

Jelena McWilliams, Chairman of the FDIC, said that a team of regulators is developing a roadmap for crypto holdings.

That roadmap will likely include rules around holding crypto in custody, using cryptocurrency for loan collateral, and holding cryptocurrencies on balance sheets as an investment.

McWilliams argued that banks should be allowed to hold crypto ‚Äúwhile appropriately managing and mitigating risk.‚Äù She added that banks will otherwise be outpaced by private industry: ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt bring this activity inside the banks, it is going to develop outside of the banks [and] federal regulators won‚Äôt be able to regulate it.‚Äù

McWilliams also acknowledged that price volatility could be an issue for banks. She noted that fluctuations in the value of cryptocurrencies can occur ‚Äúalmost on a daily basis,‚Äù which would affect capital allocation and liquidity treatment.


**Are Banks Already Using Cryptocurrency?**


Though the FDIC has not yet acted, various banks are already working with cryptocurrency. This month, U.S. Bank announced crypto custody services. Special banks such as Avanti, created by Wall Street veteran Caitlin Long, are also working with crypto assets.

Additionally, third parties like NYDIG and Visa are helping customers purchase cryptocurrencies through their banks.

Last year, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) gave banks extensive abilities to work with stablecoins. Banks gained the ability to hold and transact with stablecoins and even run nodes for blockchain networks underlying those stablecoins.

The FDIC‚Äôs plans, however, are part of a larger ‚Äúsprint‚Äù that aims to build a joint framework with the Federal Reserve and the OCC. This would create more comprehensive crypto regulation.

personalfinance,Buying a Car - All Cash vs Financing at a low-interest rate,"Hey all, 

I've been digging around this subreddit and reading numerous posts about the pros/cons of Financing vs All Cash when buying a car. 

I understand that it makes sense to invest the money if you can qualify for a low-interest rate. My wife and I both have great credit (800+) and we make an income of 225K+ between the two of us and have prequalified for a 1.9% interest rate through our bank. 

For my wife and I, we have already saved 40K towards a new vehicle. We have a stable emergency fund, savings for a house, savings for other things like vacations, etc, and zero debts. 

My question is more around the logistics of how it would work if we finance it. 

Hypothetical example:

If we put 20K down on a 40K car and invest the remaining 20K into an automated investing account via Wealthfront to beat that 1.9% rate, is the thought that we would make our monthly payments from that investment account? Would I be transferring out monthly payments from that account to pay for the remaining loan balance?

Or is the thought to pay the monthly payment through our regular monthly expenses? 

In theory, it makes sense of why investing is better, I guess I'm looking for some guidance on how some other people have handled this tactically.

We signed the initial round of disclosures last week and in that was estimates of closing costs and I‚Äôve talked with my broker on the phone and she went through the list and basically made it sound like everything was either a set price or a high estimate and that I should expect the actual total to be a fair bit lower than that. She specifically made it sound like it would at least 1000 if not $2000 lower. She also said ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt marked that we locked your interest rate even though we just did that today, that‚Äôs OK I will get that in the next round.‚Äù When she asked if I wanted to lock-in the interest rate I asked if there was any fee associated with that and I don‚Äôt remember getting an answer to that specific question, but she definitely did not tell me there was any fees. We signed the documents and then today I get an updated ‚ÄúChange of circumstances‚Äú new documents. These have an origination fee added that was not there before and then another loan processing fee that totals to almost $1800 in additional costs. I asked her what this was about and she said it was because she updated that we had locked the Rate in.

personalfinance,Strategy to save money for future house purchase,"This is one of the frequent topics of this sub. Conventional wisdom is to put it in a high yield savings account. However, I feel that's not the right strategy. A purchase of house with a mortgage is basically going long on house while simultaneously going short on bonds (you are selling a bond in the form of a mortgage). So to match that profile one should be long housing (e.g. residential REITs) and simultaneously short bonds until they can actually buy the house. A 30 year mortgage is most similar to a 10 year bond. So something like the DTYS etn should be suitable. This portfolio will gain as housing goes up in price and also if interest rates increase. Thoughts? Has anyone tried this?",finance
CryptoCurrency,NY Times: The Bond Market Says Inflation Will Last -- Impact on Crypto?,"""Expectations of rising inflation can become a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy, so the Fed has been inclined to raise interest rates or otherwise tighten monetary policy when public opinion anticipates higher prices.

Before that could happen, the Fed would end the extraordinary steps it took to cushion the economy from the worst of the pandemic. That process is widely expected to start at the Fed‚Äôs meeting next week, when its key monetary policy committee will probably begin reducing bond-buying programs that have been pumping $120 billion into financial markets each month since the pandemic hit. Exactly how quickly the Fed would taper off that program isn‚Äôt clear, but investors now seem to be betting it could be eliminated by the middle of next year.

In recent days, the market-based odds of a rate increase at the Fed‚Äôs meeting in June 2022 jumped to roughly 60 percent, according to data from CME. It was about 15 percent at the start of the month.""

7. Messari has updated its ‚ÄúInitial Token Distribution‚Äù chart to include a previously missing project and Cardano is still among the very best in the Gen 3 space in terms of broad public coin ownership.

10. Here‚Äôs the tweet with the link for the Alonzo smart contract launch watch party tomorrow (Sept 12) at 21:30 UTC. This is going to be fun! Enjoy it, guys! [https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1436325831199141888](https://twitter.com/InputOutputHK/status/1436325831199141888)
11. A Weiss Crypto analyst calls the smart contract launch an alleged event and also doesn‚Äôt realize we already have NFTS. The Cardano community was quick to correct the analyst. Weiss was then also quick to apologize.

14. One of Cardano‚Äôs biggest competitors is once again suffering network problems. This time it started out as just being characterized as (more) ‚Äúinstability‚Äù, then they started saying that something had caused the blockchain to ‚Äústart forking‚Äù. This followed their September 2 ‚Äúinstability‚Äù and ‚Äúperformance degradation‚Äù event. It‚Äôll be interesting to see how well their community tolerates this in the future if it‚Äôs happening with their planned slashing model in effect.

20. Now one of Cardano‚Äôs most highly visible critics is implying that the Cardano community has something in common with anti-vaxxers. Unfortunately for him, it was one of his pet blockchains that was down a few days ago while Cardano just kept healthily trucking right along. [https://twitter.com/spudiot1/status/1438402783040790532](https://twitter.com/spudiot1/status/1438402783040790532)

26. After the Senate hearing on Tuesday September 14th, Gary Gensler (SEC Chairman) gave a quote to a crypto publication indicating that custodial lending and possibly even staking platforms might be considered securities. This is very relevant for Cardano since it has non-custodial staking whereas many of its competitors have the kind of custodial staking that Gensler may have been contemplating. [https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/117675/crypto-lending-staking-custody-gensler-sec](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/117675/crypto-lending-staking-custody-gensler-sec)

50. In late 2008/early 2009 it turns out Hal Finney was learning Haskell and trying to figure out how to reduce C02 emissions from a (future) widely used Bitcoin. That sounds a lot like Cardano.

55. The Wall Street Journal has dropped a video on stablecoins. A lot of the video surrounds the Tether dollar reserve controversy. It‚Äôs notable that Cardano‚Äôs Djed solves this.

57. Cardano users on twitter piece together that Charles was talking about visiting [u/Pezesha\_Africa](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pezesha_Africa/) (in regard to microfinance) in Kenya.

58. Crypto twitter users try to depict US Whitehouse comments out of context to fuel an economic doom narrative.

70. Representative Tom Emmer clashes with SEC Head Gensler over the direction of crypto regulation. However, it‚Äôs unclear how much Rep.

3) Only buy it if it‚Äôs going to go up? I don‚Äôt know how you haven‚Äôt grasped this.

4) If a YouTuber is shilling a coin, buy it before they release the video, then sell after the minor price increase.

5) Hack Elon Musks twitter and tweet your portfolio

6) If this subreddit shits on something, go all in on that thing and take a loan from the bank and whatever loan sharks you can. Your gains will make their interest rates look like spare change.

stocks,CFDs: what am I missing?,"So I'm looking at a long CFD position on a particular stock.

The margin is 50% and the overnight interest swap rate is 0.2

My plan is to set a limit order for 8 CFDs at $100, hold for around 3 weeks, and close the position thereafter.

If, hypothetically, my closing price is 200, is the following calculation correct, or am I missing something?

8 X (200-100) = 1200

Then with the overnight rate deductions calculated as follows: 8(number if CFDs) X 0.2(interest rate) X 21(number of days) = 33.6
Assuming the interest rate maintains a 0.2 average over the 3 weeks. I should expect a profit net of 1200-33.6 = 1166.4

How's my understanding?

personalfinance,Always be cautious with deciding your motor finance lender.,"The ease at which one could gain a loan for a car is too simple compared to the hidden variables that could mean you are paying more than what you first initially thought.  Car finance lenders seemed to have expertly exploited the loan system, making large amounts of money while taking no risk. Undisclosed commission through car lenders charging higher interest rates means the customer has to pay back more money on what they originally borrowed. This secret commission should have been disclosed as this is pocketed by the broker themselves and does not directly contribute to paying back what is owed for the car finance agreement. 

&amp;#x200B;

Car finance agreements are regulated by the UK Consumer Credit Law (1974) that requires the commission to be disclosed to the customer as this could result in an unfair relationship between the lender and borrower. Thus, a mis-sale regarding your car finance could entitle you to compensation claims. Ensuring your broker has fully explained any potential commission and what exactly your payments will consist of could eliminate this entirely. No question is a stupid question. Ask everything you need or feel unsure about before entering into a car finance agreement. If you are past this point - don't fret. There are various ways for you to find out and be put into the position you were in before.",finance

stocks,"My top 4 monthly REITs right now: AGNC, LTC, O and STAG","In times of market volatility, dividend stocks provide a specific type of reassurance. A lot of famous investors like Warren Buffett and Jeremy Grantham have talked about the benefits of owning dividend stocks again and again. Real Estate Investment Trusts are one of the best dividend stocks out there in my opinion.

# AGNC Investment

First of all, we have AGNC Investment or simply AGNC which is a mortgage REIT. Essentially, you have two main types of REITs: equity REITs and mortgage REITs. As the name suggests, mortgage REITs like AGNC invest in mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and other related assets. Their main revenue stream is the interest on their investments. Essentially, AGNC has taken on a massive leverage to be able to pay out one of the highest dividends in the US market, but there's a silver lining to it. AGNC invests in mortgages that are guaranteed by Government Sponsored Entities (GSEs) so there is no credit risk there. Even if a mortgage owner defaults, AGNC will get their exposure refunded. So, the only risk that AGNC has is connected to interest rates. Because of the nature of AGNC's borrowing and lending, the company benefits from low short-term interest rates and high long-term interest rates. This is perfect because we are currently heading towards a larger spread between short-term and long-term interest rates in the US which means that AGNC will very likely benefit. This means a higher stock price and a higher dividend which is why AGNC is my top REIT pick right now and my biggest REIT position. AGNC currently trades at about $16.5 dollars after hitting almost $19 dollars in September.

In fact, there is another mortgage REIT called Annaly Capital Management or NLY which is very similar to AGNC and also pays a high dividend of 10% right now although it is not paying it monthly. However, Annaly Capital is still worth looking into and I think it's another great purchase as long as you don't expose yourself to it too much. NLY currently trade for $8.7 dollars.

# LTC Properties

Now, the second monthly REIT that I want to cover today is LTC Properties or just LTC. Unlike AGNC which is a mortgage REIT, LTC is an equity REIT which specialises in senior housing and skilled nursing homes. They currently have a portfolio of 176 properties with a gross investment valued at over $1.67 billion US dollars. They are currently paying a 6.4% dividend which looks appealing, but there's a potential issue. There's about 14% of uncollected rent meaning that LTC may have issues maintaining its current dividend. A few of its tenants were problematic and LTC may be selling some properties as a result. However, the company is performing well otherwise and they've also declared their dividend for the next 3 months. From the looks of it, there is no upcoming dividend cut, but we need to monitor the situation. Personally, I think it's trading at an okay price and the dividend is good, but I think that anyone thinking about investing in LTC should be wary of some potential issues. I would be careful with my exposure to the company, but I still think that it is one of the best deals out there right now because it looks like the potential tenant issues have been priced in at the current price of between $33 and $34 dollars.

# Realty Income

So, the third monthly REIT for today is Realty Income or just O. Realty Income rents commercial locations to blue-chip clients like Walmart, Walgreens, Starbucks, CVS, Home Depot and many more. 84% of their properties are rented to retailers, 11.5% are industrial and they also have some office and agriculture properties. Realty Income has a high credit rating from Moody's and S&amp;P, strong balance sheet and has shown time and time again that it can pay a reliable monthly dividend. The company has paid 608 consecutive dividends since 1994 and increased the dividend 109 times. Overall, the company is a solid choice although it offers a slightly lower dividend than the previous REITs at only 3.8%. Still, Realty Income can also offer decent good price appreciation and, most importantly, stability. Realty Income currently trades at roughly $74 and is one of the most highly regarded REITs on Wall Street.

# Stag Industrial

Finally, the fourth monthly REIT on my radar is Stag Industrial or just STAG. Now, unlike the other REITs that I've covered so far, STAG actually pay a much smaller dividend at only 3.3%. However, that's simply because the stock has gone up 41% so far this year. STAG is an industrial REIT with a history of increasing monthly dividends. They operate more than 500 individual assets that comprise over 100 million square feet that they rent out to single tenants, meaning there's only one occupier per asset. Some of their biggest tenants include Amazon, FedEx, American Tire Distributions, Ford Motor Company, etc. In my opinion, STAG is a solid all-rounder which can offer an increasing monthly dividend combined with an increasing stock price.

So, these are my top 4 monthly REITs with an additional mortgage REIT in between. What do you think? Which one is your favourite?",finance

Bitcoin,Lending out BTC,"A few months ago someone mentioned to me that Bitcoin could have a problem, due to it being a deflating currency, as deflating currencies don't foster growth well.  While that seems absurd on face, and obviously he was crediting the Federal Reserve System with the growth that America has had in the past 108 years which is patently absurd....if you think about it, there could be an issue with making loans in Bitcoin, due to it's increasing scarcity. 

Any borrower has to be very concerned, that during the life of the loan, that Bitcoin will become harder to source.  As in, his pay will decline (in Bitcoin), and while his expenses do as well, his loan payments generally will not.  So...how can anyone feel comfortable borrowing in Bitcoin for say, a 30 year mortgage loan on their home?  Etc.  And here's the kicker - the lender has the same exact concern!  How does a lender comfortably lend out his Bitcoin, knowing that it will become more scarce as time goes on and therefore the borrower could well have trouble repaying??  

So, I'd like everyone's thoughts on this question - can a deflating currency like Bitcoin, truly foster growth?  Lending must happen using the currency for growth, because it's essential that the capital held by savers be put to productive usage....but could Bitcoin be the proper vehicle for that?",cryptocurrency

The output gap produced (as was discussed in Part 2) has resulted in shortages across the board. This has given us inflation that the government had not prepared for (who could have predicted all this government spending would lead to inflation). Consumers are picking up steam with the latest data showing a huge increase in houses bought, consumer confidence increasing, delivery times picking up, input price increases and working demanding more pay (If your subreddit does not allow pictures I would check out Part 3 on the BurryEdge subreddit so you can see the charts I have posted, I find them to be extremely important).

As you can see shortages are causing huge increases in delivery times and prices (with core inflation skyrocketing an important tool to try to predict what the Fed will do). Now how can we tell this is a fiscal stimulus problem? Because the US is the only one experiencing problems on the scale we are seeing here in the United States and the United States were the only ones to stimulate the economy in the extreme fashion that we did.

With basically every consumer goods company reporting shortages with insane demand which is coupled with the great resignation (discussed in Part 2) we have workers working in overdrive while not having wages that are keeping up with inflation. This has caused strikes across the board in what media is calling ‚Äústriketober‚Äù as workers demand better conditions and more pay (this is extremely important). This *could* be the start of an unanchoring inflationary event known as the wage cost spiral. This is when workers expect more money to make up for their losses from inflation, this leads to higher input costs, which leads to higher output prices/higher inflation. This creates a feedback loop that can cause inflation to become unanchored in a negative manner. This is something we must keep a close look on. I believe if the John Deere strike results in success and they get higher pay, we could see more workers take notice and request higher pay across the country (I believe that strike specifically is the most important to pay attention to).

Now where are we seeing shortages and increased expenses? Well basically everywhere, from semiconductors, to food, to fertilizer, to precious metals (such as magnesium, steel, aluminum), commodities (coal, natural gas, oil), coffee, housing, paper pulp (Paper is up roughly 50% from last year and experts expect another toilet paper shortage along with books), Lumber/Wood again, HVAC systems, Chicken, and the list just keeps going.

**Why this isn‚Äôt transitory and could become dangerous**

Well, we just need to wait on the pandemic right, this is just supply chain kinks, right? Wrong, if you look at the above charts, Charts 1 and 2, you will see where the supply kinks fixed themselves around March. What we are seeing is demand driven shortages due to an economy operating at a pace that it literally cannot handle especially with a drop in potential GDP (Part 2). This demand is now hitting us due to pent up savings (discussed in part 1 and part 2), and the previously discussed fiscal stimulation (Part 1 and 2), and Covid coming to an end in the eyes of consumers. This is also the first Covid free Holiday season being celebrated by most Americans in almost 2 years. We are seeing shortages pick up in September/October because consumers are worried about inflation/shortages and are starting to pick up the inflationary mindset (Part 2), another possibly dangerous unanchoring event that we must pay attention to. So how do we make money on this? (I know you‚Äôre just thinking ‚ÄúFinally!!!!‚Äù)

**The United States Treasury Bond**

As discussed in Part 1and Part 2, the US has been increasing M2 at a breakneck pace and the economy has gotten near levels that the Fed will consider ‚Äútapering‚Äù or the reduction of Quantitative Easing (Part 1). What this means is that the money supply will stop growing as fast, as the government stops buying bonds to flush markets with cash (that‚Äôs basically all QE is). Now, for those of you who do not know, there is a correlation between treasury bond prices and treasury bond yields. They work inverse so when bond prices go up, bond yields go down and vice versa. Well, when the Fed begins to reduce its bond buying this will cause bond prices to go down as result to a reduction in demand. When the prices of bonds go down yields go up (This will be discussed more in another paragraph). This causes a double effect of not only decreasing the money supply by reducing bond buying, but it also causes a decrease in the money supply by increasing rates. And based on our core inflation readings from earlier with the shortages getting worse, I think it is safe to say that tapering will begin on November 2nd. This is why the 60-40 rule of stocks to bonds is now longer good risk management because stocks and bond now move

Currently private investors are not buying treasuries, and neither are banks (as of recently). The only large buyer of bonds currently is the Federal Reserve meaning that there is no demand at current levels if the Fed stops buying, leading to a reduction in bond prices. This is where we will begin the thesis for our short on 20 year treasury shortages in the form of the $TLT ETF. As tapering decreases we will see TLT increase to the long term inflation expectation rate of roughly 3% (this will increase as inflation increases of course, this expectation can easily change with inflation fears). Current 20 year bond rates are at about 1.7% today, which means we can expect at a minimum, an increase of about 1% in 20 year bond yields when tapering begins to reduce. A 1% change in bond yields leads to about an 18%-20% decrease of TLT (Remember this is the minimum amount it will drop from just tapering).

As investor fears about inflation picks up, this could cause rates to increase faster, as less investors want bonds so they demand a higher yield. This also does not take into account the Federal Reserve moving up its timetable for a federal fund rate hike which would lead to a money crunch and a further increase in bond yields as demand reduces. So a short on TLT is one investment I think is a good move since I see a minimum drop of roughly 20% (or a buy on TBT which just works as inverse). These are 2 vehicles I would look into for investing against inflation.

This could‚Äôve had more detail but I think it gets the point across, if you have questions please comment below.

**An Asset Crunch**

As I said before, stocks and bonds have moved in tandem in recent years. This new correlation is why you should also begin to short stocks. Well first let‚Äôs discuss why they move in tandem. It‚Äôs because the yield of a treasury bond is the discount rate used by the market. If there is confidence in the dollar/Fed, then companies will use this as their discount rate. So, when interest rates increase, the value of all stocks decrease due to this discount rate, it also acts as a money crunch since less money would be borrowed. Also tapering is decreasing as well, which has the double effect of increasing rates and reducing the money supply. So obviously this would *normally* only cause a small effect on stocks, unless they are in a bubble (or overleveraged). As we learned in Part 1, stocks and houses, are in a bubble. Now why would stocks in a bubble be a larger cause to worry. Well stocks in a bubble, act as a Ponzi Scheme. Now bear with me for a moment while I explain. A bubble is when an asset ignores its underlying intrinsic value and people simply invest in it because *someone else will invest in it leading the asset price to increase*. A bubble implies that individuals aren‚Äôt paying attention to the business, they are expecting to make a return based on the ***sole reason*** that someone else will want to buy the stock, not anything to do with the underlying business. Now when the money supply decreases or the discount rate increases, there is no next man up to pay for the asset. As with a ponzi scheme, when there are no more buyers everyone begins dumping their shares because it is now impossible for the asset price to keep growing and if something isn‚Äôt growing (especially in an inflationary environment) this will lead to a total collapse of the price until it becomes something worth of value.

This doesn‚Äôt include price pressures put on by shortages or the volatility that can be created by options. I suggest anyone who is reading this to read the thread by @ thelastbearsta1 on twitter regarding volatility. This explains why an asset crash will not be as long as the bubble burst in ‚Äô99 but will be a sudden and flash crash among stocks in a bubble (along with the fact that option buying is at all time high levels, possibly causing reverse gamma squeezes). My personal choices for these ‚Äúbubble stocks‚Äù are Tesla (if you‚Äôre about to argue with me on this, think about the fact that Tesla went up 100 billion on a 4 billion revenue, not profit, contract, and also I have other choices here if you disagree with my thought process on Tesla), almost any EV company, Roku (this is one of my favorites), new tech IPO‚Äôs, ARKK fund (Basically the biggest bubbles that are expecting more growth, that higher interest rates won‚Äôt allow), some space companies (or other government contracted companies due to the government having to pay more interest on future debt), and many more. These companies are not necessarily bad companies, I think Tesla is a great company and managed well by Elon Musk, but it is in a massive bubble and there‚Äôs no way investors are expecting meaningful returns from the business *at current stock prices*. As well as those companies, you should also look at any company overvalued based on a huge amount of debt where they are taking on more debt to grow (an interest increase causes debt to get much more expensive). I also suggest finding value investments as they thrive in a higher interest rate environment while growth stocks suffer, one of my favorites is DISCK which is merging with Warner Bros (A spin off of AT&amp;T), but I would wait until DISCK finds some solid support.

These are the companies I would investigate based on an increase in interest rate, and then you just need to identify the best choices for your risk tolerance and what best fits your investing personality. I don‚Äôt have DD for these suggestions which is why you should not invest without doing your own due diligence!!! Details were skipped here obviously but I am giving you the overall idea of why I have gone short on certain positions, and I am relying on you to dig deeper or find some DD as it would take me a long time to go into each individual stock.

**We have got to capitalize on Shortages**

Shortages are also a great place to find gains, although most ETF‚Äôs regarding commodities are already at extremely high levels. We should also look at companies that are still set to benefit, I really like SXC, OVV, and STNG. We have some great DD on those 3 stocks on the Burry Edge subreddit if anyone would like to look more into those stocks, as they are all undervalued stocks. OVV is a natural gas and oil company, meanwhile STNG is a petroleum transportation company. Both have great write ups and are companies I am personally invested in (I‚Äôve made roughly 25% in just stocks from those 2 and I believe they have more upside). SXC is an investment in coke steel plants (a great way to take advantage of steel when scrap prices are high). Some of the ideas that has been discussed are ideas in the food industry as well (such as CORN). Another way to capitalize on this is in a retailer that has prepped for shortages and are in an advantageous position such as WMT, a stock I have written DD for as well, and you can read more information on why I believe they are specially built for a shortage‚Äôs environment in the coming months. Just be on the lookout for shortages and honestly following the shortages subreddit (I have no affiliation with this sub but they have great posts highlighting shortages) to follow future trends is probably not the worst idea. If you can get ahead of a shortages curve you can make a lot of money. Once again, I could have written much more but our community has other written pieces out there going in more detail, and I have given you the overall thesis for things to look into. If I were to jump into individual stocks I would take up way too much room. So, to summarize this paragraph; figure out where the shortages are going to be, actively pay attention to current shortages, find the undervalued companies in those sectors that are set to climb as prices increase.

Overall, in summary, inflation is here to stay, and we need to protect ourselves against it. I wish each of you good luck and I hope the information I have provided will help all of you achieve more financial freedom. I‚Äôm sorry for any spelling mistakes or grammatical errors, I hope it did not take away from the information given.

CryptoCurrency,Big Banks Borrowing - Senators &amp; SEC Think I Need Protection,"Six of the largest US lenders have issued over $310 Billion USD in bonds so far this year which is the most for any year since 2008 (according to Dealogic - as reported in the WSJ today).

personalfinance,Want advice on a Home mortgage decision.,"My partner and I (not married but heavily committed) are buying a home together and we a getting to the last steps of making a decision about which loan to take. Apparently, in the last few weeks, the stock market has been going wild so our interest rate options from both lenders are higher than we were expecting.

One of the offers was able to swing some numbers to get me alone approved for the loan, which decreased the interest rate significantly (I have a better credit score).

The question I am asking is related to that. My partner wants to go with the higher interest rate option so that they can be on the loan and build their credit. Then, once the markets calm down, look into refinancing for a better interest rate. I am leaning towards the lower interest rate option with just me and then also refinance to get them on the loan.

* 4 units under contract, remaining 8 units listed but no offers as far as I've heard
* Residents get representation on board of manager after 3 units close, take complete control of HOA and board of managers after 8 of 12 units close

Of course all of the above makes the units currently non-warrantable, and requires buyers to purchase in cash or with a portfolio loan. I have been in touch with various banks, mortgage brokers, credit unions and most either do not do portfolio loans or are unwilling to touch a project at this stage. I have repeatedly gotten feedback that I am a ""perfect"" buyer (800+ credit score, no debt of any kind, make more than double the median household income in my city), but they aren't willing to lend on this project or they aren't willing to lend on this project *yet*.

Is it worth it to pay an extra 0.5ish% for a few months/years and save the $7-8k that I would have spent on points to refinance when possible? I know that no one can predict what interest rates will do, but I'd like some additional opinions or suggestions on how to run the numbers.

Sorry in advance for the block of text. Looking for some strategic advice on how to pay off my student loan which is broken into 4 groups.

Note none of them are accruing interest right now with COVID.

Each of the below is interest per month that would accrue with no payments towards the principal

Group 2 - $15.76

Group 3 - $21.21

Group 4 - $11.83

CryptoCurrency,Fiat Currency is Broken and Crypto is a Peaceful Financial Revolution Against Corrupt Powers.,"Fiat currency, a system by which a currency only retains its value by ‚Äúfiat‚Äù or decree by a government, leaves a central bank free to create money from thin air, reducing the value of the currency already in circulation. [According to a study of 775 fiat currencies](https://www.dinardirham.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-fiat-currencies/), there is no historical precedence for a fiat currency that has succeeded in holding its value. Every single one of them has failed. And all for a single fundamental reason: Unsound monetary policy i.e. overprinting of the fiat currency to fund deficit spending. This is mind blowing to me. 

The issuers of FIAT money always print more of it in order to try and solve other problems other than just being money. Whether it is printed for social welfare, to pay for wars to bail out banks or to manage markets, we are currently witnessing government issuers of paper money attempting to solve more of the world‚Äôs problems with printed money. This inevitably leads to its failure. It gets much more sinister though. Due to [the Cantillion Effect](https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/the-cantillon-effect-why-wall-street), that basically states whoever is closest to the money printer benefits the most from inflation, basically the elites print money and give it out to their rich friends who yield the most benefit from the freshly printed money *before* it gets devalued. Look at what‚Äôs happening in Venezuela, Argentina, Zimbabwe, Turkey and so many more places. The Fed printed 40% of all dollars in existence last year. It‚Äôs not a question or if inflation is coming, it‚Äôs when. This is why we need crypto. No one has centralised control, no one can unfairly manipulate it.

This is why Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin. And this is why he included the message \*‚ÄúChancellor on Brink of Second Bailout for Banks‚Äù.\* Cryptocurrency solves this age-old problem of allowing the common plebs like us to have a mathematically verifiable technology to preserve our wealth over time.

CryptoCurrency,US government will be auctioning off Bitcoin,"Bitcoinist.com

The U.S. government has announced that it will be auctioning off bitcoins in a three-day auction starting Tuesday, October 26th. The auction will be carried out online and will see the bitcoins auctioned off in batches by the U.S. government. GSA Auctions carry out auctions on behalf of the U.S. government to clear surplus assets and equipment that are owned by the federal government.

The bitcoins will be sold in five batches in an online event titled Fall for Cryptocurrency. Auctions will run for three days from Tuesday, October 26th to Thursday, October 28th. By the time the auctions are completed, about $300,000 worth of bitcoins, 4.94 BTC, will be sold by the U.S. government to the highest bidder.

##Auctioning Off The Bitcoin
The auction will include five lots with starting bids all under market price for the bitcoins. All auctions are to be carried out in Atlantan Georgia and the lots will include varying volumes of bitcoins. The first lot will feature the highest volume with 1.50 BTC with a starting bid of $40,809, more than $20,000 less than the market price. Other lots will include a decreased volume of bitcoins to varying degrees. Starting bids for each lot will also decrease for the lots with smaller volumes.

The second lot will see 1.25 BTC being auctioned off at a starting bid of $34,008. Next in line is the third lot with 1 BTC with its starting bid placed at $27,206. 0.75 will be put up for auction at a starting bid of $20,405. And lastly, the fifth lot will see 0.44 BTC auctioned off by the U.S. government at a starting bid of $11,971.

Although these auctions usually start at opening bids much lower than the market price, they rarely ever end up selling below market price. By the time bidding is done on these cryptocurrencies, the winning bid may well be over the market price. This is because interested parties will place competitive bids in order to win out over other parties present at the auctions and this can drive the value of the auctioned BTC up very fast.

##How The U.S. Government Acquires Crypto
The U.S. government acquires its crypto from seizures and forfeitures. Mostly, these crypto are taken from individuals involved in crime, and the assets are seized when the perpetrators are apprehended. Seizures can also occur in instances of tax evasions where individuals‚Äô assets are seized by the U.S. government to compensate for the money owed to the government.

However, the government only holds on to the cryptocurrencies it seizes. Once a case a closed, the government will auction off the crypto in its possession. A good example of this is the bitcoins that were seized during the Silk Road bust. Once the case was concluded, the government had auctioned all of the bitcoins, 144,336 BTC, which sold for about $48 million at the time of the auction.",cryptocurrency

The letter basically said that once I have an accepted offer, I should contact them and within 3 days they will give me a loan estimate with interest rate, monthly payments and the like. 
I would really like to know my interest rate before I go throwing out offers so I know what I really can afford. I have contacted them about this with no reply as of yet.
 
So my question is, is this normal when applying for a home loan? I'm just supposed to go work with a realtor with this number and try to get an accepted offer with no estimate of my interest rate and monthly payments and hope I can afford all of this?",finance
Banking,Question about Routing number and ACH payment,I am submitting a cashier's check to USCIS to pay for my immigration application fees which they cash the check by using the routing and account number on the check to convert into electronic fund transfer. They don't cash the check through the normal process. The routing number in my check is different from the routing number on my bank's website (Suntrust). When searching up my routing number from my check online it shows that it doesn't process fedwire payments. Will this be an issue for USCIS to cash my check?,finance

Bitcoin,Awareness amongst BTC fans is growing,"I can see more and more people dont see just blockchain but begin to realize danger of ETFs.

The next step on awareness path is understanding of crypto tulip-mania and how chasing rainbows (shitcoins) is guarantee that FED will last forever.

The richest man on the planet is also the greatest beneficiary of fiat currency system. The fact he has ability to influence masses to buy shitcoins with a tweet, is a tradeable skill, a distraction which keeps working class money away from core of financial system, and it is what FED desire the most.

His tweets about various coins opened door to the club and cemented government contracts.

Spending some spare change from such a deal on BTC is just smoke and mirrors.

personalfinance,Help me understand this refinancing math,"My wife has an auto loan with $11,874 left on the loan. The loan matures in April 2024 (about 30 more months) and has an interest rate of 5.95%. The current payment is about $425/mt. 

She was pre-approved for a refinanced loan at 2.24% for 36 months with a payment of $363 a month. 

When I do the math I see the pre-approved loan costing us more over the life of the loan. Am I doing the math wrong? If we refinanced and made the $425 payment on the new loan with the lower interest rate how would that effect the overall payout over the life of the loan? 

Our goal in wanting to refinance is to get the car paid off ASAP so we can focus more on our investments as this is the last non-mortgage debt we have.

CryptoCurrency,Screaming into the Void: A Rant about Sh**coins,"I am angry, I am tired, I am peeved, I am rage. I sat in vain while a dog spiked to its highs, and cheered to myself in the mirror when it crashed back to the shelf it now sits on.

I am not one to be happy by others‚Äô sorrows, but in that same breath, I found solace in knowing all those who ‚Äúyeeted‚Äù and ‚Äúyoloed‚Äù into a meme based currency found no gains but only loss. I‚Äôm not proud of that fact, but it‚Äôs true nonetheless.

Now I look upon the reign of a new dog, fully aware that it has raised %80,000,000 in the last 12 months. Buying just 2 cents (USD) of it a year ago would render you a millionaire today. Good for people that made a lot of money, but nonetheless, I am angry.

Is it because I missed out? Likely. Is it because others have played the game of cryptos better than I!?!? Me!? Who has done the research and carefully struck my keys to carve out a fantastic return on investments, only to be towered over by those who bought into a currency out of shear humor? 

Why can I not feel happy for myself and others? I‚Äôve been outwardly kind to all those involved in cryptos, but internally I am strafed with a cocktail of jealousy and greed, of vexation and fury. 

My discontent grows as that holy canine‚Äôs evaluation augments, my exasperation just a single piece fitting into the jigsaw of my bitterness and resentment.

And yet, I‚Äôve done well for myself, have I not. Haven‚Äôt we all? We‚Äôve watched as Bitcoin has conquered new heights not once but TWICE this year. We‚Äôve watched as Ethereum situated itself in a global realm of capitalization. Haven‚Äôt I cultivated a field of wealth in an arid region?

And as I sit with my raw emotions in one hand, staring at the bright green grass of my neighbor, I can‚Äôt help but think I am not the only man or woman praying for a downfall while rotting with guilt for doing so.

Thank you all for allowing me to unburden myself of these feelings I do not pride myself in having.

European central Banks are set to make an announcement. And then, the Fed after that.   


It is expected that the ECB will announce a taper, and maybe increase in rates.  
The Fed have said they will start tapering sometime in November, then raise rates in 2022.   


Will the tapering of all the key banks make the markets bleed red? Or have these events already been priced in?  


How about when the Fed raises interest rates? Is there someway that the banks can engage in contractionary monetary policy (while Government engage in contractions fiscal policies (raising taxes)) without their being some MAJOR correction in the markets?

&amp;#x200B;

The above picture is a lockout/ throttle from Kucoins trading page. There is no social media aspect. It's an exchange for context. THis Kucoins server is ""crashing"" during peak loads. They seem to go down way more than others and are quick to remind you, of that.  I have screen shots, keep scrolling

&amp;#x200B;

HSTS protocols are set up and configurable in Cloudflare in the HSTS panel.

If your solution is not big enough you can scale. Think Facebook ( bleh), Google, etcetc) they all handle tremendous loads.

The tech exists.  You can auto-scale with Amazon clouds SC2 hyper scaling. They have money, i mean 25 billion a day in transactions they advertise?

&amp;#x200B;

SO Why is this exchange have more downtime than all of its direct competitors?

THey get messages through system logs and fancy monitoring they already pay for. All their previous crashes are logged and they never go to vendors to have more uptime? arent they losing money on transaction fees... this woudl be expensive one would think.

&amp;#x200B;

You can throttle, scale and even turn throttling off. You can undersize a solution or outgrow it but there is always an upgrade path.

Cloudflare is GREAT, everyone uses it. How they use it is not ok

There is no reason for this to happen this much like this

This is not about margin this is about a liquidity engine.

A liquidity engine on par with a 3 Card Monty street-side hustle in the Bronx of New York.

&amp;#x200B;

TLD SUmmary:

Kucoin is not disclaiming risk on a server downtime and is throttling web gateways with hsts protocols at times of high volatility to harvest noobs margin and feeding it whales over liquidity issues

This is a breach of fiduciary duty

They are letting you know that  the stop losses won't always work in a written disclaimer. To escape legal issues.  Exhibiting their fiduciary duty to escape legal issues.

&amp;#x200B;

The scam works like this

* they lure people in with margin and leverage and create an image of safety and stewardship.
* they wait for periods of high price volatility and cut server access with HSTS protocols and some busted-looking code.
* Everyone is freaking out on social media, but don't worry here come our  pseudo hero Johnny KuCON
* Johny KuCON says every time ""we know there is an issue and we want to make it right, fill out this form and we will get back to you.
* Yoou get an offer of 0.5-2% of the total value of what you lost but hey they give you a voucher for free leverage so you can make up for your losses
* Anyone who complaines get told to DM me and I will make it all right.
* They try very hard to keep things out of public view. (Email DM, etc)
* Nothing happens the cycle repeats
* Noobs lose 97% of their crypto and get a voucher to get hawked again

If I was a bank and I sold you a mortgage ( the dumbest riskiest loan, a completely bad idea even if it was high interest in the middle of a forest fire, with dinosaurs shooting ninjas out of their eyes) I cant close my doors for 9 months and say you are in violation of repayment and foreclose on YOUR house.

If they disclose that detail of the bank not being open for repayment you are SOL. They fulfilled  **Fiduciary duty**, if they don't its   **Willful and wanton negligence** .

Last night Kucoin went down AGAIN. They liquidated a whole bunch of people but did not give them access. The exchange came back online.  They admit to having issues .....say sorry, take your crypto offer you a coupon and maybe 1% refund)

Do they get to keep the crypto because they locked the doors?

let me flip the tables for perspective.

&amp;#x200B;

Kucoin lets me keep my money on a trade rather than putting it in thier wallet.

I screw up and get liquidated.

Can I turn off my computer so they cant get payment?

I can say sorry once, maybe twice. but not 9 times in 45 days and 39 times over5 hours overtimes on September 7th.

They HAVE A GOD DAMN DISCLAIMER FOR THE STOP LOSS NOT ALWAYS TRIGGERING

They will tell you all about that one when you get liquidated. Its so they can enforce policy over you. They met their fiduciary duty by having it.

It they have that bad of an IT problem.... kill the trades without penalty, can I accidentally hit someone with my car and not payout.

&amp;#x200B;

Why are they banning so many people?

&amp;#x200B;

Call me a liar.

But let me ask one question at what point and I allowed to say Something is not right!

Hate on me all you want but at what point am I allowed to say please, just look.  Is it 5 outages in a month? 25 in 3 months?

&amp;#x200B;

Give me a number so I can say OK this is over the top. Anyone who talks about this is a conspiracy theorist or attacked for using leverage!

&amp;#x200B;

They trade 24billion  a day in transactions, right?  With how many It outages?

Is that acceptable?

Are the big numbers coming from the OTC desk?  Are those orders being processed during the downtime?

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to find 25-50 people since last night that we can vouch for before this moment that got a 100% refund!

&amp;#x200B;

Help me. I will eat my words

I will shut up and go away if someone can give me a sound reasonable threshold of tolerance for them to have server crashes this frequently?

&amp;#x200B;

What is a reasonable policy for them to have?

If my computer goes down 5 times a month do I get 5 refunds while I am trading?

In civil [litigation](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/litigation), [allegations](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/allegation) of fraud might be based on a misrepresentation of fact that was either [intentional](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/intent) or [negligent](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/negligence).¬† For a statement to be an [intentional](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/intent) misrepresentation, the person who made it must either have known the statement was false or been [reckless](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/reckless) as to its truth.¬† The speaker must have also intended that the person to whom the statement was made would rely on it.¬† The hearer must then have [reasonably relied](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/reasonable_reliance) on the promise and also been harmed because of that [reliance](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/reliance).¬†

A claim for fraud based on a [negligent](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/negligent) misrepresentation differs in that the speaker of the false statement may have actually believed it to be true; however, the speaker lacked [reasonable](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/reasonable) grounds for that belief.¬†

It was passed in 1986. It consists of two sections, [18¬†U.S.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_18_of_the_United_States_Code) [¬ß¬†1956](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1956) and [18¬†U.S.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_18_of_the_United_States_Code) [¬ß¬†1957](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1957).

Embezzlement

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/embezzlement.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/embezzlement.asp)

## What Is Embezzlement?

Embezzlement refers to a form of [white-collar crime](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/white-collar-crime.asp) in which¬†a person or entity misappropriates the [assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp) entrusted to them. In this type of fraud, the embezzler attains the assets lawfully and has the right to possess them, but the assets are then used for unintended purposes.

Embezzlement is a breach of the [fiduciary](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiduciary.asp) responsibilities placed upon a person.

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

* Embezzlement takes place when a person uses funds for a different purpose than they were intended to be used.
* Embezzlers might create bills and receipts for activities that did not occur and then use the money paid for personal expenses.
* Ponzi schemes are an example of embezzlement.
* Businesses lost approximately $400 billion each year to theft.
* Embezzlers can be held civilly and criminally responsible for their crimes.

They are in breach of fiduciary duty which qualified them for embezzlement

[https://webpop.io/cloudflare/error-1015-rate-limited/](https://webpop.io/cloudflare/error-1015-rate-limited/)

What is Rate Limiting?

Since lots of requests in a short period of time can overload a website, Cloudflare lets a site owner monitor and control your bandwidth consumption.

You can limit the impact of high-volume traffic by setting up a ‚Äúrate-limiting‚Äù rule on a per-IP address or domain basis through the Cloudflare rate-limiting feature in your website owner settings.

With rate limiting, Cloudflare can automatically block traffic from a suspicious site visitor or IP address so that hackers, spammers, and other online pests are can‚Äôt bog down your site‚Äôs performance with DDoS attacks and other illicit activities.

Cloudflare Error 1015: ‚ÄúYou are rating limited‚Äù results from one of a few possible causes.

Most frequently, when a legitimate site visitor is being blocked by the rate-limiting error 1015 it‚Äôs due to issues with the rate-limiting configuration that only the site owner can fix.

Leveraged Bitcoin Trading: This is THE REAL TRUTH

Coin Bureau  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4\_8xVYGvks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4_8xVYGvks)",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,Some clarification on the term 'shitcoin',"With SHIB doing what it's doing I see a ton of SHIB holders on here getting offended by the term 'shitcoin.' I think we should clear some stuff up.

The term itself sounds pretty aggressive and I can see why you guys might get upset but you should understand the meaning behind why people call your favorite meme coin a mean sounding name.

'I made 100x on my DOGE buy, how can that be a shitcoin?' you are asking yourself. Well, here's how I've seen the term used and how I've personally used it since I started in crypto a few years ago. A coin is usually labeled a shitcoin if it fits a few of the following criteria (list not exhaustive by any means, these are just the metrics I usually use to figure out how shitastic a coin or token is):

1. It was created with no purpose or as a joke or meme. Some assets don't have clear purposes when they are created but do eventually evolve into something with a purpose.
2. It has a low market cap
3. The overwhelming majority of it is held by a small number of wallets
4. The team behind it is not doxxed

BTC was at one point in this category! The team is not doxxed (who the fuck is Satoshi Nakamoto anyway), it at one point had a small market cap and the majority of it was held by a small number of wallets. Shit, that last one is apparently still true if you check out this graph though it is obfuscated a bit by the CEX wallets:[https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html)

Now we get to the important part - **the term is usually NOT being used to make you feel bad about your investment**. It is just a lot easier than writing out all this bullshit every time you want to say these things about a coin or token. 

**TLDR**; **stop getting so fucking offended every time you see the term shitcoin about something that you like**. Everything was a shitcoin at one point and possibly still is including the shittiest asset of all, $USD (most of it is owned by a relatively small number of people and who the fuck really runs the federal reserve anyway?) Have a beer or eat an edible, relax and don't let Reddit vernacular get you down.",cryptocurrency
Forex,"Hey all, I'm newer to FOREX trading (1.5ish months or so) and I have questions based on some things I've found so far.","There seems to be a pretty significant divide of beliefs:


There are those who believe in Technical Analysis, there those who say it's astronomy.

For those that say it works, there is widespread talk about ""popular indicators"" (to my knowledge) like S&amp;R, RSI, Bollinger, Stochastic, and Candlestick Patterns.
However, there is a large population who say to never use these. They reference market manipulation where non-commercial traders take note of hotspot zones created by ""popular"" retail strategies, making money by sending the market in the other direction with their influence. Evidence is provided through the referencing of client sentiment (net % clients long/short on a pair) and contrasting it to corresponding market data, which provided a strong foundation of support for their theories as in these charts price generally goes the opposite direction of this net sentiment.

There are also diverging stances on Fundamental Analysis. 

Some say FA drives markets and that it's more important than TA. These sources reference economic indicators like the relationship between inflation rates and interest rates, country GDP, Employment rate, Consumer Price Index, and so on. They place importance on not using all the same type of indicator (Leading, Coincident, Lagging). It makes a lot of logical sense to me that price wouldn't just be a bunch of trend lines and indicators on a chart, and that the governing bodies behind these two pairs and the news that accompanies it would factor heavily into consideration or at least create some sort of helpful directional bias in price.

Some say that FA matters in equal parts to TA and that although it does drive trader sentiment, it takes time for what is announced to be shown in price action, so price can still fluctuate in the opposite direction quite a bit. They suggest using overbought/oversold indicators to catch the reversals that lead into what everyone's expecting to happen like MACD, RSI, etc. a majority of which those who have the ""big bank"" narrative don't advise because they're widely used and antiquated.

Then there are those who say that FA doesn't matter at all. Big banks manipulate the markets, and that if you buy into the news you're feeding into the making of a trading hotspot that the banks take advantage of and drive markets in the opposite direction. A reference made in one of these claims was to the EUR/CHF crash in 2015. I'm sure many know, but at that time the Swiss bank came out and said price would never dip below 1.20 on that currency pair. It lead to a vast majority of traders taking long trades during which price was riding 1.20. After some amount of time, the pair inexplicably crashed to ~.97, taking many traders into debt. This is no doubt cherry picked data, but I can get a feel for why these people think like this, and the aforementioned client sentiment graph in combination with this creates a really convincing narrative.

Then there's the commitment of traders report. This kind of goes along with trading with the ""market makers"" or the non-commercial traders and that the trades I make should align with them, as they have the power to substantially move price one way or the other. Furthermore, commitment of ""retail"" traders seems to inversely correlate with the commitment of non-commercial traders, and that price normally goes in the way of these non-commercial traders, further strengthening the ""big-bank"" argument. 

Here's my outlook on this as a new trader

1. For me, FA importance positively correlates with the length of time I hold a position. With FOREX, I tend not to value FA as high since I trade on the Daily chart, and I close most positions on my demo account in a matter of days or weeks. With stocks, I'm planning on investing over years and decades with some 6-11 month growth timeframe stock picks, so FA would factor more there.

I'm not entirely convinced on the big bank narrative, but I do understand what the argument is, and coincidentally don't use many of the ""popular"" indicators (edgy, I know :) ).                             

As of current, I'm working toward using a combination of a 200SMA to determine trend, Andrews/Modified Schiff pitchforks on Major Swing Levels to gauge price channels and entry points, a mix of ATR and the boundaries of the pitchforks to set stop loss, and generally, a 1.5 to 2-1 Reward Risk. I risk no more than 2% of my demo account on each trade, with no more than 7.5% of my ""account"" actively trading at a time.

I would love to hear your thoughts as I'm trying to learn as much as I can from as many viewpoints as I can find. Thanks everyone!",finance

14. One of Cardano‚Äôs biggest competitors is once again suffering network problems. This time it started out as just being characterized as (more) ‚Äúinstability‚Äù, then they started saying that something had caused the blockchain to ‚Äústart forking‚Äù. This followed their September 2 ‚Äúinstability‚Äù and ‚Äúperformance degradation‚Äù event. It‚Äôll be interesting to see how well their community tolerates this in the future if it‚Äôs happening with their planned slashing model in effect.

20. Now one of Cardano‚Äôs most highly visible critics is implying that the Cardano community has something in common with anti-vaxxers. Unfortunately for him, it was one of his pet blockchains that was down a few days ago while Cardano just kept healthily trucking right along.

26. After the Senate hearing on Tuesday September 14th, Gary Gensler (SEC Chairman) gave a quote to a crypto publication indicating that custodial lending and possibly even staking platforms might be considered securities. This is very relevant for Cardano since it has non-custodial staking whereas many of its competitors have the kind of custodial staking that Gensler may have been contemplating. [https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/117675/crypto-lending-staking-custody-gensler-sec](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/117675/crypto-lending-staking-custody-gensler-sec)

50. In late 2008/early 2009 it turns out Hal Finney was learning Haskell and trying to figure out how to reduce C02 emissions from a (future) widely used Bitcoin. That sounds a lot like Cardano.

52. Wow! It‚Äôs looking like Meld has landed a partnership with a mobile provider in Nigeria with nine million customers. Not many details out at this point (Sept 30).

55. The Wall Street Journal has dropped a video on stablecoins. A lot of the video surrounds the Tether dollar reserve controversy. It‚Äôs notable that Cardano‚Äôs Djed solves this.

57. Cardano users on twitter piece together that Charles was talking about visiting [u/Pezesha\_Africa](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pezesha_Africa/) (in regard to microfinance) in Kenya.

58. Crypto twitter users try to depict US Whitehouse comments out of context to fuel an economic doom narrative.

70. Representative Tom Emmer clashes with SEC Head Gensler over the direction of crypto regulation. However, it‚Äôs unclear how much Rep. Emmer‚Äôs solution (his Securities Clarity Act bill) would solve the problem given that it only relieves issuers of securities regulation burdens after they have already complied with the ‚Äúregistration or exemption‚Äù hurdle.

personalfinance,High Yield Savings,So I have 10k that I want to invest and do not have much experience in finances.

Should I just hold onto it and wait or?,finance
personalfinance,Should we put down 10 or 20 percent for new home?,"Hey everybody, my wife and I are getting ready to purchase a new home and wanted some advice. Details are as follows:

Purchase price: $259,900

Current cash savings: $68,000

We should have an additional $4-5,000 saved by the time we close for a total of $72-73,000. We currently bring home around $4,200 after taxes and retirement and before any overtime that I work fairly regularly.

Only other debt is a $350 car payment with a 2.8% interest rate.

We have already put down $2,000 that will come off the down payment price. If we put down 20 percent, that‚Äôs another $50k plus closing costs which should leave us around $12k left over. If we put down 10 percent we should have around $38k left over.

My plan is to put down 10 percent and use the rest to fully fund our 6 month E fund as well as pay off the vehicle loan, freeing up $350 a month in cash as we have our first child on the way. Does this sound like a good plan, or would you all put down the full 20 percent in my situation? The difference in monthly payment with PMI is around $120 a month.

CryptoCurrency,No interest rate from banks,"Howdy yall 
Was just looking over some of me financial crap last night. Not really the best with banks and all that just have no patience for someone shafting me but was looking at my super for starters. Noticed on the front page in big writing like it was something good saying youll earn 11% interest over ten years, i thought really whats the point. Plenty of fees coming out thou. I said to the old boy id be better of putting it in the bank and getting the interest from them.  His response was you dont get interest from banks anymore. Is this serious im in australia is this cuz off the interest rates dropping or wat how long has this been happening. 

The big thing j dont understand is if this is true why havent the vast majority of people basically dumped there bank account except for what you need to live off and put it into bitcoin or other crypto.

People are funny, chatting to the brother last night hes fairly wealthy into shares and shit he said if bitcoin drops down again hell buy in i just laughed. He doesnt understand it at all. He bought one at 16 and sold it for 26. Still cant believe it.

 Ive been around bitcoin since it started i was a junkie and used it for drugs off the darknet. I begged everyone i knew to buy some for them selves everyone just laughed and said if its so good why dont you buy it yourself. My biggest regret was being hooked on drugs back then. Im clean now have been for years. But if i was only able to put a grand or to in back then and hold it my hole family would be set up now. 

The one thing that does always come up in my mind is i begged them they piss thousands away on shares that have gone bad. They never listened and werent willing to take a chance. I still believe btc would skyrocket but there not interested. I always wanted to help my family but i dont get the same vibes from them really they seem kind of greedy and dumb. 
Parents retired earlier this year i told them we should put their money in btc they laughed again. Btc was at 40k aus then sitting at 80k aus now
I knew it would rise to that i told them i guaranteed it, goto stop living in the moment i guess.

The one thing i know is i made the mistake of telling them how much i have. Every now and again when i mention it to the old boy he still ask you still got that bitcoin to the point lol. He aint forgot she gunna get interesting down the track.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,Why I converted all my ETH and selling ERC-20 tokens.,"Rant ahead:

I got charged 40$ for a failed transaction. Then Another 40$ to transfer my GRT out of the Ethereum Mainnet. Can you imagine a bank charging you 40$ on a transaction that failed? You configured everything right, but it simply didn't work.

This stuff is not user friendly and even if it does see mainstream adoption, it's gonna rip off all the people who are getting ripped off on high percentage interest rates on credit cards and wire transfers. Ether isn't the silver of crypto, it's a centralized scam machine and with rising projects like DOT, ONE and SOL, I have no incentive to use it. Good luck",cryptocurrency

solar,Hesitations over Home Solar,"So we've had a few companies come out and quote us for a solar system. My house is just about perfect for it - south facing roof, pitch very close to our latitude, not a lick of shade anywhere near it. In the southern US so we spend a good bit on AC costs during the summer in particular. All electric appliances (including winter heat).

 I was on board ready to pull the trigger but I'm having some hesitations just because its such a long term commitment. Was wondering what you guys' thoughts are.

1. They recommended a system with a whole home battery, which I like the idea of because our power goes out fairly often. Id say we lose it for a half day probably every other month and im tired of it being out just long enough to ruin all the perishables in my fridge...but also we lost power for 6 days after Hurricane Ida a few months back. It would be nice to have some off-grid like capability when our power does go out, and i don't want to pay $10-15k for a standby generator that only gets used 6 times a year. 
But I have reservations that today's battery tech will hold up, considering we're looking to finance the system over 20 years. The manufacturer warranty on the panels is 25 yr, but the battery is only 12 years? What are you guys thoughts on that?

2. Obviously there's still the federal solar tax credit that is decreasing year over year. But are PV systems becoming cheaper at a faster rate than that? I'm worried that what seems like a decent economic choice now will be foolish in 10 years if the costs of solar keep dropping and I'm tied into a 20 year payment.

I would appreciate some feedback from third party folks like y'all, since obviously the solar sales guys don't exactly have my best interests at heart.",energy
Bitcoin,"No, Bitcoin is not controlled by a small group of investors and miners (A rebuttal to the TechSpot article)","https://preview.redd.it/vli0ofqwf6w71.jpg?width=3840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a704c47375637858c27216379ae8313dadf8be8

This could be a long read. Kindly bear with me.

I write this primarily in response to the [TechSpot article](https://www.techspot.com/news/91937-bitcoin-largely-controlled-small-group-investors-miners-study.html) from yesterday (r/technology mods told me they only allow ‚Äú*mainstream news articles with* *editorial oversight and fact-checking*‚Äù so I'm sharing this here).

But I‚Äôd also like to take this opportunity to write about Bitcoin more broadly as someone who has been following it for more than a decade and I‚Äôll try to do so without complicating the conversation for anyone unfamiliar with Bitcoin.

The TechSpot article cites a non-peer-reviewed National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) [working paper](https://www.nber.org/papers/w29396) from Igor Makarov and Antoinette Schoar.

NBER claims to be non-partisan but it is a private NPO funded by the likes of [Bill Gates foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/committed-grants/2019/11/inv003527).

The chairman of NBER, Karen Horn, is a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and Head of International Private Banking for Bankers Trust.

The authors of this working paper, Igor Makarov and Antoinette Schoar are no experts in Bitcoin.

Makarov is employed by Financial Markets Group (FMG), which focuses on policy research into financial markets and works alongside [banks and regulators in Europe](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/html/index.en.html).

Schoar is a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management and co-chair of NBER Corporate Finance group, who has [previously made it clear ](https://bcf.princeton.edu/events/antoinette-schoar/)that she is no fan of Bitcoin with some pretty misguided takes on it.

It‚Äôs critical to note that the data regarding miners cited in this study is from when mining was largely concentrated in China. This is [no longer the case](https://cbeci.org/mining_map).

The paper claims the authors have ‚Äúthe ability to trace miners on the blockchain.‚Äù The tracking method shown in the paper is based on subjective, unverified ‚Äúalgorithm to track the distribution of mining rewards from the largest 20 mining pools to the miners that work for them.‚Äù

The validity of this conjectural method of tracking was also subjectively verified before all mining operations migrated out of China to many different parts of the world.

&amp;#x200B;

# Bitcoin distribution is not highly concentrated

The first thing we need to acknowledge with Bitcoin is that it is still very much a nascent monetary system. It has come a long way in a short space of time but it‚Äôs only been around 13 years and only 3% of the world‚Äôs population currently use Bitcoin.

It took the Internet 25 years to get to that point. So while adoption is certainly happening a lot quicker, we still have 97% of the world‚Äôs population to bring on board. Unlike the banking system, which has ostracized nearly half of the world‚Äôs adult population, Bitcoin can actually work for every person in the world, no matter who they are or where they come from.

The top wallet addresses [here](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html) do not belong to individuals. Almost all active addresses holding greater than 10 basis points of the total supply (greater than 0.1%) are addresses belonging to exchanges and custodial services holding custody of Bitcoin that belong to millions of individual users. Not all exchange addresses have been tagged by bitinfocharts. For instance, the third largest address, looking at activity and transaction patterns, [very likely belongs to Coinbase](https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/block/707013/1P5ZEDWTKTFGxQjZphgWPQUpe554WKDfHQ).

Now **you‚Äôre not supposed to be holding your Bitcoin in exchanges** as that defeats the whole point of Bitcoin, besides enabling rehypothecation, which can artificially inflate the supply, and other security risks, but a lot of people do since they‚Äôre new to Bitcoin, unfamiliar with the concept of self-custody, and inadequately appreciate the purpose and potential of Bitcoin. There are ongoing educational efforts to encourage people to take ownership of their Bitcoin.

**Not your keys. Not your sats.**

The wealth distribution is admittedly far from where it needs to be, but it‚Äôs heading in the right direction. As more and more users adopt Bitcoin, the Gini index improves markedly. The game theory embedded into the protocol ensures that it does over time. The article from TechSpot claims that 10,000 individuals control a third of the supply. This, even if we assume to be accurate at face value, is a vastly improved figure from only 2 years ago, when [less than 5000 wallets](https://imgur.com/aNP9Ew6) were estimated to own half the supply.

On-chain analytics firm, Glassnode, [published](https://insights.glassnode.com/bitcoin-supply-distribution/) a finding earlier this year that ownership of Bitcoin is not highly concentrated and it naturally disperses over time. I‚Äôll explain a little later in this article why that is the case.

&amp;#x200B;

# Beyond the cryptocurrency

Let‚Äôs try to first understand Bitcoin beyond the cryptocurrency, as a software protocol and what it represents for humanity. Sure, price speculation is fun but for me, it‚Äôs the least interesting aspect of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is open-source software collectively hosted by a pure P2P permissionless network of ‚àº 60,000 nodes distributed across the world‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääby far the largest pure P2P network ever. Anyone in the world can propose changes to this software no matter who you are. There‚Äôs no central server or hierarchical structure to this network. You don‚Äôt need anyone‚Äôs permission to access the network. We don‚Äôt need to know who Satoshi was to trust the system because the code is open for every single human being in the world to read and scrutinize. Satoshi was simply the first, founding contributor to this open software.

This is such a revolutionary egalitarian concept so far removed from all the corruption and iniquities that inhere within our extant hierarchical technology and monetary systems that a lot of people understandably find it difficult to grasp but this could fundamentally fix the world and make money and technology at large work for everyone without privileges.

There‚Äôs a common misunderstanding that Bitcoin has great value because it was the first digital currency. This is untrue. There were several prior attempts‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäB-money, Bit gold and Hashcash the most prominent among them. Satoshi‚Äôs proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm solved a critical flaw in the use of blockchain as a public ledger known as [the Byzantine Generals Problem](https://river.com/learn/what-is-the-byzantine-generals-problem/) (BGP).

Solving for BGP meant that we could have an open ledger network without a central server or middlemen where nobody had to trust anybody else for the system to work. Every node within the Bitcoin network is a server with a live copy of the ledger and each node is able to verify the authenticity of its copy of the ledger without having to trust any of the other nodes.

The concept of blockchain predates Bitcoin by almost two decades. So the value was never in blockchain but the way Bitcoin was able to utilize blockchain as a trustless, permissionless, decentralized public ledger to democratically create, distribute and exchange value.

On the face of it, it‚Äôs easy to mischaracterize Bitcoin as some kind of an investment scheme. It is absolutely not that ([The Newcoiner Dilemma](https://preview.redd.it/kngn40wr20d71.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3b134c484734a2b004220711e06767ce4d9aebe)). Who is to benefit from an investment scheme where nobody is in charge?

Bitcoin is a complete revamp of our monetary system to make it work for everyone and more broadly, as a software protocol, Bitcoin has the potential to fix the Internet‚Äôs original sin‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcentralization at the hands of few privileged gatekeepers‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand restore it to its originally intended form as a [decentralized P2P network protocol](https://preview.redd.it/5rc5zsks00d71.png?width=880&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=758cbf3af64ea5a1a1d4edcfe7235a9db9231c5c).

A network protocol is only decentralized if any participant within the network is able to access and verify the truth (the state of the ledger) on their own in a very economical manner without requiring permission or trust. We‚Äôve seen many predatory knock-offs since Bitcoin, which are little more than snake-oil marketing gimmicks with fundamentally flawed protocol designs and centralized node architectures. Cynical rent-seeking and exploitation just comes with the territory for any revolutionary technology.

Permissioned, quasi-permissioned, DINO (decentralized in name only) blockchains are a waste of time. Blockchains are comparatively inefficient databases unless truly decentralized. What makes them special is the ability to individually host, validate and audit the ledger.

Throughout Bitcoin‚Äôs history, Bitcoiners have staunchly defended the right of users of the network not to be priced out of running their own node, [most famously 4 years ago](https://www.amazon.com/Blocksize-War-controls-Bitcoins-protocol/dp/B08YQMC2WM) when **Bitcoin users stood firm in the face of pressure from miners and corporate interests to prove that it was the users who truly controlled Bitcoin, not miners and not wealthy investors**.

Anyone can host their own [Bitcoin full node on a Raspberry Pi](https://preview.redd.it/1ohgb7ol00d71.png?width=829&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be47cad6110b6147c8d55410b23bca8205cff9ec). This allows them to be an equal rights citizen within the network without delegating trust to a third party. If you cannot self-host a node on your own, you‚Äôre going from trusting bankers to trusting a random person on the internet. That doesn‚Äôt seem so revolutionary, does it?

&amp;#x200B;

# How does such a network¬†scale?

Let‚Äôs take the Internet as an example. The IP suite is a software protocol like Bitcoin. It originally had a monolithic design until we figured out that it could not scale without [layered architecture](https://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/~ptw/teaching/IWT/transport-layer/tcp-ip-layers.jpg). Bitcoin has undertaken a similar multi-layered approach to scaling in recent years.

Bitcoin‚Äôs base layer is the network layer protocol and the monetary settlement layer. Priorities for this layer are maximizing security and trust-minimization. Built on top of this is a payments layer called Lightning Network.

Lightning Network is a decentralized layer-2 network protocol that uses a native smart contract scripting language to enable instant, almost feeless, global [Bitcoin payments](https://imgur.com/2zUCL2b).

In Lightning Network, parties to a transaction are required only to have a sufficiently funded open channel active in the network. This is done through a single on-chain transaction.

If there is a direct channel open between the parties, the transaction is routed directly and incurs [no fee](https://preview.redd.it/esqddcdq10d71.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95c4cb49f6d3405594ee84a16c693b558daa0b18). Without a direct channel, the transaction is routed through routing nodes, incurring a small fee, typically no more than a few sats (fraction of a cent), paid to routing nodes hosted by users of the network.

You can find a live node map for Lightning Network [here](https://explorer.acinq.co/). It‚Äôs pretty remarkable how far Lightning Network has come in only 3 years.

With Lightning Network‚Äôs maturation as an infinitely scalable decentralized global payments network, Bitcoin is shifting focus to its next big milestone, Taproot, which is due to go live in mid-November at block height 709632.

Taproot brings [a set of protocols](https://bitcoinops.org/en/preparing-for-taproot/) that enhance Bitcoin‚Äôs privacy, scalability and unlocks the path for seamless integration of application protocols on top of Bitcoin while also ensuring that users are still able to economically run their own Bitcoin full node.

&amp;#x200B;

# Game Theory of¬†Bitcoin

Cypherpunks were pursuing the concept of Bitcoin, a decentralized P2P monetary system, for two decades. Satoshi completed the final, most important, piece of the jigsaw‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsolving the Byzantine Generals Problem to prevent double-spend.

In doing so, Satoshi sought to address two fundamental flaws with fiat money,

1- Centralized, focused issuance and control of money supply and monetary policy

2- Trivial cost of issuance

While issuance entails no cost, the money remains at the mercy of the basest of human qualities, self-seeking greed. All corruptive tendencies of fiat money are a direct consequence of the trivial cost to issue infinite money.

Satoshi‚Äôs proof-of-work algorithm solved for these two flaws by implementing [an ingenious cost of issuance algorithm](https://imgur.com/eFwM54J) that keeps every actor honest and forever scales in proportion to Bitcoin‚Äôs value as a monetary network‚Ää‚Äîthe higher Bitcoin's value, the higher the cost of issuance.

Proof-of-work requires those who acquire the new supply of coins (miners) to continually input real-world work for their rewards and cover recurring operational costs. The work ensures that those who receive the new supply of money cannot keep hoarding it for themselves. Miners are forced by the game theory embedded into the protocol to redistribute Bitcoin into the market.

Any monetary system [where the creation of money entails no work and cost](https://www.amazon.com/Ethics-Money-Production-Guido-H%C3%BClsmann/dp/1933550090) would be [fiat 2.0](https://imgur.com/g2MVTAy) all over again, a system where wealth equals power, where [the rich forever get richer and the poor get poorer](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/world-s-richest-become-wealthier-during-covid-pandemic-inequality-grows-n1255506).

In proof-of-work, wealth¬†!= power

Miners input work and recurring costs to find blocks and receive compensation for their work but the blocks are validated by full node users, not miners. Full nodes enforce the rules‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääaccept or reject blocks found by miners‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand hold the power to keep miners honest. Every full node user has one vote. Proof-of-work admits of no corruption or privileges.

A large portion of the world‚Äôs population is affected by either hyperinflation and/or lack of banking services (c. 4 billion people). Bitcoin allows them to connect to an open, permissionless network to generate, store and exchange value where nobody can stop them. The combination of proof-of-work and economical self-hosted nodes distributed all across the world is what ensures Bitcoin's antifragility, securing the network from [state attacks](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/10/23221016/edward-snowden-china-banning-bitcoin-just-made-it-stronger).

# Bitcoin, a global leader in clean energy innovation

20 years ago, [the Internet was boiling the oceans](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1999/0531/6311070a.html?sh=54f838642580). Today, it‚Äôs Bitcoin. In 20 years, the next emerging technology. Energy, in manifold forms, has always been fundamental to human interaction and its impact, an ineluctable consequence of human evolution.

Bitcoin is at once the most fundamentally important technological and monetary evolution for humanity. For the first time in human history, every human on earth can become financially sovereign, set free from the whims of other humans.

Bitcoin is a huge net positive for humanity and [a global leader in renewable energy innovation](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-large-scale-bitcoin-mining-is-driving-clean-energy-innovation-2021-01-06). The renewable energy share of the Bitcoin network is over 4 times that of the average grid. In 2020, renewable energy sources accounted for only about 12% of total U.S. energy consumption. [58% of global Bitcoin mining operations](https://imgur.com/98f7mSM) are powered by renewables.

According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), 66% of the primary energy used to create electricity is wasted by the time the electricity arrives at the customer meter. Bitcoin is able to [harness stranded/wasted energy](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-07-01/bitcoin-mining-with-stranded-energy-video), while also mitigating the climate effects of other industries [by capturing flared gas](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/bitcoin-mining-flare-gas-btc-energy-crusoe-energy-coinbase-winklevoss-2021-6) that would otherwise be vented into the atmosphere contributing to climate change. Other industries find the cost of transporting energy prohibitive.

We progress as a civilization, from Type 0 to Type 1, using more energy, not less. Bitcoin is critical to unlocking humanity's energy potential as it directly incentivizes R&amp;D in sustainable energy‚Äîby subsidizing broader transition to renewables, tapping remote/stranded energy resources, mitigating CH4 emissions from O&amp;G, stabilizing grids and accelerating humanity towards securing a clean, energy abundant future.

&amp;#x200B;

# The quest for perfect¬†money

What's money? Anything that‚Äôs accepted as representing value by the parties to any transaction. It‚Äôs really that simple. Three thousand years ago, cowrie shells were used to represent value. We‚Äôve had [various forms of money](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/history-money/) since but the quest remains the same. Humans have always sought money that can hold value over time until it was required to purchase other things that hold value to them‚Ää‚Äî‚Äägoods and services.

If we look at money from this perspective, we could argue that money is technology but until now, we never had the technology to come up with a money that was able to fulfill all three functions of money‚Ää‚Äî‚Äästore of value (SoV), medium of exchange (MoE) and unit of account (UoA).

Bitcoin is at once a good SoV (scarce and incorruptible), a good MoE (the payments layer‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäLightning Network), and a good UoA (infinite divisibility and instant portability across the world).

I view Bitcoin to be the culmination of humanity‚Äôs 7000-year technological quest to perfect the representation of value by truly democratizing its creation, distribution and exchange. Never before have we had a money with all the necessary properties of sound money. All previous forms of money had compromises.

Scarce money has always been sound money but previous iterations of scarce money lacked the [other properties](https://preview.redd.it/t1azmamjn0u71.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eeb96dbc2eb0e78bfaaca45fb2da5b10305848f1) required to be viable as MoE and UoA‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfungible, readily portable, infinitely divisible, incorruptible, indestructible, provably finite and objectively verifiable.

Bitcoin ticks all the boxes. It further adds a new dimension to money hitherto unimaginable, obviating the need for trust, eliminating counterparty risk without the burden, cost and attendant inefficiencies of involving trusted middlemen.

# Fiat money is a pyramid¬†scheme

It would be remiss not to highlight at this time just how [inequitable](https://www.wtsp.com/article/news/nation-world/un-world-hunger-billionaires-elon-musk/67-329635e8-6602-4bd1-b607-781cfd9ba7e0) our current monetary system is and, something we don‚Äôt often speak of, the [jarring impact](https://i.imgur.com/kLSpP6B.jpeg) of inflation-driven compulsive consumerism on climate change.

The current system of credit constantly incentivizes you through a myriad of machinations to keep spending money from tomorrow‚Äôs labor, but the new injection of money from your tomorrow‚Äôs labor ends up being concentrated at the top, with the ultimate consequence of inequitably diminishing your purchasing power and continually enriching those at the top of the pyramid.

In short, money borrowed against your future labor ends up destroying your own purchasing power while the lender profits off your future labor, both in the form of interest and by being closer to the new money. It‚Äôs a double whammy. Fiat money post hoc undercuts the value of our work and time, except for the top 0.01%, some of whom [have seen their wealth grow almost 10-fold](https://inequality.org/great-divide/updates-billionaire-pandemic/) during a once-in-a-hundred-year global pandemic.

In 1971, President Nixon canceled the convertibility of the US dollar to gold. The subsequent collapse of the Bretton Woods system gave central banks absolute monetary authority as the dollar was no longer required to be backed by gold reserves.

Central banks‚Äô newfound ability to continually manipulate supply, interest rates, and velocity of money has led to deleterious consequences. Perpetual expansion to spur illusory ‚Äúeconomic growth‚Äù has sent deficits spiraling out of control and resulted in, inter alia, a vicious cycle of high inflation, recession as a consequence of efforts to mitigate the effects thereof and ever-increasing, now extreme, economic inequality.

I‚Äôll just leave it [here](https://imgur.com/a/4LlWaKy) as to the enduring effects of the Nixon shock.

# Triffin paradox

The Triffin paradox explains why any sovereign currency serving as a global reserve currency is unworkable‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe state issuing the reserve currency is required to continually run up a deficit to meet the world‚Äôs demand for its currency. This creates a conflict of interest between domestic and international monetary policies, which becomes untenable in the long run, leading to the collapse of the system. The [average lifespan for reserve currencies](https://preview.redd.it/raj2vtkxn0u71.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7bf93b12c22fda167d3108814d0a6b2b3fef5740) is 95 years.

Bitcoin is the only monetary system in history that has the properties to last forever, for, unlike all previous monetary systems, it doesn‚Äôt derive value from the authority or wealth of the issuer, which is fleeting, but a timeless universal constant‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähard-coded mathematics.

&amp;#x200B;

# Closing thoughts

I‚Äôd like to earnestly urge everyone to read mainstream articles about Bitcoin through a lens of scrutiny as to the interests of those who own these organizations. There‚Äôs an ongoing campaign to poison the well with blatant disinformation while simultaneously accumulating Bitcoin for themselves.

When you really burrow down the Bitcoin rabbit hole, you come to realize that Bitcoin is quite the culture shock, a monetary paradigm shift irreconcilable with the status quo sustained by immoderate expansion normalized through generational indoctrination of the rationally vulnerable to acquiesce to furtive post hoc theft of the value of their work and time, especially in the last 50 years post-Nixon shock.

Mainstream media organizations are owned by the banking establishment and beneficiaries of the fiat pyramid scheme [who stand to lose a lot of power](https://preview.redd.it/r5jquqfi31u71.png?width=1065&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68019bec64e17df45ef3f72c5e7c1d8e3b167e2e) if 8 billion people were to understand [the peaceful revolution](https://imgur.com/Y2rhS0w) that is Bitcoin.

There are no C-suites, marketing/PR teams in Bitcoin to manipulate public opinion or issue any official statements in rebuttal to intellectually dishonest journalism. Bitcoin keeps plowing along honestly, paying no mind to assorted naysayers motivated by self-interest seeking to further various agendas.

Original principal balance was $223,100. My last statement I paid $389.55 to Principal, and $566.16 to interest. My current PMI is $94.82.  I started out doing payments every 2 weeks, but for the past few months been paying an additional $150 to principal each month. So I'd be paying this off before the 30 years. My property taxes have gone up, so my escrow payment will be adjusted, this year I was basically paying $1,506.93 each month all inclusive. They are giving me options on refinancing.

One option is now only $1,352.55, $869 for principal and interest. Interest rate is 2.5%, and PMI would be $153. They are saying the breakeven is 89 months(not sure what this means to be honest with you - I guess when they decide I have the equity in place to get rid of the PMI?).  The lower interest rate entices me, and this lower monthly payment gives me wiggle room for the increase I'll have because of my property taxes. Then I can keep paying off more each month than the minimum. Am I overthinking this and because I still have 29 years left on the mortgage, just dive in for the cheaper rate? 

I'd like to go for the 15 year, but that interest rate is only 2.375%, so not a huge advantage, and I hamstring myself with the higher monthly payments in case something comes up and I would like to have that extra cash flow.

personalfinance,My job has been reporting my income under the wrong SSN for a year now and it's affecting many areas of my financial health. I need advice.,"I work at private resort for the super wealthy in rural Montana. It's a seasonal job, so we are at work from June through September, and then come back December through April. This means that twice a year I go on to job attached unemployment. I have worked for my current employer for 3 years now. They have changed payroll companies more times than I can count, and I think that's how this error got started.

Somehow, in October of 2020, my job started reporting my income under the wrong social security number. Nobody caught it. HR and payroll didn't catch it, I didn't catch it, H&amp;R block didn't catch it when I did my taxes, etc. 

When I applied for unemployment at the end of September this year 2021, I got denied for not having a history of wages in the last year in my state. Obviously I had worked the whole year so I was really confused. I got to the bottom of it and found out the SSN was wrong. I thought it was just going to be a matter of my job getting a hold of unemployment and letting them know that all was good. I was wrong.

The last two offseasons, from October 17th 2020 to November 28th 2020 and then again from April 24th 2021 to June 12th 2021, I had been collecting unemployment. I didn't realize that there was a problem already during those dates, because the federal government had pushed through unemployment benefits for people even if they weren't eligible through job attachment or through state wages (because of the pandemic). So the Feds just used my previous financial data and continued my benefits through those periods for the same amount that I've always received. I never got any kind of notification that I was being switched from regular job attached state unemployment to this federal coronavirus pandemic unemployment fund. But that's why the money kept coming. And because the money kept coming, I had no reason to think that there was any problem at all.

Flash forward to the present. I call my job, my job calls unemployment, they told me that everything is taken care of. But it's not. Now that my job has gone in and retroactively added wage information for the last year, it has negated my eligibility for the receipt of the pandemic funds from The above stated dates. So now the federal government thinks that I owe them $9,235, which they are expecting me to pay back, And will garnish any unemployment wages I receive in the future until it is fulfilled.

They're saying that because I am making more money now than I used to, my benefit amount has increased from $457 a week to $618, but because I have such a big debt, they're going to confiscate 50% of that money each week, bringing my benefit amount down to $388 until the $9,235 is paid back.

But I don't owe this money. I was gainfully employed the entire time. And I can't live off of $388 a week. Additionally, now it looks like I committed wage fraud. This could affect my eligibility in the future. I have an unemployment fund that my money is pulled from, based on the wages that I earned throughout the season, and I have never fully depleted it. I have always enjoyed a good cushion of about $3k in that fund. So due to this clerical error on someone else's part, my unemployment fund has been completely depleted and no longer has that healthy cushion, additionally I look like a criminal, I'm going to lose half of my wages for the entire offseason, and -I didn't realize this until recently- I got declined for two credit cards because they couldn't verify my income, which tanked my score by almost 50 points.

Without income, my credit is all I have right now. Unemployment keeps telling me that I'm going to start getting paid every week, but every week No payment comes. Payday was supposed to be today again. No money, again.

No one at my job seems to be taking this seriously. I live in a very expensive place, usually only super wealthy people live here. But I live here because of work. So I'm bleeding money out of pocket from my savings just trying to stay afloat right now waiting for anybody to figure this out. Juggling credit cards. And my credit score has suffered. I want to buy a house, that's what I've been saving for, and now I have these marks against me that even if my job sorts out my financial situation, are going to stay on my credit for like 2 years. I don't think that's fair. I haven't done anything wrong here, but I'm the only one who is facing consequences. Not to mention that the government thinks that I owe them almost all of my savings!

I don't know if my taxes are correct. I don't even know how to figure that out. And if they're not correct I don't even know what to do about it.

The place that I live is super duper rural. We don't even have postal service here, which has exacerbated this issue because I'm not receiving my mail in a timely fashion. I have a PO box in the next county over, but it's like a 72 mile round trip. My car needs to go in the shop, it has a check engine light on and it's guzzling gas. But of course, I can't bring my car to the shop because I don't have any income right now. So I can't afford to drive out and check my mail every single day, I've been checking it once a week. But honestly I haven't received any helpful correspondence from my state unemployment or my job.

Please help, I'm so lost, I don't know what to do and my money is running out. I'm sorry if this is flared incorrectly; I Don't even know how to categorize this ridiculous problem.

Again, I apologize for grammar and misspelling since on mobile (nothing new right?)

I have an Ok health insurance plan through my employer. I use it to cover for my two small children. We have a pretty frequent visit with their specialists and after I have met all of my deductible and maxed out of pocket(OOP). Went in for a visit I was told I need to pay 250 for that procedure, and I investigate why would I still need to pay after deductible/OOP are met.

Turns out that one procedure is not covered by insurance because it should only be done 1 time ever 3 years. Now this is probably true if you are 18yrs or older but not under 5years old as their bodies continues to grow. I found that my state mandated that insurance would covered it and filed an denial appeal with my insurance provider. 
They came back to me saying that they are ""Self-Funded ERISA plan that follows the Federal mandates only""
What can I do? Any suggestions? I am not well equipped to fork over 250 dollars every time both of my child have the procedure.

Much thanks in advance.",finance
personalfinance,What to do with my credit card debt,"Hi all, I am 35 and have never really been money responsible. I never learned how to save money or spend it. Over the years I have racked up about 5k in credit card debt over 5 credit cards. Over the past few months I have been paying them off but with 26%+ interest rates it feels like it's going to take another year to pay them off. I'm paying about $100-$125 in interest per month over all 5 CC's. 

I was thinking what the the best options to paying them all off faster? Should I just pick one to pay off first then move to the next one? Or I also have 20k in my 401k that I could take out the money to pay them all off and then just pay myself back over the next year or so. Or I also was thinking about calling one of these debt consolidation companies to see what they could offer. 

As far as my income, I make about 58,000 a year and after bills, and living cost, I can pay about $300-400 per month to these credit cards so at that rate it's looking like a year before I pay everything off. 

Mostly asking for what is the best way to go about this",finance

personalfinance,Mortgage payments,"Hi, so I would like suggestions or advice on how to pay my mortgage off. 
I just started this year on a 25 year amortization, 2.3% closed interest rate for 5 years. Monthly payments are ~$1200. 

My initial plan was to pay the minimum monthly for 5 years while I save up money. Then I can pay off all or most of the mortgage at the 5 year mark. 

However, I know it‚Äôs always a good idea to put in as much money as you go to offset the interest accumulating. I think I would save a few hundred dollars in interest by paying an annual lump sum or even more with a monthly lump sum.

My question is, wouldn‚Äôt it be better to keep the lump sum I would have paid annually, invest it for more than the 2.3%, and then eventually use the lump to pay off the principal at the end of 5 years?",finance

cardano,Cardano community discussion on the future of governance,"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/30/crypto-miamicoin/

In this article, which discusses Miami‚Äôs experiment with crypto and blockchain technology the mayor says, ‚ÄúWhen you think about the possibility of being able to run a government without the citizens having to pay taxes. That‚Äôs incredible,‚Äù 

Suarez said, adding that the partnership creates a ‚Äúcounternarrative‚Äù to the idea that city programs require raising taxes or ‚Äúprivate sector philanthropy.‚Äù

As an American I‚Äôve always heard our country was founded on the principle of ‚Äúno taxation without representation‚Äù. Do you think the opposite holds true? That there is no representation without taxation? How will Representative Democracies change from the implementation of this technology in municipality level politics?

I‚Äôve been thinking about how a stake pool operating on cardano could be used for city utilities like waste removal and water services and how that could function in a way that affords the citizens the opportunity to have more say, and the officials overseeing it less responsibility in its management.

I‚Äôm posting this in hopes to start a discussion about how this tech could transform democracies 10, 20, 30 years down the road. I like the idea of having a say in how my local, state and federal government is ran and the thought of blockchain tech making it easier for citizens to make more informed decisions and to have the transparency that blockchain can provide in governance to facilitate those decisions; but I can‚Äôt deny that the comments by the mayor of Miami worry me a little bit.

CryptoCurrency,Let‚Äôs Not Forget Why Satoshi Created Bitcoin. This is a Peaceful Financial Revolution.,"The most important principles that gave us cryptocurrency are Trustlessness and Decentralization.

*‚ÄúThe root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work.‚Äù*

**- Satoshi Nakamoto**

Cryptocurrency is a technological marvel and solution to one of the oldest problems that has plagued mankind- all the trust required in third parties to store your value and transact freely with one and other. Being a **trusteless and decentralized** system is fundamental to solving this. Without decentralization crypto networks lose their most important qualities of being **trustless, permissionless** and **censorship-resistant** ‚Äî that is, that anyone can use the network and anyone can build on top of them.

[According to a study of 775 fiat currencies](https://www.dinardirham.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-fiat-currencies/), there is no historical precedence for a fiat currency that has succeeded in holding its value. Every single one of them has failed. And all for a single fundamental reason: Unsound monetary policy i.e. overprinting of the fiat currency to fund deficit spending. This is mind blowing to me. 

The issuers of FIAT money always print more of it in order to try and solve other problems other than just being money. Whether it is printed for social welfare, to pay for wars to bail out banks or to manage markets, we are currently witnessing government issuers of paper money attempting to solve more of the world‚Äôs problems with printed money. This inevitably leads to its failure. It gets much more sinister though. Due to [the Cantillion Effect](https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/the-cantillon-effect-why-wall-street), that basically states whoever is closest to the money printer benefits the most from inflation, basically the elites print money and give it out to their rich friends who yield the most benefit from the freshly printed money *before* it gets devalued. Look at what‚Äôs happening in Venezuela, Argentina, Zimbabwe, Turkey and so many more places. The Fed printed 40% of all dollars in existence last year. It‚Äôs not a question or if inflation is coming, it‚Äôs when. This is why we need crypto. No one has centralised control, no one can unfairly manipulate it.

This is why Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin. And this is why he included the message \*‚ÄúChancellor on Brink of Second Bailout for Banks‚Äù.\* Cryptocurrency solves this age-old problem of allowing the common plebs like us to have a mathematically verifiable technology to preserve our wealth over time.

I know most people here are purely in for the money, and that‚Äôs completely fine but I just wanted to share a reminder of the core tenets of why we have cryptocurrency. Remember the message that Satoshi encoded in the first genesis block. All of this has a purpose, it wasn‚Äôt a get rich quick scheme, it was to give power to the people through **decentralisation**. This is truly a peaceful financial revolution based on a core principle, and we just happen to be getting fabulously wealthy along the way. And that‚Äôs great. But let‚Äôs not lose sight of what got us here and what is truly important.",cryptocurrency

I have a side business, a sole proprietorship that is on track to bring in about $80,000 by the end of the year.

We've made deduction-eligible purchases totaling around $9,000, and we've paid contractors $4,400.

Should my wife and I file jointly, or is that going to bump us into such a tax bracket that we're going to end up paying more than if we file separately?

Bitcoin,Interesting thought: Further centralization of custodial Bitcoin institutions will lead to an oligopoly and a real attack vector for the United States to actually control Bitcoin,"**Matthew Kratter** of Trader University has a really good YouTube channel and he uploads regularly.

The comparison is how gold naturally ended up in banks over time (wasn't really forced) and eventually the tentacles of the federal government took control (executive order 6102) and now we are here. There are major, gigantic companies who are holders of Bitcoin who serve in a B2B environment and also for huge whales.

I've had a lingering thought about Bitcoin's future in the back of my mind for a while now: **The only way for Bitcoin to fail is for people to not use it as it was intended** (non-custodial wallets are mandatory is the focus of this post).

personalfinance,"New grad, need advice about what I should be doing with new income","Hi guys I am a 28 year old woman who just graduated my nursing program in 2020, Originally posted this in Canadian personal finance but I think that sub is much less active than this one.

I'm not really sure what I am asking just looking for advice for my current situation, went from having no money to a non-insignificant amount over the past couple of years.

Coming out of school with no savings $30,000 in student loans and a very small income from a small business I run (1-2k per month) . I landed myself 2 COVID related jobs right off the bat (one federal and one working from home for an oil and gas company) I have been running my business for the past 8 years in addition to this, and it has been growing steadily each year and took off with the pandemic. I am bringing in about 13k/ month. I also just got married and my husband recently got a new job and he brings in another 8k. As a wedding gift his parents gave us 100k which we have not touched and they currently have it invested somewhere until we decide we would like to use it.

I have owned our home for 8 years, but rented it out for the majority of that time it cost me 400k in 2013 and we still owe 200k we only just moved in last year and began paying the mortgage ourselves.

Here is where I am struggling. Right off the bat when I saw how much I was bringing in my husband and I started making aggressive double payments on our mortgage (3,900/month) and lump sum payments(40k) each year. Last month I completely paid off my provincial student loan (17k) to avoid paying interest, but left my federal load since it will remain interest free until 2023.

Some friends i have spoken with told me this is the wrong thing to do and I should be investing my money instead. I have no idea how stocks work and my TFSA only has about 12k in it and i think i could max it out to 50 or 60k? Honestly, investments scare me, growing up my mom always had rental properties and that is something I am more comfortable with, but my husbands parents have very diverse investment portfolios and it is where his comfort lies (he does not want to float a second mortgage for a rental even though that is the direction I am leaning in the current market). Is it wrong to keep paying down our mortgage if the interest rate is only 2.49? would it be wiser to invest somewhere with a higher interest rate...also bearing in mind that my current income will not last, once the pandemic ends so will my two highest paying jobs. 

Currently I have about 60k in the bank, my husband has close to 100 plus the 100k wedding gift is still there as well. Appreciate any advice you may have to offer!

vet,Cat‚Äôs on a food boycott,"**Note** Especially if you‚Äôre not one of the vets on this site, do NOT debate with me on nutrition. I‚Äôve done my research and chosen what *I‚Äôve* decided is best for *my* cat. That‚Äôs not the question at hand.

TL;DR at the end

My boy Beast (17lbs at a healthy weight, needs a cup of food a day) has been on a boycott lately since I changed up his diet. I went from Purina One, which was more affordable, to Merrick, 3x the price but healthier (and the shelter/rescue I did my animal care internship at swore by). Before, my family always bought whatever was cheaply available at whatever store we were presently at, so I had never known him to be picky before, and this boy is a food heathen, but I still decided to do a gradual introduction to the food so that he got used to it more gently. He is particular to fish, so I made sure to get a salmon-based kibble, and this one was with grains versus grain-free (maybe it‚Äôs the grains he dislikes because most cheaper food I see on the market‚Äôs grain-free now?), since studies have shown it‚Äôs healthier and he could use the fiber. I have always fed him twice a day, a half-cup at a time. He barely ate for the first two days, even with the old food mixed in, and kept begging for food, so I crushed up some Greenies and he started eating, pushing out a lot of the Merrick and only eating the junk. Then he started eating a bit of the new food on his own, but at this point he‚Äôs still eating less than a half cup a day. Wet food is a no-go because he doesn‚Äôt eat it, but I‚Äôve been feeding him an additional nutrition supplement since then so that he‚Äôs not completely malnourished. I‚Äôve run out of the purina recently, but now he‚Äôs starting to eat more of the Merrick on his own. The amount is gradually increasing but isn‚Äôt enough yet, so I‚Äôm deciding whether to wait for his diet to increase naturally or to buy more purina and mix the whole bag in with his new stuff, hoping he‚Äôll get used to it over several weeks or even months. Which should I do?

**TL;DR:** My cat has been barely eating the new food I got him even with a gradual introduction, I just ran out of the old food and he‚Äôs at about 1/3rd of his usual intake at this point but veeery slowly increasing. Mixing with wet food is a no-go, he won‚Äôt eat it. Should I buy a new bag of the old food and mix it completely in with the new, or should I wait it out and hope he eventually gets back to normal?",cryptocurrency

14. One of Cardano‚Äôs biggest competitors is once again suffering network problems. This time it started out as just being characterized as (more) ‚Äúinstability‚Äù, then they started saying that something had caused the blockchain to ‚Äústart forking‚Äù. This followed their September 2 ‚Äúinstability‚Äù and ‚Äúperformance degradation‚Äù event. It‚Äôll be interesting to see how well their community tolerates this in the future if it‚Äôs happening with their planned slashing model in effect.

20. Now one of Cardano‚Äôs most highly visible critics is implying that the Cardano community has something in common with anti-vaxxers. Unfortunately for him, it was one of his pet blockchains that was down a few days ago while Cardano just kept healthily trucking right along.

26. After the Senate hearing on Tuesday September 14th, Gary Gensler (SEC Chairman) gave a quote to a crypto publication indicating that custodial lending and possibly even staking platforms might be considered securities. This is very relevant for Cardano since it has non-custodial staking whereas many of its competitors have the kind of custodial staking that Gensler may have been contemplating. [https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/117675/crypto-lending-staking-custody-gensler-sec](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/117675/crypto-lending-staking-custody-gensler-sec)

50. In late 2008/early 2009 it turns out Hal Finney was learning Haskell and trying to figure out how to reduce C02 emissions from a (future) widely used Bitcoin. That sounds a lot like Cardano.

52. Wow! It‚Äôs looking like Meld has landed a partnership with a mobile provider in Nigeria with nine million customers. Not many details out at this point (Sept 30).

55. The Wall Street Journal has dropped a video on stablecoins. A lot of the video surrounds the Tether dollar reserve controversy. It‚Äôs notable that Cardano‚Äôs Djed solves this.

57. Cardano users on twitter piece together that Charles was talking about visiting [u/Pezesha\_Africa](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pezesha_Africa/) (in regard to microfinance) in Kenya.

58. Crypto twitter users try to depict US Whitehouse comments out of context to fuel an economic doom narrative.

70. Representative Tom Emmer clashes with SEC Head Gensler over the direction of crypto regulation. However, it‚Äôs unclear how much Rep. Emmer‚Äôs solution (his Securities Clarity Act bill) would solve the problem given that it only relieves issuers of securities regulation burdens after they have already complied with the ‚Äúregistration or exemption‚Äù hurdle.

I haven‚Äôt counted it up, but it‚Äôs likely I encountered losses in excess of $150,000 from making mistakes that were easily avoided, rash decisions, and not giving myself enough time to test out strategies. Net net, I‚Äôm up $500,000, but I was asked to share some of what worked for me over IM quite a bit after my last post and figured I‚Äôd lay it for others who may not want to waste money learning the hard way, as I did. 

These are tactics and strategies that worked for me and my situation - someone trying to increase net worth, not increase income - and they may not be suitable for everyone.

**Understand the Trading Environment**

One mistake I made more than a few times was not understanding or paying attention to the trading environment I was in before picking out a strategy. What do I mean? I need to know where things are in the year, in relation to earnings season, and in relation to sector rotations. I need to pay attention to the macroeconomic indicators and I need to watch the VIX.

**Mind the Gap Between Earnings Seasons**. I can‚Äôt stress this enough. When earnings are strong and earnings data is coming in, investors watch those like hawks. Good earnings reports bring confidence to the market which yields a rising market. 

In between earnings seasons, there is less data from companies to review and investors pay closer attention to macroeconomic indicators like inflation, 10-year bond yields, and what the Fed is doing. This makes for a much jumpier market that‚Äôs more likely to pull back.  It‚Äôs also a time when the large asset managers rebalance their portfolios. They manage billions, so this can cause large movements to stocks and indexes as they shift to be overweight in one asset class (e.g. value stocks, energy) and underweight in other asset classes (e.g. growth stocks, technology).

I try not to get caught by these patterns. I anticipate they are coming and invest accordingly. Simply put, I buy the pullback after the rotations have occurred and before earnings seasons begin as a general rule. Of course, I don‚Äôt do this if I expect a terrible earnings season. 

**Take Advantage of Sector Rotations**

The sector rotations are pretty predictable if you track the performance of the different sectors over the year. I do this by plotting sector ETFs on a graph and noting when one begins to gain that was flat while others that were up a lot begin to flatten or pull back. Professional investors tend to sell off sectors that have been hot the last quarter or two and replace them with underperforming sectors that represent a better value or opportunity for upside. If I run the P/E ratios for the sector ETFs, I can get a quick sense of the sectors that have had a hot run up over 30 P/E vs other sectors that are more modestly valued. Just keep in mind that certain sectors, like Tech, will always be valued more richly given their growth. So looking at P/E ratios is not apples to apples - it‚Äôs just a way to note if historically that sector is at the high end of its own typical valuation range.

Last year‚Äôs worst performing sector tends to be one of the best performing sectors the following year. This is because investors prefer to buy low and sell high. I don‚Äôt bet against this trend, it‚Äôs been around longer than I have and will continue to be around long after I‚Äôm dirt. 

Last year you couldn‚Äôt give away a barrel of oil. Last week, oil reached $80 a barrel. 

One of my favorite options strategies is to buy long dated calls at the money for sector ETFs that underperformed the previous year. I buy calls with expirations in 6-9 months, knowing that I will sell at my exit point which for me is a 100% gain. Sometimes this happens 6 weeks into the year; other times it takes 9 months. So long as I don‚Äôt overpay for the options, it works. I don‚Äôt like to pay more than the average price return of the sector. For example, if the sector ETF averages a 10% annual return and the ETF price is $100, I‚Äôm not going to buy a call for more than $10. That way, if the sector only moves 5%, I can still make money provided the price increase moves quickly enough.

**Make The VIX Your Friend**

The VIX is an easy way to gauge fear in the marketplace and is a hedge used widely against market pullbacks. If the VIX goes up, the market is worried. If it goes down, the market is getting bullish. If it stays up, everyone is on edge. It‚Äôs hard to make good trades in an environment where everyone is on edge and ready to hit the sell button. So be careful buying during times when the VIX is high. On the flip side, if the market has pulled back and the VIX starts to retreat away from its highs, that makes for a good entry point. 

Another interesting phenomenon is when the VIX is higher than normal, there tends to be a selloff the Friday before a long weekend. This happens because investors don‚Äôt want to sit through a long weekend that might hold worse news out of fear they will start their Tuesday with losses piling up. I‚Äôve found this is a nice time to get some discounts at the end of the day Friday, or to run some weekly puts on Thursday afternoon before the dips. 

**Selecting Trades &amp; Investments**

**Have an Allocation Plan**

The first thing I recommend is determining, in advance, the amount of money you want to invest longer term vs the amount you want to invest short term vs the amount of money you might actually need to have available for life emergencies. Anything shorter term is higher risk, higher reward. I break my portfolio in the following buckets:

* 25% long-term market investment using equity ETFs that largely track the SPX or do a breakdown between bonds and the market. I use Vanguard funds and a small cap value fund called CALF. I will not touch this money for 15+ years.
* 25% cash. I like to be ready to buy the dips and have enough to spare. This way if a black swan event happens, I not only have money to invest, I have money to live on should things go bad for a while. This philosophy enabled me to buy options when COVID hit in 2020 without worrying if I could continue paying a mortgage for a year without a job. It‚Äôs also very useful if I have to roll covered calls to offset taxes and buy back expensive positions. I took this from Buffet FWIW.
* 30% options, mostly in tax advantaged accounts (IRAs). I aim for a 50% annual return overall with this portfolio, though it fluctuates a lot year to year.
* 10% long term blue chips stocks like Visa, Apple, MSFT, etc. I defend these positions when the stocks get overheated by selling calls on them and/or buying puts out of the money that expire after a typical sector rotation would occur. That can generate some additional income or help lessen the sting if the stock falls. 
* 6% long-term bets in a Roth IRA. These are equities I think all have a chance at a 10X return but that will take 5-10 years. It‚Äôs a lot of IPOs, small tech companies, and biotechs. I have to stomach pullbacks in this portfolio of 40-50% on the belief that a few of the 30 in here will more than compensate for it. This is a new strategy for me so I‚Äôll let you know in 10 years if it works.
* 3% leveraged hedges.These are puts on my own positions, stocks, or the market at large. Generally I use VIX calls, buy puts, occasionally buy calls on the SPXS, and run strangles on investments (betting both up and down on the same stock using calls and puts).  
* 1% in other things I can‚Äôt mention due to the bots in here but they rhyme with tiptoe.

**Use Technologies to Find Ideas**

Unless you want to spend 8 hours a day reading news or are OK getting all your ideas from meme stocks and friends, you need to use tools to help you locate investment/trade ideas and be willing to pay for them. I value my time and am willing to pay .5% of my portfolio a year if it saves me time, and more if it generates higher returns. 

I‚Äôve tried about a dozen or so services, including stock picking services like Fool and Investorsplace. Ultimately I decided the stock picking sites were not working for me because I did not want to wait 5 years to find out if they were the right recommendations and lost a lot of money learning that lesson on their pump and dumps. So I switched to analytics tools and my Fidelity platform. 

My favorite tools to use are Zack‚Äôs VGM score, Levelfields, and Fidelity. The Zack‚Äôs VGM measures a stock‚Äôs value, growth rate, and momentum. It‚Äôs an easy screen I can run off the basic level subscription to get a list of companies to look at. The caveat is that you need to run this screen often because sometimes the companies on the list get stale and have already moved 99% of the way they are going to move. So you need to keep an eye on what‚Äôs new to the list to avoid losing money. That part is crucial. 

The list usually represents companies that are well valued and poised to move up over the next 6-9 months. Warning: they can move very slowly so be patient and set your target exit to automatically exit. I use Fidelity to do my own due diligence on the stocks from there, examining their actual growth and earnings rates and ensuring there is no negative news against them which could drive down the price.

A friend recently turned me on to an AI tool called Levelfields. They have a lot of news alerts but only for the types of events that matter and are organized thematically. It helps me find trades on news events with high returns or get in early on the small to mid-cap companies you don‚Äôt usually hear about which fall between the cracks in the penny stock discussions and cnbc favorites. They often send alerts on company events before there‚Äôs any news out, which is really helpful. The interface shows you how stocks perform when these events happen, so it‚Äôs easy to figure out my entry and exit points and statistical likelihood of success.   
I use it a lot for pinpointing entry/exit points from options trades and have bought stock in a few companies I hadn‚Äôt ever heard of before that were absolutely crushing it on revenue and earnings. Not sure why, but they never came up in any of my Fidelity stock screens. I suspect it‚Äôs because there‚Äôs a lag in the data Fidelity is getting from S&amp;P but haven‚Äôt confirmed this. They send a lot of high quality alerts and my only wish is that they‚Äôd have a better way to rank the stocks in the alerts so I didn‚Äôt have to look up the stocks on Fidelity.

I use Fidelity for basic news reading, running stock screens for high growth stocks at decent valuations, looking deeply at the history of earnings results, actually trading options, and for their options scanner which tracks abnormal option activity.  I sell puts when I see abnormal call volume and run strangles if the stock is at a mid-point in its 52-week price range in case it shoots up and then down. I always set an automated exit.

Fidelity also has a cool probability calculator for options I use when selling puts. It tells you the probability of a stock falling below a certain range. I use that number to determine where to sell puts without a lot of risk. I do two standard deviations out and still buy a put with a lower strike price as insurance and sell weekly puts on high vol companies like GME and TSLA. My typical goal is to make 800 a week from these plays which I use to fund new call positions.

**Be Wary of Analyst Opinions**

If you‚Äôve invested actively for a while, you‚Äôve likely noticed a peculiar trend: as a stock is cratering, analysts are increasing their target purchase price on it. This is not for your benefit. Brokerages often make investment recommendations based on the research provided by their analysts, so there is inherent bias in the system. 

I‚Äôve also found that few analysts recommend sell ratings. They are much more likely to issue calls to buy stocks. One study found less than 1% issued sell recommendations. What‚Äôs more, the track records of these analysts are usually about the same as coin flipping. CNBC has gotten very into pushing analyst views from big name firms (e.g. ‚ÄúGoldman Sachs says these 3 stocks are ready to explode‚Äù), but if you look at the actual analyst behind the headline, they are often inexperienced or wrong more than right. 

I am embarrassed to say I lost a lot of money listening to analyst opinions and believing their price targets were rooted in reality. It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in the excitement of an upgrade and if 4 analysts are all touting the stock at the same time it can create a bit of a ponzi effect, which is tradable. But it boils down to needing to do your own research.

**Good Things Come in Pairs**

Just about every stock has a peer or competitor. Most have several. I stopped trying to pick the winner and now place bets on multiple leaders. I‚Äôve owned Visa and Mastercard. I own OLO and TOST. I have a handful of, um, herbal medicine providers. I like ETSY and AMZN. If you bet on a small group of competitors, it‚Äôs likely one will pull ahead and your odds of success will increase substantially. 

Similarly, it enables you to monitor the news of competitors which many investors use as a proxy. What do I mean? If Mastercard reports low cross border transactions, it‚Äôs highly probable Visa will be experiencing the same thing. So you can use the information from Mastercard to alter your position on Visa.

**Exercise Financial Discipline**

Even when I‚Äôve been successful picking investments, I‚Äôve run into problems with how to handle my successes. We‚Äôve all experienced the thrill of being up huge and wondering how much higher it will go. That‚Äôs usually the moment I‚Äôve learned I should be taking some gains. A few rules I try hard to follow but still screw up:

1. Take Profits Often.   
When an option or stock hits 100% return, I look to take some profit. It may not seem possible if you only bought 1 call, but it is. Just roll the call to a higher strike price and ensure the credit to your account equals your original investment plus substantial return. You can let the new call ride in case the stock gets going up. This ensures you cannot lose money. My rationale here is simple: at a 100% gain, I now have more to lose than I have to gain. You will be surprised how much this adds up when you trade often and how often you can be up 150% then down to -50% on the same positions, which makes me want to break things.  
If you find yourself up huge on an equity investment, switch to options. I did this for my BABA position and it saved me. When it hit 300, I was up 200%. I sold all the stock and bought options for the same number of shares. I had about 60K in stock and switched to something like 6K in options. When BABA crashed down to 150 I really didn‚Äôt care much. I was only down 4.5K instead of 30K. I had my profit of 40K locked in, so being down 4.5K was no big deal.  

2. Fail Fast.   
If the option price sinks to -50% in value, it‚Äôs likely time to call it quits unless you have a solid reason not to (praying is not a strategy). The other half of the value left can easily be eaten up by the time decay in the value of the option as I wait for the turnaround and it gets closer to the expiration date. If there‚Äôs negative news driving this, I‚Äôm out. I want to fail quickly. That allows me time to take the remaining 50% and generate gains with it on a better investment. I think this is the hardest rule for me to stick to as I tend to be an optimist.  

3. Profit Both Ways.   
If a stock I hold hits an all-time high in price or valuation, I look for a way to profit from the downside by selling covered calls or buying cheap puts. This enables you to stash some cash while riding the volatility wave. I hold Visa and when it hit 235 headed into earnings, I sold 3 calls and bought 10 puts. This offset a paper loss for me of \~20K yesterday alone by 7.5K in gains, which I secured as real profits. Assuming Visa will recover, that 7K adds 9% to this year‚Äôs returns for Visa.  

4. Be Patient but Not Greedy.   
I have learned the hard way from selling positions days before they pop that it can take a while before the market catches on to my investment idea, especially if using good tools. Asset managers, wealth managers, and passive investors are usually looking for new investments every 3 months, not daily, so stocks can stay stuck in a channel for some time before the world catches on to its awesomeness. Example, I held Upstart from April to August this year and sold it because it was running flat. A couple weeks later the stock tripled. FML were the only words I could think of at the time. The second thought I had was that I should‚Äôve bought just one call option to replace the stock I sold.  
On the flip side, once a stock does move a lot higher, don‚Äôt be greedy. What goes up fast can come down just as fast. I feel a lot worse watching a stock/option go up 200% then come down all the way or more than I do exiting with a 100% gain watching the stock go up more. Don‚Äôt chase the perfect trade. It‚Äôs a white whale. Just make money.  

5. Everyone Has a Plan Until You Get Punched in the Mouth.   
This is as true in boxing (thanks Mike) as it is investing. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs essential to have a plan A and a plan B should plan A not work out as you thought. Waiting through it can work, but it isn‚Äôt a very effective strategy for navigating a changing environment.   
So if my thesis is that the stock will do well with rising COVID rates and COVID rates stop rising, I try to have plan B ready. I keep a lot of notes. I track every trade. I review what went wrong with trades quarterly. I learn. I avoid the pity party as much as possible and drink vodka for the rest. I try not to fall in love with any stock. And I know that even if I lose 100K, there‚Äôs more money to be made in the coming years and decades if I stick it out.",finance

**The Day Ahead**

* Asian equity markets are mixed this morning as market moods continue to fluctuate. Yesterday saw equities rise on Wall Street and in some European markets but futures prices point to falls today. Australian retail sales rose by a faster than expected 1.3% in September. In France, Q3 GDP rose by 3.0% up from a 1.3% gain in Q2. That is the first of several Eurozone GDP reports this morning.
* Eurozone inflation is forecast to have continued to accelerate in October. Already released data for some of the largest countries in the region point to a rise and we look for annual headline inflation to print 3.6% (from 3.4% in September), while the consensus expectation is for an even bigger rise. That is well above the European Central Bank‚Äôs 2.0% target. At yesterday‚Äôs ECB policy update President Lagarde, while admitting that the rise inflation was greater than expected, still asserted it was likely to be temporary. We do expect ‚Äòcore‚Äô inflation to be unchanged at 1.9%, which might provide some solace to the ECB. Nevertheless, with inflation possibly set to rise further before its next policy meeting in mid-December the Governing Council‚Äôs unity in maintaining a ‚Äòdovish‚Äô policy stance seems set to be tested. The first estimate for Q3 GDP growth in the Eurozone is expected to show quarterly growth of 2.0%, which would be little different to the rate seen in Q2. That would mean that the Eurozone grew more quickly than the US last quarter. Nevertheless, recent reports suggest that supply issues are also constraining output in the Eurozone, so the outlook for growth is uncertain.
* In the UK, Bank of England money supply and credit data for September may provide some insight into recent spending trends. Mortgage approvals and lending data may show whether housing market activity has slowed as the temporary cut in stamp duty has been removed.
* The September US consumer spending numbers that will be released today were included in yesterday‚Äôs GDP report. Expenditure clearly slowed in Q3 compared to the first half of the year but there seem to be some tentative signs that it was picking up again to the end of the quarter. The report will also contain the consumer expenditure deflator, which is the Federal Reserve‚Äôs preferred inflation measure. It is likely to show a further rise in inflation in September.
* Government bond markets remain volatile. Shorter-dated yields in many markets continue to firm as markets price in the possibility of tighter monetary policy. Longer-dated yields have retraced some of the falls seen earlier in the week but are generally still below their levels of last Friday. In currency markets both the euro and sterling rose against the US dollar yesterday. The euro moved up in afternoon trading despite comments from ECB President Lagarde that seemed intended to reassure that Eurozone monetary policy would remain very stimulative.",finance

personalfinance,Sanity check on credit card balance/money transfer to pay off car loan (interest difference),"Hey PF, 

I have a car loan that has around 13K outstanding on a \~3% interest rate, due to be paid off in 3.5 years.

I have an option to put around \~9K of that on a balance transfer card at 0% with a 1.2% fee.

This is at a cost of 108.

Additionally, I also have access to a money/balance transfer at 3% fee which = 90 on the remaining 3K.

The total interest I'd pay simply paying off the loan is about 700 so in my mind, I'd save about 500 by doing this over a few years which isn't bad.

That's a sane move right?

This would reduce the time I can pay it off, but I have enough room in the budget to accommodate for the extra payments.

Can anyone think of a reason I WOULDN'T want to do this?

Clean history, recent osteoarthritis,

Houston, TX.

I've taken my old boy, Blu, to two different vets now for a diagnosis on what is wrong. He is normally very energetic, he has issues getting up due to his osteoarthritis but generally is a runner, a jumper, and super vocal. 5 days ago I noticed he wasn't following me around the house, monitored him and realized he hadn't eaten. I give him pain meds thinking it was a flare up and fed him in bed which he happily ate. 

Next morning I realize he felt slightly hot, only urinated but no defacation, eyes red. Took him to his regular vet, Blu shows no signs of pain, ate just fine, drank just fine, all tests normal, they give me anti-inflammatory meds and told to monitor. 

Next day still nothing, take him to a different vet- tenderness in the abdomen, xray performed and looks like intestines are somewhat swollen, nothing in the colon. Given lactulose, anti nausea meds, high fiber food, and told to bring back in the AM. 
Next morning he starts trying to defecate but is unsuccessful, take him back to vet, second xrays show nothing in the system, nothing in the colon, no obstructions. Still constipated, less appetite (might be cause of the lactulose taste) but is more responsive. Eyes normal, starting to walk around a bit more once up. 

I massage his belly to help him poop and I feel a lump in his side. Xrays again dont show anything, given more lactulose and some powder for food.

CryptoCurrency,I am back! My blockchain games experience after 5 months. How much can you earn?,"It's been a long time since I wrote a post here but I am BACK! There is a ton of information and experience to share so I am coming back with a few posts in mind coming soon. I have a bit more than 5 months of experience in blockchain gaming and I think it will be really useful for you if you want to get on it. During those 5 months, I managed to go from $0 (ok maybe I put in like $20-30 from surveys at some point but still not much) and build my way up to more than $25k (Not including assets with really volatile value or ones that have no certain price yet because there is still no marketplace to sell them on)

I know many of you don‚Äôt like long posts so I will break it down into sections so you don‚Äôt have to read it all.

# What I have accomplished so far (apart from money):

I managed to introduce a lot of people to blockchain gaming and most of them are already earning a steady income from some games. I did spend a ton of time answering DMs and trying to be as useful as I can (will do the same again so feel free to DM me for more advice or info) and this made me a lot of connections and friends. The blockchain is a mess, so you need friends because you can‚Äôt keep track of everything. They can inform you about projects they have researched and think are worth it you can help each other so try to do that. Join discord servers, telegrams (But not scam ones!), etc. with such communities and you will be able to find games early which is one of the most important things.

# Earnings:

Enough with the blabbering, I think most of you are here for the bread so let‚Äôs get on it.

If it will be easier for you I have monthly breakdowns posted and the prices vary a lot from now because of games crashing or reaching new highs (of course it‚Äôs normal in crypto)

**Axie Infinity ($$$):** Invested a total of $510 and got my ROI back in less than a month. I was earning $100 a day at its peak and managed to sell a ton of their coin (SLP) at a high price for some ETH. Recently they introduced a bunch of new updates because the price of SLP crashed and now I earn only $12 a day myself and a few more times that from scholars which is still decent. My total income there is approximately $4000+ and am holding assets worth $3000+ (Yeah it was a great earner so really looking forward to new updates)

**Splinterlands ($)**: One of my proudest decisions still is investing that $10 earned from a free game (CryptoRoyale) to start Splinterlands. At first, I was earning just a few cents a day but once people saw potential in it the game became one of the top earners in the space. With $1,000+ earned from battles, $2,700 in cards value and daily airdrops and staking of SPS token which is $2,500, I have $6,200 earned in Splinterlands. I also am earning passively from another bot account (yes it is allowed for now), staking and daily airdrop based on assets value.

**Plants vs Undead ($)**: Well this one is a bit different. I did earn a lot there but I don‚Äôt think it is worth investing in it now. The devs made some mistakes leading to the coin dropping by 97% and losing their big investors. The game was so profitable for a couple of months that I made $1,600 in total for 2 months with a $50 investment. Still earns me about $3 a day almost passively but it‚Äôs not what it was. Hopefully, they can revive it with Farm 3.0 and the new PVP mode. But invest at your own risk here!

**CryptoRoyale (FREE)**: Well this project proves that diamond hands always payout. I held their token for a lot of time because I was getting APY and it went from earning less than 10 cents a day to owning a total of $520 now with $0 investment. You earn a bit less ROY rn from games but still a pretty fun game worth checking out.

**BombCrypto ($$)**: Similar to Plants vs Undead it had a massive earning opportunity at first. I made $1100 in 4 days with a $55 investment but‚Ä¶. they stopped the withdraw function so no one was able to sell for weeks. When they finally opened it the $1100 were worth just $350 but still sold them and now I am earning almost passively $7 a day. It‚Äôs an idle game as of now but they will have PVE and PVP soon.

# Which games to start now

You are probably wondering if it is worth joining blockchain games now or it is too late? Well, I can guarantee you that it is even too early. First of all, most of the games are not polished, rushed for release because the competition is weak and they are full of bugs. From the ones released as of now, I can say that it is only worth joining Splinterlands and Axie Infinity. The rest most probably won‚Äôt survive when we get THE games. Now is the absolute perfect time because the most promising games are soon to be released and trust me being early can be extremely profitable. Here are some examples of promising upcoming games

**Thetan Arena (FREE)**: We are starting off with one that is playable now as a beta and will be released in less than a month. I am not going to be talking in detail about it but it is a mobile 4v4 game with great graphics and an experienced team. You can play and earn for free or buy premium heroes which can earn you more daily. I have a ton of their coin bought at $2 and it is almost $10 now (started at $0.06 on ICO)

**Guild of Guardians ($$$)**: One of the most promising games you need to keep an eye on. The team is extremely serious about their game and there is huge demand of their assets. It will be heavily guild revolved so expect to play with your friends a lot. They are releasing their coin soon so it is a great time to read more about it.

**Illuvium (FREE)**: Definitely the best-looking game I have seen in a while (I wish I could add pictures). It is guaranteed to be a massive hit because the team has worked on numerous AAA games. Their coin is pretty buffed as of now almost reaching the $1000 mark per coin. Just have a look!

**Defina ($$$)**: Anime game in which you can earn. What do you need more? Its graphics are insanely well-drawn, its website and dev team are amazing and it attracted the attention of Binance. It is releasing really soon so keep an eye on it and join their discord for quizzes, NFT drops and other prizes which might be valuable in a couple of months.

**Ember Sword (FREE)**: In this game, you will be on par while playing for free with the whales. They are strongly against pay to win so the NFTs will be mostly cosmetics. You will be earning their token too and the gameplay looks really dynamic.

**League of Ancients (FREE)**: 5v5 Moba, League of legends style, massive potential. That‚Äôs all you need. The dev team presented themselves in a video and look serious about their project. You can earn with their new system as of now so get some LOA tokens before their ICO at $0.05 and when they get to $10+ you will have enough to invest wherever you want.

**Star Atlas ($)**: Last but not least. The most realistic-looking one and the most thrilling trailer of them all. I am putting it as last because it is set to release at the end of 2022. Just watch their trailer and go get a ship for $20 before their price jumps like crazy üòä

I wish I could include describe the projects in more detail and add some tips on how I find those projects and many more and how I distinguish the long-term investment ones, the short pump and dump schemes and the not worth at all but the post is getting too long. Expect it soon tho. If you have questions or need more info about some of the projects ask away. For the ones that got till the end, I might drop some gifts! 

Happy earning!",cryptocurrency

stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, Oct 29, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, October 29, 2021**

The remarkable rally in equities continued, with stocks jumping despite two of the largest companies, Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN), posting disappointing earnings results in an otherwise solid earnings season. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) both closed the week at record closing levels.

Coming into Q3 earnings season, market participants were worried the persistent supply-chain disruptions and labor market imbalances would hamper corporate profits, so it is very encouraging to see companies holding up better than expected. Recent economic data has also contributed to the bounce in equities.

After suffering its first -5% dip in September, the SPY has come back with a vengeance, advancing more than 7% from the October 4 bottom. In this same time period, the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped a staggering 10% and the Dow Jones (DIA) gained 5%. Not to toot my own horn too much, but I publicly remained bullish during September volatility and consistently encouraged dip-buying via this recap. Happy to say the strategy, as it has all year, worked great and personally resulted in my most profitable month all year. Hope some of y'all took advantage. Never try to fight market trends, much easier to ride them until you can‚Äôt anymore. As I have said for like six months at this point, I think the trend will change once the Fed begins discussing interest rate hikes. When that happens, I‚Äôll reassess my position. Until then I see any and all dips as buying opportunities.

Amazon (AMZN) shares dropped after the e-commerce juggernaut missed third-quarter expectations and forecasted a jump in expenses in the fourth quarter due to supply chain disruptions and rising costs for labor, materials and freight. These factors are expected to generate ""several billion dollars of additional costs"" to Amazon in the current quarter, the company said in its earnings statement. Here are the numbers:

* **Earnings:** $6.12 vs $8.92 per share expected
* **Revenue:** $110.81 billion vs $111.6 billion expected
* Q4 Guidance: Amazon forecast sales between $130 billion and $140 billion
* **Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Prime Subs:** $55.9 billion
* **Net product sales:** $54.9 billion

Apple (AAPL) also disappointed Wall Street in its fiscal first-quarter results, with key iPhone sales missing expectations, with the launch of the iPhone 13 hampered by the global shortage in semiconductors that forced Apple to massively cut down on production, new rules that allow third-party payment systems in the App store, and supply chain issues, which Tim Cook says cost the company more than $6 billion. Key Apple suppliers like Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Qualcomm (QCOM) fell on the miss. Here are the numbers:

* **EPS:** $1.24 vs. $1.24 estimated
* **Revenue:** $83.36 billion  vs. $84.85 billion estimated, up 29% year-over-year
* **iPhone revenue:** $38.87 billion vs. $41.51 billion estimated, up 47% year-over-year
* **Services revenue:** $18.28 billion vs. $17.64 billion estimated, up 25.6% year-over-year
* **Other Products revenue:** $8.79 billion vs. $9.33 billion estimated, up 11.5% year-over-year
* **Mac revenue:** $9.18 billion vs. $9.23 billion estimated, up 1.6% year-over-year
* **iPad revenue:** $8.25 billion vs. $7.23 billion estimated, up 21.4% year-over-year

Earlier in the week, a report showed US GDP decelerated to expand at the slowest rate in over one year for the July through September quarter, with the Delta variant and supply-side constraints capping economic activity. GDP rose at a 2.0% annualized rate, missing estimates for the 2.6% pace consensus economists anticipated. However, despite this report and other recent tepid economic data, market participants have remained remarkably resilient and kept buying up any dips.

**Highlights**

* Facebook (FB) announced it will be rebranding under new name ‚ÄúMeta‚Äù and the ticker will change to MVRS starting December 1. This is to reflect the company‚Äôs emphasis into investing in the metaverse, a 3D shared virtual space accessible via VR.
* Following the post-earning surge, Microsoft (MSFT) unseated Apple (AAPL) as the world‚Äôs most valuable company by market cap.
* Tesla (TSLA) shares continued their monster run, closing above $1100 for a new all-time high. Congrats bulls, we getting paid!
* Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) disclosed plans to expand drilling in the top US shale basin in West Texas after posting biggest quarterly profits in years amid elevated energy prices.
* Squid Game Director Hwang Dong-hyuk confirmed there will be a season 2 but said he is ‚Äúnot a priority‚Äù right now. Netflix (NFLX) stock was up 2.5% today to reach a new ATH. After lagging other tech companies in the last year or so, Netflix stocks has been on absolute fire following the release of Squid Game, the most popular show ever on the platform. It is reported Netflix made roughly $900 million\* from the show.
* Shares of Starbucks (SBUX) plummeted 6% after reporting earnings miss amid slowing sales in China.
* The European Commission opened a full-scale investigation into NVIDIA (NVDA) plpanned $54 billion bid for semiconductor designer ARM. Very basically, the problem is that tons of companies, including Apple‚Äôs new M1 chip are designed using ARM architecture, other chip companies are worried that NVDA‚Äôs takeover could damage competition. In response NVDA has insisted it would maintain ARM as a ‚Äútech neutral‚Äù supplier.

CryptoCurrency,Help with staking 15K USDC,"Looking to stake 15k into USDC. I want to compound the interest I get off of it. What would be the best method for this?

I was thinking of taking the amount, dividing into 13 week deposits of 3 month terms each week until done. Is this the way? Is there a better way? Any tips would be very helpful, thank you :)

I saw a post on here a week ago or so about this but I can‚Äôt find it anymore. Is there a better way? Currently using crypto.com. Currently at 12% for 3 month stakes.

If not USDC, what other coins have you staked and why?

I see some DeFi wallets offering extremely high interest rates, but they change too often. Anyone have better luck with that?",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,I financed a car with the rate of 24% APR almost 2 years ago and now i am having trouble.,"I financed a car, Honda Accord 2015 by February 2019 with 24% interest. The value of the car was like $15.000 at the time. For 6 years, $500 a month, i will ended up paying $36.000. It was horrible deal. I know. But i was so desperate because i was paying around $40-50 daily to Uber 5-6 times a week. That was a like $1000 a month. I thought instead of paying that. I would just pay $500 a month.

The reason my interest rate was so high was because of my credit history and income proof. At the time i just started to work and i was getting paid with cash. They started to pay me check after for a while. So there was not enough proof to show them that i would pay besides my bank statements. My credit score was around 700 but i had only 2 credit cards with the limit of $500 each.

So they told me i can get a car loan but the interest would be so high. So i accepted it. I was ok because i was able to pay. I did pay for almost 2 years. Until september. I missed 2 payments. I recieved a letter from them if i don't make a payment after last week of October, they will repossess my car. I called them and made some payment arrangements. So right now, i am trying to catch up my payments again and most likely i will be ok.

But i am so disappointed that i have such a bad deal and i will end up paying $36.000 for a car that it will be less than $10.000 at the time it will be paid off.

I don't think i can refinance with any bank because i already missed 2 payments. My credit score is 570 and it is going down every month because i already have few credit cards with full balance. I pay them minimum but still. I can't pay them off now.

I don't know what to do. Is there anything i could do about this?

Thanks in advance.",finance
personalfinance,"If mortgage rates now(ish) are the lowest they will probably every be, will this crimp future Cash Out Refis?","Given how low interest rates have been, it seems unlikely that rates would be equal or lower, say 2 years from now.

So will this mean people are probably NOT going to be doing Cash Out Refi's in a couple of years, because the rates in the future are going to be higher?  So will people not be taping into home equity in the future?

Say rates go up just .5% in 2 years.  Is that going to be considered ""still cheap"" and maybe is OK then to cash out refi?",finance

Bitcoin,Today it is my task to present to you a bird's eye view of The Saylor Series,"This is all in Michael Saylor's own words from the full transcripts (bottom):
 
 ‚ÄúIt all started for us with channeling energy‚Ä¶releasing a latent energy in matter‚Äîwe‚Äôre converting matter into energy.‚Äù

‚ÄúTechnologies that are dominating today, they‚Äôre dominating because they‚Äôre able to deliver force faster, harder, stronger, smarter...if it‚Äôs got the characteristic that it can be made harder, smarter, stronger, faster, there‚Äôs something compelling about it!""

""The Roman Empire is a great model for the way that human beings interact with technology and the way that they interact with a competitive world and become both antifragile and get harder, smarter, faster, and stronger!""

""The Roman way: there‚Äôs a certain submission to nature and the organism is greater than any one individual and any one family. It‚Äôs continually refreshing itself. We have to have a constant flow of new talent, new leadership.""

""It‚Äôs not that the Romans invented everything, it‚Äôs just that the Romans stole every good idea from every civilization from the Greeks, from the Carthaginians, from the whatever that they crushed.""

""The basic credo of the engineer is: I look at nature and I look at the circumstances that I‚Äôm surrounded by and I use my intellect and every material and technique at hand in order to construct a better world for everyone and everything that I love.""

""The Romans were healthy as long as they kept tension and dynamism and this incredible competition in their ecosystem, and when they lost it, they lost their edge.""

""Everywhere on Earth where you see a big city, it was the center of an empire. Everywhere where you see a city that‚Äôs fallen upon hard times, that‚Äôs been destroyed‚Äîits empire lapsed. [It once had economic density but then lost economic density].""

""Where there‚Äôs an explosion of innovation and an explosion of vitality, somebody tapped into 1,000x more energy or figured out how to deliver the energy.""

""Everyone that‚Äôs succeeded [in the history of technology]‚Äîevery empire, individual, company‚Äîthey all found a way to be harder, smarter, faster, stronger.""

""Humans triumph throughout history by channeling energy. Since 1mm years ago to today‚Äîit‚Äôs really the story of intelligent people looking around for Where is the energy coming from? How do I channel it in a network in order to achieve something harder, smarter, faster, stronger?""

""I want to replace 'monetary network' with energy network, because monetary energy is energy! What is money? Money is the highest form of energy that human beings can channel.""

""Humans prosper by channeling energy. [#Bitcoin is about to be] the most efficient energy network in the history of the world. Because the challenge of humanity is: how do I store energy and transmit energy across time and space and domain?""

""I think the success of #Bitcoin and the network power ultimately is a function of the adoption, the utility, the productivity, and the inflation...If there‚Äôs a lesson of history, the lesson of history is: the most organized team always wins.""

""Everybody that‚Äôs marketing #Bitcoin, everyone working on Bitcoin technology, everyone simply HODLing Bitcoin, everybody that hates it, everybody attacking every other asset, every time another asset fails or another currency weakens it, [the passage of time]‚Äîcontributes to it.""

""#Bitcoin is the best system in the history of the world for controlling, storing, and channeling energy, and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs destined to be successful.""

""[On #Bitcoin as a swarm of cyber hornets]: When something is a decentralized, organic creature that is rapidly evolving and adapting, it becomes excessively antifragile because every time you kill an element of it, the elements you don‚Äôt kill get that much stronger.""

""Ultimately, the strength of #Bitcoin comes from the fact that an individual can self-custody...in any of 200 different regulatory jurisdictions, find a jurisdiction where they will have the strongest money where they can generate the most yield and...move to that jurisdiction.""

""#Bitcoin's strength comes from the fact that it‚Äôs being developed‚Äîit‚Äôs not constrained by the lowest common denominator (the weak parts of the herd get culled out, they‚Äôre being deprived of their capital), it‚Äôs strengthened by the highest common denominator.""

""#Bitcoin is an antifragile but scalable platform serving as a store of value. The best possible circumstance would be if the entire world plunged into a war where value was dissipating in every currency everywhere at a rapid rate. And I think it describes what we have today.""

""Insanely great technology is when it does a thing without you doing a thing. And so if I told you: Take all your money, put it into #Bitcoin, and then you‚Äôll be rich and happy and prosperous for all of eternity without doing a single transaction‚ÄîI just need it to always work.""

""If I can channel my energy and put it into a network and that network can be used to fund and power an endowment that will [project my values], then that #Bitcoin network...is going to be my mechanism for achieving all of my hopes and aspirations from now to eternity.""

""#Bitcoin is the universal language of economic truth. I think it will evolve as a unit of monetary energy. The right way to think of it is as just a standard unit of economic energy or monetary energy. An immutable, self-sovereign unit of economic energy.""

""I‚Äôm probably not going to sacrifice my life for the 13th iteration on smart contracts. On the other hand, if you tell me that we‚Äôre about to suck all of the economic energy out of the civilization and plunge ourselves into the Dark Ages‚Äîthat‚Äôs worth fighting for.""

""I‚Äôve never seen an economist say, Why don‚Äôt we actually define the things that a working 22-year old is going to want to buy by the time they‚Äôre 32? And here‚Äôs one thing: early retirement! I want to buy early retirement by the time I‚Äôm 32. How do I do that?""

""The pernicious mistake everybody makes is: they don‚Äôt really think about the energy density and information density of their products, services, and assets. They‚Äôre not applying conservation of energy.""

""When you‚Äôre young, you overestimate the value of functionality and acquisition, you underestimate how expensive it‚Äôs going to be to maintain things, and then you really underestimate this last issue: can you enjoy it?""

""The great challenge is this paradox of the engineer versus the zookeeper: we see nature, we want to engineer a better world for ourselves, and it can be done. But we can also reach too far and try too hard and try to make water flow uphill and try to make time flow backwards.""

""Satoshi engineered money. Whereas every government has created money.""

""The greater the sharing, the greater the economy. The more immutable, the higher integrity. The higher the efficiency of the economy, the more [mathematically] correct. The more effective the economy‚Äîthe faster the network updates‚Äîthe faster the economy.""

""Gold fails [as money] primarily because there‚Äôs no good application protocol. It‚Äôs not conservative, it‚Äôs too difficult, too slow, too dangerous.""

Previously Covered but still interesting:

1. Messari has updated its ‚ÄúInitial Token Distribution‚Äù chart to include a previously missing project and Cardano is still among the very best in the Gen 3 space in terms of broad public coin ownership.

5. A Weiss Crypto analyst calls the smart contract launch an alleged event and also doesn‚Äôt realize we already have NFTS. The Cardano community was quick to correct the analyst. Weiss was then also quick to apologize.

8. One of Cardano‚Äôs biggest competitors is once again suffering network problems. This time it started out as just being characterized as (more) ‚Äúinstability‚Äù, then they started saying that something had caused the blockchain to ‚Äústart forking‚Äù. This followed their September 2 ‚Äúinstability‚Äù and ‚Äúperformance degradation‚Äù event. It‚Äôll be interesting to see how well their community tolerates this in the future if it‚Äôs happening with their planned slashing model in effect.

14. Now one of Cardano‚Äôs most highly visible critics is implying that the Cardano community has something in common with anti-vaxxers. Unfortunately for him, it was one of his pet blockchains that was down a few days ago while Cardano just kept healthily trucking right along.

20. After the Senate hearing on Tuesday September 14th, Gary Gensler (SEC Chairman) gave a quote to a crypto publication indicating that custodial lending and possibly even staking platforms might be considered securities. This is very relevant for Cardano since it has non-custodial staking whereas many of its competitors have the kind of custodial staking that Gensler may have been contemplating.

30. The Hoskinson Center for Formal Mathematics has been established at Carnegie Mellon.

44. In late 2008/early 2009 it turns out Hal Finney was learning Haskell and trying to figure out how to reduce C02 emissions from a (future) widely used Bitcoin. That sounds a lot like Cardano.

49. The Wall Street Journal has dropped a video on stablecoins. A lot of the video surrounds the Tether dollar reserve controversy. It‚Äôs notable that Cardano‚Äôs Djed solves this.

51. Cardano users on twitter piece together that Charles was talking about visiting [u/Pezesha\_Africa](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pezesha_Africa/) (in regard to microfinance) in Kenya. This is big because Pezesha operates in countries with a combined population of over $300MM.

52. Crypto twitter users try to depict US Whitehouse comments out of context to fuel an economic doom narrative. However, if you listen to the whole press briefing, you will understand that these comments were based on a ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù scenario involving the US debt ceiling somehow not being raised.

56. Brazil is looking to follow the El Salvador example and accept crypto as legal tender with a new bill to be voted within days.

64. Representative Tom Emmer clashes with SEC Head Gensler over the direction of crypto regulation. However, it‚Äôs unclear how much Rep. Emmer‚Äôs solution (his Securities Clarity Act bill) would solve the problem given that it only relieves issuers of securities regulation burdens after they have already complied with the ‚Äúregistration or exemption‚Äù hurdle.

76. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce (cryptomom) gave a polite but scathing speech at the Texas Blockchain Summit where she laid bare all the problems with the SEC‚Äôs current approach to crypto. After her recent opinion piece and this speech, it‚Äôs fair to say that she and SEC Chairman Gensler are in open war over crypto. How this gets resolved will determine the regulatory landscape for Cardano and all of crypto going forward. Sadly, Gensler is in charge and not vice versa.

83. We got a nice Triple H update from Harrison/Hemsley/Hammond joined by Jan M√ºller in the October mid-Month Dev Update. We learned that we‚Äôll have a maintenance upgrade toward the end of October and then PAB a few weeks later. This is extremely important since it will finally allow for the last bits of dApp buildout. The PAB is already available on the tesnet. The test dApp the team is using is an NFT marketplace. The team is watching as we see high loads around events like NFT drops. But, the network is reacting as expected.

personalfinance,Best tactic for securing Credit Limit Increases,"I posted a short while ago, asking about the importance of AAoA on credit scores. A user suggested I try to increase my existing credit lines, which I did attempt.

However, this failed for two of my eight cards. The first request, from Capital One was rejected due to not utilizing enough of the existing credit line. Makes sense if you consider I put all my purchases on one credit card (not CapOne) and haven't made a purchase on this card for over a year. CapOne was giving me steady increases in the previous years but I'll forgive them their trepidation.

So I turned to the bank whose card I put all my purchases on (Navy Federal), and considering I put the request in over a week ago and my limit hasn't gone up, I assume they denied the request (although I haven't got a letter in the mail yet which is odd). I can only imagine what their reason is.

Basic credit rundown is I have around $5,600 debt on a $40,800 total available, for around 15% overall utilization. Most of that debt is on one card, and that makes up a 31% usage for that card, but I've had worse credit pictures and still gotten increases. 

I've been spammed with offers from BofA, who I've been primarily banking with for a year, and while my original strategy was going to be different, I got drunk one night and applied for the card that suited me. They approved me and I got a $10k limit. 

Getting this new card has not assuaged the hit to my ego that 2 denied CLI requests caused, however, and I want to know how I can prevent this from happening in the future. CapOne rejected me because I had a $3,250 line and spent nothing on it for a year; this leads me to wonder how much I'd need to spend for them to consider it a ""adequate use of existing credit line"" (paraphrasing their reason for rejection of CLI). Likewise, if Navy Fed gives the same reason, then it's safe to say my card with them has reached it's max limit. I will spend anywhere from $500 - $1,000 on a given credit card in a given month, so if Navy Fed considers a 12% usage of my current credit line too little, I won't be getting any farther than my $8,000 limit unless I start buying a lot more stuff. CapOne is a bit more reasonable, because if I'm spending up to 30% of my limit per month they might see fit to increase my limit.

What I'm trying to ask is how best to orient my purchases and card usage to promote future CLI. My $5,600 debt isn't going anywhere anytime soon, because I feel like having cash savings in this still-volatile time is more important than paying off a debt that I pay 6% APR on. Will NavyFed only increase my limit if I exceed $1k monthly spending on an $8k limit? If I switch to the CapOne card with $3.25k limit and spend $1k a month, will they be more likely to increase my limit? Can I expect no increase from the BofA card I just got approved for if my spending remains $1k a month on a $10k limit?

I would ask whether nobody will give me CLI until that $5,600 disappears but BofA just gave me $10k so I don't see how that would be a factor. 

Do I need more credit than I have? No. But the only way for me to increase my credit score currently (since I can't pay off the debt) is to decrease utilization. That means either more cards or CLI, and CLI is safer since it doesn't impact AAoA. 

My original strategy was to rotate my monthlies on each of my 8 cards to entice them into increasing the limit. Even though I just got a $10k card from BofA, I'm wondering if that's still a viable option. I have 2 cards with $1k limits, if I put almost the full limit on those but pay it off each month, will they increase the limit? The BofA application was an impulse decision that turned out well, but I'd much rather get CLI on my current lines and I want to know how best to achieve that.",finance

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**:

While inflation should theoretically reduce the value of a particular asset, in a strong bull market, enough demand can still outweigh the selling pressure from inflation.

You can clearly see this in the inflation chart (monthly) of Sushiswap. Despite the huge inflation in the early stages to incentivise users, the value of $SUSHI is increasing rapidly. This is something interesting in the crypto space.

 

# General Conclusion

Inflation is not only an important variable in monetary policy in the economy, but also important in crypto. Inflation is the easiest way to fund development. This forces holders to indirectly pay for development through the loss of value or ownership of the token over time to the protocol.

Inflation is usually referred to via a token release schedule; the researcher actively recalculates it.

# What Is Inflation?

&gt;Inflation in traditional economics refers to the **increase in prices of goods.** Inflation in token economics refers to the **increase in token supply.**

Inflation is the persistent increase in the general price level of goods and services over time and the value loss of a currency. When the general price level rises, **a unit of currency buys fewer goods and services than in the past.** Thus, inflation reflects a decrease in purchasing power per unit of a currency. In the economy, inflation is affected by many factors such as **demand-pull, cost-push, structural changes and import and export, etc.**

In the crypto space, inflation is the issuing of new crypto/tokens into circulation which puts selling pressure on them. In theory, their value should decrease with an increase in supply, if demand is constant. Inflation in the crypto space is mainly affected by **the increase in the supply of circulating tokens**.

# Token Issuance Model

The only impact on inflation is the issuance of tokens into circulation. Token inflation is used to bootstrap growth or to start a community. In this section we are going to find the answer to this question: which issuance models have been used so far in crypto space?

personalfinance,Leasing vs buying a car - Inflation &amp; opportunity costs.,"Hello,

Since our car is dying at the moment, me and my partner are looking into buying a used car. We are eyeing on getting a used car that costs around ‚Ç¨17.000. We are in the position that we can buy it cash without breaking the bank.

I am also looking into financing the car, and comparing buying vs financing.
My thoughts on leasing at the moment:

The interest rate on the financing is 4.2%. I can choose to pay in e.g., 48, 60 or 72 months. Lets say the inflation rate would hypothethically be at 3% for the coming 5/6 years, and our wages would grow with more than that (I am finishing a PhD so the probability of my wage increasing during the financing is high); being in debt with a relatively high inflation percentage is considered beneficial.

Another positive side of financing imo is that I am pretty sure I can get a higher percentage annual return with investing my money in ETF's than the interest rate on the lease. 
Even during economic downperiods, I would not be forced to sell the investments since we have a large buffer.

What are your thoughts on this subject? I like to hear opinions about whether to go for either choice. Best regards!",finance

&gt; Inflation has been running at a 30-year high. Core PCE inflation ‚Äî which is the Fed‚Äôs preferred gauge ‚Äîjumped 3.6% in September on a year-over-year basis, the same as in August.
*****
&gt; Stocks were higher on the week, with the S&amp;P 500 up about 1.1% as of Friday afternoon and up roughly 6.7% for the month of October. Both the Dow and S&amp;P 500 notched new highs in the past week. The widely watched 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.53% Friday afternoon.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThere is an incredible level of complacency out there in this environment,‚Äù Boockvar said.
*****
&gt; Other events the markets are monitoring include the gathering of world leaders at the G-20 in Italy and the United Nations climate summit COP26, beginning Sunday in Scotland.
*****
&gt; # ‚ÄòWild week‚Äô
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to have a wild week,‚Äù Wells Fargo‚Äôs Michael Schumacher said. He noted that the Fed‚Äôs action will dominate the week, and the jobs report will be secondary.
*****
&gt; Wells Fargo economists expect 390,000 jobs were added in October and average hourly earnings grew by 0.4%, he noted. Payrolls were up just 194,000 in September. Schumacher said inflation is the biggest concern in the markets, so the wage data will be most closely watched.
*****
&gt; Schumacher said the market is widely expecting the Fed to announce it will reduce its bond purchases by $15 billion a month, starting either in November or December. The central bank implemented its $120 billion monthly bond-buying program in early 2020, as it slashed rates and introduced programs to buy a range of assets to help keep the markets liquid.
*****
&gt; Now, as the program is being wound down, it is what Fed Chairman Jerome Powell says about inflation that matters most because that will drive interest rate expectations.
*****
&gt; Yet, Powell is expected to stress that the Fed is not automatically going to raise interest rates once the bond purchases end in the middle of next year. Traders are pricing in as many as three interest rate hikes next year, but in the latest Fed forecast, only half of central bank officials agreed there should be even one.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe inflation commentary is a lot more important,‚Äù Schumacher said. ‚ÄúPowell has sounded concerned about expectations getting baked in.‚Äù He noted that the 2-year yield, which most reflects the Fed, has risen more than 30 basis points since the last Fed meeting five weeks ago.
*****
&gt; Schumacher said market expectations for rate hikes may be overdone, and that he does not expect a move until the beginning of 2023. ‚ÄúThe direction is right, but the speed is wrong,‚Äù he said.
*****
&gt; Powell‚Äôs comments will be closely watched for any adjustment in his thinking on inflation. The Fed had described the surge in rates as ‚Äútransitory‚Äù or temporary. The consumer price index has been running above 5%, and core CPI was at 4% in September.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúThe general feeling among central bankers and the major central banks is this inflation rate will come back down,‚Äù TIAA Bank president of world markets Chris Gaffney said. ‚ÄúNobody is using ‚Äòtransitory‚Äô anymore, but they don‚Äôt feel like we‚Äôre going to have prolonged high inflation.‚Äù
*****
&gt; Gaffney said the weaker-than-expected 2% growth in third-quarter gross domestic product could help the Fed convince the markets that it intends to keep rates lower for longer.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúAs long as they stay accommodative, I think the recovery continues,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fairly bullish for the markets going forward. We‚Äôll certainly see a lot more choppiness, but I still think the global economy, the U.S. economy particularly, is right now a great environment for corporations. We‚Äôre seeing fairly positive earnings reports, and more importantly expectations for future earnings.‚Äù
*****
&gt; There have been some high-profile misses, including both Apple and Amazon this past week. Both their stocks fell, weighing on the Nasdaq down Friday.
*****
&gt; ‚ÄúEarnings overall have been good, but there‚Äôs still a lot of profit margin challenges out there,‚Äù Boockvar said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no better example than Apple and Amazon.‚Äù

&gt; # November‚Äôs First Trading Day: DJIA Up Over 1% Three Years in a Row

&gt; Based upon data in the 2022 Stock Trader‚Äôs Almanac on page 90, the first trading day of November is the fourth best of all monthly first trading days since September 1997 based upon total DJIA point gained. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ have all advanced 13 times over the last 21 years. Average performance on the day ranges from a low of 0.17% by S&amp;P 500 to 0.28% by NASDAQ over the 21-year time period.

&gt; # Here Comes One of the Best Days of the Year (and the Best Week and Month)

&gt; The calendar is about to do a lot of favors for the bulls, as late October and early November historically are quite strong.

&gt; October 28 was the best day of the year, until it fell more than 3% last year, but this day is still one of the strongest days historically for stocks. Not to be outdone though, October 29 and November 2 and 3 are also some of the better days of the year. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to think it has something to do with my birthday being on October 28, but the truth is bulls should be aware that the coming days are historically some of the best of the year,‚Äù explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.27.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the single best day to buy at the close and hold for the next five trading days is today, October 27. Yes, these 5 days were lower last year by 0.6%, but you have to go back to the late 1960s to see the last time they were down two years in a row.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.27.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Lastly, November has been quite strong historically. In fact, since 1950, and the past 10 years, it is the best month of the year, while it ranks second over the past 20 years and during a post-election year. ‚ÄúNovember is the best month of the year, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to get nearly as much love as you‚Äôd think,‚Äù added Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúWe all assume December is the best month, but November is actually better and gets very little fanfare. Maybe it should be a month for the bulls, not for turkeys.‚Äù

&gt; # Year‚Äôs Best 3-Month Span About To Start

&gt; November, December and January constitute the year‚Äôs seasonally strongest 3-month period for the S&amp;P 500, Dow Jones Industrials and the NASDAQ Composite. This seasonal strength is created by a combination of the annual, semiannual and quarterly operations of institutions and the habitual behavior of retail investors and consumers.

&gt; The November-January 3-month span has produced a gain of 4.3% for the S&amp;P 500 &amp; DJIA since 1949. October-December runs a close second at 4.1% for S&amp;P and 3.9% for DJIA. Since 1971 NASDAQ has gained a whopping 6.3% November-January with December-February in second at 5.0% and October-December in third at4.4%.

&gt; These charts also highlight the Best and Worst Months of the year with the Best running from October/November to April/May/June and the Worst from May/June/July to September/October. Stocks have been firming up since we issued our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal to subscribers on October 8 and look poised for a solid yearend rally that continues into early 2022.

&gt; # Short Term Breadth Takes Off

&gt; One of the points noted about the recent moves for the S&amp;P 500 over the past few days have been on the outsized impacts of big gains or losses in names like Tesla (TSLA) or Facebook (FB). In spite of the impacts of those single names, the S&amp;P 500's return to record highs has happened on very strong breadth across sectors. Below, we show 10-day advance-decline line charts from our Sector Snapshot.

&gt; The 10-day advance/decline line measures the average daily number of advancers minus decliners in an index or sector over the last ten trading days. It's a short-term breadth measure that traders use to measure how extended the market is at the moment. Very high readings suggest that the market might be overbought in the near term, and downside mean reversion can be expected. Very low readings suggest the opposite -- that the market might be oversold in the near term, and upside mean reversion can be expected.

&gt; For the broad S&amp;P 500, the 10-day AD line has hit the highest level since February 12th. Going back to 1990, the current reading stands in the 97th percentile. Looking at each sector, most lines are also in the upper decile of readings since 1990 and only two are not currently overbought: Communication Services and Consumer Staples. Meanwhile, some like Technology and Real Estate are a full two standard deviations above the historical norm. In fact, the Tech sector's line is the most elevated relative to its respective history of any sector with the current reading in the 98th percentile of all periods. The last time that the line was as elevated as now was in November of last year. No other sector has as long of a gap in time in which it has seen levels similar to the current reading. Most other sectors have seen higher readings as recently as August or September, though current levels are nonetheless elevated. The market has had quite the run over the last two weeks, and we'd expect some sort of cool-off period soon.

&gt; # High Number of Record Highs

&gt; Major US equity indices have returned to all-time highs in the second half of October with the S&amp;P 500 and Dow both hitting record levels today. Meanwhile, the NASDAQ Composite is roughly a quarter of one percent away and the closest to a new all-time high since the last one on September 7th. The Russell 2,000, on the other hand, is at the high end of the past several months' range, but it is still over 2% below its high from March 15th.

&gt; With the S&amp;P 500 having been at new highs over the past few days, it has made 57 new all-time highs year to date. As shown in the top-left chart below, there have only been three other years in the past that have seen more record highs during the full course of the year: 2017 (62), 1964 (67), and 1995 (78). For the other major indices, the pace of record highs is less impressive but still strong. The Dow has made 38 new highs in 2021 which is more than triple the historical average. This year is on pace to see the highest number of record highs for the index since 2017 when it tied 1991 for the record of 71 closes at an all-time high. The NASDAQ Composite has also seen a solid number of highs at 36 which is well above the historical average of 19 per year historically. Given the index has been rangebound essentially all year, the Russell 2,000, conversely, has only seen 13 closing record highs. That is the same number as last year and it is actually below the average of 20 per year historically.

&gt; # Sentiment Steps Back

&gt; The weekly sentiment survey from AAII saw a surge in optimism in recent weeks, but it took a step back this week even with the S&amp;P 500 at new highs. Bullish sentiment fell from a recent high of 46.9% down to 39.8% this week. Outside of last week, that is still the highest level since the first week of September.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102821-AAII-Bulls.png))**

&gt; While bullish sentiment saw a significant 7.1 percentage point drop, a relatively small share of those losses turned to the bearish camp. Bearish sentiment only rose 1.6 percentage points to 29.4%. That is still below levels from two weeks ago and is in line with the average from throughout the summer.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102821-AAII-Bears.png))**

&gt; The corresponding moves in bullish and bearish sentiment resulted in the bull-bear spread to fall but bulls continue to outweigh bears by 10.4 percentage points.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102821-AAII-Spread.png))**

&gt; As previously mentioned, the largest share of losses to bulls did not go to bears, but instead were picked up by those reporting neutral sentiment. That reading moved back above 30% this week gaining 5.3 percentage points. Again, that does not mark any sort of new high or low but instead brings sentiment back to similar levels seen only a month or two ago.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks. :)",finance
personalfinance,"I don't think I need a financial advisor yet, but audit me on this real quick","38 years old, debt free as of August (drained my ""emergency fund"" and paid my house off.) My wife and I have separate finances, but now that the house is paid off, we are contributing to a joint account for household expenses/taxes/home improvements to the tune of $5k per month combined, with the intent to let that account grow to a ""safe"" level and then start putting the excess in to an index fund. That account has $10k in it currently.

On to me- 38 years old, income is variable (commission) with a particularly strong year this year due to interesting COVID related dynamics. Most years I make 180-200k, this year will be over 300k. (Wife makes 120-150k). I max out my 401k, but due to ""highly compensated employee"" federal guidelines I end up getting a check back at the end of the year which reduces my effective contribution to around $12k. I have around $450k in that account currently. We swapped to an HSA plan a couple years back, I have another $11k sitting there currently and need to figure out how much and where to invest it, but it isn't a critical amount of money to worry about yet. 

Otherwise, after draining everything to pay the mortgage off, I've been working to get my savings back to a comfortable level, currently sitting at $30k. I also keep another $5k cash in my safe as a ""just in case"" fund. 

I feel that we are responsible with our money- we make quite a bit, and don't go out of our way to live spartan, but we paid off our 15 year mortgage in 4.5 years, paid off the 50k I borrowed on our 140k boat in 3 years, and paid cash for her $65k Jeep. We have agreed that from here on out we aren't going to borrow money for anything. We don't have a kid that we need to put through college, from here on out it's just a matter of getting as financially comfortable as possible- ideally we both will retire early, but between now and then we'll need to trade our boat in at some point, may buy a place in Florida, etc etc etc.

Long story with too much info made short- I don't want to tie up too much additional money into retirement funds with age requirements for withdrawal. At my income level, there are a lot of restrictions anyhow. I'll continue to max out my 401k and HSA, and would be open to looking at additional money into an IRA of some point also. Does my plan of using an index fund as a large ""savings account"" make sense? I figure that once I get 200k or so built up in there, it'll make sense to get a financial advisor involved.

Bitcoin,"Inflation notches a fresh 30-year high as measured by the Fed's favorite gauge - probably nothing, no need for BTC. Keep your money in fiat.",,cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,IMF hates bitcoin or any other crypto Asset because they are losing control,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF), along with a string of other financial institutions, really does not like Bitcoin. So, let‚Äôs do the usual, thinking through what the IMF is and why it even matters.

**WHAT IS THE IMF?**

The IMF and the World Bank are like the parallel universe versions of Shaggy and Scooby-Doo. They have no idea what they are doing, and yet the decisions they make determine how the show ends. The only difference is that no one wants to watch this version of the show, because Shaggy and Scoob keep debasing your currency into oblivion.

Sticking with the IMF alone for this article, its mandate is as follows:

‚ÄúThe IMF promotes monetary cooperation and provides policy advice and capacity development support to preserve global macroeconomic and financial stability and help countries build and maintain strong economies.‚Äù

‚ÄìIMF.org

For oversimplification, let‚Äôs just imagine the IMF as dictating a short- and medium-term global monetary policy. It responds to what is in front of it at any given time and ‚Äúinfluences‚Äù global markets. This, obviously, requires a large amount of control, or centralization, if you will.

So, who makes up the IMF?

‚ÄúIMF loans are funded mainly by the pool of quota contributions that its members provide.‚Äù

‚ÄìIMF.org

It‚Äôs not a secret that a bunch of rich people influence the entire globe‚Äôs monetary policy. This is public information that‚Äôs easy to find. Obviously, these guys have good reason to maintain the *status quo*.

So, as I said, the IMF doesn‚Äôt like Bitcoin. But why?

**PREVENTING THE FOURTH TURNING**

For those unfamiliar, the ‚ÄúFourth Turning‚Äù is a concept that states there is a cyclical progression in society, typically with 20 years or so in each turn, the last of which results in a crisis that topples the old systems of power and ushers in a new era.

Bitcoin is often thought to be the crisis moment of the Fourth Turning by toppling the financial institutions of old (here‚Äôs a summary).

Following that track, over the past two years, the world has been rocked by a pandemic that led to the debasement of many global currencies, the U.S dollar being a very clear one, as outlined in this article by Jerry Goddard. The IMF knows all of this and has made it clear that it means to maintain control.

On July 29, an article was posted on the IMF blog, including the following quote:

‚ÄúThere is a window of opportunity to maintain control over monetary and financial conditions, and to enhance market integration, financial inclusion, economic efficiency, productivity, and financial integrity.‚Äù

‚ÄìIMF blog

It‚Äôs honestly kind of smug how indiscreet this statement is. Clearly, through central banks in nation states, the World Bank and other institutions, the goal of the IMF is to maintain control. In the classic Bitcoiner phraseology:‚Äù Bitcoin fixes this.‚Äù

But seriously, this is what Bitcoin was made for.

**HOW DOES BITCOIN FIX THIS?**

I‚Äôll spare everyone the details of rehashing what Bitcoin is. Let‚Äôs stick to the basics:

**1. Bitcoin is decentralized.** There‚Äôs no group of developers, miners or businesses that can band together to manipulate the protocol. If consensus is not met, the hell with it, it isn‚Äôt happening. Understandably, the IMF, which settles short- and medium-term economic issues between countries by issuing out loans based on the currencies that it constantly has a hand in debasing, probably doesn‚Äôt want the money supply controlled by an unbeatable algorithm that makes you play the game the way Bitcoin wants to play.

**2. Bitcoin has a programmatic monetary policy.** We know how many bitcoin exist now, we know how many will exist in total and we know when the new bitcoin will be issued. We know all of this, and it‚Äôs publicly available to anyone willing to look. Not being able to control the supply or its issuance is a crucial concern for any central authority attempting to maintain power in the legacy system. They cannot control the protocol or the system of Bitcoin, and they cannot control the currency of bitcoin, either. These would be transparent reasons for not wanting it to succeed.

**THE IMF WANTS TO INITIATE BITCOIN PANIC**

‚ÄúDigital money must be designed, regulated, and provided so that governments maintain control over monetary policy to stabilize prices, and over capital flows to stabilize exchange rates.‚Äù

‚ÄìIMF blog

Read that first part again: *‚ÄúDigital money must be designed‚Äù* for government control. The IMF will claim this is for consumer protection. We hear about the impending regulations on the darkening horizon constantly.

And when discussing digital assets, the IMF made sure to speak directly on Bitcoin later on in the post:

‚ÄúThe least stable of the lot, which hardly qualify as money, are cryptoassets (such as Bitcoin) that are unbacked and subject to the whims of market forces.‚Äù

‚ÄìIMF blog

The only cryptocurrency named was bitcoin. (I hear you maxis, I know you don‚Äôt like us to call Bitcoin ‚Äúcrypto.‚Äù) It was named because it is feared. It stands before the IMF as an unstoppable algorithm designed as a relic of the new age. Debasement and financial instruments that enable it will fade to forgotten dust as a bygone age is swallowed whole, along with the financial legacy framework.

**IT‚ÄôS NOT JUST ABOUT CONTROL**

It‚Äôs about IMF‚Äôs funding too. What happens when a governing body needs to raise capital quickly? That‚Äôs right, it issues garbage bonds. Well, what happens if other products result in larger yields in a shorter time frame, such as what is happening in the world of stablecoins and DeFi?

‚ÄúCountries are concerned with several scenarios. Substantial CBDC or stablecoin demand might absorb a large share of government bonds. This could affect the yield curve, and in the case of stablecoins whose reserves cannot be lent out, the availability of collateral. And stablecoins fully backed by central bank reserves could immobilize and segregate central bank liquidity which would otherwise be freely lent between banks to satisfy daily payment shocks.‚Äù

‚ÄìIMF, ‚ÄúThe Rise Of Digital Money‚Äù

For the United States, this is what is referred to as the ‚ÄúFederal Funds Rate.‚Äù This is the rate at which banks borrow money from each other or the central bank overnight to meet a reserve requirement (a percentage of the deposits you hold), each night. As you can imagine, the loss of bonds and the loss of another revenue stream via the Federal Funds Rate isn‚Äôt something any centralized player wants.

**BUT THAT‚ÄôS NOT ALL, FOLKS!**

In December 2020, the IMF put up a post on its blog that discussed using your browser history to affect your credit score.

‚ÄúAs Big Techs gather data, manage customer relations through ubiquitous digital platforms (as opposed to networks of physical branches), and become essential to better design and customize financial services, they will keep an increasing share of the producer surplus.‚Äù

‚ÄìIMF

The IMF is ecstatic to talk to all of us about the opportunity to add every single thing we do on the internet to be calculated into our ability to get a credit card. It doesn‚Äôt want to simply have access to your finances and control that information on a global market anymore. No, that got too boring. Now, it wants to control who you are and control every digital action you make.",cryptocurrency
personalfinance,HELOCs and Home Improvements,"Yes, in a perfect world, I'd be able to pay all this with cash. But it's not so this is what I've got to work with.

When I purchased my condo ($108k) back in 2019, I knew that I'd need to do general remodeling. The bathrooms and the kitchen are all the original 1987 builds and were not well maintained, so before I offload this place, I'd have to redo them, not to mention for my own personal home enjoyment (I can't tell you how much my kitchen just... sucks). So I sourced a quote for the shower/tub replacement, and am waiting to hear back on labor costs for the kitchen/new pergo for the first floor (materials come in at around $7,685 + $1,200 for the floor). 

I refinanced at a lower interest rate and was able to drop $100 off my mortgage payments last year, and am contacting my bank to get PMI dropped. Home appraised for $122k this time last fall (replaced the furnace and AC).

I'm in a middle unit condo, and I loved it here... until my end unit neighbor decided to start being a nightmare. With my parents moving out of state, my younger brother and his new family moving back to this state next year, and a job that's relatively location independent, I've got a lot of options open moving forward. 

So to facilitate that, is the HELOC my best option for funding the needed remodeling? Can I also use it for some debt consolidation? (I have CC debt that I'm working on paying off).",finance
CryptoCurrency,Thoughts On Upcoming November 3rd Fed Meeting Tapering Announcement Are Welcome! Implications for Crypto...,"The US Fed will announce it is tapering its bond buying program on November 3rd at 2pm with a press conference at 2:30pm EST. From $120B a month, decreasing by around $15B thereafter. It feels like crypto will trade down on this announcement as this is a major contributor to inflation which is a partial driver of crypto valuation. I don't anticipate interest rate increases will be signaled due to high levels of government debt and for fear of crashing the market. 

The fed may also increasingly acknowledge inflation. If it does acknowledge inflation that should be good for crypto but this will be offset by the coinciding tapering announcement.

personalfinance,"Budget Review- How can I bring my financial understanding to the ""next level""?","Throwaway so I can post personal information. 

Thank you in advance for anyone who takes the time to read through this. There is a TLDR at the bottom if you'd rather skip ahead.

I have only recently become interested in personal finances, so I have some gaps in knowledge (particularly around retirement and investing) that I'm looking to fill. Luckily my parents drilled the ""live below your means"" mindset into me from birth, so I haven't dug myself into any holes. 

**Basic Info** 

I am a 27 year old teacher. I live alone in a house I own, no children, just a dog. I'm not sure what qualifies an area as high-mid-low cost of living but I believe my area is on the lower end. I am in Wisconsin, USA.

**Income**

$42k gross annual income. Net pay is $1154 every other week ($2308 in a typical month). 

**Debt**

My only debt is my mortgage. My interest rate is 3.25%. My remaining balance is $107,686. 

**Necessary** **Monthly Expenses**

Mortgage- $795.14 

Groceries- $120

Utilities (water, electric, internet, phone)- $220

Car (gas, insurance, registration)- $100

Pet Expenses (food, treats, heartworm/flea/tick)- $80

Toiletries/Household Goods- $50

Gym Membership- $55

Total: 1420.14

Remaining income after necessary expenses: 887.86

Mortgage is exact, everything else is rounded. I know my numbers are accurate because I use YNAB. I set aside monthly amounts for annual costs like car registration, which is why they're factored above. I did not include fun money, dining out, subscriptions, etc, because they are variable and I would like to understand how much I should be putting towards savings/retirement/other goals before I decide how much I should spend on fun things. For reference, I spent about $200 in October on non-essentials, but I know I was spending more than that before I started tracking with YNAB.

**Savings**

Emergency Fund- $5000. This would cover my expenses for 3.5 months. I would like to increase this to around 6 months. 

Sinking Funds- $300/each for medical, vet, car maintenance, home maintenance. These are for unexpected expenses and maintenance. I would like to increase these as well, but I'm not sure what a good goal is. 

Other- I have some savings set aside for upcoming expenses like pest control, an oil change, a tiny amount of fun money, etc. Roughly $2000 set aside for these specific expenses. This money cannot be used elsewhere.

Total cash in checking/savings: $10,132

**Retirement/Investments**

Now here is where I am confused and would like to improve my understanding. 

I have 6.5% ($107 per paycheck) deducted from gross pay for retirement and this is matched by my employer for a total of 13.5%. I am confused about what type of account this is. It is through the Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS). I know that it is not a 401(k). 

The WRS only sends out one statement a year, and I cannot check my current balance online. As of January 2021, I had just over $20k in this account and have continued my contributions all year. 

Roth IRA- My grandmother very generously set up this account for me and has made all the contributions to it. It is currently at $10,552 and has been maxed out for this year. This is an American Fund (it says ""The Growth Fund of America (GFACX)""). I don't have a full understanding of what that means. I have seen mixed reviews of American Funds on Reddit, but my parents and grandmother seem very happy with this fund and have accounts set up for my siblings and I. I would love to learn more on this topic. 

Investment Account- This was also set up through contributions from my grandmother after the Roth IRA was maxed out. It currently has $5,017. It says ""AMCAP Fund (AMPCX)"". I do not know what this means.

**Financial Goals**

Immediate goals- Increase retirement savings to get above 15% and increase my emergency funds to 6 months expenses. 

In the next 5 years or so, my long term partner and I would like to get married and start a family. I would love to be able to stay home and care for our child for at least 1-2 years (preferably longer) if possible. Based his current income, I believe this will be possible, but I would like to save as much as possible towards this goal on my own as I can (not counting my chickens before they hatch). I would be comfortable investing my savings towards this goal because if the market dips I would just keep working and pay for child care rather than staying home. Not ideal but I think the rewards outweigh the risks.

My partner and I live separately and he owns a duplex. He rents out one side and lives in the other. When we get married we would like to sell or rent out my house, rent out both sides of his duplex, and purchase a nicer house for ourselves. 

I would love to retire early. I don't think I can sustain being a teacher for another 35-40 years, even if I take a break to stay home with children. Even though I love working with the children and I enjoy my job, it drains me and I am already burned out after less than 5 years. I understand early retirement may not be possible on my salary. I don't currently wish to pursue another career path but it is something that has been sitting in the back of my mind. 

**TLDR- Questions I Have**

After my necessary expenses, I have $887 left over. How should I be splitting this between emergency savings, savings goals, retirement, investing, and fun money? This will sound dumb but I struggle with how much is reasonable to spend on fun money. Growing up, I was just taught ""don't spend if at all possible"", which is nice in theory but doesn't really guide my budget. 

Can anyone help me understand or point me in the direction of resources to better understand my retirement and investment accounts? I don't even know what questions I should be asking.

When I increase retirement contributions, should I put the additional money into the WRS account or something else? Obviously the Roth IRA is maxed out this year, but next year should I be contributing extra there? Should I open my own separate Roth IRA instead? Do I need a 401(k)? 

How would you rate my financial health? Do you see ways for me to improve? 

My parents want me to meet with a financial advisor. Is this a good idea? How can I make sure this person is working in my best interests? What questions should I be asking? 

Are my financial goals realistic and/or possible on my income? 

Thanks to anyone who read through this. I would really appreciate an outside perspective on my situation as I am just now starting to get a better handle on my finances. I've learned a lot just from lurking on this sub. Thank you!",finance

CryptoCurrency,Many are worried the sub has turned to shit with shitcoin shilling. Its just the state of the entire crypto market right now. Dogcoins are posting 100% gains almost daily.,"Imo its not a critical condemnation of this sub but rather just how the crypto market is right now. Things arent making sense anymore. 

Many people (me included) who woved to never touch shitcoins have just decided to go with the flow. Some are risking small amounts of capital just to start with and seeing that double almost overnight, putting more in these things. Coins that literally do nothing but have a dog photo slapped on them are soaring to billion plus market cap. 2 meme coins in top 10 have a market cap larger than established companies that have been around for decades and employ thousands of people. 

Everyone knows this will eventually end. No one can predict when. It may still be running few months down the line. These are all second level results of loose monetary policy where the central bank is printing trillions, but most of the money has no way to get to the hands of those who need them, but enter stock market and crypto markets. It is possibly a situation that has never happened in monetary history.  

My mantra is to just make hay when the sun shines. Eventually all of this will end. Till then, there is no real point in trying to predict the day it will end, or trying to call out shitcoins.

CryptoCurrency,What's the biggest risk involved in your favourite project?,"I'll do Monero.

In the current day and age people do not understand or value privacy and those who do are automatically labeled criminals or liars or assumed to be unfaithful. If you are stopped by a police officer (local laws and circumstances of the situation depending of course) they must ask you if you can be searched and require your verbal consent for it to be legal but say no and they will be on you like flies on shit because if you had nothing to hide you wouldn't mind having your possessions gone through.

There are multiple federal agencies including the IRS FBI NSA just to name a few who are working to break Moneros decoy system which hides true transactions to maintain user privacy and even have a $600,000 bounty on it, while I believe in the devs and believe that they can patch any vulnerabilities and remain 2 steps ahead it is an issue to have such a large force working for your demise.

They have also had (although very infrequent) bugs which allowed for nodes to have a pretty good guess at which transaction hash was the true, one bug caused the ring signature to ignore very recent spendable outputs for consideration as decoys making transactions potentially less private, another bug caused some wallets to be able to figure out which transactions were true more often than not when volume increased substantially over a significant period of time, an earlier bug allowed for essentially brute forcing of sending thousands of micro transactions to give bad actors the capability to learn which hashes are most likely to be decoys and as such which were likely to be true transactions. These issues have all since been patched and you can read more [here](https://www.getmonero.org/2021/09/20/post-mortem-of-decoy-selection-bugs.html) if your feeling adventurous, but the point I'm trying to make is that although none of these mentioned bugs have drastically affected user privacy and were quickly patched maybe a bug that hasn't been found yet or a vulnerability that doesn't even exist yet will harm user privacy, but there are risks you take whichever crypto you invest in and this is just one of XMRs.

Regulators make it very difficult to get access to Monero because they make it hard for exchanges to list it, and this means you either have to buy hardware to CPU mine XMR or have to use Atomic swaps (which are far from user friendly btw) (this is where I would of linked to a helpful Reddit post breaking down how to use Atomic swaps but the automod does not appreciate that unfortunately), and exchanges that do still list XMR may be pressured to delist eventually as has been seen previously with ZEC and DASH (unless I'm confusing coins) and lower liquidity will make XMR much more difficult to use as a currency as it's intended.

Unlike BTC Monero will remain inflationary indefinitely which makes it less of a viable inflation hedge, which to some is a downside but to others a small inflation is necessary to incentivise spending so take that as you will.

solar,"Getting help checking pre-requisites on a marginal property [San Francisco, PG&amp;E service]","I have a marginal, potentially non-viable property for solar. I need to do a major panel upgrade this year and a roof replacement in the next 5 years, so I still want to make sure I don't do anything counterproductive that would cost money down the line

**Background info on viability of property**

* Property is located in San Francisco area, serviced by PG&amp;E, solar installers are pretty busy
* I contacted two national companies. They were only willing to spend 1 hour on me (e-mails, phone calls, and forwarding my info to design team) before one explicitly told me it wasn't viable, and the other ghosted me after I talked to them on the phone and provided detailed written info. This suggests that it would be pretty difficult for me to get good free consultation / make progress with any kind of solar project
* Project sunroof says I have a 8 year payoff. However, I don't know if it really has proper modeling of the shading on my roof. It is heavily shaded with 100+ year old, non-removable heritage oaks on 3 corners. Anecdotally, the uptake of BEVs in this neighborhood is very high, but very few properties have solar (which is not the case in other adjacent neighborhoods with fewer (IE normal) level of trees). My visual inspection \[which I've shared on this sub before\] indicates that most bearings to the sun will have maybe 4-6 hours of sun exposure, and I feel I get very low solar heat gain in the summer despite how little attic insulation there is.
* In the past few years, PG&amp;E and CPUC has been adjusting time-of-use rates with the result that ROI from solar has gotten worse.

**Helpful inputs I'm soliciting in this post**

* What are all the big ticket solar dependencies that I should be tracking? Besides roof and electrical panel?
* I really want to get high confidence guidance on my dependencies. I have appointments set up with PG&amp;E project review (formal process) and my inspector for my panel upgrade, so I can probably ask them about whether I can reuse the equipment for solar.
   * Is it worth contacting anyone other than the project check meetings I already have set up? The main differences I can think of is that any recommendation would be given in writing / formally, and there would be dedicated time for it. However, I doubt that I have any recourse if I get bad advice (whereas I'm certain if PG&amp;E and inspector approve my panel change, and then they complain after installing that it's not kosher, I can point at the paper trail)
   * What are my options to get high confidence guidance? Are most solar installers available for paid consultation / trustworthy to do so? What is the efficient way to solicit bids for this?
   * Can I trust a roofing company to give a correct recommendation on what tile types would be solar ready?
   * Can I trust electricians for recommendations? I'm pretty wary given how each contractor I've contacted on my panel upgrade has missed things in different places, some critical, that I've had to do legwork / my own research on to correct.
   * What would be a good document for me to read to self-educate to the level I need to do the dependency checking? Note that it is a little difficult to justify / get motivated about this because of the short term non-viability of the project, so I feel this is a bad approach. I already suspect I've jumped the shark in terms of time sunk on looking into solar.
* When should I check in again on whether solar is viable? What market conditions might cause an inflection point? My guess is I need solar costs + tax credits to be halved, and no further changes to electric rates that reduce the ROI on solar.

**Detailed technical questions**

* For the electrical panel, what POCO requirements does PG&amp;E impose on the topology and capacity for a grid-connected solar system?
* My topology is below, with new equipment in \[\]'s.
   * Does the size of the service feeder and total amps on the PanelA bus affect the solar system?
   * What are good ways to set up the transfer panel and new PanelC to be solar ready? Or should I just assume that the transfer panel will no longer be useful if I add a grid-independent system with battery backup

personalfinance,aggressive loan repayment or refinance and take it slow?,"Hi all,

I have 79k in federal student loans that have been on COVID forbearance; payments begin again in February. During the forbearance I have been saving as much as I can in a HYSA planning on making a lump payment before interest begins accruing again. I have saved $55k. 

Because interest rates are so low I looked into refinancing my loans once payments begin again. I can get a rate between 2.3% - 2.4% depending on how large the refinance amount is. Once I realized I can get a rate this low, I realized that it may be unwise to put the 55k i've saved towards my loans. Perhaps it is best to just refinance the entire 79k amount and pay off the loan more slowly. I can get a 2.43% rate, 5 year repayment plan, $1,424/ month (total interest $4,997). 

Ive done the math, and the aggressive loan repayment plan would increase my net worth by 5.3k by the time I am 30 (i am currently 28), 21k when I am 40, 42.7k by 50, and 85.8k by the time I am 60. 

This seems like a no brainer, but I feel like I may not be considering the benefits of paying off the loan ASAP and having the extra cash available to me for other life moves. I do not own a home and would like to start saving/working towards that. I am not married and have no children, but obviously that may change in the future and I don't want money to be a barrier to that. 

I make a comfortable salary and am generally quite responsible with money. I will max out my retirement account/ fully fund an emergency fund regardless of which decision I make.

cardano,Charles Hoskinson's big picture summary of Cardano and other assorted notes from 10/31/21 AMA.,"[Surprise AMA 10/30/2021 (From Ethiopia)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5au7JEPMaM).

**Edit**: Fixed some typos. Also the AMA was from October 30th, 2021, not October 31st, 2021 like it says in the title. 

This is not a 100% accurate transcription and it is not complete. I tried to summarize some of the more interesting notes from the most recent AMA Charles did. If I quote something, I tried to get it right, but I may have misspelled something or misheard, so I do not guarantee perfect accuracy here. Anyway, I think I got the gist of it. I tried to keep it focused on questions that were about the state of Cardano, the vision for scaling Cardano, digital economics. I didn't focus on more personal or off-topic stuff. There's a long discussion about Shiba Inu, Doge coin, and I didn't feel like taking notes on this. 

**General State of the Union**

* Alonzo Hard Fork September launch was a great success, and October was about adding in a lot of features.
* Final stages of a Plutus application back-end (PAB). Transitioning from low-level Assembly language of Plutus to high-level applications like Sundae Swap and Meld are going to start deploying soon. Estimates PAB to go live, best estimate around November, but stuff happens.
* Babbage hard fork between November 2021 and February 2022 - going to be a boatload of changes and optimizations. Basically the first wave was about correctness, and now they are going to focus on optimizations for scalability and real-world deployment. There is a layered execution strategy with Cardano.
* John Woods (lead technical architect of Cardano, https://ie.linkedin.com/in/johnalanwoods) is focused for the next 6 months on optimization of performance, more throughput and scaling up systems parameters. Specifics are things like ‚Äúk‚Äù, the blocksize, reducing the memory footprint (perhaps by 50%), how the data structures work in the system, UTXO-HD (hybrid storage of memory and hard drive), script compression. 
* Other parties are going to come in and optimize the Haskell code. Everything was first written for correctness, now they are focusing on optimization and scalability. 
* Another layer of workstream is Mithril (https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/mithrilstake-based-threshold-multisignatures/). Light client solution with full node security. 
* Another layer is improving the performance of Daedalus and also adding in light client support on the IOHK end. As well as improving the light client ecosystem. 
* One of the most anticipated is the Hydra workstream. Goal is to have something by Q1 (first quarter of 2022?) that is a good beta, that can be attached to commercial partners like DEXes to see how one can offload traffic onto the Hydra Network for payments and for smart contracts. 
* Mamba - hoping for something developers can experiment with as early as January. Mamba adds in EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) support. 
* Yet another thread is standards for verifying smart contracts and their correctness. 
* Digital Identity - full prism integration into Cardano stack. This has been underway due to the Ministry of Education deal, the Boost mobile deal, etc. 
* The dApp store is another thread that is going on, so on and so forth. 
* 300-400 people are working on all of these things. 
* IOHK foundation announced a $25 million budget for 2022.
* EMURGO (https://emurgo.io/) is trying to launch at least a $100 million fund that is Africa focused to start building out an ecosystem there.
* Catalyst - 150 proposals were funded in the 6th round, largest one yet. $8 million Fund 7 starting in November. 
* A lot of social media criticism regarding the price. There‚Äôs usually a big buildup and a big drawoff. Charles says he doesn‚Äôt care and isn‚Äôt focused on that. Charles doesn't understand market swings, and stays focused on technical development. 
* ‚ÄúEvery single metric of Cardano is looking real strong.‚Äù
* Africa tour - overwhelming demand in e-governance and identity. 
* Met up with a lot of startup accelerators that want to build up on Cardano.
* Anticipates dozens of deals coming from this Africa tour. The bottleneck is not having enough bandwidth to handle everything. 
* Zanzibar is launching a nation scale ISP with Cardano at the bedrock of it that will cover 1.8 million people. Expects a 12-to-24 month timeline in terms of rollout. Believes that what they do in Zanzibar will transfer over to many other nations. 
* People are already writing Solidity code that can be fueled and powered by Ada (mentions dcSpark - https://dcspark.io/).
* Over last 2 months - tens of thousands of NFTs been issued. 

**ERC-20 Cardano Converter**

* SingularityNet is in the process of migration
* Two targets for ERC-20: one is the main chain, the other is Mamba 
* More resources will be invested in the ERC-20 team
* ERC-20 to native asset standard, first example of this is going to be Singularity Net. This will be a case-study and they will work backwards to a more generic framework for it. 
* Long-term goal is automation and bridging, moving and wrapping assets.
* Commercial tool that allows people to migrate to Cardano ecosystem, and there is a collection of competencies there. 


**Hydra**

* Huge amount of work is going into Hydra
* High commercial priority. Important that they can offload the traffic onto Hydra.
* You need to segregate the traffic for microtransactions. 
* But still a bit of research going on, but converging to a good idea of a ‚Äú1.0‚Äù 

**DJED**

* A project by COTI, not technically from IOHK.
* IOHK philosophy is to develop something, open-source it, and let other people develop their own competing implementations of it. 

**New light wallet from IOG**

* Very high priority
* Mithril will launch with light wallet, so you get full node security with it

**FUD about increasing block size doesn‚Äôt really increase amount of plutus smart contract per block**

* Charles says this is a lie. If you increase the amount of storage a block has, you can of course increase the amount of scripts in that block. There are some limitations about amount of computation per block, but it‚Äôs a very complex situation. For what it is worth, IOHK wrote a blog post about this: https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/09/10/concurrency-and-all-that-cardano-smart-contracts-and-the-eutxo-model/. 
* Seems like Charles big vision here is that the eUTXO model is massively parallelizable because there will be a massive amount of outsourcable computation: ‚Äú3-5 years into the future 99% of computing will be done off-chain, and checked with proofs on chain.‚Äù
* The scaling model: ‚ÄúAs long as you have a proof that the out-sourcable computation was done correctly, that‚Äôs all that matters and that‚Äôs what checked on chain. You have a scarce resource on-chain, and unlimited, distributed resources off-chain. That‚Äôs the model that makes sense.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre boiling the ocean if you are chasing global state.‚Äù 

**How many transactions per second**

* Average transaction (subjective what this means) of 50-100 per second for an average crypto you are doing okay for daily volume. Nice to get core chain to 500-1000 TPS. 
* Getting beyond 500-1000 for any sharded architecture is not going to happen. 50K TPS is centralizing or batching/rolling-up, effectively doing Layer Two (which is the spirit of Hydra). 
* Charles doesn‚Äôt think there is a TPS problem. Or rather it‚Äôs the wrong question, Charles thinks in terms of ‚Äúwhat is the off-chain, what is the on-chain?‚Äù and how do you check correctness. 
* Charles thinks TPS is a useless in practice and is just a marketing metric. A dump-truck has 1000 horsepower, but it‚Äôs completely different than a ~~coating stick (not sure about this transcription)~~ Koenigsegg (a sports car).

**Paper wallet with staking capability**

* Charles is very big on this one, it‚Äôs a priority for him. 

**IOHK is not the ecosystem**

* IOHK is independent from projects like Sundae Swap. Charles does not know the deadlines of all of these various projects. I guess he is getting flooded with these types of questions. 

**Coin burning**

* Charles reiterates there will only ever be 45 billion ADA. Does not believe in modifying the monetary policy. No one can change it. 
Charles references when Stellar burned their reserve supply and it didn‚Äôt do anything for the underlying price. 

**Plutus Dev Accreditation System**

* Thinking about developing some sort of accreditation system 
* Hired 8 companies to just write a bunch of code for them. They also viewed these companies as training the trainers. 
* Continue to grow Plutus Pioneers program 

**Can hydra heads/channels talk with each other?**

* Does it make sense to have everything go through the main chain or to have a synchronized Layer 2 setup? Charles believes in synchronized Layer 2 with Hydra.",cryptocurrency
CryptoCurrency,How to avoid scams and invest safely,"This are the top 5 investment schemes that people fall for:

1. Advanced fee scheme: scammer tries to convince the victim to send money (to pay gas fees for example, or trade for you and make a profit) and claims he will repay you an enormous amount of money for your help. Spoiler alert: he isn't.

2.Boiler room scam: using unfair or dishonest sales tactics. Someone sets up a fake company (usually trading company) and promises low fees/high interest rates. Once you have deposited you will never be able to retire your money, so only use trustworthy exchanges and store your crypto on a cold wallet.

3.Fake Guru (investment seminar scum): self-proclaimed millionaires claim they have discovered the secret to get crazy rich crazy fast. They only want you to buy their course/seminar/textbook so they can make a buck. Once you fail with you own money they will tell you it was your fault and that you must have done something wrong when trading at 125x leverage or doing the high risk-high reward stuff they encourage. Think about it, if they really had an easy way to get rich, why sell it to you and not use it?

4.Pump n' dump scheme: they are the most known. Usually organizated through chat rooms in telegram for example, this schemes target small market cap tokens/coins/shitcoins in order to move the price as demand rises exponentialy for a few minutes. They promise guaranteed returns as other people (bots, big investment firms etc) will jump into and buy when they see the price rises. In reality the organizers of the sheme have already bought a sizable amount of this coin and sell it to you once everyone involved raises the price. In a matter of minutes/seconds the price returns to normal and you lose most of your money.

5.Ponzi scheme: finally the most referenced but least understood. They usually promise incredibly high returns ""guaranteed"" (really high APY). You feel the hype for this great opportunity and call friends, family or coworkers so they don't miss this opportunity. In reality, no value is being generated and investors are paid using money that they/other people have put into the project. Once this blows up, those that ""bought high"" or ""entered late"" are literally left with nothing. They might keep going as people keep joining but eventually the scheme runs out of money or cashes out. 
The pyramid scheme is a variation of the scheme in which you are paid more if you bring other people to the scheme.",cryptocurrency

I think I can add more during design and I plan to take it 8000+

My usage is less than 7000 kw yr so all of these will work fine. The  I am more inclined towards Going with local and LG370N1K. That gives me wiggle room if my demand grows in the future.

Is the costing reasonable? Am I thinking on the right lines? Or should I go with Tesla. Cost diff is pretty big.

One of the reasons that I was most drawn to it was because of Algorand's focus on the trilemma of blockchain, which is a 3 headed problem that comes with maintaining a decentralized ledger platform:

* Scalability
* Security
* Decentralization 

The idea is that you can achieve any of the above 2 bullet points, at the expense of the 3rd. Have an easily scalable platform with robust security? Sounds centralized to me. Have a great decentralized environment with top-notch security? Those marks will probably suffer at scale. This conundrum exists for all blockchains - Algorand, Ethereum, etc.

I don't really ever see these concepts discussed here. 

I am a naturally paranoid, skeptical person - maybe you are not. However I have a few concerns about existance in general that seem to intersect, with cryptocurrency and blockchain serving as the remedy. I'd like to list my concerns here in list form and hopefully give you some insight that has nothing to do with price.

**1) National Monetary Policy.**

Almost all of us who are financially literate can agree that we are living in unprecedented times as far as the economy is considered. COVID showed us that the financial situations of most individuals are running on razor thin margins by necessity - while corporate budgets run on narrow margins by choice. Either way - both are left needing help when the economy stalls, and those entrusted to help are in their own financial dire straits.

*""It's only when the tide goes out that you learn who has been swimming naked.""*

Want to know why fast Coronavirus social welfare wasn't quickly deployed? Nothing complicated here. Most governments could not afford to send you a relief check. The ""rainy day fund"" style of personal finance that we recommend to our children is not practiced by national governments, they did not have a stash of emergency cash to give you. Businesses are expected to have retained earnings to whether tough financial times. Individuals are expected to have emergency funds to cover their bills. 

While not incorrect - what is called ""Modern Monetary Theory"" allows for a harmonious relationship between debt and GDP growth in a governmental, fiat system. From their perspective, it would be almost be a loss not to operate in debt, as that would impede growth. Until this style of monetary policy stops (and it won't, maybe it shouldn't) you can safely assume that most governments will not be at the ready to assist you during periods of lost work.

In a perfect example of ""Having your cake and eating it too"" the National Bank of the United States (the Federal Reserve) practices both the endorsement of capitalism and social stimulus via open market operations. This is a fancy way of saying that in order to inject cash into the economic system, the national bank uses cash to buy bonds. This puts bonds in the hands of the Federal Reserve, and their cash into the system. This is what supply side economics is. It is a more systemic bailout (supposed to be anyway) and not an individual one, and this is why you often hear that the ""stock market is disconnected from reality"" or that it is ""propped up.""

The take away from point 1 is that you can not realistically rely on the behavior of the government long term, nor the interpretation of open market operations. If you are still reading this, thanks.

**2) Meta**

Meta means information that is recursive in nature. So, meta-data is data about data, etc. You would be shocked at how much information could be pieced together about your routine, even if you are a relatively private person. 

The advice used to be ""once it's on the internet, it's there forever."" This piece of knowledge has a voluntary aspect to it. In today's world, you are not only worried about your data - but data ABOUT your data. Even the most resilient of privacy hackers will struggle to keep their cell phones from pinging off cell towers.

The ""metaverse"" is an eventuality. It's actually already here, it just isn't being corralled very well. There are thousands of data points floating all around you at all times.

Don't you think it's weird that you don't have any privacy? There really aren't any real Peer 2 Peer (P2P) interactions anywhere. We have an illusion of P2P with apps like Venmo, but these apps still use a bank as an intermediary.

Short of me walking up to you and giving you cash, there isn't much of a way for Individual A and Individual B to interact without getting Nosey Bank/Institution C involved. Why? It's because this is a *necessity* of the current monetary system. I mean come on, we have an Internal Revenue Service. An entire service whose job it is to understand the current state of the MASSIVE revenues of the United States. These requirements in this system mean that you, and your behavior, needs to be logged in order to be taxed. If not taxed, then used for marketing purposes.

Summarizing My Rant:

The ability to operate anonymously in a P2P environment is my end game. That is not quite where we are with Algorand, nor is my ""crazy man in the hills"" vision even in line with their end game. However, in my opinion, Algorand is the best target for institutional adoption - while still adhering to fair principles which contribute to an even playing field between the retail participant and the industry.

I do feel that ANONYMITY is vital to achieving the freedom to participate in a true P2P system - and that is why I (and hopefully you, soon) support exchanges that DO NOT require KYC.

I know that a lot of you are here to make money, I can't blame you. I too am enjoying my profits.

But I am scared for the future and preparing.

personalfinance,"I could pay off my mortgage in 3.5 years, but should I?","This is likely a common scenario, but every one is a bit different. I tend to be a bit verbose so I will try and keep it short.

I'm 37, single, I live alone, and I am 2 years into a 15 year mortgage. I owe $62,000 left, and I calculated it tonight and if I tighten my budget for the next 3.5 years starting in January, I could pay off my principal by mid-2025.

Even with my tighter budget, I would still be investing in two retirement accounts and a mid-term savings account to replace my car in 8-10 years. Otherwise, all other investments would be on hold during the 3.5 years to make room for me to pay this off. 

My current interest rate is 3.125%, and when I did the calculations, I would be saving about $9500 over the course of the loan if I did this.

I understand the economic vs. emotional safety debate of this, and I feel like I am teetering on the edge here about what to do. Would I be taking this extra money and be otherwise investing it all in something worth more than 3.125%? Not likely all of it. I'd be fixing up my house more, going on vacation, and going out to eat... As well as investing some. Plus, investments that are higher are not guaranteed, so either way, it's a risk. 

On the other hand, if I do decide to do this, I will have my primary residence (and place I don't intend on leaving ever) paid off entirely by the time I'm 42. I'll own my home and can then use the extra money from the principal and interest to put towards another investment or another loan (see edit below about this) to fix up my home. 

Are there other things I'm missing here? I hadn't looked into tax breaks for mortgages yet but that's something I would need to consider as well. 

Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated. Thanks for reading.

EDIT: I forgot to mention this. In my area, there is a government program with 2.75% 5 year ""fix it"" funds available for specific purposes such as remodeling/repairs. But I can't take on that debt now with the mortgage that I have. Of course I also don't know if those will still be available in 3.5 years so that's something to consider.

I also have people in my life who could lend me a personal loan (another conversation) that would charge less interest than a typical home improvement loan.

When I say take on another loan, this is what I mean. But I would also have the additional money from not having a mortgage to go towards anything I want to do to my home.",finance
personalfinance,Should you make a $0 downpayment on a 1.49% car loan for a new car worth $25000?,"I have a 750+ credit score, but this is my first ever car loan. Through DCU, it seems like I may be eligible for a 1.49% car loan though I still need to apply for preapproval. Should I make a downpaymemt at all, given the low interest rate?

And say I get a higher interest rate, at what point would a downpayment make sense?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: 

Lets consider these two scenarios:

1. I buy the car by putting a $5K downpayment and take a $20K loan. As soon as I leave the lot, my car's value $22K i.e. $3K less due to depreciation. The car gets totaled. So, the insurance will only cover $22K. With the $22K, I can pay off the loan and be left with $2K. My total loss will still be $3K.
2. I buy the car by putting a $0 downpayment and take a $25K loan. As soon as I leave the lot, my car's value $22K i.e. $3K less due to depreciation. The car gets totaled. So, the insurance will only cover $22K. With the $22K, I can pay off only a part of the loan and I'm still left with $3K to pay off. So, I still lose $3K plus maybe a tiny bit of interest. (Assumes no gap insurance).

So, is the difference in only WHEN the loss occurs as opposed to IF the loss occurs? In that case, won't option #2 with gap insurance be my best option?",finance

personalfinance,Help Calculating 2021 Income Taxes!,"Without getting into detail, I was extremely fortunate this year (2021) and will make +/-$1.5 million of income from my job.

When I look up the federal and state income tax brackets and run my income through the tables and add the two tax amounts together, I get one total tax amount due.

For a reality check, when I go to a website like smartasset.com or even a state dept. of revenue and use their income tax estimator, I typically get a much larger total amount due.

The article proposed some solutions for the existing monopoly of the banking system by Bitcoin. No other cryptocurrencies were prevalent and had gained attention and trust among the public other than Bitcoin then. 

Bitcoin was relatively new and the crash of stock market then had created a wide range discussions on the legitimacy of the government and banks.

Through randomized breeding outcomes determined using RNG from Chainlink VRF, a pet acquired from an egg may or may not have all the body parts above. Additionally, DeFi pets have genes that are split into either dominant or recessive genes, resulting in different offspring. Each pet has its own strengths and weaknesses that give it varying levels of combat ability, staking APR, and even aesthetic qualities.

stocks,Is there any realistic scenario where there is not a market crash in the next two years?,"Let's assume inflation is not transitory. The fed will have to raise rates in the next two years to control it. This should lead to a crash or a nasty downturn. Is there anyway a rate raise wouldn't lead to this?

Why isn't the most obvious play in the market right now buying long dated puts on bad companies for Jan 2024? Gives plenty of time for all this to play out.

Please educate me how a crash could not happen. Thanks!",finance

CryptoCurrency,God-Tier DD: ‚ÄúI like the coin.‚Äù,"Behodl: a 30-second look into Loopring.

About 4 days ago, posts mentioning GameStop and Loopring started saturating the forum.

Before then, there were a couple of citations, thanks to u/RagPoet !

Current price: $0.55xx
ATH: $2.50+
Market Cap &lt;$1 billion

Rumors of GameStop partnership were semi confirmed on GitHub 3 days ago, through a leak, then the price spiked and have been hodl‚Äôing decently in the $0.50-$0.59 range.

Coinbase featured a new Loopring quiz.

The big question I have now is, does this mean that GameStop would like to sell video games and media content as NFT‚Äôs, or, does this imply that GameStop could be posturing to set up their own market, as the reason for its notoriety is Reddit apes‚Äô claim that markets have been manipulated in abhorrent ways to bilk retail investors for too long, and thanks to u/DeepFuckingValue ‚Äòs due diligence, Reddit found a way to flip the script... big money helped itself, now, here we are, ... making memes about SEC Chairs getting their checks and balances ganked by the Fed...

I digress-

Could Loopring be an opportunity?

I don‚Äôt wanna say ‚Äútrust me bro‚Äù ... but I‚Äôll scream that I‚Äôm an ape, I eat red and green crayons and this is not financial advice.

personalfinance,Private Student Loan Debt Help,"Hi Reddit,

Currently I have about $130,000 dollars in private student loan debt, just in my name. It's a classic story of parents saying they'd be able to pay them but then realized they couldn't. That part isn't all that important.

My loans are serviced through Navient, and I'm currently unable to pay anything meaningful because of high interest rates (one is 11%). Navient has reduced the interest rate in the past but it seems like they're not willing to work with me on that anymore.

I've contacted a credit counselor and it seems like they have found an option that will allow me to be debt free in 5 years, but it would come at a cost of $1700 a month. This is almost attainable for me but not quite. Right now I think this is my #1 option.

I'm wondering if anyone has had any luck pursuing other options. Thanks in advance for any help you can provide.",finance

personalfinance,Would going through with this mortgage be a smart decision?,"Hey all. I signed on a nice condo downtown in my area that‚Äôs going for 111,900. With my down payment (7%) and my interest rate, the payments will be around $878 (this includes insurance, HOA dues, water and sanitary). I‚Äôm only left responsible for an electric bill. My car note currently is $260 a month, and I clear around 2100 a month ( currently investing 5% matched 401K plan through work). Doing a rough calculation, that puts my DTI at 54%. That‚Äôs the part that concerns me the most.


Is this really feasible, considering my situation?  Wouldn‚Äôt this lender not lend me the money if they thought I couldn‚Äôt afford it? My sister made less than I do now and was able to afford a mortgage ( her house was about 10K cheaper). I do have a few days to bounce out of this contract if need be. Thanks for any feedback!",finance
personalfinance,How aggressively to repay student loans and what professionals deal with this exactly?,"So the quick background, I finished law school back in May and went straight out on my own the next month and now run my own firm. In total I've got about 175K in student loans that are all Federal and vast majority are from law school over the last 3 years. All the business and finance media I've absorbed has me hating any debt over my head and student loans aside my only other debts add up to about 9K.

I've been trying to figure out how best to handle these as my payments start in March. My instinct is to just attack the loans as aggressively as I possibly can out the gate to minimize the interest I ultimately end up paying and be debt free asap. However, I've been trying to figure out if it makes sense to do an IBR plan like REPAYE or something since I'm self employed and if the more negative forecasts around inflation come to pass then it might be easier making massive payments towards it in 2028 vs 2022 (Plus my income as an attorney would be higher then vs now). The wall I hit with that route is interest capitalizing. 

I'd love any advice and to know if I'm looking at this like an idiot. And I'd love knowing what professional we can bring this stuff to and have the math/projections laid out for me.",finance
personalfinance,1.99% cash out refi - worth it?,"We're preparing to buy a second home sometime in 2022. We are considering doing a cash out refi to bolster our downpayment for this property. We intend to sell the current home (which the refinanced mortgage would be on) within a year or so. We found an offer with one bank for a 1.99% 3/1 ARM refinance. This would give us about $50k in cash which we would use either towards a downpayment or towards work on the future property, depending on the house we end up purchasing.

Current mortgage payment (no PMI) is 1183/month, 30 year fixed rate at 3.25%

Proposed mortgage payment (no PMI) is 1161/month, 30 year 3/1 adjustable rate at 1.99% 

Since we are going to be buying a second property, it seemed like a cash out refi might make more sense to keep out DTI low. We only have normal monthly credit card payments, a small student loan ($48/month), and the existing mortgage. We worry that if we do a HELOC or Home Equity Loan, and aren't sure exactly when we'll be selling our current property, we might get stuck with higher interest rates and a higher DTI.

Just wondering what this sub's thoughts are on this? I've been going back and forth on what to do. Looking for some insight from others. Thanks!",finance

He's gone through several advisors/managers over a long period of time, and he's thinking of just moving it all into index funds. 

I'm exclusively in index funds with Vanguard so I know a little bit, but I am not comfortable at all with helping him move and allocate a portfolio of that size. Do advisors or consultants exist who will help with asset allocation on a big portfolio with only index funds and other passive investment vehicles? Seems like all I am seeing are those who want to actively manage the portfolio. Thanks!",finance
CryptoCurrency,Ways to earn crypto,"In this post I will try to gather most of the existing ways to earn crypto, since it will get pretty long I will also post a **tldr in the comments**. A lot of you will probably know most of these stuff, but I hope I can show you something new here.

I will also categorize them by:

* *Free*
* *Minimal investment*
* *Greater return by larger investment*
* *Requires larger investment*

**Learn and earn** \- *Free*

* [**Coinbase**](https://www.coinbase.com/earn) \- *Various cryptocurrencys*:  
This is by far the easiest way to earn free crypto all you need to do is register a coinbase account and do KYC and you are good to go. You will need to complete short quizzes to earn and if you are lazy like I am you can find the answers here on the subreddit. Right now there are 7 cryptocurrencys avaliable(LRC, ACTION, FET, CLV, GRT, AMP, COMP) in my region amounting to 26.5$. There are also regularly new coins released for earn making it possible to earn more over time. You can than sell these to trade it for BTC/ETH or just keep it! It might be also a good idea to keep those coins if you take a look at this [post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/pg1xk1/coinbase_earn_see_what_3_will_get_you_gains_and/)
* [**Coinmarketcap**](https://coinmarketcap.com/earn/) \- *Various cryptocurrencys*:  
Very similar to Coinbase learn and earn with the difference that you are not guaranteed to gain coins. I personally haven't been able to gain anything from here yet and I also gave up about after the 20th try.
* [**Binance**](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/c-93?navId=93) \- *Various cryptocurrencys*:  
From time to time binance also has learn and earns like this one [here.](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/067fd8bb1fb84e99bfe2927f6bb72188) The top X users get rewarded with X amount of a X token. So be sure to check on the binance latest activity tab to not miss these.
* [**Phemex**](https://phemex.com/learn-crypto) \- *Usd*:  
You can earn 16$ on Phemex for completing its short quizzes. Haven't tried myself yet because it requires KYC as well.

**Blogs** \- *Free*

* [**Publish0x**](https://www.publish0x.com/) \- *AMPL and FARM*:  
By far my favourite and not just writers even readers can gain crypto here by tipping articles. Also this is a win win for everyone since you get educated about crypto while earning crypto. I have accuired as a reader 0.17$ so far.
* [**SteemIt**](https://steemit.com/) \- *STEEM*:  
Very similar to publish0x I personally haven't used it yet so can't really say too much about it.
* [**Leofinance**](https://leofinance.io/) \- *LEO and ETH*:  
Pretty much the same as the other two with some extra spice. LEO is based on the hive chain, they have their own DEX and they don't have transaction fees. It may become something in the future the project seems pretty promising.

**Crypto visa cards** \- *Minimal investment \~ Requires larger investment*:  
There are many alternatives out there but I will only mention the ones that offer the greatest cashback on your purchases.

* [**Coinbase card:**](https://www.coinbase.com/card)  
You can pay with USDC and earn 4% cashback in XML or 1% in BTC. No staking is required for the card. Sadly this is only available in the US.
* [**Crypto.com card:**](https://crypto.com/cards)  
Depending on how much CRO you stake your cashbacks may vary here. But even if you don't stake CRO you can get 1% cashback in CRO wich is pretty neat in my opinion. If you stake CRO your rewards can get up to 8% and you can get free spotify, netflix etc. Also cdc has a [partnership](https://blog.crypto.com/crypto-com-partners-with-booking-com-to-offer-exclusive-travel-discounts/) with booking.com and you can save up to 25% on your bookings.
* [**Binance card:**](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/c93fe535bcf4431aa32623ae0a49d4f2)  
This is also a great alternative but I don't see why anyone would use this instead of crypto.com card it just offers much greater benefits.

**Yield Farming** \- *Greater return by larger investment*  
Yield farming is providing liquidity to a set of coins and by doing so you earn a % rate on it. This is a very risky one though since you can easily lose due to [impermanent loss](https://blog.liquid.com/impermanent-loss) which can happen easily. Though you can avoid this problem by providing liquidity to stable coin pairs and you can earn a pretty neat % on your crypto. I personally recommend [pancakeswap](https://pancakeswap.finance/farms).

**Games** \- *Free*

* [**Crypto royale**](https://cryptoroyale.one/) \- *ROY*:  
This is my personal favourite. It is a combined rock,paper,scissors with agar.io. You earn ROY by winning games or taking part in tournaments(which happen daily). I have already accumulated 550 ROY in a few days. Also if you keep your ROY in your ingame wallet you get 93% apy.
* [**NanoQuake**](https://nanolooker.com/nanoquakejs/) \- *NANO*:  
If you like playing Quake hop on, get a nano wallet address get some kills and you are all set up. I played for like 45 minutes and got 0.003 Nano. There are sadly not always people online there.
* [**Nano CS:GO**](https://earn-nano.com/csgo) \- *NANO*:  
If you are a fan of CS:GO this is for you. The game mode is arms race and the winner can get at least 0.00125 Nano. To join the server follow these [steps.](https://earn-nano.com/csgo)
* [**Playerkillers.exchange**](https://Playerkillers.exchange) \- *NANO*:  
A fun way to kill time and earn some NANO. It is a 2d game where you run around the map and kill players or NPCs. You need to kill 3 players or 33 NPCs to be able to cashout.
* [**WeNano**](https://wenano.net/) \- *NANO*:  
If you live in a highly populated area this is for you. It is very similar to Pokemon GO you go to spots in real life and you get NANO for it. Haven't been able to try it since there are 0 spots near me.
* [**Coin Hunt World**](https://coinhunt.world/) \- *BTC and ETH*:  
Very similar to WeNano, but you have vaults and keys with different rarity and payout amount. If you live in the US, Canada, UK or Netherlands go check it out.
* **And many other blockchain games:**  
For example [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/) you can apply for a scholarship and earn SLP, [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) you can craft NFTs there and than sell it for MANA(which pumped big time in the past few days), [Illuvium](https://www.illuvium.io/) which has pretty dope graphics, [Gods unchained](https://godsunchained.com/) similar to Hearthstone, etc. Also many people beleive NFT gaming will be the future well it was always in my opinion. Its just that they were called skins instead of NFTs and werent involved in blockchain tech before.

**Brave** \- *Free*:  
You earn BAT for your attention and Ads. Even if it is a small fraction it adds up over time I personally have 22 BATs just on my desktop for using Brave for 7 months. Also Brave launched their gemini wallet not too long ago and you can earn a bonus 3.5% apy on your brave. Their Brave Talk also seems promising.

**Presearch** \- *Free*:  
If we are talking about Brave we have to talk about Presearch the two go pretty well with eachother. You gain PRE tokens for using their search engine. You can get up to 3 PRE a day with a minimum withdrawal limit of a 1000 PRE tokens, which I know is a lot just think of it as a yearly Chirstmas gift. Presearch also pops up as a default browser option on android devices here in Europe now.

**Running nodes** \- *Minimal investment \~ Greater return by larger investment*:  
You can also gain various cryptocurrencys by running a specific crypto node. You will be rewarded with the blockchains native token for running a node for them. I tried running [Theta Edge Node](https://community.theta.tv/theta-edge-node/) and earned some tfuel by folding at home. I also bought a Raspberry Pi 4 and will plan to run a MYST and PRE node potentially. [Modo tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRgl9Ry2xNw) has great videos about this if someone wants to try it out.

**Theta.tv** \- *Free*:  
Twitch and crypto met and had a child thats theta in short. It is very immature and needs improvements but it is a great way for streamers to earn some crypto. Viewers are also able to earn crypto by betting coins(which you earn for watching) on predictions(very similar to twitch again) and if you are correct you have a chance to win crates. Crates can be opened for various rewards which can contain tfuel or theta.

**Getting onto new exchanges** \- *Minimal investment*:  
If you sign up for a new exhange, do KYC and deposit a 100$ you will most likely get at least 10$ in BTC or some other crypto. The ones worthy to mention here are Binance, Coinbase, Crypto.com, Gemini and I will mention a less known one Okcoin where you can get 50$ bonus in BTC. I haven't done it yet since the BTC will be locked for 180days and if I do it in the bear market I might get higher returns from that 50$ btc.

**Referral programs** \- *Free:*  
Getting onto new exchanges goes hand to hand with referral programs. For refering a friend you can gain some crypto on most Centralized Exchanges. Also some faucets have referral programs as well.

[**Lolli**](https://www.lolli.com/) \- *Free*:  
You can earn a fixed %(depends on the brand) back on your purchases in BTC. E.g. you can earn 6% back on booking with lolli. All you need to do is add the Lolli extension to you browser. The only downside is that it is only avaliable in the US.

[**Pei**](https://about.getpei.com/) \- *Free*:  
Very similar to Lolli haven't tried it myself yet though. They have partnership with Walmart, Starbucks, etc.

**Mining** \- *Greater return by larger investment*:

* **Proof of work** \- *Various cryptocurrencys*:  
You can use your GPU/CPU to mine a given crypto. If you are really dedicated you can even build your own mining rig. I personally used to mine ETH for about 2 months not constantly since I used my gaming PC for this purpose. I used the [ethermine](https://ethermine.org/) mining pool with T-rex. Though since 2Miners allow NANO withdrawals it might be a better alternative right now.
* **Proof of stake** \- *ADA, ETH 2.0, ALGO, etc.*:  
You can join a staking pool even on your exchange if you want to and start staking. You can earn on average 5-10% in staking rewards. I personally staked ADA for a while. Might stake ETH as well once 2.0 comes out.
* **Proof of space** \- *FIL, XCH*:  
You can earn crypto for unused storage space with this consensus mechanism. I personally have no experience with this one.
* **Proof of coverage** \- *HNT*:  
This is a really cool concept by far the coolest in my opinion. People set up something similar to routers and for their coverage they earn E.g. HNT. The Helium network plans to also build 5g coverage with their devices. I am still thinking if should I get myself a [Hotspot miner.](https://www.helium.com/mine)

**Faucets** \- *Free*:  
There are plenty of faucets out there where you can earn crypto dust. I will list my favourites here: [Nano faucets](https://nanolooker.com/faucets), [Doge faucet](https://www.dogefaucet.com/en/what-now/DESr25GcRhznoFitKy3bvnBTzqTxALpd1C), [Cointipl](https://cointiply.com/)y, [Solana faucet](https://solfaucet.togatech.org/) and of course [Moons faucet](https://www.moonfaucet.cc/). There is also a timer currently in works for the moons faucet which is really cool. Remember to claim these especially the moons faucet since we are getting a lot of moons mainnet hopium.

**Reddit** \- *Free*:  
Community tokens are also avaliable not only available on the **cryptocurrency** subreddit but also in the **ethtrader** and **fortniteBR** subreddits you can earn DONUTS and BRICKS there. Also in the future I can't wait to collect community tokens on other subreddits. E.g. something on the Hearthstone subreddit. ~~Dust incoming?~~Edit: Soon you will be also able to earn community tokens on the **hiphopheads** subreddit.

**Airdrops** \- *Free*:  
You can sign up for various airdrops on [Coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/airdrop/) or [Airdrops.io](https://airdrops.io/). I personally haven't been able to win on any of these.

**NFTs** \- *Free*:  
If you are an artist you can create your own NFTs and sell it on a marketplace. For example [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/), [Mintable](https://mintable.app/), [NFTb](https://nftb.io/), etc. You can also earn diamonds on [Coinmarketcap](https://coinmarketcap.com/account/rewards/) and turn them in for various NFTs and than if you want to you can sell it later on. I was almost able to collect the NFTb Fright Night there I was just about 200 diamonds short.

**Lending and earning interest** \- *Greater return by larger investment*

* [**Celsius:**](https://celsius.network/)  
What Celsius does is it takes your deposited crypto and lends it to institutions and by that you are able to earn interest on your crypto up to 17% apy. You can also earn 50$ btc bonus if you deposit 400$ to Celsius.
* [**Blockfi:**](https://blockfi.com/)  
Pretty much the same as Celsius but with lower interest rates. They also have their own crypto visa card.
* **Many other Defi platforms:**  
There are also many Defi platforms that offer interest as well e.g. [AAVE](https://aave.com/) and [COMPOUND.](https://compound.finance/markets) AAVE offers almost 17% on USDC for example which is pretty competent.

[**Audius**](https://audius.co/) \- *Free*:  
This one is for music creators, they can earn AUDIO there. I don't know how it exactly works since I'm not a musician. They also have a partnership with TikTok. I listened to some music there and [3LAU](https://audius.co/3lau) has some pretty dope music.

**Honorable mentions**

* [**Kinfit**](https://www.mykinfit.com/) \- *KIN*:  
You can earn KIN for the amount of footsteps you made a day. It is a pretty cool idea but it kinda died down.
* [**Sator**](https://www.sator.io/) \- *SAO*:  
You can earn SAO for engaging with content I don't know how it exactly works but it seems like a good project.

**P.S.:**  
Damn writing all that down took way more time than I expected, but still I hope you guys will like it, if I missed something please do let me know. I also didn't use any referral links since to my knowledge they are forbidden on the subreddit if you want one you can easily google for one yourself. I tried to keep things short since the list is pretty long and I might have even missed a few. It was also good to put my markdown knowledge from school to the test.

Edit:  
Thanks for the great feedback from you all. I will add the things that I missed.I added Hiphopheads as a subreddit where you can earn community tokens.I added refferal programs which is a part of getting onto new exchanges.I added [playerkillers.exchange](http://playerkillers.exchange/) which I forgot to add to games even though I wanted to.I also added [Audius](https://audius.co/) for music creators which I also forgot to mention.Removed Algo faucet since it stopped operating as of today. I added a [Solana faucet](https://solfaucet.togatech.org/) instead which I found while trying to search for another Algo faucet. Sadly I couldn't find another Algo faucet.",cryptocurrency

CryptoCurrency,My toast for bitcoin at Satoshis birthday party. Bitcoin and fractional reserve lending.,"Bitcoin is so cool, it could stop the ills of banking for good.   Since this is bitcoins birthday today, I think we should all consider ways to protect this digital gift from Satoshi.  So bere is one way I see traditional banking doing the rope-a-dope with bifcoin.

I've been reading ""the creature from Jekyll island"" and learning about central banking and their tools of operation.   One of a central banks tools is called fractional reserve lending.   This practice was ""discovered"" by blacksmiths back in the day whom people trusted to keep their jewelry safe.... but for a price.  But making money on holding valueables wasnt enough.  Blacksmiths, with their heavy vaults, soon found out they could use the stored jewelry as collateral for more money.  They just had to make sure not everyone wanted their jewlery back at the same time.... this ""tool"" is essentially fractional-reserve lending.   Just swap jewlery for gold reserves and you are ankle deep in how the federal reserve operates.  

So I was thinking about how banks could do this with  bitcoin... because, if you don't know yet, bitcoin is legit.  With the open ledger, it would be easy yo monitor fractional reserves of bitcoin.  This doesn't mean it can't happen though.  How would they do it?   In my mind, there are 4 ways banks could break bitcoin my fractional reserve lending.  

1) this could be done through a bank made DEFI platform-IF some smart-contracts through defi (now or in the future) could exploit bitcoin In fractional reserve lending.  

 2) If banks start acquiring bitcoin and have their own wallet.  So the recent news about Mastercard and banks is something veteran cryptoheads need to monitor.   Expect complex vernacular for ""who owns the bitcoin"" in legislation, contracts, and terms and conditions.  

3) if banks offer to hold your bitcoin like a medieval blacksmith because WaLlEtS are ToO CoMpLiCaTeD... WE'lL KeeP Ur CryPTo Safe.  They could easily cook the books with bitcoin.  

4) if banks take your private keys.  This is the most difficult way for the banks right now.... but what about in 50-60 years when we start aging and dieing...  What will happen to our private keys?  What about the microstrategy bitcoin vault?  Is Michael Saylor the only person that knows the private keys for Microstrategy?  Could the banks offer enough to someone to make them compromise any private keys?  

I don't know.... just some thoughts.",cryptocurrency
Bitcoin,Just Re-listened to the September Fed Meeting On Economy and Interest Rates... Here Are My Thoughts Ahead of The November 3rd Upcoming Meeting,"I was worried about the market reaction to the Fed tapering schedule which will be announced on November 3rd at 2pm, so I decided to re-listen to Powell's September speech. The tapering is estimated to start in mid-November or December which is largely expected by the market; however, Fed commentary around interest rate and inflation will be critical to determining if the bull market persists.

In regards to the September US non-farm payroll released after the last Fed meeting, ""Nonfarm payrolls increased by 194,000 in September, compared with the Dow Jones estimate for 500,000"", so this will make the Fed more dovish (i.e. more inflation, low interest, more accommodative) for this up-coming November meeting. Likewise, US GDP was lower than the Fed would like to see, further contributing to their likely dovishness.

The Fed is also getting pressure from politicians such as Warren who called Powell a ""dangerous man"" inferring that if he becomes Hawkish too soon, it will result negatively for a fragile recovering COVID economy. I don't think he cares what Warren thinks very much \[like most people\], but I do think it inadvertently pressures him to be more dovish.

For these reasons, in regards to interest rate increases at this up-coming Nov 3 meeting, Powell will AVOID providing any commentary relating to timing of rate increases occurring in 2022. Some Wall St banks are expecting 2 interest rate increases in 2022 due to inflation. However, I heard nothing from Powell's September speech to suggest he will raise once or twice in 2022. He said the hurdle for raising interest rates is significantly higher than the hurdle to start tapering. He did mention that all but one of the Fed officials expects interest rate increases starting in 2023; however, for 2022 Powell said interest rates can increase only after tapering completes (mid-2022) because it's senseless to raise interest rates while bond purchases are occurring. And he said the Fed is going to continue to monitor the economy before providing guidance on such rate increases.

In regards to actual inflation, the fed is unlikely to acknowledge its true extent in the midst of a COVID economy. Powell is being very careful with how he discusses inflation and interest rate increases. His commentary will focus on how inflation is manageable, related to supply chain shortages, and how it will be lower in the out years like 2023 once the economy is on firmer ground.

In regards to crypto, I think there is potential for a bumpy Monday / Tuesday (I'm scared every time the Fed speaks) but I see Bitcoin staying above $59K. Institutions understand the bull market too much to allow Bitcoin to fall any further than $59K, and if it falls to this level it will quickly be purchased. After this meeting on Wednesday, I believe Crypto is free to increase until November 22nd forming new ATHs, after which volatility from November 29 options expiry will start to set in and potentially cause a minor pull back from these new ATHs.",cryptocurrency
